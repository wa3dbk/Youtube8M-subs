milk which we brought to a boil we're
going<00:04:11.109> to<00:04:11.260> pour<00:04:11.469> that<00:04:11.620> in<00:04:11.859> and<00:04:12.129> it's<00:04:12.700> going<00:04:12.849> to

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
going to pour that in and it's going to

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.569 
going to pour that in and it's going to
curdle<00:04:13.299> almost<00:04:13.840> instantly<00:04:14.439> so<00:04:14.739> now<00:04:15.459> you're

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
curdle almost instantly so now you're

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.759 
curdle almost instantly so now you're
thinking<00:04:15.969> why<00:04:16.209> do<00:04:16.269> I<00:04:16.449> want<00:04:16.720> curdled<00:04:17.199> milk<00:04:17.410> in

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769

thinking why do I want curdled milk in
plain<00:04:18.099> milk<00:04:18.340> punch<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:19.329> reason<00:04:19.690> why<00:04:19.840> is

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
plain milk punch the reason why is

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.860 
plain milk punch the reason why is
because<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.560> milk<00:04:20.889> is<00:04:21.190> going<00:04:21.579> to<00:04:21.729> act<00:04:22.360> almost

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
because the milk is going to act almost

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.129 
because the milk is going to act almost
as<00:04:23.289> a<00:04:23.320> filtering<00:04:24.280> agent<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:25.810> going<00:04:26.080> to

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
as a filtering agent it's going to

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.490 
as a filtering agent it's going to
filter<00:04:26.710> this<00:04:27.250> punch<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:28.990> juice<00:04:29.169> is<00:04:29.349> going

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
filter this punch and the juice is going

filter this punch and the juice is going
to<00:04:29.590> come<00:04:29.740> out<00:04:29.919> clear<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:31.210> reason<00:04:31.479> why<00:04:31.930> we<00:04:32.139> want

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
to come out clear the reason why we want

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.830 
to come out clear the reason why we want
to<00:04:32.380> use<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:33.070> because<00:04:33.669> it<00:04:34.419> adds<00:04:34.630> an

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
to use it is because it adds an

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.860 
to use it is because it adds an
