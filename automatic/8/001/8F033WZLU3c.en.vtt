Hi guys! Today I'm here to review another top-end glove from Puma

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.820
The evoPOWER Grip 1

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.320
Which is used by world class goalkeepers such as Buffon and Weidenfeller

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.320
But are these gloves worthy of this goalkeepers?

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.000
Join me and find it out!

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.600
Let's start with the fit, which is great

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.760
In fact the wristband is enough wide and flexible

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.020
and has a twist, so the hand is really comfortable on the glove

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.640
The palm is made of a flat cut and the fingers are just a bit shaped

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.840
The latex used is the 4mm Ultimate Grip

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.540
That ensures a great grip, especially on dry conditions

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.780
Also we find these orange flex channels, but I don't think they make such a difference

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.880
Also, the glove features a thin wrap thumb which maximises latex to ball contact

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.720
The backhand is embossed and it is made up of two panels of latex

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.380
As for the colorway we have this bright orange which I think is the right colorway for this glove

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.120
In the package we can find also a wristband, the Wrap Tech

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.680
That helps to strenghten the wrist and can replace the classical tapings

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.700
How to use it?

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.100
Put the thumb on the hole and the tape the wristband around your wrist

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.000
What should I say?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.160
I think they're great

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.900
They have a optimal grip, they're comfortable and solid enough

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.760
and the design is immensely beautiful

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.280
But what do you think about these gloves?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.880
