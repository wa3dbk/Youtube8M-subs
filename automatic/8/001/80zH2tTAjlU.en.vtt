same down here and then that's a big tip

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.280 
same down here and then that's a big tip
right<00:01:16.280> here<00:01:16.610> when<00:01:17.390> I<00:01:17.479> was<00:01:17.570> throwing<00:01:17.869> my<00:01:18.020> board

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
right here when I was throwing my board

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.700 
right here when I was throwing my board
over<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.590> fence<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:19.850> landed<00:01:20.270> like<00:01:20.329> on<00:01:20.750> the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
over a fence it landed like on the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.859 
over a fence it landed like on the
ground<00:01:21.950> like<00:01:22.040> this<00:01:22.369> so<00:01:22.909> I<00:01:22.970> don't<00:01:23.000> get<00:01:23.479> how<00:01:23.720> it

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
ground like this so I don't get how it

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.069 
ground like this so I don't get how it
chipped<00:01:24.490> it's<00:01:25.490> really<00:01:25.640> weird<00:01:25.909> was<00:01:26.810> probably

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
chipped it's really weird was probably

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.959 
chipped it's really weird was probably
weak<00:01:27.320> from<00:01:27.619> hitting<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.100> fence<00:01:28.280> at<00:01:28.700> this

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
weak from hitting the fence at this

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.340 
weak from hitting the fence at this
hurts<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:29.540> much<00:01:29.689> but<00:01:31.659> overall<00:01:32.659> I<00:01:32.719> really<00:01:32.899> like

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
hurts so much but overall I really like

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.470 
hurts so much but overall I really like
this<00:01:33.560> forward<00:01:34.070> is<00:01:34.490> really<00:01:34.820> strong

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.390 

probably<00:01:38.290> one<00:01:38.380> of<00:01:38.410> my<00:01:38.500> favorite<00:01:38.980> boards<00:01:39.280> I've

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
probably one of my favorite boards I've

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.930 
probably one of my favorite boards I've
had<00:01:39.670> so<00:01:40.240> far<00:01:40.270> that<00:01:41.170> have<00:01:41.590> like<00:01:42.630> probably<00:01:44.940> maybe

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
had so far that have like probably maybe

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.180 
had so far that have like probably maybe
like<00:01:46.180> 13<00:01:46.690> different<00:01:46.980> brands<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.930> this<00:01:50.860> board

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
kind of razor tail but does have a point

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
detail and a little bit more rounded

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.040 
detail and a little bit more rounded
