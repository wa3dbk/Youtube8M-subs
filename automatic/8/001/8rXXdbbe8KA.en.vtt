DWC<00:00:45.570> seems<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.590> working<00:00:46.860> pretty<00:00:47.010> well<00:00:47.149> now

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
DWC seems to be working pretty well now

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
DWC seems to be working pretty well now
the<00:00:48.210> only<00:00:48.390> thing<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.800> hotter<00:00:50.039> than

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the only thing is is it's hotter than

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.709 
the only thing is is it's hotter than
fire<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.059> Florida<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.539> I've<00:00:51.600> been

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
fire out here in Florida so I've been

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.299 
fire out here in Florida so I've been
worried<00:00:51.870> about<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> reservoir<00:00:52.530> temps<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.129> so

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
worried about the reservoir temps but so

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.569 
worried about the reservoir temps but so
far<00:00:53.870> it<00:00:54.870> hasn't<00:00:54.899> seemed<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> problem<00:00:56.160> I

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
far it hasn't seemed to be a problem I

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.189 
far it hasn't seemed to be a problem I
just<00:00:56.910> got<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> check<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> buckets<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.079> make

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
just got to check the buckets to make

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.290 
just got to check the buckets to make
sure<00:00:58.379> they<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> slam<00:00:59.609> as<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> cantaloupe

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
sure they have a slam as the cantaloupe

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.990 
sure they have a slam as the cantaloupe
there<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> checked<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.910> there<00:01:02.910> was

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
there that I checked it and there was

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.660 
there that I checked it and there was
hardly<00:01:03.210> anything<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> bottom<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.580> just<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
you notice this was my aquaponics table

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.999 
you notice this was my aquaponics table
here<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.170> Dutch<00:01:34.320> buggers<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:34.770> they've<00:01:34.890> all

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
here with Dutch buggers but they've all

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.950 
here with Dutch buggers but they've all
been<00:01:35.189> converted<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> hydro<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.540> now<00:01:36.689> I

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
been converted to the hydro for now I

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.749 
been converted to the hydro for now I
think<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.740> my<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.009> had<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> problem<00:01:38.610> with

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
just too many plants for the nutrients

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.460 
just too many plants for the nutrients
but<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> strawberries<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.140> stuff<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.380> you

looked in my older videos over the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.270 
looked in my older videos over the
aquaponics<00:01:46.259> video<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.649> were<00:01:46.710> nice<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
aquaponics video they were nice and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.700
