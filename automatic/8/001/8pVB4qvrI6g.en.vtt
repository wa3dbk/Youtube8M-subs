00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello to all his friends welcome to my 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.790
 chain today we find ourselves for 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.980
 a tutorial it was a long time 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.690
 so this is the famous smoky strand that you 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.380
 wanted me to do with you 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.420
 L'oreal products 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.319
 so here I hope it's okay 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.899
 so please immediately I start 

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:23.909
 with my mischievous pro palette at home 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:26.369
 lörrach jacqueline with a clear face 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:29.970
 eyebrow it is slightly elysées and I 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.579
 leave your tone then I apply a strand 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.859
 very clear about the sting of my 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.109
 eye with a brush a little bit pointed 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.359
 and I go back and forth to 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.890
 really have a fade effect I'm going 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.510
 even add a little more for 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.589
 that the color is more intense and 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.589
 outward management 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.460
 after I take my famous product at 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.770
 l'oréal and I'm going to apply it on my 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.720
 mobile eyelid really everywhere 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.450
 do not hesitate to put some material 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.120
 it's a texture a bit I'm not going 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.910
 to say thanks is a bit special it's not 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.100
 cream either I do not know too much and I 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.240
 do not hesitate to add color to 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.010
 really give that effect a little 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.869
 metallic is super pretty in this 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.670
 produced there and then I'm going to melt them 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.170
 products with a blender brush so 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.540
 do not really hesitate to make 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.820
 going back and forth insisted a little press on 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.979
 your brush to really melt 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.390
 the end because it's actually a 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.060
 texture a bit oily so its mark 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.399
 much more than a normal lighthouse so 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.790
 here and to have a nice gradient he 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.790
 must insult 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:49.250
 there were cases tomorrow and then I 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.040
 take back my lighthouse will I clear from my 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.500
 palette the rac mega pro and I'm going to the 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.270
 melt with montbrun I would have insisted 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.520
 do all this to make it really 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.140
 very intense that also spend a little 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.050
 little clear but without relying on 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.520
 a brush how many do not both 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.170
 colors between them one be it a 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.300
 nice gradient is the most important 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.940
 in your makeup then I follow 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.540
 by applying my product to run out eyelashes 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.030
 lower 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.650
 so the most crudely really at the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.950
 missile plant I also join him 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.560
 in the outer corner and I'm going downgraded 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.300
 the collapse produced with the brush 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.310
 with which I had applied montbrun 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.620
 the product palette rac without adding 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.090
 of products 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.100
 this attention also not to exceed 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.200
 this line to avoid having a 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.360
 falling look and feel free to 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.640
 use your paintbrush to correct the 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.410
 small mistakes in Switzerland continues in 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.640
 applying this great product from 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.590
 marc jacobs 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.680
 I discovered not long ago it's 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.970
 a cream blush actually in the shape of a pen 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.890

 my look 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.530
 because it's a creamy texture and 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.020
