00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
half and I kind of like that idea was

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.479 
half and I kind of like that idea was
kind<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.239> fizzled<00:03:21.750> out<00:03:22.010> great<00:03:23.010> American<00:03:23.370> write

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
kind of fizzled out great American write

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.440 
kind of fizzled out great American write
bomb<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:24.060> actually<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.680> next<00:03:25.950> I'll<00:03:26.299> leave<00:03:27.299> it

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
bomb is actually the next I'll leave it

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.709 
bomb is actually the next I'll leave it
up<00:03:27.599> it's<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.930> next<00:03:28.290> out<00:03:28.469> laughs<00:03:28.709> it's<00:03:28.919> out

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:32.719 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.629 

again<00:03:33.719> I<00:03:33.750> think<00:03:33.840> like<00:03:34.109> doing<00:03:34.500> lasers<00:03:34.980> it's<00:03:35.489> a

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
again I think like doing lasers it's a

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.100 
again I think like doing lasers it's a
we<00:03:35.879> were<00:03:35.969> doing<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.329> for<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.659> long

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.040 

to<00:03:41.100> gear<00:03:41.430> that's<00:03:41.730> really<00:03:41.970> come<00:03:42.360> over<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.780> three

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
to gear that's really come over to three

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.640 
to gear that's really come over to three
different<00:03:44.840> lasers<00:03:45.840> inside<00:03:46.140> of<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.410> stuff

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
different lasers inside of that stuff

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.590 
different lasers inside of that stuff
this<00:03:46.890> has<00:03:47.130> been<00:03:47.340> love<00:03:47.490> always<00:03:47.730> shined<00:03:48.090> retired

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
this has been love always shined retired

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.430 
this has been love always shined retired
numbers<00:03:49.470> file

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.470 

so<00:03:53.040> there's<00:03:53.220> not<00:03:53.340> going<00:03:53.490> to<00:03:53.580> be<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:53.700> huge<00:03:54.120> gap

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
so there's not going to be a huge gap

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.630 
so there's not going to be a huge gap
between<00:03:54.510> this<00:03:55.470> album<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.190> next<00:03:56.460> album

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
between this album and the next album

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.940 
between this album and the next album

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
like last time right only it's this

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.860 
like last time right only it's this
algorithm<00:03:59.490> massive<00:04:01.220> massive<00:04:02.220> successes<00:04:03.180> for

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
algorithm massive massive successes for

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.130 
algorithm massive massive successes for
the<00:04:04.230> longest<00:04:04.620> time<00:04:04.770> everybody<00:04:05.490> was<00:04:06.140> saying
