control<00:01:41.570> on<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.869> wheel<00:01:53.770> so<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:54.830> do<00:01:55.039> have

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
control on the wheel so you do have

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.460 
control on the wheel so you do have
weight<00:01:55.550> in<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.789> back<00:01:55.940> end<00:01:56.270> with<00:01:56.450> that<00:01:56.630> ramp

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
system so it is quite a bit different to

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.630 
system so it is quite a bit different to
handle

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.440 

but<00:02:08.220> with<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.340> three<00:02:09.520> points<00:02:09.850> lead<00:02:10.090> three

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.740 
but with the three points lead three
litre<00:02:10.630> v6<00:02:10.929> in<00:02:11.440> here<00:02:11.709> it's<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.180> no<00:02:13.180> problem<00:02:13.480> for

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
litre v6 in here it's a no problem for

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:24.589 
litre v6 in here it's a no problem for
this<00:02:13.870> van<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.290> handle

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.989 

so<00:02:25.109> this<00:02:25.290> would<00:02:25.439> be<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.590> great<00:02:26.040> mobility<00:02:26.489> tool

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:26.999 
so this would be a great mobility tool
