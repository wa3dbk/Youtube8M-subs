 high level but it should be noted the 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.199
 yet the effort made 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.260
 indicators and bng have progressed are 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:09.350
 very low and that means that the 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.990
 experience that has been accumulating 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.200
