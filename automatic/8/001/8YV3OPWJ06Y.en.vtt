00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.749
 often far away 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.110
 this was first in 1756 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.650
 from the Swedish hobby mineralogist why Axel Friedrich KohlstÃ¤dt discovers 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.210
 some people think that in such times lava fields 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.170
 Zeolite it is something very special you can not imagine like a sponge 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.250
 in the computer animation we recognize the molecular structure which for 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.770
 a very special grotto bending defect is responsible 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.080
 with the zeolite the testers are not funny humorous witty little ones 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.540
 Cavities that are sometimes connected 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.880
 in this tiny amount of zeolite 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.360
 in my hand, so to speak, is the channel system 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.960
 and now for the experiment I want to be here 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.920
 Sicilia 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.120
 so there are now so to speak but millions of kilometers in this vessel what 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.820
 happens when I swallow a pie now 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.130
 top-fermented beer to tip 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.630
 Greulich man 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.880
 Part of the piglet Fillon 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.170
 the bad image for one 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.240
 and you can then see if the temperature changes 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.310
 I think the zeolite is already very thirsty Silvia times 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.460
 I'll get it 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.510
 the beer is still there but Bill the brewery Verdes so wrong 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.510
 Google offered the stones are blue 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.910
 I do not sing a dance I also have a table Una color change is already 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.050
 not to list on board too she is wrong 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.670
 So only the view of the thermometer remains 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.520
 except Honda 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.590
 Ardian look like she likes 60 degrees 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.830
 Wilfried Ebel 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.320
 the argument continues 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.089
 in shipping 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:10.419
 General you can 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.719
 liquids 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.479
 how does it work 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.819
 After pouring over the liquid will lightning fast in the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.579
 sucked in gigantic canal system 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.829
 the kinetic energy that is generated changes into heat energy 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.759
 Everybody knows each other at top speed through one 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.099
 Completing Rogge's head happy was also pretty hot ears 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.909
 the zeolite can even heat up to 250 degrees 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.709
 This special use Bach zeolites various industry application 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.839
 attractive for example by cooling beer kegs 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.769
 Diack which look like a fridge, look 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.609
 the barrel has several layers 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.609
 outside zeolite in the middle of a vacuum 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.269
 and you this area here is full of water 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.059
 what happens when we open this valve to show him 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.109
 now on this glass bulb model 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.949
 co-lead is here 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.419
 there is water in there and in the middle there is a valve 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.369
 if I have this Hefner now 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:14.639
 Room on 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.639
 then the water will suddenly close 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.689
 like water 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.759
 the attacks on 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.049
 that Villarreal 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.869
 he can do the steam 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:32.159
 during the World Cup evaporative cold the water freezes to ice 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.959
 And so you can already in the future, the run on domestic hot water 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:35.499
 heater 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.839
 with integrated fridge look forward to friend repentant man
