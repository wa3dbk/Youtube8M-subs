00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
hello and welcome to my tutorial on

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.630 
hello and welcome to my tutorial on
using<00:00:03.959> image<00:00:04.440> alpha<00:00:04.830> channels<00:00:05.250> in<00:00:05.490> the

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
using image alpha channels in the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.320 
using image alpha channels in the
blender<00:00:05.850> edit<00:00:06.270> window<00:00:07.490> today<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:08.730> thought<00:00:09.150> I'd

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
blender edit window today I thought I'd

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.259 
blender edit window today I thought I'd
start<00:00:09.690> off<00:00:09.870> with<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.260> end<00:00:10.590> result<00:00:11.210> show<00:00:12.210> you

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
start off with the end result show you

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.410 
start off with the end result show you
what<00:00:12.480> we're<00:00:12.599> going<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.780> be<00:00:12.840> doing<00:00:13.670> this<00:00:14.670> I'm

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
what we're going to be doing this I'm

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.660 
what we're going to be doing this I'm
making<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.870> tutorial<00:00:16.379> mostly<00:00:16.890> because<00:00:17.039> I

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
making this tutorial mostly because I

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.560 
making this tutorial mostly because I
forget<00:00:18.449> how<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> do<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.050> sometimes<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:20.570> I'm

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
forget how to do this sometimes and I'm

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.529 
forget how to do this sometimes and I'm
pretty<00:00:21.810> sure<00:00:21.930> most<00:00:22.289> people<00:00:22.740> new<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.949> blender

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
pretty sure most people new to blender

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.509 
pretty sure most people new to blender
start<00:00:24.539> up<00:00:24.630> not<00:00:24.840> knowing<00:00:25.050> how<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.380> do<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.490> I

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
start up not knowing how to do this so I

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.689 
start up not knowing how to do this so I
thought<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.119> know<00:00:27.240> might<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:27.990> useful<00:00:28.699> before

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
thought you know might be useful before

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.640 
thought you know might be useful before
we<00:00:29.820> get<00:00:29.939> started<00:00:30.150> however<00:00:30.840> I'd<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.470> show

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
we get started however I'd like to show

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.900 
we get started however I'd like to show
you<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.920> image<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.340> got<00:00:32.520> off<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.700> internet

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.940 

this<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.210> an<00:00:36.390> early<00:00:36.660> image<00:00:37.140> from<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.680> game

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
this is an early image from the game

fable<00:00:38.520> 2<00:00:38.730> by<00:00:39.210> lionhead<00:00:39.809> studios<00:00:39.840> if<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:42.510> look

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
fable 2 by lionhead studios if you look

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.020 
fable 2 by lionhead studios if you look
at<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.840> grass<00:00:43.200> below<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.190> pole<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> fence

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
at the grass below the pole of the fence

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.180 
at the grass below the pole of the fence
you'll<00:00:45.989> notice<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.410> there's<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> flat

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
you'll notice that there's a flat

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.790 
you'll notice that there's a flat
surface<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.390> grass<00:00:48.660> texture<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
surface with a grass texture on it and

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.340 
surface with a grass texture on it and
then<00:00:50.370> you'll<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:50.789> grass<00:00:51.149> sticking<00:00:51.960> up<00:00:52.110> off

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
then you'll see grass sticking up off

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.470 
then you'll see grass sticking up off
that<00:00:52.820> surface<00:00:53.820> if<00:00:54.980> you<00:00:55.980> look<00:00:56.160> closer<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:57.270> can

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that surface if you look closer you can

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.810 
that surface if you look closer you can
tell<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.050> there<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:58.859> about<00:00:59.340> one<00:00:59.670> or<00:00:59.789> two

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
tell that there are about one or two

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.540 
tell that there are about one or two
polygons<00:01:00.719> with<00:01:01.140> grass<00:01:01.410> textures<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.340> them

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
polygons with grass textures on them

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.789 
polygons with grass textures on them
that<00:01:03.270> are<00:01:03.420> being<00:01:03.570> used<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:04.019> create<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.559> tall

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that are being used to create the tall

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.000 
that are being used to create the tall
grass<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.760> sticking<00:01:06.270> up<00:01:06.799> this<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.979> a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
grass that is sticking up this is a

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.950 
grass that is sticking up this is a
common<00:01:08.549> technique<00:01:08.729> used<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.420> many<00:01:09.659> different

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
common technique used in many different

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.280 
common technique used in many different
games<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:11.000> I'm<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> teach<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.720> exactly

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
games and I'm going to teach you exactly

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.160 
games and I'm going to teach you exactly
how<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.360> because<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> like

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
how to do it because if you do it like

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.100 
how to do it because if you do it like
this<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.460> create<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.909> realistic<00:01:18.630> grass

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
this you can create a realistic grass

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.780 
this you can create a realistic grass
field<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:20.100> only<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.369> couple<00:01:20.430> hundred

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
field with only a couple hundred

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.670 
field with only a couple hundred
polygons<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:24.540> now<00:01:24.780> we're<00:01:24.930> back<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.140> blender

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
polygons so now we're back in blender

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.789 
polygons so now we're back in blender
and<00:01:26.570> I've<00:01:27.570> started<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:30.020> these<00:01:31.020> two<00:01:31.259> planes

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
and I've started with a these two planes

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.539 
and I've started with a these two planes
that<00:01:32.189> I'm<00:01:32.909> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.299> texture<00:01:34.340> make<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.460> look

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
that I'm going to texture make it look

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.410 
that I'm going to texture make it look
like<00:01:35.729> grass<00:01:36.270> particle<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.170> games<00:01:37.470> and

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
like grass particle you see in games and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.649 
like grass particle you see in games and
to<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.720> first<00:01:41.360> importantly<00:01:42.360> make<00:01:42.630> sure

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
to do that first importantly make sure

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.520 
to do that first importantly make sure
the<00:01:43.350> shading<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.189> GL<00:01:44.520> SL<00:01:45.119> because<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.350> some

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the shading is on GL SL because for some

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.960 
the shading is on GL SL because for some
reason<00:01:46.560> that's<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> only<00:01:47.280> shading<00:01:47.610> mode<00:01:47.729> that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
reason that's the only shading mode that

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.859 
reason that's the only shading mode that
blender<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.750> display<00:01:49.140> textures<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:50.869> make

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
blender can display textures in make

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.069 
blender can display textures in make
sure<00:01:52.049> draw<00:01:52.290> type<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.740> textured<00:01:53.720> all<00:01:54.720> right<00:01:54.960> we

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
sure draw type is textured all right we

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.249 
sure draw type is textured all right we
got<00:01:55.229> everything<00:01:55.939> I'll<00:01:56.939> lit<00:01:57.329> everything's

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
got everything I'll lit everything's

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.609 
got everything I'll lit everything's
ready<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.939> make<00:02:00.149> sure<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> material

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
ready you make sure we have a material

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:10.630 
ready you make sure we have a material
and<00:02:02.420> now<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.479> import<00:02:04.969> our<00:02:05.969> texture<00:02:06.500> go<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.560> open

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.699 

remember<00:02:11.630> these<00:02:12.100> yeah<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:13.580> anyway<00:02:14.000> here's<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
remember these yeah so anyway here's the

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.910 
remember these yeah so anyway here's the
grass<00:02:15.709> texture<00:02:16.160> that<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.430> intend<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.970> use<00:02:17.920> open

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
grass texture that I intend to use open

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.020 
grass texture that I intend to use open
it<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:23.140> see<00:02:24.140> can't<00:02:24.950> see<00:02:25.130> anything<00:02:25.340> yet<00:02:25.700> but

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
it and see can't see anything yet but

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.250 
it and see can't see anything yet but
that's<00:02:26.209> because<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.600> lighting<00:02:26.840> will<00:02:27.050> fix

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
that's because the lighting will fix

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.610 
that's because the lighting will fix
that<00:02:27.440> later<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:29.660> first<00:02:29.900> thing<00:02:30.080> we<00:02:30.200> want<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.440> do

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
that later the first thing we want to do

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.250 
that later the first thing we want to do
is<00:02:30.860> open<00:02:31.370> up<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.790> image<00:02:32.030> sampling<00:02:32.720> tab<00:02:33.050> and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
is open up the image sampling tab and

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.690 
is open up the image sampling tab and
make<00:02:33.320> sure<00:02:34.180> alpha<00:02:35.180> use<00:02:36.250> make<00:02:37.250> sure<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.550> do

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
make sure alpha use make sure you do

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.400 
make sure alpha use make sure you do
that<00:02:37.850> that's<00:02:38.030> very<00:02:38.270> important<00:02:38.750> because<00:02:38.780> if

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
that that's very important because if

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.000 
that that's very important because if
you<00:02:39.500> forget<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:40.040> it's<00:02:40.340> going<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.760> invert<00:02:41.390> the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
you forget that it's going to invert the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.500 
you forget that it's going to invert the
Alpha<00:02:43.010> Channel<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.459> it's<00:02:43.610> going<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:43.940> look<00:02:44.150> all

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
Alpha Channel and it's going to look all

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.070 
Alpha Channel and it's going to look all
messed<00:02:44.930> up<00:02:45.610> believe<00:02:46.610> me<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:46.820> just<00:02:47.720> found<00:02:47.870> that

messed up believe me I just found that
out<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.670> now<00:02:49.820> we<00:02:49.880> go<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.209> influence<00:02:51.459> click

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
out so now we go to influence click

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.600 
out so now we go to influence click
alpha<00:02:53.620> now<00:02:54.620> we're<00:02:54.830> going<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:54.980> go<00:02:55.130> back<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.580> the

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
alpha now we're going to go back to the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.790 
alpha now we're going to go back to the
material<00:02:56.480> tab<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:58.540> see<00:02:59.540> check<00:02:59.930> transparency

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
material tab and see check transparency

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.530 
material tab and see check transparency
and<00:03:01.010> open<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.400> up<00:03:01.519> make<00:03:01.820> sure<00:03:01.850> it's<00:03:02.150> on<00:03:02.239> Z

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
and open it up make sure it's on Z

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.960 
and open it up make sure it's on Z
transparency<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.590> we're<00:03:04.489> going<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.760> turn

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
transparency and we're going to turn

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.009 
transparency and we're going to turn
alpha<00:03:05.390> all<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:06.260> way<00:03:06.380> down<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:07.780> see<00:03:08.780> we're
