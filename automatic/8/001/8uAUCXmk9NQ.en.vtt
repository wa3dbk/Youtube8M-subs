 and welcome to my channel today 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.249
 I will make a necklace in the technique of imitation 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.260
 turquoise 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.620
 for work we need three colors 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.780
 polymer clay 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.080
 to get a turquoise color mix 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.390
 part of blue plastic with 1 3 green i 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.690
 I use a translucent green film 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.059
 504 can be replaced by the usual 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:37.710
 I mix clay well in green 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.899
 getting a uniform color 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.269
 the resulting turquoise layer in half and 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.460
 I paste each half thinly 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.760
 rolled out sulfur or black polymer 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.760
 clay 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:04.860
 using the knitting needles I make the notches and put in 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.860
 they have thin stripes of turquoise color 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:14.240
 the second part is cut in half and side 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.799
 without drawing I attach to the first 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.330
 I pull the sausage I divide it into three parts 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.330
 and collected fuiste 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.640
 from the remnants of his apple skiers balls 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.520
 I pinch the ball in sections 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.530
 surface shape to shoe size 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.579
 cabochon should fit the size 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.579
 future suspension 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.400
 small specks of fingerprints can 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.400
 clean with a damp cloth 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.000
 by pattern on black polymer clay 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.080
 cut the oval 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.600
 this will be one of the pendants of their pins I 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.340
 I do different sizes in pairs except 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.180
 the largest ones will hang 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.180
 in the middle 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.090
 I bend pin nippers tidy up my hat and in 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.010
 captivity his workpiece for reliability 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.020
 on top of the glue little piece 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.200
 Klimov cabochon insert in the center 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.200
 blanks 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.799
 using an extruder make thin 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.190
 sausages using nozzles of different 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.190
 thickness 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.040
 I twist the sausages in the rope 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.060
 I cut off the protruding edges of the workpiece with a knife 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.269
 using a silver brush 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.269
 trofimov tinted each suspension 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.700
 same 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.690
 am sending pendants firing at 10 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.260
 minutes at a temperature of one hundred and thirty 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.470
 degrees 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.720
 waiting for the cooling down 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.790
 cabochons pass with two layers of varnish 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.790
 to give more shine to the product 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.700
 when the cabochon dries get down to 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.940
 the assembly nippers bite off the excess part 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.780
 pin making them smooth i flood every 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.780
 pin in the eyelet 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.600
 I fasten loops with rings of 4 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.600
 millimeter 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.840
