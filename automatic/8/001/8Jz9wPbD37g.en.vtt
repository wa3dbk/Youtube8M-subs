 Aglietti 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:19.140
 today we talk about cutting fruit in a particular way how to peel 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.340
 cut a banana using essentially a knife and fork 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.739
 once the fruit is chosen 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.739
 the two ends will be cut 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.060
 therefore two dots are practiced 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.060
 longitudinal 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.950
 with a fork 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.960

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.960

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.660
