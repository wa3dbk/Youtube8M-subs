case it's a it's a case based off the
design<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.840> our<00:00:52.170> three<00:00:52.470> some<00:00:53.220> of<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.489> basic

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
design of our three some of the basic

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.640 
design of our three some of the basic
functions<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.629> course<00:00:54.840> expanded<00:00:55.470> and

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
functions but of course expanded and

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.740 
functions but of course expanded and
developed<00:00:56.370> into<00:00:56.940> further<00:00:57.120> iterations<00:00:57.420> to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
developed into further iterations to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.560 
developed into further iterations to
improve<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.410> what<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.610> we<00:00:59.970> have<00:01:00.299> added

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
a dust filter on top and also in the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.030 
a dust filter on top and also in the
front<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:28.680> front<00:01:28.830> comes<00:01:29.340> off<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:31.860> can

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
front the front comes off and you can

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.460 
front the front comes off and you can
actually<00:01:32.250> still<00:01:33.120> have<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.690> attached<00:01:34.440> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
actually still have the I of attached to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.150 
actually still have the I of attached to
the<00:01:34.710> front<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.160> it<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.940> be<00:01:36.090> clean<00:01:36.330> with<00:01:36.570> ease

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
the front so it can be clean with ease

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.660 
the front so it can be clean with ease
we<00:01:38.160> also<00:01:38.550> have<00:01:38.760> improved<00:01:39.120> these<00:01:39.920> grommets<00:01:40.920> to

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
we also have improved these grommets to

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.390 
we also have improved these grommets to
cover<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.360> cables<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:43.920> don't<00:01:44.130> fall<00:01:44.340> off

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
cover the cables so they don't fall off

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.670 
cover the cables so they don't fall off
a<00:01:44.520> ceaseless<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.210> did<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.450> an<00:01:45.540> r3<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.530> then

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
a ceaseless they did in an r3 then then

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.320 
a ceaseless they did in an r3 then then
we<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.010> smaller<00:01:47.310> version<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
we have the smaller version here the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.050 
we have the smaller version here the
midi<00:01:48.570> tower<00:01:48.750> case<00:01:49.080> which<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.920> similar<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.670> we

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
midi tower case which is similar it's we

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.700 
midi tower case which is similar it's we
basically<00:01:51.300> took<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.660> large<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:52.080> and<00:01:52.110> we

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
basically took the large one and we

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.400 
basically took the large one and we
reduce<00:01:52.980> it<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.250> size<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:53.940> have<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
reduce it in size and here we have the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.730 
reduce it in size and here we have the
mini<00:01:55.410> arc<00:01:56.150> Tommy<00:01:57.150> when<00:01:57.870> will<00:01:58.110> customers<00:01:58.590> be

exactly<00:02:41.069> we<00:02:41.610> have<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.909> core<00:02:42.120> series<00:02:42.420> here

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
exactly we have the core series here

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.559 
exactly we have the core series here
it's<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.439> series<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.860> three<00:02:44.180> where<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.269> actually

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
it's a series of three where we actually

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.530 
it's a series of three where we actually
took<00:02:45.689> also<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.290> we<00:02:47.010> use<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.370> design<00:02:47.849> of<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:48.120> r3

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
took also a we use the design of the r3

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.589 
took also a we use the design of the r3
as<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> concept<00:02:49.859> and<00:02:50.189> we<00:02:50.280> stripped<00:02:51.060> down<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.239> few

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
as a concept and we stripped down a few

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.449 
as a concept and we stripped down a few
features<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:52.230> keep<00:02:52.409> the<00:02:52.530> color<00:02:52.739> price<00:02:53.129> level

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
features to keep the color price level

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.839 
features to keep the color price level
down<00:02:53.609> so<00:02:54.329> we<00:02:54.420> have<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.599> core<00:02:54.780> 3000<00:02:55.379> here<00:02:55.530> which

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
down so we have the core 3000 here which

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.420

which is one of the functions we

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.949 
which is one of the functions we
actually<00:03:21.989> skipped<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.560> course<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.840> yeah<00:03:24.840> it's
