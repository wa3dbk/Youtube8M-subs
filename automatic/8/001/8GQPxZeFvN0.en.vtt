00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.060 
and now they have to go to sensitivity
training<00:04:37.520> I<00:04:38.030> want<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:39.020> actually<00:04:39.139> have<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:39.860> video

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
sensitivity classes what are they going

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.150 
sensitivity classes what are they going
to<00:04:44.570> learn<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:45.440> if<00:04:45.590> you're<00:04:45.710> ever<00:04:45.919> being
