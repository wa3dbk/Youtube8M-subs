00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello everyone today let's talk once 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.660
 more than one fantastic modification 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.719
 made by the great designer 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.360
 thai drive a left in the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.790
 description a link to your official website 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.940
 of cubes on facebook good but that 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.789
 we have here because we have a 5 by 5 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.529
 3 made from 16 are 5 by 5 for 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.859
 get this puzzle from a 5 by 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.320
 5 what we have to do is join these 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.630
 two layers join these two layers and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.390
 then we would already have a 5 by 5 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.480
 for 3 and then we go sanding we're not going 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.870
 sanding sanding sanding and at the end 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.489
 we got up to this size no and all 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.559
 the gaps that remain 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.219
 fill with resin so this 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.469
 puzzle weighs so much and if you look at the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.140
 central pieces have a forms a 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.940
 little bit strange 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.970
 well this is so because if you go 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.410
 Sanding the puzzle because they are the forms 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.270
 that are appearing inside the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.430
 cube worth this is the explanation you go 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.260
 sanding and this is what you find 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.180
 inside you can see here 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.970
 example with a little more detail what 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.630
 fine that is this piece fix this 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.980
 piece is super fine if we link it more 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.330
 it directly breaks and disappears 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.400
 and also is interesting because when 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.410
 we are turning the cube it seems that this 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.410
 piece is going to collide with this do not fix 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.960
 and yet one crashes and turns 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.240
 perfectly 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.710
 you see that it has a very good design the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.390
 really good let's do a couple of 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.940
 patterns and so we see how the cube rotates 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.340
 As you can see, it rotates perfectly as it is 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.560
 made from a sensor here we have 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.300
 this typical pattern and by the way the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.860
 yellow that uses thrive join their puzzles 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.820
 it is a yellow then different from the typical and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.560
 I like it a lot and we're going to do it too 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.869
 the pattern of exchange of centers and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.030
 so we can read a bit the size 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.130
 original of the cube we do like this 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.530
 well so by the way as you see this puzzle 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.649
 it deforms 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.170
 and we have this like that then we have to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.170
 here these hidden centers and then 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.650
 we have these two centers here you do not see 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.060
 that way we have the size of 5 by 5 and 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.380
 if we see here with a little bit more of 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.290
 detail 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.340
 you see that it looks like the inside of 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.590
 puzzle here we have how it stands out 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.090
 centerpiece I do not think it's a 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.950
 pattern that looks great in this cube 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.500
 well let's mess up a bit the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.520
 soccer let's start making turns of 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.990
 this style without distorting it and as you see 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.520
 it turns perfectly there is no 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.770
 problem I do not get tired of throwing it because 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.740
 being made from a sensor 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.540
 It is perfect and cuts corners 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.470
 also a little notice if I separate 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.380
 this 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.710
 You see that it fits perfectly even 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.710
 here 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.140
 so it's amazing it's very good 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.660
 done and as I said before it weighs much more 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.930
 of what one expects not because as the 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:12.590
 as it has the resin because in the end it weighs 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.800
 enough more to see how it is going 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.590
 how nice, but as I said before 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.420
 this cube is deformed so we're going to 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.180
 deform so I'll start making a 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.190
 turn of this style for example 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.650
 and so 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.490
 and a turn like that to see what happens and now 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.950
 you see we can keep turning the cube 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:38.510
 and it starts to deform automatically 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:41.240
 20 what looks and stays as blocked 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.150
 ok and it's like 3 for 3 here 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.710
 we have one two three levels one two 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.630
 three levels and three levels for you 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.320
 as well 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.140
 let's give it a few more laps and 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.450
 by the way I a while ago had 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.970
 started to make a modification of a 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.970
 semi are 5 x 5 is worth a modification that 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.250
 consists in transforming a 5 by 5 into a 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.320
 cylinder I need to put the stickers 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.970
 ok this is the modification we are going to 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.069
 see it since we're talking about 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.190
 modifications as you see 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.950
 cut all this 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.959
 until transforming it into a cylinder and 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.299
 it turns quite well not because it's done 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.120
 from a sensor not rotate also 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.860
 like treason but good I think 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.330
 that is pretty good I need to put 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.100
 the stickers but I did not put them on because 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.470
 I was a bit lazy because you had 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.630
 than cut them out with the right size and 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.730
 besides having resin here I do not know if 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.230
 you see it but well all this you see that 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.540
 has resin to fill the gaps 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.980
 Well, the stickers did not stick well 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.380
 so then I have to take a little 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.390
 glue or whatever because I do not know 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.620
 adhere good here you see some that 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.570
 another imperfection not but 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.190
 it's a project that I have pending I have 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.919
 to finish putting the stickers not 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.389
 is that really one thing is to make a 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.340
 modification and another is that you stay 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.580
 Also, as you have left, I bring one 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.440
 that's really hard, let's give it 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.510
 a few more turns and as you see 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.650
 even being deformed it turns 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.080
 perfectly to do this 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.620
 modification first try then 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.370
 phone has to buy the sensor 5 x 5 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.740
 then you have to make the modification 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.139
 you have to sand all the pieces and 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.840
 fill with resin then you have to 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.820
 buy the stickers and cut them or 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.310
 print them and then they have to paste 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.520
 and finally you have to send cloth to 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.110
 your house not for all this I was charged 70 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.710
 euros to me it seems a reasonable price 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.780
 since this as I said before takes a lot 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.729
 more work than it seems and by the way 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.860
 solve this cube is pretty 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.790
 complicated first of all I return it to 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.520
 the shape of kuwait 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.320
 it's good relatively complicated and 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.300
 then I solve it as a cube and 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.730
 but you can present some 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.200
 situations a little bit strange the 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.180
 I really took a surprise, I thought 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.980
 It was going to be quite simple, I've already 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.260
 solved several times but still not 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.180
 I'm happy with the method so I'm going 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.000
 to try to develop one more method 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.520
 clear to be able to write down what later and that 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.580
 I do not forget, well, here I am 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:15.580
 dismissal with this big cube 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:20.199
 I hope you liked it I'll stay 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:22.650
 here solving it and nothing we see in 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.650
 another video
