Sterling audio from Guitar Center for
about<00:00:07.319> 26<00:00:07.859> bucks<00:00:08.220> because<00:00:08.670> it<00:00:08.760> was<00:00:08.849> on<00:00:08.940> sale<00:00:08.970> as

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
about 26 bucks because it was on sale as

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.339 
about 26 bucks because it was on sale as
you<00:00:09.690> can<00:00:09.840> see<00:00:10.019> it's<00:00:10.380> currently<00:00:11.000> $29.99<00:00:12.000> and

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
you can see it's currently $29.99 and

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.129 
you can see it's currently $29.99 and
usually<00:00:13.349> $50<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.790> figured<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.719> metal

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
usually $50 so I figured this is a metal

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.060 
usually $50 so I figured this is a metal
