the<00:01:25.890> only<00:01:26.220> true<00:01:26.460> issue<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the only true issue I have with the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.149 
the only true issue I have with the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
commando is the amount of ammo that you

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.950 
commando is the amount of ammo that you
can<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.520> even<00:01:29.939> upgraded<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.570> thing<00:01:30.780> can

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
can have even upgraded this thing can

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
seems like a decent amount but if you're
