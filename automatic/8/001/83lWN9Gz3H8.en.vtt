00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.340
 the training career is a career 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.769
 which has three important pillars that 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.360
 is the organization in business and in 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.000
 the pillar of what is innovation and 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.160
 technology and has the pillar what is the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.480
 Analytical what are the races 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.490
 engineering information is a 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.529
 concept that is used a lot now and it 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.689
 listen very much is the concept of big 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.160
 dating what does it mean that no longer 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.289
 only the information is important 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.670
 that we have within our company in 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.560
 our servers but information 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.570
 that users speak on networks 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.820
 social what is shared within 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.280
 Internet and much more information than 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.960
 happens on mobile why the race 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.020
 Information engineering allows 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.190
 use and take all this information 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.260
 organize it and help the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.260
 decisions that companies make are 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.879
 more and more scientific and help us 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.350
 have better results 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.210
 I believe that in addition to this 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.550
 have to add that a customer a lot 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.469
 stronger or the business component 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.629
 that is because in the end it is the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.340
 customer information with 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.960
 information that has to do with them 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.260
 what you have to exploit and what to know 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.470
 really made to measure 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.060
 and it was a way that a 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.130
 person can learn to manage 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.990
 data that you already have in the same network 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.680
 can learn to organize the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.690
 information to improve a company today 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.830
 It's very interesting because it's a race 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.130
 new that has been used in the future 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.050
 will help you reach high positions 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.030
 in any company because every company 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.980
 nowadays he needs someone to drive 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.260
 your data or information before 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.710
 I just thought it was reading information 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.230
 and analyze it and file for but now 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.520
 I know he has a lot more field 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.980
 great that you can become manager 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.500
 that does not simply mark in a post 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:54.980
 much lower and that is new to the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.510
 world and what is needed and I think it is 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.729
 an opportunity for me and for a lot 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.040
 people to find work in our 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.810
 career as one handles information 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.690
 that is around us and not what 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.410
 we use as in social networks or 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.370
 surveys or what they ask us to 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.800
 use it later on be a company 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.440
 a consultant and I would like to study it 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.970
 because let's say not only do not sell them 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.830
 if they do not go to your experience and you work in 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.209
 a time to work is very important 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.700
 currently that are social networks 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.920
 as it is often confused 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.630
 between an information engineer and a 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.930
 systems engineer an engineer 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.260
 systems is for 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.090
 and structures technology systems in 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.030
 change of information engineer will 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.469
 It is responsible for seeing how all this data 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.840
 exists at this time in the world 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:45.140
 within the companies and outside power 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.700
 organize it through different 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.010
 models of different forms of 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.959
 different administration topics for 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.969
 take out data and to do to take out 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.189
 decision issues an engineer the 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.349
 information can take care of the 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.849
 management of noble management of the 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.519
 information technology management 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.590
 of innovation management within 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.720
 organizations and this campus every time 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.000
 more broadly not only in Peru but 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.530
 It is also a field that gives us a 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.950
 very large opening level 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.010
 international I would make a bet 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.930
 a bet on the new does not 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.469
 decidedly these are this new 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.799
 trends that are taking place in the 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:27.510
 companies are the trends that sometimes 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.580
 this 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.470
 it costs at the beginning a little bit to understand them 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.750
 but I think that's where the challenge has been 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.879
 the challenge of the new is something that is 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.129
 a lot to write and I think we're in 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.680
 the ability of all of us who are in 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.140
 this area and the new people that 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.500
 enter to write that way 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.480
 well that's the new handling of that new 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.930
 business resource that is called the 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.930
 information
