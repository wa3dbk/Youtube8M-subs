00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:07.779
 It is already the new 4k technology that is 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:12.720
 four times the regular resolution that 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.720
 we have an hour on a 1080 screen 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.150
 good morning friends youtube writers 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.330
 We are here in the post charter and 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.990
 when we all thought that 4k was what 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.369
 last now we are presented with something that 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.670
 call 8 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.590
 and it's something that will leave us surprised 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.260
 how can you see an ad that is here 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.210
 this is the future of television and 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.910
 let's see I would like you to be 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.960
 here with me for you to see what 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:48.280
 clear that you see that 8k screen that is 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.589
 eight times as 4k is 4 times it will be 8k 8 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.510
 Sometimes the resolution tenerife no 8 k is 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:58.390
 16 times the resolution we have 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.600
 currently with reasons that we can 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.090
 make screens so immense and with a 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.830
 color tan 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.540
 and now I'm going to play with the colors 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.860
 of the camera here for you to see 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.970
 different colors so you can see 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.840
 the sharpness of this 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.940
 live look that got me this 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.380
 screen that you are viewing here is 85 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.190
 inches 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.620
 I'm about five meters away, I think 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.090
 let's give it a closer look 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.090
 who is or not god 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.980
 8 k we are going to see to come closer to see 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:43.310
 that you also see that 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:47.550
 let's see if it allows me to approach 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.290
 see the sharpness from close 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.940
 look at people like they hit the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.540
 screen to see if we can see the 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.540
 pixels 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.000
 they want to enjoy the movie and I do not 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.290
 I know how it looks on youtube but this is 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.650
 he sees impressive 16 times the resolution 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.250
 of a regular television 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.640
 Wow 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:36.849
 he has 77 thousand six hundred and eighty 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.849
 four thousand 320 pixels 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.490
 85 inches 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:58.190
 six times the resolution 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.560
 irregular high resolution 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.420
 resolution we have now not 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.989
 I'm not waiting for the future 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.300
 die like we say of you think 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.099
 of this great technology that we have at 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.769
 front 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.989
 this is more little hands up there are no 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.709
