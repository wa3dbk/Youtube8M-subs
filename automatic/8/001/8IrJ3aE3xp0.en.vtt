00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
you have the sponge is cut out you would

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.279 
you have the sponge is cut out you would
just<00:01:37.100> attach<00:01:37.460> them<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.969> or<00:01:38.619> attach<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.710> paper<00:01:39.889> a

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
just attach them to or attach a paper a

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.800 
just attach them to or attach a paper a
clothespin<00:01:42.289> on<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.649> these<00:01:42.770> like<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:43.810> and

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
clothespin on to these like so and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.809 
clothespin on to these like so and
there's<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.380> handle<00:01:45.740> for<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.009> children<00:01:46.429> to

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
there's the handle for the children to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.129 
there's the handle for the children to
hang<00:01:46.969> onto<00:01:47.179> and<00:01:47.450> then<00:01:47.539> they<00:01:47.630> would<00:01:47.749> dip<00:01:47.929> that

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:48.139 
hang onto and then they would dip that

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:50.649 
hang onto and then they would dip that
in<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.920> paint<00:01:49.189> we're<00:01:50.060> going<00:01:50.179> to<00:01:50.240> use<00:01:50.359> a<00:01:50.389> card

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.179 
in the paint we're going to use a card
one<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:50.990> would<00:01:51.079> be<00:01:51.109> the<00:01:51.259> same<00:01:51.469> thing<00:01:51.709> you<00:01:51.979> just

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
one it would be the same thing you just

00:01:52.189 --> 00:02:00.580 
one it would be the same thing you just
attach<00:01:52.609> it<00:01:52.639> to<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:55.369> sponge<00:01:58.119> like<00:01:59.119> so<00:01:59.389> and<00:01:59.689> then

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
attach it to the sponge like so and then

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.699 
attach it to the sponge like so and then
for<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:00.889> paint<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.490> children<00:02:01.819> would<00:02:01.909> dip<00:02:02.090> the

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
for the paint the children would dip the

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.859 
for the paint the children would dip the
sponge<00:02:03.709> brushes<00:02:04.069> into<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.029> paint<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:06.740> then

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
sponge brushes into the paint and then

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.880 
sponge brushes into the paint and then
they<00:02:08.869> would<00:02:09.020> be<00:02:09.140> able<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.500> sponge<00:02:09.890> paint

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
they would be able to sponge paint

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.339 
they would be able to sponge paint
very<00:02:11.890> easy<00:02:12.159> I<00:02:12.580> think<00:02:13.420> much<00:02:13.540> more<00:02:13.689> economical

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349

very easy I think much more economical
than<00:02:15.000> going<00:02:16.000> out<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.209> buying<00:02:16.420> sponge<00:02:16.870> brushes

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
than going out and buying sponge brushes

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.199

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
and you can make these again different

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.170 
and you can make these again different
sizes<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.140> different<00:02:20.680> colors<00:02:20.790> they<00:02:21.790> come<00:02:21.970> in
