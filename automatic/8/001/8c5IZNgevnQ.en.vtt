 heaven a price as oh great 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.429
 paul super super genius fantastic 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.410
 could not go twitter today 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.239
 because yes then the whole commentary would 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.440
 busy and then you think yes 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:56.050
 forth by eric a bit gay no me 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.059
 start talking about krank crank today 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.190
 the gameplay naturally hurts to shrink 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.690
 background whatever you want to call it 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.550
 because I want to talk about the new game oh 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.530
 to have the game someday i only now have one 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.650
 call or duty ghost is in it and has run out 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.120
 have a good idea of ​​your ideas but 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.830
 avoid a few more adjustments 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.970
 and I don't know if you are 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.320
 have that too 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.270
 just indicate it in the comments 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.680
 what you think of my opinion about what I do 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.460
 I think crank is what I like 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.930
 to tell 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.730
 I talk a bit fast I have the idea 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.080
 but that also comes i have a cold i 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.460
 try my voice 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.740
 anyway a little to defame you 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.120
 need to cough splutter I know 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.040
 the f-one must drink because it does 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.080
 men ending again 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.420
 but yes that is it just hurts new ones 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.280
 games and as you know hurt works 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.720
 up to 100 points 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.400
 100 points and then your team has 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.290
 and if you just a normal 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.810
 keel makes if you do not get hurt 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.910
 must sit you get a point for once 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.680
 if you have a crank moot then you get 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.390
 two points for a kill for your team 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.860
 so can go very fast 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.780
 it can be very fast over certainly if 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.240
 people sit streak app or crank bolt 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.280
 can run up those points very quickly and then 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 yes you can do a spot show of couple 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.190
 don't make so many kills 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.040
 so yes that is actually without it 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.710
 downside is it actually had more points 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.349
 must be not 100 we make 200 or 1250 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.660
 so because you are so in 100 I think 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.980
 200 or 150 you see better card 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.480
 also slightly longer game also a little something 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.330
 making more kills might just be right 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.820
 slightly nicer 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.530
 that's a small yami budget 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.410
 thinks I already got both 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.480
 natural plus that everything beeps 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.070
 if you are a kilo buddy you are dying 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.470
 or you spawn just in the beginning of the 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.100
 game and you make a chill then you see 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.110
 stand 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.850
 you a crank engine hurts maud and then 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.580
 see your counter go i can do so much 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.890
 seconds and if you have a crank boat 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.010
 means that you already have your five the speed bug 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.190
 sprite between duty marathon slide event 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.290
 freddy and stolker 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.530
 so actually wanted to mean that with 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.270
 once you have 5 pieces with the first 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.560
 kill you immediately get 5 books by so that's 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.840
 actually an advantage 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.520
 actually i would recommend it to anyone too 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.260
 although they are large folders, you have to 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.090
 walk a lot 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.030
 you have to be completely in your own 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.110
 workshop is special is also in special 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.330
 bonus no one 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.610
 speed pro con lure because you war them 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.920
 even if you're languishing so that's just 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.080
 not a tip for anyone not starting 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.520
 none of those speedbooks 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.080
 speed bridge are of course orange 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.250
 I think you need color 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.420
 I just didn't put it in 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.070
 not done either 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.690
 That means you have a little more space 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.220
 have for other perks so you can 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.420
 For example, some people who sit one 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.280
 little magic was tired and 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.269
 wanna wanna pin wanna senpai the jets 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.310
 eines 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.959
 they want ayse you will discover jewels 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.100
 slide event how or year slider guy 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.070
 don't have to don't have to 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.140
 to think because that is a spy park 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.420
 you sometimes have choices there i want me 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.430
 I don't want a flack jacket 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.350
 this does that and then you just have something 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.709
 more choice to do some more perks 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.690
 because you just have 5 plus immediately just one 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.940
 once site works and normally 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.950
 would quite pick your beam according to his foot 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.440
 smart you want to start with all speed 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.850
 boxwood yes now you have a small advantage and 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.769
 that is a big advantage to you 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.540
 also have a your specialist you have more 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.040
 production so it makes it for you 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.840
 own also a bit easier ladies 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.190
 maybe got so nice about that 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.830
 something easier for your own 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.380
 and of course that crank engine your time 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.750
 sees you going to run you have to Russians 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.549
 you have to walk you have to sprint 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.100
 that naturally makes you nice 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.989
 something must do everything you die is that 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.400
 also somewhat united the camp 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.769
 met because I see crank anyway 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.370
 usually people walk more than on 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.080
 stupid nation of ten that much of field 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.800
 for whatever hurts is still 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.139
 a game boy 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.150
 people often walk because they have 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.190
 well she had to make them in the throat 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.659
 somewhere 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.360
 in the middle of the folder or ice creams 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:39.860
 the sides can meet people 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.030
 so yes that's why I like it so much 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.430
 is a good idea 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.229
 so well worked out that you have 5 puppies 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.780
 of course then you can do even more 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.120
 variation in your puppy 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.240
 because you can attract so many pucks and 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.919
 mercury or whatever you want 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.139
 but the drawback is being a jar 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.669
 usually over quickly and certainly play now 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.469
 I solo so are you lucky you 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.479
 maybe your random inherits the 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:04.190
 level but if i just we here 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.199
 with two or three man game that I just 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.400
 do you know though i would be here with paul 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.740
 I know team with those where we play 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.020
 normally lets tail just because ps4 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.520
 Playing this game is so fast 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.349
 my paul makes a lot of kills that carpets 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.940
 i make for kills and then it is after 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.650
 so over again and that is it anyway 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.580
 disadvantage of hurting and you think so 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.469
 maybe also 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.599
 it takes too short it is nice system 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:25.159
 good that it is on small folders sometimes 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.590
 I think that a folder is quite a bit 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:30.199
 off may not go anywhere even toe is anyway 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.029
 just too big I think follow 656 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.919
 a few pieces are allowed there 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:35.719
 waste maya to just put him on something small 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.909
 hear something compact nice and faster 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:39.319
 nice and quick and make those kills and then 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.000
 I would be a bit so my opinion will 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:42.110
 good game also folders maybe one 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.060
 adjust a little 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.710
 maybe a little more points and then you have 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.360
 to grab a fantastic chemo 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.469
 I hope you like this comment 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.690
