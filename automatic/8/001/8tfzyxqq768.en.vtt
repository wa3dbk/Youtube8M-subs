tried to lean that same way on this one
thousand<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.659> bike<00:01:32.840> really<00:01:33.590> went<00:01:33.979> over

thousand and the bike really went over

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.600 
thousand and the bike really went over
on<00:01:34.940> me<00:01:35.149> and<00:01:35.409> I<00:01:36.409> really<00:01:36.860> just<00:01:36.979> had<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.399> put<00:01:37.580> my

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
on me and I really just had to put my

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.999 
on me and I really just had to put my
leg<00:01:37.880> out<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.140> press<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.350> bike<00:01:39.500> back<00:01:39.799> up

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
leg out and press the bike back up

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.080 
leg out and press the bike back up
otherwise<00:01:40.340> they'll<00:01:40.640> have<00:01:40.759> been<00:01:40.880> on<00:01:40.970> the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
otherwise they'll have been on the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.260 
otherwise they'll have been on the
ground<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:41.770> wait<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:43.190> something<00:01:43.700> you're<00:01:44.149> going

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
ground so wait is something you're going

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.820 
ground so wait is something you're going
to<00:01:44.330> have<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.600> get<00:01:44.720> used<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:45.080> but<00:01:45.259> it's<00:01:45.380> not<00:01:45.590> hard

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
to have to get used to but it's not hard

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.889 
to have to get used to but it's not hard
to<00:01:45.890> do<00:01:46.100> because<00:01:46.520> all<00:01:46.850> bikes<00:01:47.119> are<00:01:47.299> designed<00:01:47.810> to

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
to do because all bikes are designed to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.260 
to do because all bikes are designed to
ride<00:01:48.080> up<00:01:48.380> right<00:01:48.649> it's<00:01:49.159> just<00:01:49.429> when<00:01:49.580> you<00:01:49.700> stop<00:01:50.060> or

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
ride up right it's just when you stop or

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.730 
ride up right it's just when you stop or
when<00:01:50.390> you<00:01:50.479> lean<00:01:50.750> that's<00:01:51.380> when<00:01:51.590> you're<00:01:51.709> really

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
when you lean that's when you're really

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.440 
when you lean that's when you're really
kind<00:01:52.429> of<00:01:52.549> feeling<00:01:52.880> that<00:01:52.909> weight<00:01:53.179> or<00:01:53.330> when

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
kind of feeling that weight or when

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.850 
kind of feeling that weight or when
you're<00:01:53.569> trying<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.899> back<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.350> up<00:01:54.470> with<00:01:54.679> your

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
you're trying to back it up with your

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.740 
you're trying to back it up with your
feet<00:01:55.069> or<00:01:55.310> move<00:01:55.729> it<00:01:55.879> forward<00:01:56.149> something<00:01:56.660> like

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
feet or move it forward something like

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.119 
feet or move it forward something like
that<00:01:56.929> you<00:01:57.289> have<00:01:57.410> to<00:01:57.500> deal<00:01:57.649> with<00:01:57.770> that<00:01:57.920> weight

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:58.129 
that you have to deal with that weight

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:01.150 
that you have to deal with that weight
but<00:01:58.340> other<00:01:58.489> than<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:58.759> it's<00:01:59.690> cool<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:00.349> weight

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
but other than that it's cool so weight

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.580 
but other than that it's cool so weight
difference<00:02:01.610> number<00:02:02.509> one<00:02:02.690> thing<00:02:02.989> I<00:02:03.110> had<00:02:03.289> to<00:02:03.410> get

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
difference number one thing I had to get

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.770 
difference number one thing I had to get
used<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:04.009> in<00:02:04.190> transitioning<00:02:04.940> between<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.660> two

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
fifty pounds x 225 pounds it was a bit

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.910 
fifty pounds x 225 pounds it was a bit
difficult<00:02:56.090> so<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.840> ended<00:02:57.050> up<00:02:57.110> having<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.500> start

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920

it<00:02:58.129> put<00:02:58.489> it<00:02:58.580> in<00:02:58.670> first<00:02:58.730> gear<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.329> then<00:02:59.659> just

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
it put it in first gear and then just

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.180 
it put it in first gear and then just
giving<00:03:00.469> it<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.620> little<00:03:00.709> gas<00:03:00.889> and<00:03:01.280> walking<00:03:01.609> it<00:03:01.700> up

my 250 when I come off to throttle the

my 250 when I come off to throttle the
bike<00:03:15.120> just<00:03:15.360> rose<00:03:15.570> smooth<00:03:15.960> but<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.380> 1000

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
bike just rose smooth but on the 1000

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.100 
bike just rose smooth but on the 1000
it's<00:03:17.160> going<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.430> break<00:03:17.910> hard<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.660> like<00:03:18.870> that

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
it's going to break hard and I like that

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.160 
it's going to break hard and I like that
and<00:03:19.440> now<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.280> I'm<00:03:20.400> used<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.820> i<00:03:20.880> like<00:03:21.060> it

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
and now that I'm used to it i like it

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.600 
and now that I'm used to it i like it
because<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.410> helps<00:03:22.680> me<00:03:22.800> in<00:03:22.950> my<00:03:22.980> cornering

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
because it helps me in my cornering

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.280 
because it helps me in my cornering
because<00:03:23.850> when<00:03:23.970> our<00:03:24.090> downshift<00:03:24.630> blip<00:03:25.260> the

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
because when our downshift blip the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.400 
because when our downshift blip the
throttle<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:27.150> RPMs<00:03:27.660> our<00:03:27.750> high<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:27.960> going<00:03:28.350> to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
throttle the RPMs our high is going to

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.990 
throttle the RPMs our high is going to
break<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.950> then<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.160> can<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:29.340> go<00:03:29.580> on<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.880> take

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
break and then I can just go on and take

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.090 
break and then I can just go on and take
that<00:03:30.180> corner<00:03:30.450> smoothly<00:03:30.900> finding<00:03:31.890> where<00:03:32.070> the

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
that corner smoothly finding where the

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.810 
that corner smoothly finding where the
clutch<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.090> throttle<00:03:33.660> engage<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:35.250> was

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
clutch and the throttle engage this was

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.970 
clutch and the throttle engage this was
I<00:03:36.150> think<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.960> hardest<00:03:37.290> thing<00:03:37.590> for<00:03:37.830> me<00:03:37.890> to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
I think the hardest thing for me to

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.220 
I think the hardest thing for me to
transition<00:03:38.340> into<00:03:38.820> coming<00:03:39.300> off<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:39.450> 250<00:03:40.020> into

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
transition into coming off of 250 into

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.400 
transition into coming off of 250 into
the<00:03:40.410> 1000<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:41.490> my<00:03:41.820> 250<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.480> know<00:03:42.690> when<00:03:42.990> I<00:03:43.020> let<00:03:43.290> off

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
the 1000 on my 250 I know when I let off

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.560 
the 1000 on my 250 I know when I let off
the<00:03:43.590> clutch<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:44.190> can<00:03:45.000> let<00:03:45.180> off<00:03:45.330> at<00:03:45.480> about

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
the clutch I can let off at about

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.170 
the clutch I can let off at about
halfway<00:03:46.070> before<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.370> engages<00:03:47.700> into<00:03:48.090> the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
halfway before it engages into the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.630 
halfway before it engages into the
transmission<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.620> know<00:03:49.680> where<00:03:50.130> I<00:03:50.160> can<00:03:50.280> roll

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
transmission and I know where I can roll

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.560 
transmission and I know where I can roll
on<00:03:50.790> throttle<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:52.940> get<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:53.970> nice<00:03:54.120> smooth

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
transition from gear to gear on the 1000

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.180

that that space where you clutch engages

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.880 
that that space where you clutch engages
is<00:04:02.580> smaller<00:04:03.390> I<00:04:03.690> mean<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:03.960> know<00:04:04.020> I<00:04:04.140> can<00:04:04.350> adjust<00:04:04.710> it

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
is smaller I mean I know I can adjust it

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.040 
is smaller I mean I know I can adjust it
but<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.430> haven't<00:04:05.640> adjusted<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:06.239> yet<00:04:06.420> so<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:06.930> know

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
but I haven't adjusted it yet so I know

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.479 
but I haven't adjusted it yet so I know
it's<00:04:07.380> it's<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.830> smaller<00:04:08.480> space<00:04:10.160> so<00:04:11.160> I'm<00:04:11.310> getting

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
it's it's a smaller space so I'm getting

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.640 
it's it's a smaller space so I'm getting
used<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.720> smaller<00:04:12.989> space<00:04:13.290> coming

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
used to that that smaller space coming

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.740 
used to that that smaller space coming
off<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:13.950> clutch<00:04:14.459> rolling<00:04:15.209> onto<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.570> throttle

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
off the clutch rolling onto the throttle

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.140 
off the clutch rolling onto the throttle
and<00:04:16.290> that<00:04:17.280> that's<00:04:17.520> pretty<00:04:17.700> much<00:04:17.880> been<00:04:18.060> the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
and that that's pretty much been the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.909 
and that that's pretty much been the
hardest<00:04:18.359> thing<00:04:18.690> I've<00:04:18.900> come<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.560> find<00:04:19.709> out<00:04:19.859> that

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
hardest thing I've come to find out that

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.460 
hardest thing I've come to find out that
I've<00:04:20.609> got<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:21.780> know<00:04:21.900> our<00:04:22.080> buddies<00:04:22.350> have

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
I've got that you know our buddies have

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.110 
I've got that you know our buddies have
that<00:04:22.590> little<00:04:22.770> bit<00:04:22.950> of<00:04:22.980> play<00:04:23.310> in<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.640> throttle

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
that little bit of play in the throttle

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.670 
that little bit of play in the throttle
and<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.300> know<00:04:24.450> when<00:04:24.600> you<00:04:24.690> get<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.650> bottom

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
and you know when you get to the bottom

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.790 
and you know when you get to the bottom
of<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.250> plate<00:04:26.640> that<00:04:27.390> next<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.930> next<00:04:28.169> turn<00:04:28.500> is

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
of that plate that next the next turn is

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.980 
of that plate that next the next turn is
going<00:04:29.010> to<00:04:29.070> get<00:04:29.910> you<00:04:30.060> going<00:04:30.240> so<00:04:30.600> I<00:04:30.630> know<00:04:30.750> where

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
going to get you going so I know where

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.620 
going to get you going so I know where
that<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.140> now<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.919> i<00:04:32.910> wrote<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.300> mountains

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
that is now and i wrote the mountains

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.210 
that is now and i wrote the mountains
this<00:04:33.750> weekend<00:04:34.200> i<00:04:34.260> did<00:04:34.410> pretty<00:04:34.620> good<00:04:34.710> i<00:04:34.890> didn't

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
this weekend i did pretty good i didn't

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.310 
this weekend i did pretty good i didn't
crash<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.940> I<00:04:36.030> really<00:04:36.690> did<00:04:36.840> good<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.140> I<00:04:37.200> was

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
crash and I really did good and I was

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.260 
crash and I really did good and I was
happy<00:04:37.620> with<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.310> way<00:04:38.460> I<00:04:38.520> road<00:04:38.760> so<00:04:39.060> yeah

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
happy with the way I road so yeah

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.400 
happy with the way I road so yeah
getting<00:04:39.630> used<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.020> clutch<00:04:40.230> and<00:04:40.380> the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
getting used to the clutch and the

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.140 
getting used to the clutch and the
throttle<00:04:40.770> engagement<00:04:41.370> there's<00:04:41.880> something

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
throttle engagement there's something

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.340 
throttle engagement there's something
else<00:04:42.300> you're<00:04:42.419> going<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:42.630> have<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.870> get<00:04:42.990> used<00:04:43.169> to

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
else you're going to have to get used to

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.260 
else you're going to have to get used to
torque<00:04:43.919> eNOS<00:04:44.250> I<00:04:44.550> don't<00:04:44.880> know<00:04:44.970> if<00:04:45.030> that's<00:04:45.210> a

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
torque eNOS I don't know if that's a

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.170 
torque eNOS I don't know if that's a
word<00:04:45.390> or<00:04:45.570> not<00:04:45.720> but<00:04:46.020> this<00:04:46.140> bike<00:04:46.380> is<00:04:47.180> very

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
word or not but this bike is very

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.909 
word or not but this bike is very
torquey<00:04:48.510> I<00:04:48.780> mean<00:04:48.990> it's<00:04:49.200> got<00:04:49.350> a<00:04:49.380> good<00:04:49.530> torque

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
torquey I mean it's got a good torque

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.740 
torquey I mean it's got a good torque
through<00:04:50.130> all<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.460> power<00:04:50.669> bands<00:04:51.210> power<00:04:51.419> range

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
through all the power bands power range

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.680 
through all the power bands power range
low<00:04:52.140> medium<00:04:52.470> high<00:04:52.650> it's<00:04:53.580> very<00:04:53.970> good<00:04:54.300> when<00:04:54.600> you

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
low medium high it's very good when you

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.090 
low medium high it's very good when you
come<00:04:54.870> on<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.140> throttle<00:04:55.350> it's<00:04:55.710> going<00:04:55.890> to<00:04:55.919> go

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
come on that throttle it's going to go

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.520 
come on that throttle it's going to go
where<00:04:56.400> you<00:04:56.490> want<00:04:56.700> it<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:56.910> go<00:04:57.060> I<00:04:57.300> find<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.470> I

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
where you want it to go I find that I

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.400 
where you want it to go I find that I
can<00:04:58.770> ride<00:04:59.010> in<00:04:59.370> second<00:04:59.760> gear<00:04:59.880> at<00:05:00.090> a<00:05:00.120> much<00:05:00.300> higher

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
can ride in second gear at a much higher

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.170 
can ride in second gear at a much higher
rpm<00:05:01.410> and<00:05:01.440> also<00:05:01.830> third<00:05:02.040> year<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.790> really<00:05:03.000> all

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
the gears at a much higher rpm that I

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.480 
the gears at a much higher rpm that I
can<00:05:05.550> or<00:05:05.669> 250<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.510> I<00:05:07.200> like<00:05:07.500> that<00:05:07.530> because<00:05:08.010> like

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
can or 250 and I like that because like

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.440 
can or 250 and I like that because like
I<00:05:08.580> said<00:05:08.640> when<00:05:08.850> you're<00:05:08.970> riding<00:05:09.090> in<00:05:09.330> the

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
I said when you're riding in the

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.850 
I said when you're riding in the
mountains<00:05:09.780> or<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:09.960> canyons<00:05:10.440> or<00:05:10.560> wherever

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
mountains or the canyons or wherever

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.860 
mountains or the canyons or wherever
you're<00:05:10.919> at<00:05:11.039> you<00:05:11.700> can<00:05:11.850> stay<00:05:12.030> in<00:05:12.090> second<00:05:12.660> gear

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
you're at you can stay in second gear

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.630 
you're at you can stay in second gear
and<00:05:13.169> you<00:05:13.289> can<00:05:13.500> take<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:13.860> twisties<00:05:14.370> and<00:05:14.580> you

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
and you can take the twisties and you

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.820 
and you can take the twisties and you
can

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
can

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.620 
can
take<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.130> switchbacks<00:05:15.670> and<00:05:15.880> you<00:05:16.360> don't<00:05:16.540> have

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
take the switchbacks and you don't have

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.060 
take the switchbacks and you don't have
to<00:05:16.720> worry<00:05:16.870> about<00:05:16.960> switching<00:05:17.410> gears<00:05:17.770> you<00:05:17.890> can

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
to worry about switching gears you can

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.740 
to worry about switching gears you can
take<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.550> in<00:05:18.640> second<00:05:19.030> gear<00:05:19.060> you<00:05:19.300> can<00:05:19.330> take<00:05:19.660> it

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
take it in second gear you can take it

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.210 
take it in second gear you can take it
in<00:05:19.870> third<00:05:20.110> gear<00:05:20.320> you're<00:05:20.800> still<00:05:21.010> going<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.160> have

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
in third gear you're still going to have

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.740 
in third gear you're still going to have
that<00:05:21.400> torque<00:05:21.730> to<00:05:21.910> get<00:05:22.060> you<00:05:22.180> through<00:05:22.390> the<00:05:22.510> turn

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
that torque to get you through the turn

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.630 
that torque to get you through the turn
and<00:05:23.080> come<00:05:23.500> out<00:05:23.680> of<00:05:23.830> that<00:05:23.860> turn<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.400> come<00:05:24.490> on

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
and come out of that turn and come on

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.040 
and come out of that turn and come on
that<00:05:24.790> throttle<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.330> shoot<00:05:25.630> you<00:05:25.750> out<00:05:25.810> of<00:05:26.020> that

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
that throttle and shoot you out of that

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.320 
that throttle and shoot you out of that
curve<00:05:26.410> and<00:05:26.680> that's<00:05:27.580> a<00:05:27.670> good<00:05:27.790> feeling<00:05:27.850> when<00:05:28.270> you

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
curve and that's a good feeling when you

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.910 
curve and that's a good feeling when you
come<00:05:28.540> out<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:28.900> curve<00:05:29.140> and<00:05:29.380> you<00:05:29.500> give<00:05:29.710> us<00:05:29.830> some

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
come out the curve and you give us some

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.500 
come out the curve and you give us some
gas<00:05:30.130> and<00:05:30.160> it<00:05:30.580> brings<00:05:30.790> you<00:05:30.910> up<00:05:31.090> right<00:05:31.300> and<00:05:31.450> you

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
gas and it brings you up right and you

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.880 
gas and it brings you up right and you
set<00:05:31.780> up<00:05:31.870> for<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.080> next<00:05:32.140> curve<00:05:32.530> and<00:05:32.740> then<00:05:32.830> you

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
set up for the next curve and then you

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.150 
set up for the next curve and then you
go<00:05:33.040> back<00:05:33.220> into<00:05:33.430> it<00:05:33.760> so<00:05:34.000> torquing<00:05:34.510> this<00:05:34.660> is

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
go back into it so torquing this is

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
go back into it so torquing this is
another<00:05:36.160> feature<00:05:36.400> that<00:05:36.580> I<00:05:36.670> had<00:05:36.790> to<00:05:36.850> get<00:05:37.000> used

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
another feature that I had to get used

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.780 
another feature that I had to get used
to<00:05:37.450> I<00:05:37.690> like<00:05:38.440> it<00:05:38.620> now<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:39.040> kind<00:05:39.250> of<00:05:39.280> scared<00:05:39.580> me<00:05:39.640> at

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
to I like it now it kind of scared me at

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.550 
to I like it now it kind of scared me at
first<00:05:39.820> but<00:05:40.150> not<00:05:40.450> like<00:05:40.690> it<00:05:40.870> so<00:05:41.200> I<00:05:41.230> think<00:05:41.320> I've

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
first but not like it so I think I've

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.650 
first but not like it so I think I've
covered<00:05:41.770> everything<00:05:42.100> in<00:05:42.760> the<00:05:43.060> transitioning
