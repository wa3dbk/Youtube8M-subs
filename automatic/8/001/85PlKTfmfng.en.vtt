 Hello dear friends with you phoenix 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.380
 and today I would like to show how 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.210
 create a server to the game all hunting 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.320
 play on the network let's say skype but not 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.289
 know how to do it 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.970
 only knows the access point smelly 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.269
 me she is already this access point 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:30.840
 annoying so we see what needs to be done 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:33.570
 we first go to Google shorter 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.870

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.070

 and follow this link here with us 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.520
 Enterprise requires a username and 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.399
 password 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.590

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.059
