boss<00:00:27.089> with<00:00:28.089> the<00:00:28.449> I<00:00:28.480> electribe<00:00:29.199> as<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.539> input

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
boss with the I electribe as the input

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.900 
boss with the I electribe as the input
so<00:00:32.200> let's<00:00:32.710> say<00:00:32.980> just<00:00:33.310> see<00:00:33.430> so<00:00:33.640> we'll<00:00:33.760> just

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
so let's say just see so we'll just

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.819 
so let's say just see so we'll just
start<00:00:34.239> it<00:00:34.390> off<00:00:34.510> here<00:00:34.750> and<00:00:34.899> then<00:00:35.079> my<00:00:35.350> settings

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
start it off here and then my settings

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.270 
start it off here and then my settings
are<00:00:36.100> on<00:00:36.969> phaser<00:00:37.420> so<00:00:38.379> you<00:00:38.440> can<00:00:38.680> hit<00:00:38.980> this<00:00:39.100> and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
are on phaser so you can hit this and

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.970 
are on phaser so you can hit this and
you<00:00:39.340> can<00:00:39.370> select<00:00:39.609> the<00:00:39.760> chorus<00:00:40.120> flanger<00:00:40.449> phaser

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
you can select the chorus flanger phaser

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.410 
you can select the chorus flanger phaser
so<00:00:41.980> it's<00:00:42.129> on<00:00:42.250> phaser<00:00:42.489> at<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.820> moment<00:00:43.149> and<00:00:43.269> it's

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
so it's on phaser at the moment and it's

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.119 
so it's on phaser at the moment and it's
set<00:00:43.690> dry<00:00:44.050> so<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.559> first<00:00:44.739> thing<00:00:44.800> you're<00:00:45.010> going
