00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.440
 yes 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:09.390
 [Music] 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.070
 the year feeling at home we are in the 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.710
 rebellious new a voice that is called 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.139
 flashmode that includes all that vehicle 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.900
 I'm looking back there and apart 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.539
 weapons that is the most important thing in the world 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.810
 and return models by pulling the version 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.060
 172 is worth to include only more in 3-d 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.900
 I think that's cool 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.780
 sample of this already 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.820
 profile 38 and apart I have salt 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.200
 that has nothing to do is modest the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.989
 lighting and all that I'm seeing 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.600
 salts that worth what it will look like 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.909
 strange of this is that in the shadows it 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.399
 see like that but then we put on the 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.890
 third person and be like that you know is a 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.870
 little weird 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.530
 but well I will not give much 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.920
 importance but good then for 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.260
 example worth 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.260
 look at the animation is this collection 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.909
 until now 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.830
 we have the g7 that good the liberation 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.280
 slow that is quite cured 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.280
 look 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.320
 well, this is all these 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.200
 vehicles that it brings because they are airplanes 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.210
 they are quite manageable and tighten the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.000
 c key while they are mounted then 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.310
 active as you use it with the mouse 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.330
 the cars are handled pretty weird but 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.330
 the truth is that he is so handsome 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.240
 very good and that's all an example of 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.890
 I'm putting here looks and skating 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.520
 I just worked all the vehicles 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.799
 this 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.600
 you do not have to be better is the best 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.520
 in some version I suppose but good 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.130
 now for now it's pretty functional 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.860
 so well let's see the others 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.380
 vehicles that brings 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.060
 has left country 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.060
 open the tank this 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.110
 and here we have the desire because we have 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.340
 what to put there 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.340
 the pressure that it brings 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.390
 we have to look for it here or if not already 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.090
 leave the page two characters in the 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.440
 description of this activity 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.820
 but well this below his rival the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.640
 truth is that it is quite expensive to get 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:32.580
 things a part are included 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.580
 this is going to flip right now 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.060
 start with the muffler it's all here 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.060
 I'll take this to the table 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.300
 modifiable have been put until what 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.490
 we put what we can do here is 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.420
 modify weapons not only that they are not 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.060
 the postmen but good and then you 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.360
 we can put a look do not look at the eye 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.530
 of these that I liked a lot 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.010
 and well we take out here the weapon that gives 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.010
 these kids 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.760
 and everything seems to me on top of the planes 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.760
 now I will say how they are handled 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.100
 pretty good 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.440
 so ' is not as inverted to the 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.270
 thing 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.100
 the cons but good the character and he 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.190
 moves to the impressive form but 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.300
 good 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.300
 we are giving a pirouette 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.330
 and good 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.349
 is what they bring many things I will leave a 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.349
 listing of same 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.990
 he saw her stay like this but good is 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.990
 pretty work the mold 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.860
 and the vehicles are about to improve 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:56.260
 still 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.040
 but good and more to challenge how pretty 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.040
 Bone lads 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.610
 I'm delighted over the new things 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.550
 who have brought you so good 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.620
 deals that are taking next 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.870
 well we continue here with the ryder of 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.760
 more things I was going to say I'll leave a 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.730
 installer in the description is worth that 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.030
 just give you mobile install is already 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.160
 installed alone 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.720
 also if you do not know how to install in 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.630
 motorcycle neither automatically nor manually 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.360
 I will leave a 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.320
 leave a tutorial I made myself from 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.139
 how to install more in minecraft 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.909
 good those that are not included he 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.259
 the minimum for that you see is not 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:41.490
 neither included the animations of 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.689
 these characters that are too many 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.039
 out of the ordinary but good 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.039
 handsome looks pretty pretty 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.270
 and good the things that he said to me 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.270
 Handsome 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.360
 what I do 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.040
 but well not all things not all 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.260
 things while watching for example 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.800
 grenades are you 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.390
 I imagine that it will not consume much what 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.780
 plays of antiquity and not consumed 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.460
 current 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.880
 so good the ssa of these and the 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.650
 we take on a flight 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.470
 so it's good apart from these vehicles 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.690
 that brings you can pack packs 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.880
 are found for this version because 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.280
 they have to take into account 2 - no no 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.110
 ok I mean, I've been card packs 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.020
 5 and such but not the cars not only 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.430
 they had removed so it's not worth it but 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.260
 you can look around to see if 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.360
 find packs install them and try 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.680
 the newest new vehicles and all 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.480
 those things it's worth leaving the mode of 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.180
 description so you can try it if 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.680
 you want to try it or if you want to play with 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.420
 he played in his experience I did not 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.640
 tried very well I tried it after 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.620
 terminal but it has to be handsome worth 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.010
 there are also servers to play online 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.930
 I'm looking for I do not know what they are but before 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.980
 played in one no longer we no longer know which one 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.860
 search it out there by by google for 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.610
 and good to like you if you want more 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.290
 most the magazine and subscribe to the channel 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.850
 that helps me a lot 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.140
 knows how much it costs to do 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.140
 videos and until next time 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.670
