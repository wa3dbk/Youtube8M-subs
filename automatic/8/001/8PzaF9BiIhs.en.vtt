00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
that's quite a key point on this as well

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.839 
that's quite a key point on this as well
so<00:00:29.529> anyway<00:00:29.769> what<00:00:29.949> does<00:00:30.039> it<00:00:30.160> do<00:00:30.339> well<00:00:30.519> it<00:00:30.609> takes

I<00:05:36.910> live<00:05:37.910> in<00:05:38.150> my<00:05:38.390> life<00:05:38.900> I<00:05:39.320> carry<00:05:39.860> asleep<00:05:40.580> but<00:05:41.420> no

I live in my life I carry asleep but no
so<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.820> point<00:05:45.120> is<00:05:45.330> you<00:05:46.020> can<00:05:46.290> see<00:05:46.320> that<00:05:47.280> you<00:05:47.400> can

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
so the point is you can see that you can

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.010 
so the point is you can see that you can
scrub<00:05:50.000> you<00:05:51.000> can<00:05:51.180> speed<00:05:51.420> it<00:05:51.450> up<00:05:51.600> and<00:05:51.690> slow<00:05:51.750> it

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
scrub you can speed it up and slow it

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.600 
scrub you can speed it up and slow it
down<00:05:52.050> to<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:52.890> point<00:05:53.040> where<00:05:53.130> then<00:05:53.340> you<00:05:53.460> can

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
down to the point where then you can

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.970 
down to the point where then you can
just<00:05:53.760> reverse<00:05:54.090> it<00:05:54.470> so<00:05:55.470> you<00:05:55.560> can<00:05:55.710> play<00:05:55.830> it

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
just reverse it so you can play it

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.810 
just reverse it so you can play it
backwards<00:05:56.510> also<00:05:57.510> you<00:05:58.290> can<00:05:58.560> step<00:05:58.950> up<00:05:59.130> a<00:05:59.340> pair

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
backwards also you can step up a pair

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.850 
backwards also you can step up a pair
semitone<00:06:00.420> sort<00:06:00.720> of<00:06:00.810> thing<00:06:00.960> and<00:06:01.350> you<00:06:01.560> can<00:06:01.710> see

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
semitone sort of thing and you can see

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.070 
semitone sort of thing and you can see
how<00:06:01.950> accurate<00:06:02.430> is<00:06:02.550> as<00:06:02.670> well<00:06:02.850> is<00:06:03.150> if<00:06:03.420> I<00:06:03.570> this<00:06:03.930> is

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
how accurate is as well is if I this is

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.870 
how accurate is as well is if I this is
normal<00:06:04.410> now<00:06:04.500> so<00:06:04.710> I<00:06:04.740> kind<00:06:05.430> of<00:06:05.460> figured<00:06:05.730> it<00:06:05.760> we

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
normal now so I kind of figured it we

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.469 
normal now so I kind of figured it we
see<00:06:06.180> I<00:06:06.210> think

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479
