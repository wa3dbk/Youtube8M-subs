00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.700
 hello we are again here my channel them 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:07.390
 I wanted to present a fifa with video 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.379
 me 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.869
 which is an economical laptop equipment 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:17.470
 so it has a lot of value 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:20.020
 is going to be 80 is the cheap with penetration 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.920
 of 98 but missing the coach would generate 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.280
 The 100% 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.279
 and hey, it's pretty good, it's going to be 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:32.559
 cheap and I'll show you we have the 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:36.260
 swansea word doorman for 800 coins 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:39.290
 800 coins approximately is nothing 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.300
 wrong and the truth 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.900
 because in my identification are not the 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.440
 attributes none falls from 65 the worst and 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.440
 in block 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.260
 therefore they are the goalkeepers faster 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.090
 because there are other goalkeepers who are 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.040
 rather better than it has a goal 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.940
 to block it is important that you have 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.680
 enough speed then 81 of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.500
 these so many good ones is very good of 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.830
 next price taiwo side that the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.130
 of the tottenham hotspurs everybody what 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.789
 knows and is very well priced 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.520
 fail of important sensations 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:20.200
 next smolin does not have a good shot but 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.840
 good to be a center we do not want 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.310
 that has we visit good defense and 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.130
 head was wanted and abbas is 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.100
 quite a rhythm and quite a rhythm 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.429
 very important for the center too 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.860
 get the central everton we have 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.970
 69 rhythm shots men better than is 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.670
 mill but it's also not a big 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.729
 providence 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.400
 quite phase and head and defense 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.460
 it's pretty good following dips 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.329
 Left side of the Tsar will be a lot 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.579
 defense rhythm and 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.670
 more or less but hey is pretty 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.710
 complemented loses one home in another and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.780
 it's pretty cheap if all these 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.200
 players that I said do not pass the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.240
 a thousand coins 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.780
 the next each god where is 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.150
 find also for 800 800 coins 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.510
 around with enough rhythm shots good 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.409
 very good 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.510
 to be 800 coins but I repeat it is not 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.180
 like some other good players 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.480
 we follow passes that is fine and dribbling 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.250
 86 defense did not meet us such and 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.329
 neither head but the interior 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.989
 right we arrived perfectly 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:35.200
 next jack wilshere perfect addition 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.790
 of some pretty good characteristics 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.980
 has enough defense is going to be a 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.280
 midfielder because we remember that it is 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.650
 midfielder and almost bear can culminate 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.380
 pretty tall who you love and pretty 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.500
 defense to be a central level 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.570
 of other dribbling passes and rhythms is 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.680
 Quite well guys do not disappoint so 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.920
 that makes it a great 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.740
 midfield player 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.310
 we have click here waylett 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.860
 and a lot much much rhythm some 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.270
 Pegate does not have a great defense either 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.680
 a big heads cough but good the 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.500
 Left device takes us well to 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.860
 get enough coins to meet 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.780
 next if course is not that it's very 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.240
 good but I love this 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.240
 player did not want to leave it behind 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.390
 my talk is constant supplemented 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:33.900
 has 70 71 80 74 of a principal 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.810
 supporter offensive center 176 pretty 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.840
 complemented and I love I would count 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.780
 eat with time to 100 sure we continue 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.580
 marko marin from chelsea as we see is 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.140
 better than the previous 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:53.260
 in this 70 and 80 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.290
 it's pretty good feel of rhythm 86 of 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.550
 71 of pace and 72 of pass reach us 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.820
 perfectly to have a midfielder 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.820
 offensive 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.520
 78 forward mirallas center of everton 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.050
 quite shot pretty rhythm and pretty 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.860
 Dodge to be a striker comes to us 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.930
 perfectly 800 coins 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.420
 these are from players we have 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.200
 seen they can cost around 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:24.940
 coins or less than a thousand per player 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.680
 then if they want they can others 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.720
 players later on I would recommend 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.730
 that you start to sign this 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.730
 substitute to make spare parts 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.460
 nobody silva that this already costs enough 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.940
 very good 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.319
 kolarov also and where to throw 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.529
 faults can use it too 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:49.880
 interior or natural creature break 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:51.580
 from weezer 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.620
 finished 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.319
 and well, it's not very fast against 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.160
 previous defense do you meet that 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:01.340
 it's the important thing 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.380
 the line and a player especially for 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.420
 discover the defensive deficiencies that 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.020
 has the team because look at defense 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.680
 it has 82 a pace is quite complete 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.570
 the worst that you have then kilos and they are 67 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.980
 I recommend a great player without hesitation in 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.380
 the best players to find in 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.580
 an Andrean team as substitute so that 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.330
 meet any part of the field 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.460
 he is practically a great player 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.850
 complemented 100% we go and we have a 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:32.420
 full player this estuary of this and 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:35.110
 finally the goalkeeper david de gea 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.400
 which is pretty good 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.880
 Features in stretched reflections 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.880
 without serves 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.180
 to 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.180
 but above all 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.990
 position and fired to be a cut 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.640
 of 80 is pretty good has a little 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.530
 with reflexes regarding the first goalkeeper 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.530
 we had but it's not bad 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:03.170
 good if you like videos 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.690
 if you like videos subscribe 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.310
 comment and I will try to do it too 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.710
 from these videos but from other lines 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.710
