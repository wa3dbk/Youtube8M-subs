drill press or a mill and you'll come
through<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.069> you'll<00:02:14.190> cut<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:16.019> bottom<00:02:16.440> of

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
through and you'll cut and the bottom of

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.900 
through and you'll cut and the bottom of
this<00:02:16.680> hole<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.640> flat<00:02:17.910> surface<00:02:18.450> needs<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.840> be

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
this hole the flat surface needs to be

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.520 
this hole the flat surface needs to be
right<00:02:20.910> level<00:02:21.390> with<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.660> front<00:02:21.930> leading<00:02:22.170> edge

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
right level with the front leading edge

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.979 
right level with the front leading edge
of<00:02:22.739> your<00:02:22.950> port<00:02:23.519> no<00:02:23.970> deeper<00:02:24.390> than<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.720> you

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
of your port no deeper than that you

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.289 
of your port no deeper than that you
could<00:02:25.260> hit<00:02:25.380> water<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.860> do<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> lot<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.220> these<00:02:26.370> so

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
could hit water to do a lot of these so

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.430 
could hit water to do a lot of these so
you're<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.600> trying<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.870> give<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.049> a<00:02:28.200> flat

you're just trying to give it a flat
surface<00:02:28.829> for<00:02:28.859> the<00:02:29.100> bolt<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.459> hit<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.239> it's

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
surface for the bolt to hit so that it's

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.050 
surface for the bolt to hit so that it's
very<00:02:31.140> good<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.650> have<00:02:31.799> it<00:02:32.220> level<00:02:32.880> with

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
very good that you have it level with

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.930 
very good that you have it level with
the<00:02:33.150> front<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.630> foot<00:02:34.579> okay<00:02:35.579> so<00:02:35.640> you've
