frustration<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.160> know<00:00:38.250> having<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.579> maybe

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
frustration that you know having a maybe

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.850 
frustration that you know having a maybe
a<00:00:38.910> bad<00:00:39.450> first<00:00:39.690> set<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.170> actually<00:00:40.320> sort<00:00:40.770> of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
a bad first set you can actually sort of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.170 
a bad first set you can actually sort of
take<00:00:41.010> some<00:00:41.160> positives<00:00:41.309> out<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.879> from<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
take some positives out of that from the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.340 
take some positives out of that from the
way<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.360> sort<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.629> responded<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.320> say

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
way you sort of responded in as you say

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.350 
way you sort of responded in as you say
after<00:00:43.920> missing<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:44.280> tree<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.579> guess<00:00:44.730> every

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
after missing one tree or I guess every

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.840 
after missing one tree or I guess every
step<00:00:45.600> fall<00:00:45.809> forward<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> bonus<00:00:47.100> absolutely

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
step fall forward is a bonus absolutely

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.430 
step fall forward is a bonus absolutely
and<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.090> mean<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.390> really<00:00:48.510> say<00:00:48.750> positive<00:00:49.260> this

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
and I mean I really say positive this

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.290 
and I mean I really say positive this
match<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.890> other<00:00:50.100> like<00:00:50.250> that's<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
match and other like that's a it's a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.020 
match and other like that's a it's a
good<00:00:51.449> performance<00:00:51.989> at<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.289> end<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:53.340> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
good performance at the end it it's a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.840 
good performance at the end it it's a
good<00:00:54.210> fight<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.840> good<00:00:55.020> mental<00:00:55.920> strength

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
good fight it's a good mental strength

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.389 
good fight it's a good mental strength
by<00:00:57.090> me<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.570> instead<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.680> know<00:00:58.710> looking

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
by me and instead of you know looking

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.799 
by me and instead of you know looking
too<00:00:59.730> much<00:00:59.879> at<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> negatives<00:01:00.510> well

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
too much at the negatives well

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.660 
too much at the negatives well
everything<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.410> didn't<00:01:01.649> work<00:01:01.800> out<00:01:02.039> today<00:01:02.280> or

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
everything that didn't work out today or

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.429 
everything that didn't work out today or
the<00:01:03.120> last<00:01:03.270> few<00:01:03.510> weeks<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.899> months<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.290> mean

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the last few weeks and months I mean

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.770 
the last few weeks and months I mean
there's<00:01:04.619> enough<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.820> anyway<00:01:06.510> maybe

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
there's enough of that anyway maybe

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.420 
there's enough of that anyway maybe
probably<00:01:07.049> said<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.470> written<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.280> me<00:01:08.400> I

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
probably said and written so for me I

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.010 
probably said and written so for me I
think<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.210> really<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.630> look<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
think I really have to look at the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.260 
think I really have to look at the
positives<00:01:10.439> right<00:01:10.650> now<00:01:10.830> because<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.310> am<00:01:11.460> healthy

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
positives right now because I am healthy

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.359 
positives right now because I am healthy
again<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.689> I've<00:01:13.409> been<00:01:13.530> able<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.950> win<00:01:14.100> against

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
again and I've been able to win against

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.830 
again and I've been able to win against
a<00:01:14.520> really<00:01:14.700> good<00:01:14.939> player<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.420> Tommy<00:01:15.630> Haas

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
a really good player like Tommy Haas

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.810 
a really good player like Tommy Haas
today<00:01:16.140> that's<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.830> positive<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.549> that's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
today that's it's positive so that's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.490 
today that's it's positive so that's
what<00:01:17.970> I'm<00:01:18.060> focusing<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.600> right<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.200> then

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500
