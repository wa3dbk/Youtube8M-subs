00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.319 
here I'm not sure why this happens I've
tried<00:01:34.020> facing<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.590> does<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:35.009> work<00:01:35.329> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
tried facing it and does not work the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.630 
tried facing it and does not work the
grass<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.540> turns<00:01:36.960> black<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.770> that's<00:01:38.549> an

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
grass just turns black but that's an

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.660 
grass just turns black but that's an
effect<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> city<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.270> all<00:01:39.360> says<00:01:39.659> okay<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.670> so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
effect the city it all says okay and so

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.460 
effect the city it all says okay and so
cut<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.000> go<00:01:42.119> try<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.360> finance<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.049> here<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:43.380> we

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
cut so go try and finance it here if we

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.090 
cut so go try and finance it here if we
can<00:01:44.570> maybe<00:01:45.570> nights<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:46.770> sure<00:01:46.860> how<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> get

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
can maybe nights I'm not sure how to get

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.530 
can maybe nights I'm not sure how to get
in<00:01:47.220> here<00:01:47.369> we'll<00:01:47.490> go<00:01:47.610> maybe<00:01:47.970> from<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.270> bottom

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
in here we'll go maybe from the bottom

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.060 
in here we'll go maybe from the bottom
over<00:01:48.630> here<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.409> see<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.649> there's<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.829> way<00:01:49.950> up

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
over here and see if there's a way up

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.510 
over here and see if there's a way up
inside

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
inside

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.090 
inside
I<00:01:50.790> guess<00:01:51.780> not<00:01:51.930> just<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.380> job<00:01:52.560> when<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.740> get<00:01:52.890> cool

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
I guess not just a job when I get cool

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.460 
I guess not just a job when I get cool
so<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.610> figured<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.420> 90%<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:55.020> these<00:01:55.140> buildings

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
so I figured like 90% of these buildings

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.100 
so I figured like 90% of these buildings
though<00:01:55.649> are<00:01:55.950> all<00:01:56.130> first<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.820> awesome<00:01:57.210> we

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
though are all first that is awesome we

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.539 
though are all first that is awesome we
go<00:01:58.259> over<00:01:58.500> over<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.860> spike<00:01:59.070> there<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
go over over like spike there this is a

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.300 
go over over like spike there this is a
very<00:01:59.790> huge<00:02:00.240> map<00:02:00.450> very<00:02:01.200> intensive<00:02:01.890> as<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.189> can

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
very huge map very intensive as you can

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.340 
very huge map very intensive as you can
see<00:02:02.520> we<00:02:03.210> got<00:02:03.329> some<00:02:03.390> lag<00:02:03.689> you're<00:02:03.960> going<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.320> oh

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
see we got some lag you're going on oh

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.010 
see we got some lag you're going on oh
my<00:02:04.590> gosh<00:02:04.890> okay<00:02:05.159> what<00:02:06.000> there<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.570> go<00:02:06.719> okay

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
my gosh okay what there we go okay

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.660 
my gosh okay what there we go okay
there's<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.290> major<00:02:07.590> lag<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.129> on<00:02:08.220> here<00:02:08.489> and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
there's a major lag going on here and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.080 
there's a major lag going on here and
but<00:02:09.569> he<00:02:09.629> has<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> pretty<00:02:09.929> intensive<00:02:10.500> map

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
but he has a pretty intensive map

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.580 
but he has a pretty intensive map
so<00:02:11.450> all<00:02:11.599> of<00:02:11.630> all<00:02:11.810> these<00:02:11.959> download<00:02:12.260> links<00:02:12.440> down

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
so all of all these download links down

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.339 
so all of all these download links down
below<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.640> definitely<00:02:13.819> would<00:02:14.090> suggest<00:02:14.349> not

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
below and I definitely would suggest not

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.720 
below and I definitely would suggest not
down<00:02:15.709> I'm<00:02:15.890> going<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.099> unless<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.580> have<00:02:16.700> a

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
down I'm going to unless you have a

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.790 
down I'm going to unless you have a
pretty<00:02:17.030> decent<00:02:17.239> device<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.930> can<00:02:18.349> handle<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.680> so

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
pretty decent device I can handle it so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.380 
pretty decent device I can handle it so
you<00:02:18.890> can<00:02:18.980> see<00:02:19.069> there's<00:02:19.250> also<00:02:19.370> going<00:02:20.150> from

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
you can see there's also going from

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.699 
you can see there's also going from
audience<00:02:20.660> buildings<00:02:20.959> connecting<00:02:21.590> them

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
audience buildings connecting them

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.589 
audience buildings connecting them
together<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:22.099> a<00:02:22.130> bunch<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.430> these<00:02:22.610> rails<00:02:22.880> which

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
together is a bunch of these rails which

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.210 
together is a bunch of these rails which
is<00:02:23.690> awesome<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:23.989> open<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.410> minecart<00:02:24.709> down<00:02:24.950> and

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
is awesome and open a minecart down and

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.640 
is awesome and open a minecart down and
go<00:02:25.370> zip<00:02:26.270> through<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.510> city<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.020> it's<00:02:27.470> really

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
go zip through the city and it's really

city<00:02:51.560> there's<00:02:51.860> awesome<00:02:52.280> guys<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:53.420> is

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
city there's awesome guys and that is

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.660 
city there's awesome guys and that is
huge<00:02:53.989> ninety<00:02:54.709> percent<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.130> these<00:02:55.220> buildings<00:02:55.610> I

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
huge ninety percent of these buildings I

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.220 
huge ninety percent of these buildings I
think<00:02:55.700> are<00:02:55.940> also<00:02:56.269> like<00:02:56.420> cut<00:02:56.630> off<00:02:56.660> like<00:02:57.110> they're

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
think are also like cut off like they're

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.539 
think are also like cut off like they're
not<00:02:57.290> even<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.950> whole<00:02:58.130> height<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:58.459> they

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
not even the whole height that they

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.570 
not even the whole height that they
could<00:02:58.760> be<00:02:58.940> because<00:02:59.720> of<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.110> height<00:03:00.650> limit<00:03:00.920> but

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
could be because of the height limit but

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.520 
could be because of the height limit but
it's<00:03:02.510> still<00:03:02.690> very<00:03:02.750> cool<00:03:03.170> there's<00:03:03.349> all<00:03:03.440> these

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
it's still very cool there's all these

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.660 
it's still very cool there's all these
