00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.189
 good in this case what we wanted 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:08.130
 teaching you is a small example of how 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:10.589
 We can work with berries coming 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.950
 of different documentation systems 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:16.860
 either laser scanning or photogrammetry 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.890
 digital and how we can then export 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.820
 this this information in different 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.380
 formats that we can later open in 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.630
 3d infographic applications type 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.130
 blender this is an example of a 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.619
 project that we are carrying out he 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.860
 Documentation is not finished yet 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.790
 of a cave in which we have found 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.430
 we are digging and in which we have 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.410
 found inhumations remains of 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.960
 innovations and also paintings 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.730
 cave paintings in schematic style is in 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.490
 the province of alicante and we have already 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.760
 documented a large part of the cave 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.350
 although not yet complete 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.660
 what you are seeing more or less in 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.210
 plant is the area in which a great 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.820
 room where we find paintings 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.220
 rock 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.900
 I'm going to a little bit to get inside so 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.750
 we can see 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.510
 especially the geometry of the cave 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.090
 because what interests me is that too 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.780
 you see is how through techniques of 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.740
 digital photogrammetry we can document 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.510
 geometries that we can consider 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.030
 quite complex because the truth is 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.380
 that not Cuba is always one of the 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.270
 more complex examples with which you 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.820
 you can find when commenting 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.170
 patrimony and good although I here I am 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.730
 trying to make us see a little 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.920
 textures the quality the textures that 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.180
 can you really get as soon as 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.310
 I have to compress the video to 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.950
 send it I do not know if you prefer it but in 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.720
 order the quality is quite good and as 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.280
 You see, we can document 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.619
 correctly the entire cave including 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.380
 then the small ones, the areas where 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.500
 there are greater depressions irregularities 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.800
 a more complex relief in order any 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.750
 kind of 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.280
 and obstacle in that sense can be 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.350
 solve either by photogrammetry 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.540
 digitally or by scanner you will have given 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.000
 account while lowering and orienting the 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.440
 cave that model 13 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.220
 that this area here where I am 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.990
 placing the cursor does not have the same 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.260
 continuity or the same quality as the 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.750
 more inside area like some of 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.200
 you will suppose in reality this 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.640
 part 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.739
 is open because it looks at a 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.470
 precipice and what happens then the problem 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.480
 we have, I'll see if I put a 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.769
 photo so you can see what the view is 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.690
 from inside the cave and os 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.080
 give an idea of ​​what is the fall that 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.720
 we have but logically with this with 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.370
 is with this kind of problems, 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.140
 we can take pictures of this area 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.140
 correctly and therefore the problem is 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.209
 that on the threshold of the cave we have 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.950
 these geometry faults on the one hand or 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.370
 good mistakes in the meshes like this 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.370
 type d 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.599
 colors obtaining false colors 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.150
 mayas deformed in short a result that 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.620
 is not the right this logically like 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.959
 I tell you it 's a work in progress and what 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.750
 we're going to do to get the 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.340
 photographs of this area is to use what 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.040
 which is usually called by the acronym 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.840
 in English of a bird that is a vehicle not 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.159
 manned in this case a helicopter 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.159
 that comes equipped with 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.670
 gps receiver that allows us to mark the 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.680
 route by which the helicopter goes to 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.359
 move and take data because also 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.810
 is equipped with a camera 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:40.299
 and it allows us to take data in this case 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.459
 photographs or videos of the area that 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.480
 we want to document once we finish 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.069
 those those photos we integrate them to 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.790
 same bank of photographs that we have 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.260
 used to document the interior and 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.200
 in this way we will finish the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.540
 helicopter cave and work method 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.329
 that you will also have to see 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.459
 throughout the course because then we have 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.380
 the luck of having this with this 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.090
 apparatus with a helicopter 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.180
 that we use for jobs 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.430
 aerial cartography and photogrammetry not 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.010
 they solve a lot of problems because 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.530
 imagine time 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.540
 document therefore the upper part of a 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.680
 building of a church of a castle or 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.639
 in this case the problem we have with 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.690
 some areas of this cave that 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.220
 they look out over a cliff and 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.650
 then once we have the model 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.360
 undertake we can continue working 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.000
 we can do a lot of things in this 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.430
 good case when we incorporate it 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.979
 in the virtual tour we can do 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.770
 many effects simply by pointing 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.620
 is one of them because this is the camera 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.560
 what the user would see 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.790
 when I was doing the tour 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.889
 virtual 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.650
 now we have a light are a sound light 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.100
 light a light today is not punctual is a light 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.510
 that emits 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.230
 and energy emits light so 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.850
 omnidirectional in all directions 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.420
 and that's why we get an illumination 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.790
 global let's say 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.590
 and homogeneous if we change this 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.729
 lighting to spot lighting 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.040
 what we will have is 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.590
 this type of effects 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.070
 that will allow us 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.070
 well 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.910
 that the user feels as if 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.289
 I was entering with a frontal 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.800
 with 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:32.960
 with a torch with a torch and 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.930
 different effects that can be very 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.330
 useful and that especially since at the time 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.430
 to think about the didactics of or in the 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.210
 interest that we want we want to give you 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.830
 to the users because it allows us to attract 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.689
 a little more your attention in a way a 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.030
 little more didactic simply by 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:50.920
 put yourself 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.630
 one of the many examples of things that 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.610
 we can do in the program is kind 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.590
 blender and that as you can see with a 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.680
 equipment not too powerful as is the 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.170
 mine, you can calculate in real time 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.440
 is to preview the time in time 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.440
 real
