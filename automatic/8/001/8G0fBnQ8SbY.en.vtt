classic example of over rotation it's
done<00:00:44.570> because<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> couple<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.170> factors

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
club stuck out this side of them now the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.060 
club stuck out this side of them now the
reason<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.570> are<00:01:27.720> allowing<00:01:28.140> yourself<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.710> turn

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
reason you are allowing yourself to turn

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.640 
reason you are allowing yourself to turn
so<00:01:29.369> far<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.939> because<00:01:30.150> your<00:01:30.570> hips<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.259> don't

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
so far is because your hips just don't

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.340 
so far is because your hips just don't
stop<00:01:31.979> moving<00:01:32.340> you've<00:01:32.520> got<00:01:32.670> no<00:01:33.170> resistance<00:01:34.170> in

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
stop moving you've got no resistance in

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.649 
stop moving you've got no resistance in
your<00:01:34.530> lower<00:01:34.650> half<00:01:34.740> that's<00:01:35.220> turning<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.180> then

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
your lower half that's turning and then

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.719 
your lower half that's turning and then
that<00:01:36.810> allows<00:01:37.110> your<00:01:37.380> upper<00:01:37.680> body<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.100> turn<00:01:38.400> so

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that allows your upper body to turn so

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.810 
that allows your upper body to turn so
you<00:01:38.790> putting<00:01:39.240> say<00:01:39.960> 60<00:01:40.740> degree<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.159> hip<00:01:41.340> turn<00:01:41.579> in

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
you putting say 60 degree of hip turn in

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.429 
you putting say 60 degree of hip turn in
there<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.119> allowing<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.570> get<00:01:42.750> well<00:01:43.170> over

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
there it's allowing you to get well over

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.929 
there it's allowing you to get well over
ninety<00:01:43.470> degree<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.100> shoulder<00:01:44.549> turn<00:01:44.729> which

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
ninety degree of shoulder turn which

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.819 
ninety degree of shoulder turn which
then<00:01:45.149> allows<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.170> wrap<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.649> club

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
then allows you just to wrap the club

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.700 
then allows you just to wrap the club
around<00:01:47.100> your<00:01:47.340> head<00:01:47.869> keep<00:01:48.869> them<00:01:49.079> mobility

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
around your head keep them mobility

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.039 
around your head keep them mobility
mobility<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.549> great<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.240> you've<00:01:51.420> got<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.720> have

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
mobility is great but you've got to have

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.870 
mobility is great but you've got to have
some<00:01:52.380> stability<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.310> throwing<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> but

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
some stability we like throwing the but

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.300 
some stability we like throwing the but
we<00:01:53.970> can't<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.299> spin<00:01:54.990> round<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:55.649> spin

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
we can't just spin round and then spin

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.709 
we can't just spin round and then spin
round<00:01:56.520> what<00:01:56.880> you're<00:01:57.000> doing<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.509> create

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
round what you're doing is you create

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.679 
round what you're doing is you create
your<00:01:57.840> mobility<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.799> turning<00:01:59.219> which<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.390> good

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
your mobility so turning which is good

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.289 
your mobility so turning which is good
while<00:02:01.439> creating<00:02:01.829> resistance<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.610> turn<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.060> fine

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
while creating resistance a turn is fine

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.789 
while creating resistance a turn is fine
but<00:02:03.509> you've<00:02:03.630> got<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.110> some<00:02:04.290> resistance

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
but you've got to have some resistance

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.590 
but you've got to have some resistance
get<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.670> resistance<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.240> your<00:02:06.390> lower<00:02:06.509> half

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
get that resistance in your lower half

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.839 
get that resistance in your lower half

relatively<00:02:10.860> still<00:02:11.069> much<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.520> learn<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.790> would

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
relatively still much to learn you would

relatively still much to learn you would
ever<00:02:12.780> believe<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:13.319> even<00:02:13.560> though

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
ever believe so even though

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.930 
ever believe so even though
you<00:02:13.920> practice<00:02:14.190> wings<00:02:14.370> where<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.610> turn<00:02:14.790> your

your<00:02:16.980> knees<00:02:17.040> at<00:02:17.190> all<00:02:18.320> then<00:02:19.320> move<00:02:19.560> your<00:02:19.590> knees

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
your knees at all then move your knees

your knees at all then move your knees
on<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.190> downswing<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.660> back<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.900> keep<00:02:22.260> your

knees out of it down swing get your

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.790 
knees out of it down swing get your
knees<00:02:24.030> involved<00:02:24.480> you're<00:02:25.290> looking<00:02:25.590> for<00:02:25.680> your

knees involved you're looking for your

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.100 
knees involved you're looking for your
hip<00:02:25.950> turn<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.520> around<00:02:26.820> 30<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.720> 40<00:02:28.080> degrees

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
hip turn to be around 30 to 40 degrees

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
hip turn to be around 30 to 40 degrees
that's<00:02:28.680> not<00:02:29.040> much<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.580> much<00:02:30.030> smaller<00:02:30.420> than

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
that's not much it's much smaller than

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.800 
that's not much it's much smaller than

half<00:02:40.080> turn<00:02:40.350> me<00:02:40.500> up<00:02:40.590> half<00:02:40.830> strikes<00:02:41.550> you'll

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
half turn me up half strikes you'll

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.490 
half turn me up half strikes you'll
improve<00:02:41.940> your<00:02:42.150> direction<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.660> proof<00:02:42.870> think

improve your direction of proof think

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.310 
improve your direction of proof think
about<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.220> way<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.459> turn<00:02:44.730> your<00:02:44.910> body<00:02:45.320> will

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
about it the way you turn your body will

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.170 
about it the way you turn your body will
dictate<00:02:46.650> your<00:02:47.130> club<00:02:47.430> path<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.970> obviously

dictate your club path and obviously

dictate your club path and obviously
club<00:02:48.390> past<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.780> takes<00:02:49.020> where<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.350> ball<00:02:49.530> goes

if you over rotate your hips on the
backswing<00:02:52.709> good<00:02:52.920> chance<00:02:53.160> should<00:02:53.280> be<00:02:53.370> getting

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
backswing good chance should be getting

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.490 
backswing good chance should be getting
quite<00:02:53.670> rounded<00:02:54.180> with<00:02:54.300> your<00:02:54.420> backswing<00:02:54.810> that

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
quite rounded with your backswing that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.350 
quite rounded with your backswing that
encourages<00:02:55.950> an<00:02:56.070> over-the-top<00:02:56.459> action<00:02:56.940> or

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
encourages an over-the-top action or

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.150 
encourages an over-the-top action or
just<00:02:57.660> an<00:02:57.780> almighty<00:02:58.080> block<00:02:58.470> from<00:02:58.680> an<00:02:58.800> inside

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
just an almighty block from an inside

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.520 
just an almighty block from an inside
approach<00:02:59.520> so<00:02:59.850> look<00:03:00.630> get<00:03:00.870> some<00:03:01.050> resistance<00:03:01.410> on

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
approach so look get some resistance on

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.990 
approach so look get some resistance on
the<00:03:01.560> downswing<00:03:01.920> keep<00:03:02.250> tuning<00:03:02.430> shoulders<00:03:02.790> get

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
the downswing keep tuning shoulders get

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.810 
the downswing keep tuning shoulders get
the<00:03:03.090> legs<00:03:03.480> calming<00:03:03.930> down<00:03:04.080> then<00:03:04.739> use<00:03:05.130> your<00:03:05.160> legs

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
the legs calming down then use your legs
