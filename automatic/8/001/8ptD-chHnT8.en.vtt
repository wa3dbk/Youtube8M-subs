00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.840
 very good all guys how are you and 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.200
 well we are here in a video of classes 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.200
 plans 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.379
 to make an internet village design 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.490
 level 6 as the farming mode says 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.010
 OK 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.010
 in town hall way out even though ya 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.210
 I say that with those villages there is a bit of 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.070
 walter town halls by the end and the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.520
 I think that if they want we can 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.529
 attack in those can attack and the 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.570
 whole good so good we're going to 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.019
 start with something good start with something 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.630
 simple to typical google and putting 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:43.750
 clan castle worth 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:47.200
 and antiaircraft there is worth 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.440
 and the truth is that also good has 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.510
 liked 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.399
 you are going to see a little bit for the design 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.839
 when I finish it, but I'm not very 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.430
 supporter of leaving defenses out of the 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.079
 wall but good in that town hall 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.089
 neither can it be much more because 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.200
 there's no such wall is worth then 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:08.659
 good antiaircraft covers the entire village almost 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.479
 It covers the entire village, it has been the 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.990
 Great covers the whole village mortars cover 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.810
 the whole village and simple is worth much more 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:22.840
 then cover the rest we cover the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.840
 mortars here with equal with the 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.090
 with the wall having stop the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.179
 mortars and the thing is changing so 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.219
 let's go putting now what they come 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:37.390
 being the warehouses are worth we change 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:40.649
 gold and elixir store we're leaving 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.649
 asserting 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.390
 do not go to see you 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.650
 the law and store of gold and choose 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.800
 equally on the other hand 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.060
 OK 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.180
 tower of magicians as is custom and more or 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.010
 less like the milk as you see we have 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.659
 boiler pretty well covered 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.479
 let's start pulling this out here 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.509
 I have to spare to make a 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.509
 idea 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.180
 125 pieces of the wall that have to 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.180
 To spare, then, as you can see, we have 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.389
 more or less so to speak a little 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.219
 I'm going to predesigned the leas do not either 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:30.590
 much larger is a design mode 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:33.769
 rhombuses that will not be much more 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.510
 ok we have cannon out there towers of 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.540
 archers here and now in reverse 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.780
 we put archer towers and canyon over here 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.780
 OK 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.150
 and we have this we closed the compartment 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.150
 of all of them 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.590
 worth one 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.770
 I'm here 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.319
 and you know what he's playing now 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.519
 excellence in this village design will 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:10.879
 knock good here and wall over there and 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.810
 a wall over here because the nature and 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.810
 good for there is worth 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.690
 There is a wall missing but more or less 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.540
 I think it's the right thing we have 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.220
 everything all well put to a wall of 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.950
 this that I have not done well we have not 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.990
 uploaded but good now I'll look at it and 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.550
 it's okay now we have two defenses left 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.440
 and it's a canyon over here 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.760
 and all the stubbornness here that's what 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.760
 I say it was going to stay out 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.000
 it's a shame but that's the way I do not like it 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.069
 nothing to have this to leave it like this 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.230
 because I'm not surprised by the 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.629
 defense outside is one thing for me that is 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.819
 very vulnerable and I do not like anything 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.580
 so well we put this here 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.090
 we put this over there 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.090
 Y 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.860
 and if it is not now it is already clear that 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.630
 they had gauguin the ipad 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.320
 Baleària is the only thing to finish 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.590
 put all the issues of these sections 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.590
 to put 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.600
 move away 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.170
 the issue of office as I always say 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.170
 you already know 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.720
 what you have is worth 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:28.410
 so that we go back to 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.140
 this mine here another collector for 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.280
 here but leave me then for the traps 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:37.260
 I 'm looking good for me to stay 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.470
 perfectly the theme of the holes for 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.330
 the traps are worth 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:48.330
 I need a camp that goes there 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.300
 and we are going to put the two 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.689
 simple builder the bag for and 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.689
 OK 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.940
 this over here 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.560
 more or less is symmetrical 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.320
 it's worth this here we have nothing left 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.970
 to hang the first endorsement to choose what 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:18.300
 which are or not of each interleaved 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.300
 also around here 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.830
 another there 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:28.620
 and we need another little thing mans vale and we 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.629
 missing this is ok we have more or less 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.809
 the design village we are missing therefore the typical 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:36.419
 for putting the town hall and that if not 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:38.820
 bad we go and the trampitas is worth you 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.100
 I have removed all the 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.700
 all flags and everything we stop by 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.810
 here you can go rolling everything that is the 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.000
 laboratory to the city ​​hall 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.230
 flags and flowers milestones and everything goes 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.480
 I leave the strata for you to know 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.910
 besides a society is unity and we go 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.500
 to put the traps is worth putting 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:02.130
 Traps jump over here and pump around here 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.360
 You are waiting here on the wall 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:08.040
 here so much and you know already you globito 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.430
 spark though you're going to see now when 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.770
 press the press this when we go 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.470
 to be going to be the whole bazaar 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.910
 covered almost the whole village as you see 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.729
 shows that if everything covered so 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:26.500
 neither do I need to believe that 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:31.840
 but good on this side we put the same 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:34.620
 bomb-trap of saint and flying 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.100
 come the same 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.250
 so we have it already we have the 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.770
 script and being the village design of 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:48.470
 this village as I told you 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:52.370
 125 126 so you can put a wall 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:56.960
 here if you want and stable so I hope 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:07:01.240
 be liked that you do not vote and then nothing 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.240
 in the next video guys work
