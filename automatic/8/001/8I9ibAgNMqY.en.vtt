00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.490
 the meeting this Friday for the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.080
 night between monarchs morelia and saints 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.240
 can be seen as a very offensive match 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.710
 between both squads we know the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.389
 potential to attack that has the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.009
 lagoon set while the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.020
 technician of monarcas morelia ángel david 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.180
 Comizzo has declared that he will attack his 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.940
 visitor does not conceive another way of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.470
 see football if I do not understand another 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.779
 way of playing football other than the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.320
 attack I do not understand 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.360
 I would regret what 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.430
 I've always played it that way 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.250
 of game is an identity that I 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.630
 characterize 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.490
 and us where we go 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.880
 surely we are always going to play against 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.760
 forward that does not change anything to me not 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.780
 the rival modifies the court 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.469
 moody's and canada always better like this 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.690
 we have to have this much vertigo in 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.190
 half of court and mainly be very 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.160
 vertical 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.789
 the idea of ​​trying and trying to be 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.890
 Vertical tomorrow once 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.900
 let's capture the ball because it's a team 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.729
 that press well if the team has 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.049
 a lot of dynamics I tell you half of 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.960
 court forwards is a very team 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.440
 dangerous very dangerous we have been 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.259
 looking quite at the rival and we believe that 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.729
 we can do damage to some area 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.799
 about his next rival lagoon saints 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.479
 the Argentine strategist defined him as 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.130
 a dangerous team in the middle of the field 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.560
 forward and defined this 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.479
 encounter as key but not defining 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.750
 in their aspirations to get to the 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:36.280
 Liguilla is a difficult opponent 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.020
 that has very good players 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.420
 especially half court for 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.250
 forward which are very dynamic 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.780
 very fast has a lot of variant and 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.060
 we're going to have to have us a lot 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.310
 watch out 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.409
 of trying not to commit any kind of 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.310
 error because we can get to pay 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.990
 expensive 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.030
 well in a very important game 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.090
 I would say 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.039
 key 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.259
 for what we intend 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.420
 It is not definitive but it is too 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.090
 important is an anticipated end in the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.190
 that we 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.709
 the team has focused on playing 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.200
 each game as if it were a final like this 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.700
 the team is going to play with both 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.680
 consecutive victories of monarchs 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.330
 morelia and with a santos lagoon that is 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.769
 become one of the most 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.200
 regular of this campaign 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.360
 these dressings make predict a good 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.940
 entrance tomorrow night at 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.519
 the stadium morelos stadium from the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.790
