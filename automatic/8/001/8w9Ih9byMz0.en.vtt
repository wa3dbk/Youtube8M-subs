team vcm she's had is building a
complete<00:00:43.670> car<00:00:43.910> and<00:00:44.180> that's<00:00:45.170> what<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:45.680> effort

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
complete car and that's what the effort

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.440 
complete car and that's what the effort
starts<00:00:46.340> as<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:46.670> you've<00:00:46.760> just<00:00:46.790> improved<00:00:47.270> on

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
starts as and you've just improved on

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.780

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
relationship that we created with shelf

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.260 
relationship that we created with shelf
autosport<00:01:00.710> happened<00:01:01.700> at<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:01.880> exact<00:01:02.120> same

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
autosport happened at the exact same

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.420

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
still the basis of the team today

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.240

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.140 
behave of course there's tons of room
for<00:02:00.750> improvement<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.460> really<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> perfect

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
for improvement but really a perfect

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.690 
for improvement but really a perfect
platform<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:04.110> start<00:02:04.440> on<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:05.280> really

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
platform to start on it's really

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.890 
platform to start on it's really
difficult<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.090> forecast<00:02:06.300> how<00:02:06.570> we're<00:02:06.750> going<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
difficult to forecast how we're going to

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.580 
difficult to forecast how we're going to
do<00:02:07.820> top<00:02:08.820> tuner<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.570> has<00:02:09.750> an<00:02:09.929> advantage<00:02:10.230> in

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
do top tuner really has an advantage in

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.740 
do top tuner really has an advantage in
the<00:02:11.070> show<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.760> shine<00:02:11.970> think<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.570> that's

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
the show and shine think that that's

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.450 
the show and shine think that that's
where<00:02:13.020> their<00:02:13.290> knowledge<00:02:13.680> base<00:02:13.860> comes<00:02:14.190> from

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
where their knowledge base comes from

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.100 
where their knowledge base comes from
and<00:02:14.700> then<00:02:14.910> looking<00:02:15.210> forward<00:02:15.270> we've<00:02:15.870> got<00:02:16.020> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and then looking forward we've got the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.840 
and then looking forward we've got the
CSCS<00:02:16.650> challenge<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.190> media<00:02:17.400> challenge<00:02:17.700> I

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
CSCS challenge the media challenge I

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.120 
CSCS challenge the media challenge I
think<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.870> media<00:02:19.080> challenge<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.710> think<00:02:19.740> if<00:02:20.010> we

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
think the media challenge I think if we

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.010 
think the media challenge I think if we
can<00:02:20.310> bring<00:02:20.520> someone<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.180> board<00:02:21.450> with<00:02:21.750> how<00:02:21.960> we

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
can bring someone on board with how we

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.840 
can bring someone on board with how we
feel<00:02:22.590> about<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:23.040> car<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.370> how<00:02:23.520> we<00:02:23.580> feel<00:02:23.820> about

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
feel about the car and how we feel about

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.330 
feel about the car and how we feel about
the<00:02:24.330> motorsports<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.140> what<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.040> feel<00:02:26.310> is

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
the motorsports and what we feel is

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.640 
the motorsports and what we feel is
important<00:02:27.000> they<00:02:27.450> might<00:02:27.780> understand<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.470> car

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
important they might understand the car

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.130 
important they might understand the car
