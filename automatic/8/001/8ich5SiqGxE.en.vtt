00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
each of the four different chips next I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.650 
each of the four different chips next I
take<00:01:37.230> the<00:01:37.290> tips<00:01:37.650> these<00:01:38.400> are<00:01:38.670> already<00:01:39.030> cut<00:01:39.480> to

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
take the tips these are already cut to

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.140 
take the tips these are already cut to
four<00:01:39.870> centimeters<00:01:40.230> in<00:01:40.620> length<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.910> first

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
four centimeters in length so the first

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.230 
four centimeters in length so the first
one<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.630> placed<00:01:43.050> by<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:44.010> will<00:01:44.910> measure

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
one are just placed by a I will measure

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.150 
one are just placed by a I will measure
it<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.480> to<00:01:45.780> make<00:01:45.960> sure<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.380> cut<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:46.830> it<00:01:47.010> if

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
it just to make sure and cut it if it if

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.970 
it just to make sure and cut it if it if
appropriate<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:48.000> take<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> second<00:01:49.470> one<00:01:49.590> which

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
appropriate I take the second one which

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.660 
appropriate I take the second one which
is<00:01:50.780> again<00:01:51.780> measured<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.460> in

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
is again measured you see that it is in

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.490 
is again measured you see that it is in
fact<00:01:53.880> four<00:01:54.180> centimeters<00:01:54.780> long<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.230> we<00:01:55.350> need

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
fact four centimeters long but we need

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.160 
fact four centimeters long but we need
to<00:01:55.590> cut<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.070> half<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.670> B<00:01:56.910> so<00:01:57.870> we<00:01:57.960> measure

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to cut this in half for B so we measure

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.970 
to cut this in half for B so we measure
two<00:01:58.440> centimeters<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.450> recut<00:02:03.620> put<00:02:04.620> that<00:02:04.770> next

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
two centimeters and recut put that next

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.430 
two centimeters and recut put that next
to<00:02:05.100> B<00:02:05.370> and<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:06.210> work<00:02:06.390> on<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.780> next<00:02:06.990> piece<00:02:07.290> of

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
to B and then work on that next piece of

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.110 
to B and then work on that next piece of
chip<00:02:07.650> to<00:02:08.310> produce<00:02:09.030> C<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.510> D<00:02:10.580> now<00:02:11.580> place<00:02:11.880> these

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
chip to produce C and D now place these

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.850 
chip to produce C and D now place these
back<00:02:12.360> into<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.750> Betty<00:02:13.020> dish<00:02:13.260> while<00:02:13.470> we<00:02:13.590> start

we take chit a out of the petri dish

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.009 
we take chit a out of the petri dish
pick<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.489> up<00:02:53.580> with<00:02:53.730> our<00:02:53.819> forceps<00:02:54.330> drop<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.900> into

pick it up with our forceps drop it into

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.720 
pick it up with our forceps drop it into
the<00:02:55.170> hydrogen<00:02:55.500> peroxide<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:56.220> start<00:02:56.549> the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
the hydrogen peroxide and start the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.750 
the hydrogen peroxide and start the
stopwatch<00:02:57.890> you<00:02:58.890> can<00:02:59.069> see<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> hydrogen

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
stopwatch you can see the hydrogen

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.789 
stopwatch you can see the hydrogen
peroxide<00:02:59.909> been<00:03:00.450> broken<00:03:00.840> down<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.230> water<00:03:01.500> and

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
peroxide been broken down to water and

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:02.899 
peroxide been broken down to water and
oxygen<00:03:02.010> bubbles

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
oxygen bubbles

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.720

this<00:03:03.150> causes<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.720> chip<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.200> rise<00:03:04.379> we<00:03:05.129> stop<00:03:05.459> the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
this causes the chip to rise we stop the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.940 
this causes the chip to rise we stop the
stopwatch<00:03:06.000> when<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.480> hits<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:06.780> top<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.680> we

stopwatch when it hits the top and we

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.110 
stopwatch when it hits the top and we
record<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.910> time<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.510> time<00:03:09.750> taken<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.319> 24

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
record the time the time taken is 24

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.500 
record the time the time taken is 24
seconds<00:03:13.340> now<00:03:14.340> we<00:03:14.370> repeat<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.940> process<00:03:14.970> that

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
seconds now we repeat the process that

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.069 
seconds now we repeat the process that
should<00:03:15.660> be<00:03:15.870> drop<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.590> start<00:03:17.310> stopwatch

see<00:03:26.819> we<00:03:27.060> drop<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.420> in<00:03:27.599> we<00:03:28.170> can<00:03:28.379> see<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.620> bubbling

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
see we drop it in we can see it bubbling

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.130 
see we drop it in we can see it bubbling
it's<00:03:29.700> bouncing<00:03:30.209> around<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.540> bottom<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:30.900> if

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
it's bouncing around the bottom so if

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.569 
it's bouncing around the bottom so if
bubbles<00:03:31.560> are<00:03:31.650> being<00:03:31.829> knocked<00:03:32.040> off<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.430> it's

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
bubbles are being knocked off so it's

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.369 
bubbles are being knocked off so it's
not<00:03:32.700> necessarily<00:03:33.299> rising<00:03:33.780> as<00:03:33.900> fast<00:03:33.930> as<00:03:34.260> we

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
not necessarily rising as fast as we

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.610 
not necessarily rising as fast as we
would<00:03:34.530> think<00:03:35.359> eventually<00:03:36.359> it<00:03:36.450> rises<00:03:36.930> we

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
would think eventually it rises we

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.289 
would think eventually it rises we

moon calculates to 6.75 we stick to the

moon calculates to 6.75 we stick to the
same<00:06:00.300> format<00:06:00.780> and<00:06:00.930> so<00:06:01.470> our<00:06:01.560> mean<00:06:01.770> is<00:06:01.800> written

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
same format and so our mean is written

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.140
