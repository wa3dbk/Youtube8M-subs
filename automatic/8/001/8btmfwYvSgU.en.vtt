00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hey everyone it's me so I am sitting out

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.490 
hey everyone it's me so I am sitting out
in<00:00:04.049> in<00:00:04.589> front<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.100> garage<00:00:05.279> in<00:00:05.640> my<00:00:05.819> dad's<00:00:06.500> VW

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
in in front of the garage in my dad's VW

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.600 
in in front of the garage in my dad's VW
year<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.189> an<00:00:08.340> MV<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:10.590> am<00:00:10.950> trying<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.429> put

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
year of an MV and I am trying to put

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.299 
year of an MV and I am trying to put
this<00:00:11.969> CD<00:00:12.660> changer<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.980> like<00:00:14.160> an

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
this CD changer in it's like an

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.950 
this CD changer in it's like an
accessory<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.880> can<00:00:14.910> put<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.330> alongside

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
accessory you can put on alongside

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.689 
accessory you can put on alongside
everything<00:00:16.500> else<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.949> car<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.400> you'd<00:00:17.520> have

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
everything else in the car so you'd have

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.670 
everything else in the car so you'd have
the<00:00:17.820> normal<00:00:18.150> stereo<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:19.260> way<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.500> thing

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the normal stereo the way this thing

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.800 
the normal stereo the way this thing
works<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.250> has<00:00:20.279> an<00:00:20.550> FM<00:00:20.820> modulator<00:00:21.359> that

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.910 

that<00:00:25.789> reroutes<00:00:26.789> things<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:28.199> these<00:00:28.769> two

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
that reroutes things so you these two

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.310 
that reroutes things so you these two
cables<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.460> connect<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.240> antenna<00:00:30.539> one

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
cables here connect to the antenna one

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
cables here connect to the antenna one
goes<00:00:31.529> from<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> antenna<00:00:32.430> that's<00:00:32.640> outside<00:00:33.000> of

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
goes from the antenna that's outside of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.850 
goes from the antenna that's outside of
the<00:00:33.149> car<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.989> reroutes<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.469> through<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.649> box

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
the car it reroutes it through the box

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.010 
the car it reroutes it through the box
and<00:00:35.010> then<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:35.880> goes<00:00:36.030> back<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.540> standard

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
and then one goes back to the standard

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.860 
and then one goes back to the standard
stereo<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.620> already<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:38.149> so<00:00:39.149> one<00:00:39.780> of

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
stereo that you already have so one of

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.930 
stereo that you already have so one of
these<00:00:39.989> goes<00:00:40.290> from<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> antenna<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
these goes from the antenna one of the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.280 
these goes from the antenna one of the
other<00:00:42.059> ones<00:00:42.210> I'm<00:00:42.480> not<00:00:42.510> sure<00:00:42.750> which<00:00:42.899> other<00:00:43.079> one

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
other ones I'm not sure which other one

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.779 
other ones I'm not sure which other one
goes<00:00:43.559> into<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> car<00:00:45.559> so<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.100> also<00:00:47.340> these<00:00:47.489> get

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
goes into the car so and also these get

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.600 
goes into the car so and also these get
12<00:00:48.120> volts<00:00:48.420> power<00:00:48.780> which<00:00:49.440> which<00:00:49.890> operates<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
12 volts power which which operates the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.850 
12 volts power which which operates the
device<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> ground<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
device and this is a ground so the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.520 
device and this is a ground so the
problem<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.690> well<00:00:57.690> there<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> few<00:00:58.109> problems

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
problem is well there are a few problems

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.160 
problem is well there are a few problems
this<00:00:59.489> wants<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> accessory<00:01:00.539> voltage<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.109> you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
this wants the accessory voltage so you

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.810 
this wants the accessory voltage so you
know<00:01:01.410> when<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> turn<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> key<00:01:02.010> partially<00:01:02.550> it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
know when you turn the key partially it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.520 
know when you turn the key partially it
turns<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.719> part<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> car<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.409> can

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
turns on part of the car like you can

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.910 
turns on part of the car like you can
open<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.830> close<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> windows<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.400> stuff<00:01:06.920> I'm

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
open and close the windows and stuff I'm

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.990 
open and close the windows and stuff I'm
not<00:01:08.159> sure<00:01:08.280> how<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.400> get<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.670> that

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.840 

I'm<00:01:18.100> assuming<00:01:19.100> that<00:01:19.399> it's<00:01:19.609> gonna<00:01:19.700> be

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
I'm assuming that it's gonna be

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.910 
I'm assuming that it's gonna be
somewhere<00:01:20.240> in<00:01:20.420> here<00:01:20.750> or<00:01:20.990> behind<00:01:21.350> this<00:01:21.560> this<00:01:21.799> is

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
somewhere in here or behind this this is

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.560 
somewhere in here or behind this this is
the<00:01:22.009> fuse<00:01:22.280> box<00:01:22.490> normally<00:01:23.270> there<00:01:23.390> would<00:01:23.450> be<00:01:23.509> a

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
the fuse box normally there would be a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.209 
the fuse box normally there would be a
plastic<00:01:24.020> cover<00:01:24.170> here<00:01:24.259> but<00:01:24.500> my<00:01:24.590> dad<00:01:24.740> removed<00:01:25.130> it

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
plastic cover here but my dad removed it

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:30.580 
plastic cover here but my dad removed it
a<00:01:25.250> few<00:01:25.429> years<00:01:25.460> ago<00:01:27.039> let<00:01:28.039> me<00:01:28.130> show<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:29.380> I'm<00:01:30.380> not

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
a few years ago let me show you I'm not

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.789 
a few years ago let me show you I'm not
either<00:01:30.799> I'm<00:01:31.219> also<00:01:31.990> not<00:01:32.990> quite<00:01:33.170> sure<00:01:33.259> how<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.619> get

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
either I'm also not quite sure how I get

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.770 
either I'm also not quite sure how I get
the<00:01:33.979> antenna<00:01:34.340> cable<00:01:35.439> because<00:01:36.439> that<00:01:37.630> if<00:01:38.630> you

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
the antenna cable because that if you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.059 
the antenna cable because that if you
can<00:01:38.929> see<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.560> antennas<00:01:39.979> right<00:01:40.159> here<00:01:42.039> let<00:01:43.039> me

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
can see the antennas right here let me

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.699 
can see the antennas right here let me
just<00:01:43.130> adjust<00:01:43.840> that<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:45.259> is<00:01:45.439> where<00:01:45.590> the

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
just adjust that that is where the

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:47.289 
just adjust that that is where the
antenna<00:01:46.009> it<00:01:46.159> goes<00:01:46.310> into<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:46.819> if<00:01:46.909> I<00:01:47.000> push<00:01:47.179> it

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
antenna it goes into so if I push it

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.990 
antenna it goes into so if I push it
down<00:01:47.890> it's<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:48.979> little<00:01:49.069> bit<00:01:49.280> stuck<00:01:49.549> so<00:01:49.700> hasn't

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
down it's a little bit stuck so hasn't

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.210 
down it's a little bit stuck so hasn't
pushed<00:01:50.239> down<00:01:50.390> in<00:01:50.509> years<00:01:50.720> but<00:01:50.959> if<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:52.039> were<00:01:52.130> to

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
pushed down in years but if you were to

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.589 
pushed down in years but if you were to
push<00:01:52.369> that<00:01:52.520> down<00:01:52.579> it<00:01:53.000> would<00:01:53.119> go<00:01:53.270> into<00:01:53.450> that

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
push that down it would go into that

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.830 
push that down it would go into that
like<00:01:54.409> sleeve<00:01:54.709> this<00:01:55.640> cable<00:01:56.060> I'm<00:01:56.179> assuming<00:01:56.750> is

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
like sleeve this cable I'm assuming is

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:08.350 
like sleeve this cable I'm assuming is
the<00:01:56.929> antenna<00:01:57.229> cable<00:01:57.590> no<00:01:58.869> theoretically<00:02:07.360> sit

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
the antenna cable no theoretically sit

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.210 
the antenna cable no theoretically sit
down

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.890 

if<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:14.000> were<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:15.460> take<00:02:16.460> out<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:17.030> stereo<00:02:17.720> that

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
if I were to take out that stereo that

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.810 
if I were to take out that stereo that
you<00:02:17.990> can<00:02:18.110> see<00:02:18.260> right<00:02:18.410> over<00:02:18.590> there<00:02:18.820> behind

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
you can see right over there behind

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.490 
you can see right over there behind
there<00:02:20.270> somewhere<00:02:20.630> would<00:02:20.780> be<00:02:20.930> an<00:02:21.140> antenna

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
there somewhere would be an antenna

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.580 
there somewhere would be an antenna
cable<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.550> I<00:02:22.580> could<00:02:22.880> just<00:02:23.090> unplug<00:02:23.590> reroute

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
cable that I could just unplug reroute

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.420 
cable that I could just unplug reroute
through<00:02:24.890> this<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:26.590> get<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.710> entire<00:02:27.950> thing<00:02:28.010> to

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
through this and get the entire thing to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:38.320 
through this and get the entire thing to
work<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:31.520> problem<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:34.480> this<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.090> don't<00:02:38.210> know

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
work the problem is this so I don't know

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.860 
work the problem is this so I don't know
if<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.480> can<00:02:38.540> read<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:39.370> did<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.490> know<00:02:40.870> the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
if you can read that did you know the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.660 
if you can read that did you know the
entire<00:02:41.960> stereo<00:02:42.530> system<00:02:42.830> removed<00:02:43.370> from<00:02:43.490> the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
entire stereo system removed from the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.760 
entire stereo system removed from the
vehicle<00:02:44.060> will<00:02:44.510> stop<00:02:44.780> working<00:02:44.960> it<00:02:45.410> will<00:02:45.590> never

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
vehicle will stop working it will never

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.760 
vehicle will stop working it will never
work<00:02:45.860> again<00:02:46.150> at<00:02:47.150> least<00:02:47.360> that's<00:02:47.570> what<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.840> the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
work again at least that's what the the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.360 
work again at least that's what the the
window<00:02:49.100> says<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.750> what<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.470> want<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.710> know<00:02:51.830> if<00:02:52.130> I

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
window says so what I want to know if I

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.840 
window says so what I want to know if I
can<00:02:52.960> if<00:02:53.960> you<00:02:54.170> guys<00:02:54.320> know<00:02:54.560> can<00:02:54.770> I<00:02:54.860> take<00:02:55.130> this<00:02:55.280> out

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.010 

reroute<00:02:58.850> all<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.150> reroute<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.720> antenna

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
reroute all the reroute the antenna

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.300 
reroute all the reroute the antenna
connections<00:03:00.500> theoretically<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.100> wouldn't

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
connections theoretically I wouldn't

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.770 
connections theoretically I wouldn't
have<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.460> do<00:03:01.550> anything<00:03:01.820> else<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.360> just<00:03:02.390> have<00:03:02.720> to

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
have to do anything else I just have to

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.930 
have to do anything else I just have to
take<00:03:02.900> out<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.170> antenna<00:03:03.470> wire<00:03:03.790> reroute<00:03:04.790> it

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
take out the antenna wire reroute it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.220 
take out the antenna wire reroute it
through<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:05.510> probably<00:03:05.780> shove<00:03:06.110> the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
through this and probably shove the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.400 
through this and probably shove the
cable<00:03:06.530> down<00:03:06.650> somewhere<00:03:07.340> behind<00:03:07.460> the<00:03:07.670> dash

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
cable down somewhere behind the dash

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.130 
cable down somewhere behind the dash
would<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:10.100> radio<00:03:10.490> stop<00:03:10.730> working<00:03:11.120> because<00:03:11.780> I'm

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
would the radio stop working because I'm

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.600 
would the radio stop working because I'm
not<00:03:12.260> sure<00:03:12.470> if<00:03:12.500> it's<00:03:12.680> like<00:03:12.800> a<00:03:12.830> mechanical

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
not sure if it's like a mechanical

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.790 
not sure if it's like a mechanical
switch<00:03:13.820> that<00:03:14.270> once<00:03:15.050> it's<00:03:15.230> been<00:03:15.380> pulled<00:03:15.620> out<00:03:15.740> of

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
switch that once it's been pulled out of

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.900 
switch that once it's been pulled out of
the<00:03:15.950> vehicle<00:03:16.490> it<00:03:16.610> just<00:03:16.640> won't<00:03:16.910> work<00:03:17.030> again<00:03:17.360> and

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
the vehicle it just won't work again and

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.310 
the vehicle it just won't work again and
or<00:03:19.910> if<00:03:20.239> it's<00:03:20.390> just<00:03:20.630> something<00:03:20.810> like<00:03:21.140> if<00:03:21.290> you

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
or if it's just something like if you

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.960 
or if it's just something like if you
unplug<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.800> antenna<00:03:22.130> cable<00:03:22.459> or<00:03:22.550> the<00:03:22.670> speaker

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
unplug the antenna cable or the speaker

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.750 
unplug the antenna cable or the speaker
cables<00:03:23.390> or<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:24.140> power<00:03:24.410> cable<00:03:24.860> it<00:03:25.430> will<00:03:25.489> just

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
cables or the power cable it will just

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.150 
cables or the power cable it will just
not<00:03:26.030> work<00:03:26.239> again<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.720> don't<00:03:27.620> want<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:27.980> have<00:03:28.100> to

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
not work again I don't want to have to

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.380 
not work again I don't want to have to
go<00:03:28.250> out<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:28.489> buy<00:03:28.550> a<00:03:28.580> new<00:03:28.670> stereo<00:03:29.090> for<00:03:29.300> this

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
go out and buy a new stereo for this

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.870 
go out and buy a new stereo for this
thing<00:03:29.570> because<00:03:29.959> first<00:03:30.230> of<00:03:30.350> all<00:03:30.440> it's<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.550> I

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
thing because first of all it's a I

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.570 
thing because first of all it's a I
think<00:03:32.360> it's<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.570> strange<00:03:32.989> size<00:03:33.320> because<00:03:33.830> it's

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
think it's a strange size because it's

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.810 
think it's a strange size because it's
German<00:03:35.290> so<00:03:37.209> or<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.270> European<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.500> size<00:03:40.489> is<00:03:40.790> a

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
German so or a European so the size is a

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.400 
German so or a European so the size is a
little<00:03:41.060> bit<00:03:41.150> strange<00:03:41.390> I'm<00:03:41.720> not<00:03:41.930> sure<00:03:42.170> how<00:03:42.350> to

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
little bit strange I'm not sure how to

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.290 
little bit strange I'm not sure how to
go<00:03:42.680> about<00:03:42.800> buying<00:03:43.160> car<00:03:43.489> stereos<00:03:43.850> but<00:03:44.150> I<00:03:44.180> know

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
go about buying car stereos but I know

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.930 
go about buying car stereos but I know
they're<00:03:44.570> expensive<00:03:44.900> because<00:03:45.470> my<00:03:45.650> dad<00:03:45.940> bought

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
they're expensive because my dad bought

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.300

antenna cable reroute it and have it
work<00:04:07.670> again

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
work again

the<00:04:09.960> another<00:04:10.230> problem<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.710> as<00:04:10.920> I<00:04:11.040> said<00:04:11.250> it's<00:04:11.400> a

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
the another problem is as I said it's a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.720 
the another problem is as I said it's a
German<00:04:11.880> import<00:04:12.360> so<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:13.830> think<00:04:14.040> I've<00:04:14.430> seen<00:04:14.610> on

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
German import so I think I've seen on

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.710 
German import so I think I've seen on
the<00:04:14.820> internet<00:04:15.090> somewhere<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.630> they

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
the internet somewhere that they

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.270 
the internet somewhere that they
actually<00:04:15.990> have<00:04:16.110> different<00:04:16.140> style<00:04:16.680> antenna

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
actually have different style antenna

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.250 
actually have different style antenna
cables<00:04:17.640> in<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.790> standard<00:04:18.450> Motorola<00:04:18.840> thing

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260
