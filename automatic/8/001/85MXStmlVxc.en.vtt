00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
I'd really like about this gun is that

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.300 
I'd really like about this gun is that
it's<00:02:25.430> hip<00:02:25.640> fire<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.900> an<00:02:26.990> SMG<00:02:27.440> has<00:02:28.280> a

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
it's hip fire is that of an SMG has a

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.420 
it's hip fire is that of an SMG has a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
pretty tight hip fire spread but now on

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.370 
pretty tight hip fire spread but now on
to<00:02:31.460> the<00:02:31.640> attachments<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.630> do<00:02:32.720> not<00:02:33.050> really

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
to the attachments I do not really

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.350 
to the attachments I do not really
recommend<00:02:33.980> using<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:34.340> guns<00:02:34.580> iron<00:02:34.850> sights<00:02:35.180> at

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
recommend using this guns iron sights at

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.690 
recommend using this guns iron sights at
all<00:02:35.630> it's<00:02:36.260> not<00:02:36.440> really<00:02:36.650> clear<00:02:36.980> when<00:02:37.280> your<00:02:37.400> abs

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
all it's not really clear when your abs

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.340 
all it's not really clear when your abs
in<00:02:37.820> with<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.480> it's<00:02:38.630> obstructed<00:02:39.170> by<00:02:39.290> the

in with it and it's obstructed by the
guns<00:02:39.680> design<00:02:40.210> for<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:41.300> sights<00:02:41.600> I'd<00:02:41.810> say<00:02:42.080> go

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
guns design for the sights I'd say go

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.350 
guns design for the sights I'd say go
with<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.470> holographic<00:02:42.980> sight<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.850> gives<00:02:44.150> the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
with the holographic sight it gives the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.170 
with the holographic sight it gives the
gun<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.570> 1.5<00:02:45.550> magnification<00:02:46.550> which<00:02:46.700> helps<00:02:47.090> when

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
gun a 1.5 magnification which helps when

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.580 
gun a 1.5 magnification which helps when
trying<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.540> go<00:02:47.630> for<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.870> little<00:02:47.930> shots<00:02:48.230> better<00:02:48.470> a

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
trying to go for a little shots better a

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.640 
trying to go for a little shots better a
little<00:02:49.040> further<00:02:49.280> out<00:02:49.580> but<00:02:50.380> being<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:51.410> this

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
little further out but being that this

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.860 
little further out but being that this
gun<00:02:51.920> has<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.100> controllable<00:02:52.640> recoil<00:02:53.210> I<00:02:53.390> didn't

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
gun has a controllable recoil I didn't

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.120 
gun has a controllable recoil I didn't
really<00:02:53.990> see<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.380> need<00:02:54.410> for<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.920> grip

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
really see the need for the grip

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.490 
really see the need for the grip
attachment<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.210> I<00:02:56.240> decided<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.750> throw<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.020> bipod

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
attachment so I decided to throw a bipod

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.560 
attachment so I decided to throw a bipod
on<00:02:57.650> there<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.280> has<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.520> be<00:02:58.580> one<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:58.940> best

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
on there that has to be one of the best

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.150 
on there that has to be one of the best
decisions<00:02:59.720> I've<00:03:00.260> made<00:03:00.290> in<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.710> while<00:03:00.920> when

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
decisions I've made in a while when

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.040 
decisions I've made in a while when
putting<00:03:01.370> an<00:03:01.520> attachment<00:03:01.790> on<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> gun<00:03:02.420> now

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
putting an attachment on a gun now

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.840 
putting an attachment on a gun now
coupled<00:03:03.530> with<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.740> holographic<00:03:04.220> sight<00:03:04.580> and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
coupled with the holographic sight and

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.020 
coupled with the holographic sight and
the<00:03:05.000> bipod<00:03:05.510> this<00:03:06.050> gun<00:03:06.380> becomes<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.220> monster<00:03:07.520> and

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
the bipod this gun becomes a monster and

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.970 
the bipod this gun becomes a monster and
last<00:03:08.600> but<00:03:08.720> not<00:03:08.870> least<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.380> decided<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.860> throw

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
last but not least I decided to throw

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.580 
last but not least I decided to throw
the<00:03:10.160> hairy<00:03:10.370> heavy<00:03:10.970> barrel<00:03:11.690> on<00:03:11.870> there<00:03:12.110> just<00:03:12.440> for

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
the hairy heavy barrel on there just for

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.800 
the hairy heavy barrel on there just for
good<00:03:12.800> measure<00:03:12.860> as<00:03:13.430> I'm<00:03:13.910> not<00:03:14.120> really<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.450> fan<00:03:14.750> of

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
good measure as I'm not really a fan of

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.170 
good measure as I'm not really a fan of
