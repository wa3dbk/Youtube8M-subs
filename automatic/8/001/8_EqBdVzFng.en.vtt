high-efficiency washer customer's
complaint<00:00:29.789> was<00:00:30.240> then<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.570> seemed<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.960> take

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
complaint was then it seemed to take

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.130 
complaint was then it seemed to take
longer<00:00:31.349> than<00:00:31.560> their<00:00:31.710> older<00:00:31.980> model<00:00:32.989> and<00:00:33.989> for

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
longer than their older model and for

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.840 
longer than their older model and for
it's<00:00:34.380> probably<00:00:34.500> normal<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.730> we're

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it's probably normal for this but we're

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.190 
it's probably normal for this but we're
going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.000> put<00:00:36.149> into<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.420> test<00:00:36.660> mode<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:37.079> to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
going to put into a test mode just to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.900 
going to put into a test mode just to
verify<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.620> all<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.980> functions<00:00:38.790> are

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
verify that all the functions are

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.670 
verify that all the functions are
operating<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.540> they<00:00:39.629> should<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.079> we're<00:00:40.590> going

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
operating as they should so we're going

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.060 
operating as they should so we're going
to<00:00:40.770> go<00:00:40.829> ahead<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.100> access<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:42.890> test<00:00:43.890> mode

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
to go ahead and access that test mode

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.450 
to go ahead and access that test mode
right<00:00:44.219> now

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
right now

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.520 
right now
okay<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.149> we're<00:00:45.420> going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.600> take<00:00:45.750> our<00:00:45.930> knob

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
okay so we're going to take our knob

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.860 
okay so we're going to take our knob
here<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.160> another<00:00:47.430> cycle<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> think<00:00:48.570> we'll

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
here just another cycle so I think we'll

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.569 
here just another cycle so I think we'll
call<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.140> we're<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.739> go<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.039> left<00:00:50.219> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
call it we're going to go to the left to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.660 
call it we're going to go to the left to
the<00:00:51.180> right<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> right<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> right<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
lights illuminate I want to turn it two

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.520 
lights illuminate I want to turn it two
more<00:00:58.320> times<00:00:58.559> clockwise<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.730> two<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:01.109> spin<00:01:01.379> is

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
more times clockwise one two the spin is

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.750 
more times clockwise one two the spin is
illuminated<00:01:02.039> I'm<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.340> hit<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.520> start

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
illuminated I'm going to hit the start

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.270 
illuminated I'm going to hit the start
button<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.949> go<00:01:05.010> through<00:01:05.189> an

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
button and it's going to go through an

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:56.700 
button and it's going to go through an
automatic<00:01:05.580> test<00:01:05.939> mode<00:01:06.119> right<00:01:06.299> now

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
diagnostic mode everything went through

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.109 
diagnostic mode everything went through
there<00:02:00.770> fine<00:02:01.040> I<00:02:01.070> didn't<00:02:01.460> hear<00:02:01.610> any<00:02:01.790> observe

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
there fine I didn't hear any observe

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.620 
there fine I didn't hear any observe
noises<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:03.920> what<00:02:04.760> I'm<00:02:04.880> going<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.060> do<00:02:05.180> just<00:02:05.479> to

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
noises so what I'm going to do just to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.240 
noises so what I'm going to do just to
make<00:02:05.659> sure<00:02:06.080> everything<00:02:06.440> is<00:02:06.560> matched<00:02:06.979> up

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
make sure everything is matched up

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.270 
make sure everything is matched up
properly<00:02:07.640> I'm<00:02:08.179> just<00:02:08.360> going<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.570> put<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:08.810> into<00:02:09.110> a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
properly I'm just going to put it into a

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.010 
properly I'm just going to put it into a
calibration<00:02:10.280> mode<00:02:10.660> so<00:02:11.660> I'm<00:02:11.750> going<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.930> go

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
calibration mode so I'm going to go

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.810 
calibration mode so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.500> just<00:02:12.800> open<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.070> lid<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.580> done

light is going now and I'm going to
enter<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.010> test<00:02:16.250> mode<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.520> exact<00:02:16.790> same<00:02:17.000> way<00:02:17.150> I

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
enter the test mode the exact same way I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.520 
enter the test mode the exact same way I
did<00:02:17.390> before<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:17.930> we're<00:02:18.050> going<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.260> go<00:02:18.320> left

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
did before so we're going to go left

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.680 
did before so we're going to go left
right<00:02:18.910> right<00:02:19.910> right<00:02:21.220> left<00:02:22.220> right<00:02:22.580> all<00:02:23.420> the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
right right right left right all the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.000 
right right right left right all the
lights<00:02:23.870> are<00:02:24.020> eliminated<00:02:24.440> now<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.590> want<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.890> turn

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
lights are eliminated now I want to turn

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.620 
lights are eliminated now I want to turn
it<00:02:25.130> clockwise<00:02:25.250> 4<00:02:25.850> times<00:02:26.120> 1<00:02:26.480> 2<00:02:27.290> 3<00:02:28.070> 4<00:02:28.820> now<00:02:29.570> the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
it clockwise 4 times 1 2 3 4 now the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.090 
it clockwise 4 times 1 2 3 4 now the
rinse<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:30.140> illuminated<00:02:30.680> I'm<00:02:30.800> going<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:30.980> hit

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
rinse is illuminated I'm going to hit

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.509 
rinse is illuminated I'm going to hit
start<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:33.769> see<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.010> entered<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.280> mode

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
start and you see it entered the mode

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.070 
start and you see it entered the mode
when<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.880> starts<00:02:35.209> going<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:35.780> will<00:02:35.959> take

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
when it starts going and this will take

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.350 
when it starts going and this will take
just<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.350> couple<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.650> minutes<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:37.209> I<00:02:38.209> guess

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
just a couple of minutes and I guess

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.610 
just a couple of minutes and I guess
it's<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.600> calibration<00:02:39.170> mode<00:02:39.320> which

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
it's the calibration mode which

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.350 
it's the calibration mode which
basically<00:02:39.950> syncs<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.550> drive<00:02:40.760> components<00:02:41.090> in

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
basically syncs to drive components in

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:57.420 
basically syncs to drive components in
the<00:02:41.420> computer<00:02:41.840> together

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.440 

all<00:02:58.430> right<00:02:58.580> we<00:02:58.730> just<00:02:58.910> finished<00:02:59.000> that

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
all right we just finished that
