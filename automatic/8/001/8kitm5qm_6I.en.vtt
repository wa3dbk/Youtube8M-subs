00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 a lad of senior and we're back 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.799
 in the channel we are in a new video 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.740
 more in this case we are in 2.0 kids 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.750
 we are again in a question and it 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.210
 answers in two points will remain 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.070
 super cool the other you loved the only thing 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.770
 that was published badly because that is published 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.240
 an evil because it did not go well in the fidh and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.519
 also the thumbnail was posted badly so 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.769
 who founded a lot of support but not in this 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.930
 I hope I have more support because I 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.210
 make sure everything goes well it's time 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.769
 that the link is published and all 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.630
 what you are looking at the bottom you can 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.829
 have some wolffer admras 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.809
 I think the first one is the risk map 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.550
 that good is not important for that 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.110
 let's start with the products and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.989
 Answers in 2.0 a question of Maria 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.780
 polished carmen that comes out asks me then 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.700
 I do not know if it will be negative or it will be the fool 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.940
 from his mother whatever back up 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.489
 gta 5 if it is so with just uploading and us 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.680
 select this question because if I 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.629
 I went up I will go back up gta 5 madryn already 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.280
 you will be writing so that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.809
 go back up gta 5 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.729
 but it's not going to be something like before 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.800
 Trick is still so it's just 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.290
 racing with me 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.000
 he just secured races with friends 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.610
 activities with friends and it's going to be a 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.190
 quite different way so that it is not 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.000
 what you have and say is that you leave in gta 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.190
 for not only to see gta when I go before 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.480
 forgotten are worth the days that you have to 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.480
 password are bonus 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.580
 so you do not complain 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.080
 the same videos of fairy goal that 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.240
 always to what I know 4 a week 5 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.430
 additional but the days that you have 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.170
 you will have the most a second video almost 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.120
 all those have foot gta at night 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.980
 is from wolffer cited or vice versa 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.930
 again it has given us show us the 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.150
 three or four and then gt at 9 a 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.680
 10 a.m. to 8 a.m. so you win the 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.260
 race the advance with omissions against 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.810
 appointment with gags with more people a lot of 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.880
 people and if I'm going to upload it on xbox they are 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.730
 which is the nexgen console that I have 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.950
 next question you kilo and dribble me 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.530
 ask how much time do you devote to 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.300
 youtube commented editing render a 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.800
 greeting machine good to youtube more 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.720
 or less he devoted almost nothing during the week 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.220
 a little bit too little because if 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.810
 studying such I have things to do 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.570
 but weekend was dedicated to record 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.160
 almost everything for the week comment 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.390
 render a button upload I leave it 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.820
 going up all night because he writes 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.800
 connection is not for more and basically 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.140
 that I say enough time what of 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.420
 intentional week almost nothing is not 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.210
 file and ask me and me who machine 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.900
 although youtube youtube this 10 to live 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.850
 is that they do not stay far away and I have left 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.310
 away from my house because after living 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.770
 with u2 see if I follow youtube if you give me 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.180
 to live anything of these but 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.280
 If I had that unique number 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.350
 right now, I think I would choose the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.290
 gang in which I am always do not know 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.270
 yes it is a peter grant serigraphic vice 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:02.100
 Agustin 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:04.560
 I do not think anyone but I think what 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.480
 safer with them would be the first 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.270
 election would ask them and if 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.580
 I would like it because it would be pretty good and if 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.960
 it was not so bad but it would be basically 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.870
 with them who are the ones with whom 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.730
 more time I am always but good 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.730
 it would be basically if with them Jorge 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.020
 lever asks me the things that 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.450
 simpler question 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:29.490
 these cases of these these these 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.440
 these people because now in this of ghd 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.810
 are the stars at 50 the truth gives me 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.410
 pretty cool they do not use quite well 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.410
 looked 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.440
 I do not know if he looked like an idiot but good 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.440
 only jump 50 300 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.790
 and the sky was talking good 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.430
 this is the 300 are wireless 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.020
 and such but drop the battery so 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.150
 this is already that simple 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.660
 loading while you talk and good is 300 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.739
 payments that way I bought it cheaper 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.110
 very bad because they are quite alfonso 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.850
 fuck Lopez you ask me when some 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.740
 soccer team or would you like to be 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.600
 good if I'm playing in football but 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.400
 good is with colleagues in the institute 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.310
 we finish and we're going to play 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.670
 football municipal league very from very 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.430
 colleagues very very rest not to do 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.960
 sport and such but I would like to be 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.180
 a new one because I'm good at one and 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.860
 good always happens pretty good and good 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.750
 guys now comes more or less the 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.510

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.900
 They are not many but they are very rare 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.900
 I assure you that 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.230
 point 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.230
