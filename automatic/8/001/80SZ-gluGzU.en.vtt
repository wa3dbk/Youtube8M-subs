00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
lot of seeds so I don't know I have only

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.959 
lot of seeds so I don't know I have only
four<00:00:31.109> containers<00:00:31.650> here<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.489> wanted<00:00:32.850> to

sounds silly but this is what I try to
do<00:00:37.620> before<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> put<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:38.910> my<00:00:39.030> mud<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.600> or<00:00:39.840> my

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
do before I put in my mud in here or my

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.060 
do before I put in my mud in here or my
daughter<00:00:40.860> my<00:00:41.190> soil<00:00:41.489> whatever<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.030> call<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.239> I

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
daughter my soil whatever you call it I

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.410 
daughter my soil whatever you call it I
see<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.100> there<00:00:44.370> are<00:00:44.399> some<00:00:44.670> holes<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.210> what

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
see that there are some holes and what

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
see that there are some holes and what
happens<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.870> when<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> plant<00:00:46.379> or<00:00:46.649> whatever<00:00:46.829> I

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
happens is when I plant or whatever I

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.750 
happens is when I plant or whatever I
water<00:00:47.489> my<00:00:47.579> seedlings<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:49.590> water<00:00:49.890> passes

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
water my seedlings the water passes

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.479 
water my seedlings the water passes
through<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.120> holes<00:00:51.390> along<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> mud<00:00:52.489> so

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
through this holes along with the mud so

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.889 
through this holes along with the mud so
that's<00:00:53.670> why<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.850> try<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> put<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.809> is

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that's why I try to put this and this is

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.600 
that's why I try to put this and this is
a<00:00:54.930> very<00:00:55.199> good<00:00:55.350> idea<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.800> learned<00:00:56.039> from<00:00:56.190> my

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
a very good idea I learned from my

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.990 
a very good idea I learned from my
friends<00:00:57.270> where<00:00:58.050> they<00:00:58.260> put<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:59.399> paper

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
friends where they put in some paper

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.939 
friends where they put in some paper
towel<00:01:00.270> or<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.840> know<00:01:00.989> toilet<00:01:01.469> paper<00:01:01.649> or

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
towel or you know toilet paper or

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.770 
towel or you know toilet paper or
anything<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.550> could<00:01:02.730> find<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.239> has<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
anything that you could find it has a

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.219 
anything that you could find it has a
fish's<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.650> very<00:01:04.860> soft<00:01:05.129> consistency<00:01:05.549> and

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
fish's of a very soft consistency and

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.649 
fish's of a very soft consistency and
that<00:01:07.229> would<00:01:07.380> help<00:01:07.710> prevent<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:09.240> soil<00:01:09.450> from

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
that would help prevent the soil from

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.810 
that would help prevent the soil from
getting<00:01:10.320> out<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.680> holes<00:01:10.920> that's<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.700> you

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
getting out of this holes that's it you

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.060 
getting out of this holes that's it you
have<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.150> also<00:01:12.390> tried<00:01:12.840> growing<00:01:13.110> stuff<00:01:13.860> in

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
have I also tried growing stuff in

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.710 
have I also tried growing stuff in
containers<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.540> my

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
containers like this this is like my

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.590 
containers like this this is like my
soup<00:01:15.930> bowl<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.439> also<00:01:16.619> comes<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.600> cover

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
soup bowl and it also comes with a cover

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.620 
soup bowl and it also comes with a cover
on<00:01:18.780> top<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.549> since<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> has<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> good<00:01:21.119> source

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
on top and since it has a good source

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.260 
on top and since it has a good source
more<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> greenhouse<00:01:22.830> effect<00:01:23.430> which<00:01:24.090> you

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
more like a greenhouse effect which you

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.609 
more like a greenhouse effect which you
probably<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.720> seen<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.020> my<00:01:25.140> other<00:01:25.320> videos

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
probably have seen in my other videos

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.359 
probably have seen in my other videos
but<00:01:26.210> I<00:01:27.210> drew<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> lot<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> stuff<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.070> I

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
but I drew a lot of stuff in this and I

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.550 
but I drew a lot of stuff in this and I
do<00:01:29.430> not<00:01:29.729> put<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.119> hole<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.900> because<00:01:31.350> I

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
do not put a hole on to this because I

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.350 
do not put a hole on to this because I
do<00:01:31.680> not<00:01:31.920> water<00:01:32.159> them<00:01:32.340> every<00:01:32.610> day<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.119> not

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
do not water them every day and I do not

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.050 
do not water them every day and I do not
keep<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.020> soil<00:01:34.229> dry<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.729> know<00:01:35.820> it's

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
keep the soil dry because you know it's

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.240 
keep the soil dry because you know it's
pretty<00:01:36.689> much<00:01:36.810> moist<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.680> over<00:01:37.979> drain

never<00:01:58.920> understand<00:01:59.369> what<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.670> meant<00:01:59.850> well<00:01:59.969> but

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
never understand what it meant well but

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.510 
never understand what it meant well but
let's<00:02:00.360> not<00:02:00.540> get<00:02:00.719> into<00:02:00.869> details<00:02:01.229> here<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:02.250> when

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
let's not get into details here but when

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
let's not get into details here but when
I<00:02:02.549> put<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.909> sandpaper<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.780> put<00:02:04.079> my

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
I put the sandpaper in and I put my

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.180 
I put the sandpaper in and I put my
seeds<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.770> here<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.540> I<00:02:06.540> shake<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.649> faulkner

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
seeds in here and I shake this faulkner

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.800 
seeds in here and I shake this faulkner
for<00:02:08.369> example<00:02:08.879> on<00:02:09.090> board<00:02:09.420> why

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
for example on board why

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.420 
for example on board why
doing<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.709> daisies<00:02:12.380> so<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.130> trick

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
doing the daisies so this is the trick

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.820 
doing the daisies so this is the trick
so<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.730> have<00:02:14.880> emptied<00:02:15.300> all<00:02:15.450> my<00:02:15.660> seeds<00:02:16.020> from<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
so I have emptied all my seeds from the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.470 
so I have emptied all my seeds from the
Daisy<00:02:17.010> packet<00:02:17.640> into<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.890> container<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.480> as

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
Daisy packet into this container and as

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.660 
Daisy packet into this container and as
I<00:02:21.630> said<00:02:21.690> before<00:02:22.080> we<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.800> sandpaper<00:02:23.400> and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
I said before we have a sandpaper and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.670 
I said before we have a sandpaper and
then<00:02:23.819> as<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.060> put<00:02:24.270> my<00:02:24.300> seedlings<00:02:25.200> in<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.560> I'm

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
then as I put my seedlings in that I'm

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.520 
then as I put my seedlings in that I'm
just<00:02:25.890> going<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.069> close<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.870> closes<00:02:28.170> for

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
just going to close it and it closes for

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.470 
just going to close it and it closes for
me<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:28.860> because<00:02:29.190> it's<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.610> same<00:02:29.849> cover<00:02:30.269> of

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
me on it because it's the same cover of

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.839 
me on it because it's the same cover of
the<00:02:30.630> container<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.140> em<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:32.780> just<00:02:33.780> do<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.849> and

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
the container and em I just do this and

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:42.520 
the container and em I just do this and
make<00:02:36.060> sure<00:02:36.300> all<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.140> seeds<00:02:37.910> are<00:02:38.910> nicely

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.759 

shaken<00:02:43.530> inside<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.519> container<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.769> what

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
shaken inside the container and what

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.520 
shaken inside the container and what
that<00:02:46.980> does<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.519> it<00:02:47.760> helps<00:02:48.420> bruise<00:02:48.989> the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
that does is it helps bruise the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.800 
that does is it helps bruise the
coverings<00:02:50.010> like<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.400> improved<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.540> seeds

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
coverings like it's improved the seeds

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.440 
coverings like it's improved the seeds
so<00:02:52.019> that<00:02:52.049> helps<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.560> sprout<00:02:52.980> faster<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.209> did

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
so that helps it sprout faster so I did

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.809 
so that helps it sprout faster so I did
the<00:02:57.569> same<00:02:57.780> thing<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.080> my<00:02:58.200> cucumber<00:02:58.680> seeds<00:02:58.920> B

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
the same thing to my cucumber seeds B

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.120 
the same thing to my cucumber seeds B
and<00:03:00.650> really<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:02.209> sprouted<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.450> very<00:03:03.630> next<00:03:03.870> day

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
and really it sprouted the very next day

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.770 
and really it sprouted the very next day
now<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.400> did<00:03:05.640> take<00:03:05.849> a<00:03:05.880> longer<00:03:06.239> time<00:03:06.269> for<00:03:06.630> me

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
now it did take a longer time for me

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.559 
now it did take a longer time for me
with<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.049> pansies<00:03:07.319> because<00:03:08.130> I<00:03:08.459> think<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.420> took

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
with the pansies because I think it took

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.330 
with the pansies because I think it took
me<00:03:09.630> four<00:03:10.080> days<00:03:10.290> for<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.830> sprout<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.160> I'll

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
me four days for it to sprout and I'll

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.309 
me four days for it to sprout and I'll
show<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.730> pansies<00:03:12.209> in<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.450> second<00:03:12.840> okay<00:03:13.260> so

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
show you the pansies in a second okay so

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.810 
show you the pansies in a second okay so
these<00:03:13.620> are<00:03:13.829> my<00:03:13.950> pansies<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:15.260> put<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.820> into

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
these are my pansies and I put this into

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.900 
these are my pansies and I put this into
the<00:03:17.970> soil<00:03:18.299> that's<00:03:18.989> even<00:03:19.410> um<00:03:19.680> four<00:03:20.459> days<00:03:20.640> ago

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
the soil that's even um four days ago

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.780 
the soil that's even um four days ago
and<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:22.290> can<00:03:22.470> see<00:03:22.680> some<00:03:22.890> tiny<00:03:23.130> sprouts<00:03:23.549> coming

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and you can see some tiny sprouts coming

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.319 
and you can see some tiny sprouts coming
off<00:03:24.500> but<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:25.890> very<00:03:26.130> few<00:03:26.549> but<00:03:26.760> there<00:03:26.940> they

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
off but it is very few but there they

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.440 
off but it is very few but there they
are<00:03:27.359> they're<00:03:28.100> even<00:03:29.100> this<00:03:29.400> one<00:03:29.700> now<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:29.940> had<00:03:30.239> like

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
are they're even this one now I had like

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.180 
are they're even this one now I had like
I<00:03:30.690> don't<00:03:30.750> know<00:03:30.959> how<00:03:31.079> many<00:03:31.140> seeds<00:03:31.560> but<00:03:31.799> I<00:03:31.859> think

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
I don't know how many seeds but I think

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.090 
I don't know how many seeds but I think
they<00:03:32.280> were<00:03:32.450> two<00:03:33.450> hundred<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.049> ten<00:03:34.290> milligrams

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
they were two hundred and ten milligrams

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.370 
they were two hundred and ten milligrams
-<00:03:35.880> quite<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.150> lot<00:03:36.329> of<00:03:36.450> seeds<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.019> didn't<00:03:37.319> I

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
- quite a lot of seeds and I didn't I

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.680 
- quite a lot of seeds and I didn't I
don't<00:03:37.560> like<00:03:38.090> covering<00:03:39.090> them<00:03:39.269> with<00:03:39.299> mud

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
don't like covering them with mud

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.500 
don't like covering them with mud
because<00:03:40.019> they're<00:03:40.200> very<00:03:40.549> fragile<00:03:41.549> so<00:03:42.480> I

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
because they're very fragile so I

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.569 
because they're very fragile so I
usually<00:03:42.959> cover<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.560> whole<00:03:43.859> container<00:03:44.190> either

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
usually cover the whole container either

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.220 
usually cover the whole container either
with<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:44.940> lid<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.299> container<00:03:45.510> or<00:03:45.810> with

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
with the lid of the container or with

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.059 
with the lid of the container or with
cellophane<00:03:46.500> paper<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:48.450> I've<00:03:48.840> put<00:03:49.829> all<00:03:49.920> the

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
cellophane paper so I've put all the

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.940 
cellophane paper so I've put all the
soil<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:51.420> their<00:03:51.660> respective<00:03:51.989> containers<00:03:52.680> and

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
soil and their respective containers and

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.340 
soil and their respective containers and
I'm<00:03:53.180> trying<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.299> water<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.780> get<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.170> soil

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
I'm trying to water it and get the soil

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.870 
I'm trying to water it and get the soil
on<00:03:55.530> moist<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:56.790> I'm<00:03:57.780> going<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.109> put<00:03:58.609> each<00:03:59.609> seed

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
on moist and I'm going to put each seed

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.500 
on moist and I'm going to put each seed
any<00:04:02.880> of<00:04:03.060> these<00:04:04.519> and<00:04:05.519> we'll<00:04:05.760> put<00:04:05.910> coral<00:04:06.269> five

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
any of these and we'll put coral five

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.080 
any of these and we'll put coral five
seeds<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:07.019> each<00:04:07.139> container<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:07.920> see<00:04:08.549> how<00:04:08.940> it

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
seeds in each container and see how it

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.280 
seeds in each container and see how it
goes<00:04:09.620> maybe<00:04:10.620> more<00:04:10.950> than<00:04:11.069> that<00:04:11.250> Turner<00:04:12.290> so

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
goes maybe more than that Turner so

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.659 
goes maybe more than that Turner so
today<00:04:14.100> is<00:04:14.569> April<00:04:15.569> 15<00:04:16.340> 2013

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
today is April 15 2013

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.279 
today is April 15 2013
and<00:04:17.820> let's<00:04:18.570> see<00:04:18.840> how<00:04:19.049> this<00:04:19.349> does<00:04:19.409> um<00:04:20.039> in<00:04:21.289> a

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
and let's see how this does um in a

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.980 
and let's see how this does um in a
couple<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.770> weeks<00:04:23.090> they<00:04:24.090> should<00:04:24.479> be<00:04:24.659> able<00:04:24.810> to

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
couple of weeks they should be able to

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.420 
couple of weeks they should be able to
sprout<00:04:25.440> let<00:04:25.770> see<00:04:25.919> what's<00:04:26.070> written<00:04:26.159> on<00:04:26.370> the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
sprout let see what's written on the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.060 
sprout let see what's written on the
pattern<00:04:26.849> I<00:04:26.909> got<00:04:27.120> this<00:04:27.270> from<00:04:27.450> Walmart<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.169> they

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
pattern I got this from Walmart and they

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.310 
pattern I got this from Walmart and they
should<00:04:29.280> be<00:04:29.430> able<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.729> sprout<00:04:30.240> say<00:04:30.599> in<00:04:30.810> 42<00:04:31.229> to<00:04:31.289> 21

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
should be able to sprout say in 42 to 21

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.580 
should be able to sprout say in 42 to 21
days<00:04:31.800> but<00:04:31.940> since<00:04:32.940> we<00:04:33.150> have<00:04:36.349> lessons<00:04:37.349> we<00:04:37.560> have

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
days but since we have lessons we have

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.649 
days but since we have lessons we have
bruised<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.370> seeds<00:04:38.669> it<00:04:38.849> should<00:04:39.030> sprout<00:04:39.330> maybe

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
bruised the seeds it should sprout maybe

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.860 
bruised the seeds it should sprout maybe
like<00:04:39.840> in<00:04:40.020> a<00:04:40.140> week<00:04:40.380> within<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:40.800> week<00:04:41.870> usually

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
like in a week within a week usually

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.920 
like in a week within a week usually
would<00:04:43.229> live<00:04:43.470> this<00:04:43.620> open<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.720> cover<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:45.900> with

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
would live this open and cover it with

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.930 
would live this open and cover it with
cellophane<00:04:46.320> paper<00:04:46.650> so<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.400> gets<00:04:47.640> like

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
cellophane paper so that it gets like

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.520 
cellophane paper so that it gets like
the<00:04:48.090> greenhouse<00:04:48.479> effect<00:04:48.510> either<00:04:49.200> a

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
the greenhouse effect either a

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.680 
the greenhouse effect either a
cellophane<00:04:49.950> paper<00:04:50.070> or<00:04:50.490> put<00:04:51.030> it<00:04:51.120> inside<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.390> box

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
cellophane paper or put it inside a box

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.870 
cellophane paper or put it inside a box
I<00:04:52.080> would<00:04:52.680> not<00:04:52.950> let<00:04:53.130> any<00:04:53.310> oxygen

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
I would not let any oxygen

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.040 
I would not let any oxygen
pass<00:04:54.330> into<00:04:54.780> it<00:04:55.110> just<00:04:56.099> let<00:04:56.430> it<00:04:56.750> suffocate<00:04:57.750> kind

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
pass into it just let it suffocate kind

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.980 
pass into it just let it suffocate kind
of<00:04:58.669> and<00:04:59.669> then<00:04:59.940> maybe<00:05:00.000> after<00:05:00.510> two<00:05:00.630> days<00:05:00.810> I'll

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
of and then maybe after two days I'll

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.659 
of and then maybe after two days I'll
open<00:05:01.260> it<00:05:01.349> and<00:05:01.530> let<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:01.740> breathe<00:05:02.220> in<00:05:02.430> some

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
open it and let it breathe in some

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.520 
open it and let it breathe in some
oxygen<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.330> that's<00:05:03.630> when<00:05:03.840> I<00:05:03.870> put<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.169> top<00:05:04.349> in

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
oxygen and that's when I put the top in

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.290 
oxygen and that's when I put the top in
soil<00:05:04.770> or<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.729> topsoil<00:05:06.150> on<00:05:06.680> so<00:05:07.880> I'm<00:05:08.880> just<00:05:08.940> going

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
soil or the topsoil on so I'm just going

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.089 
soil or the topsoil on so I'm just going
to<00:05:09.330> go<00:05:09.479> ahead<00:05:09.570> and<00:05:09.780> put<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.200> soil<00:05:10.409> on<00:05:10.680> this

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
to go ahead and put the soil on this

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:11.510 
to go ahead and put the soil on this
time

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
time

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.580
