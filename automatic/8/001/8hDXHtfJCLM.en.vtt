drums<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.460> very<00:00:45.300> good<00:00:45.570> reason<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.500> got<00:00:47.129> rid

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
drums up very good reason that I got rid

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.119 
drums up very good reason that I got rid
of<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.550> sup<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.079> don't<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:50.100> don't

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
of that sup so you don't see you don't

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.799 
of that sup so you don't see you don't
see<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.370> too<00:00:50.489> often<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.480> pretty

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
see that too often but it's pretty

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.450 
see that too often but it's pretty
deadly<00:00:52.050> when<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.789> put<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.910> sleep<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
deadly when you do I put to sleep and

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.529 
deadly when you do I put to sleep and
hopefully<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.640> doesn't<00:00:56.789> wake<00:00:57.000> up<00:00:57.030> right<00:00:57.420> about

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
hopefully it doesn't wake up right about

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.810 
hopefully it doesn't wake up right about
here<00:00:57.949> because<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.129> would<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.430> good<00:00:59.520> at

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
here because that would not be good at

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.160 
here because that would not be good at
all<00:01:00.350> so<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.730> believe<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.820> set<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.090> my<00:01:03.120> own<00:01:03.270> sub<00:01:03.629> I'm

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
all so I believe I set up my own sub I'm

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.539 
all so I believe I set up my own sub I'm
probably<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.559> waiting<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:04.979> him<00:01:07.159> yep<00:01:08.159> set<00:01:08.490> up

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
probably just waiting on him yep set up

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.100 
probably just waiting on him yep set up
my<00:01:08.670> own<00:01:08.700> sub<00:01:09.350> stay<00:01:10.350> asleep<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.979> then<00:01:11.880> uh<00:01:12.110> focus

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
my own sub stay asleep and then uh focus

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
my own sub stay asleep and then uh focus
punches<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.590> pretty<00:01:13.770> predictable<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.880> I

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
punches are pretty predictable so I

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.670 
punches are pretty predictable so I
think<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.540> actually<00:01:15.659> went<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.080> seed<00:01:16.320> bomb<00:01:16.530> on

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
think I actually went with seed bomb on

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.530 
think I actually went with seed bomb on
this<00:01:16.830> one<00:01:17.040> yeah<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.880> case<00:01:17.909> he<00:01:18.210> switched

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
this one yeah just in case he switched

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
this one yeah just in case he switched
seed<00:01:19.259> bomb<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.509> if<00:01:21.509> he<00:01:21.659> slept<00:01:21.900> or<00:01:22.170> woke<00:01:22.320> up

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
seed bomb and if he slept or woke up

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.980 
seed bomb and if he slept or woke up
then<00:01:22.890> next<00:01:23.580> turn<00:01:23.820> will<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> same<00:01:24.659> result

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
then next turn will be the same result

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.780 
then next turn will be the same result
as<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.320> he<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.830> woke<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.159> normally<00:01:26.520> anyway

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
as if he just woke up normally anyway

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.850 
as if he just woke up normally anyway
from<00:01:27.060> focus<00:01:27.420> punch<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:28.020> he'd<00:01:28.229> still<00:01:28.770> get

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
from focus punch because he'd still get

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.819 
from focus punch because he'd still get
the<00:01:28.979> hit<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.520> whatever<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.409> don't<00:01:31.409> lose<00:01:31.590> out

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the hit in so whatever I don't lose out

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.530 
the hit in so whatever I don't lose out
and<00:01:32.040> uh<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:32.850> case<00:01:33.030> there's<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> ghost

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and uh just in case there's a ghost

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.170 
and uh just in case there's a ghost
switch<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.350> stay<00:01:34.680> safe<00:01:35.299> works<00:01:36.299> nice<00:01:38.000> it<00:01:39.000> brings

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
switch I stay safe works nice it brings

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.630 
switch I stay safe works nice it brings
in<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.420> bass<00:01:39.600> geodon<00:01:39.990> which<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.920> guess<00:01:41.100> he<00:01:41.310> wants

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
in a bass geodon which I guess he wants

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.910 
in a bass geodon which I guess he wants
to<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:41.850> raped<00:01:42.259> so<00:01:43.460> whatever<00:01:45.530> i'm<00:01:46.530> sure<00:01:46.799> you

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
to get raped so whatever i'm sure you

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.319 
to get raped so whatever i'm sure you
could<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.159> found<00:01:47.250> anything<00:01:47.700> else<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.240> it

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
could have found anything else and it

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.030 
could have found anything else and it
would<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.509> been<00:01:48.570> better<00:01:48.630> switching<00:01:49.290> this

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
would have been better switching this

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
I have a sub up I may as well use it so

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
hit is a hit so I'll switch out to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.750 
hit is a hit so I'll switch out to
something<00:02:45.960> better<00:02:46.080> now<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.620> go<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.250> star<00:02:47.550> me

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
something better now I go to star me

we'll take the fire Fang and resist it

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.610 
we'll take the fire Fang and resist it
nicely<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.340> then<00:02:51.090> as<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.360> bunch<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.380> different

nicely and then as a bunch of different

nicely and then as a bunch of different

the<00:02:55.070> question<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> which<00:02:57.090> one<00:02:57.240> does<00:02:57.360> he<00:02:57.390> want

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
the question is a which one does he want

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.570 
the question is a which one does he want
to<00:02:57.720> predict<00:02:58.080> because<00:02:58.710> different<00:02:59.040> guys<00:02:59.280> could

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
to predict because different guys could

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.490 
to predict because different guys could
use<00:02:59.730> different<00:03:00.090> absorbs<00:03:00.540> or<00:03:00.750> different

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
use different absorbs or different

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.320 
use different absorbs or different
resistances<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.070> maybe<00:03:02.790> take<00:03:03.060> less<00:03:03.300> damage

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
resistances and maybe take less damage

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.050 
resistances and maybe take less damage
then<00:03:03.959> if<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.890> printed<00:03:05.250> something<00:03:05.459> else<00:03:05.700> so

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
then if you printed something else so

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.520 
then if you printed something else so
that's<00:03:06.570> what<00:03:06.690> he's<00:03:06.810> thinking<00:03:07.140> about<00:03:07.230> right

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
that's what he's thinking about right

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.610 
that's what he's thinking about right
now<00:03:08.360> sent<00:03:09.360> our<00:03:09.480> lap<00:03:09.690> wrist<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.170> really<00:03:10.440> didn't

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
now sent our lap wrist so really didn't

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.100 
now sent our lap wrist so really didn't
matter<00:03:10.680> which<00:03:10.920> one<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.130> picked<00:03:11.459> but<00:03:12.360> uh<00:03:12.390> we've

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
matter which one I picked but uh we've

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.810 
matter which one I picked but uh we've
been<00:03:13.140> better<00:03:13.380> if<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.590> play<00:03:13.739> dice<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.520> didn't

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
been better if I play dice and I didn't

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.220 
been better if I play dice and I didn't
so<00:03:15.090> whatever<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:17.810> don't<00:03:18.810> want<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.989> stay<00:03:19.200> in

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
so whatever I don't want to stay in

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.320 
so whatever I don't want to stay in
there<00:03:19.500> even<00:03:20.459> though<00:03:20.550> I<00:03:20.580> could<00:03:20.820> be<00:03:21.000> built<00:03:21.180> it

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
there even though I could be built it

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.760 
there even though I could be built it
myself<00:03:21.360> because<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.050> know<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.290> packs<00:03:22.470> its<00:03:22.650> own

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
myself because I know it packs its own

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.920 
myself because I know it packs its own
table<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.989> bringing<00:03:24.989> my<00:03:25.230> best<00:03:25.470> more<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:27.720> save

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
table so bringing my best more to save

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.120 
table so bringing my best more to save
the<00:03:28.110> day<00:03:28.290> takes<00:03:29.280> nice<00:03:29.610> beam<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:31.130> will-o'-wisp

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
the day takes nice beam I will-o'-wisp

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.460 
the day takes nice beam I will-o'-wisp
it<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:33.180> doesn't<00:03:33.510> really<00:03:33.600> affect<00:03:33.750> its<00:03:34.110> attack

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
it it doesn't really affect its attack

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.740 
it it doesn't really affect its attack
but<00:03:34.980> it'll<00:03:35.310> just<00:03:35.489> slowly<00:03:35.700> hurt<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.180> that's<00:03:36.540> all

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
but it'll just slowly hurt it that's all

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.680 
but it'll just slowly hurt it that's all
I'm<00:03:36.870> really<00:03:37.080> concerned<00:03:37.350> about<00:03:38.540> because<00:03:39.540> I

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
I'm really concerned about because I

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.120 
I'm really concerned about because I
know<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.840> can<00:03:40.020> stay<00:03:40.230> here<00:03:40.260> all<00:03:40.470> day<00:03:40.560> with<00:03:40.890> dust

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
know I can stay here all day with dust

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.310 
know I can stay here all day with dust
