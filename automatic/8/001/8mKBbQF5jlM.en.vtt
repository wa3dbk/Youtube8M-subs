00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.420
 take it out on yourself she wants to say 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.240
 that the mouse costs only 20 euros 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.910

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.670

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:31.610

 understood from inside a little pazzerella that 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.250
 we will talk I think the new mouse 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.950
 of the cm storm or of the ops horner 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.880
 which as you have already understood from the center is 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.300
 a mouse that has a really low cost 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.940
 can say or 20 euros I paid 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.700
 in with all the shipping though 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.060
 guys the package has arrived now then 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.600
 now we will open and deal with this 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.600
 Msgr 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:40.129
 [Music] 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:41.569
 here he is, the boys are interested 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.209
 sorry the bang is only at 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.239
 picking up a boom anyway here we are 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:52.250
 here guys this is the box of 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.959
 mouse format as you can see right away 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.739
 we give written going there are 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.239
 2000 dpi which is really a lot for one 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.180
 15 euro mouse 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.760
 the screen goes on anyway now 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.870
 let's go immediately to open it it seems 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.629
 so it's ok watch the boys 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.650
 beauty of this box we can 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.750
 see the mouse immediately with a screen 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.299
 so with a figure that represents us 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.560
 all the technical features in the 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:27.169
 but our box is in English 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.919
 however, I don't know anything about the rush 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:34.310
 wall I talk anyway let's move on to another ad 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:38.300
 see the real technical specifications e 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.420
 this mouse has its own turn 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.060
 because we have wood inside 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.290
 it worked so I can tell the scale 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.260
 here we see immediately this 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.390
 new guys is really beautiful 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.930
 look around 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.750
 then here we find immediately inside 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:03.230
 this would therefore be the guarantee 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.820
 boys eye conquest that if mouse and 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.420
 then to some operations that you want 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.910
 to save 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.419
 then after that we have this booklet 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:19.540
 with all the instructions we can see 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:22.000
 that tells us everything I know it is now 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.949
 with the English trani does not put me 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.010
 look for my language 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:30.940
 still nothing here, there are all 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:34.060
 precisely the parts of our mouse also 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.760
 the first concern of what shows up here 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.020
 but now let's move on to the mouse that 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:45.780
 really guys it's awesome ie I have 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.780
 seen only by a and now I'm from the south 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.330
 so I didn't know what I was going to 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:56.819
 deal but I have to tell you guys that it is 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:00.190
 truly spectacular ie what thing 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:02.979
 you want to tell a mouse like this 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.289
 we can see it we can see 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.430
 the keys of the plans that these two 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:13.479
 keys to the sides anyway apart from that is 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:16.720
 the mons and if so it's very much 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:20.229
 comfortable we can see why at this 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.050
 this let's say I don't know this ledge 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:26.470
 which in my opinion serves to support 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.690
 This Vito and saw that others Msgr 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.520
 let's face it, I 'm a little uncomfortable 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.580
 after a while they also have bad hands 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.220
 because on the near are comfortable 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.960
 but with this mouse we could be 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.080
 comfortable all the time, however we see 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.099
 the logo of the cm storm 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.780
 all 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:51.810
 at the bottom of this mouse and gives the name 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:56.060
 he provided precisely that on it 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.710
 ledge then okay we have here comes 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.300
 to move the mouse and we have no 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.539
 follow this is 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.099
 are are two meters of wire it seems to me 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.720
 that I am not mistaken 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:12.460
 anyway guys what to say about this 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.389
 mouse well I say I can tell you one thing 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.430
 one 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:18.629
 go to any website e 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:22.090
 ordered to the boys because it really is 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:25.210
 spectacular now we move on to 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.550
 try and so you can see live on 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.120
 internet on my computer and 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.340
 consumer this way here we are 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.960
 guys this is the proof I have you 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.930
 said before the mouse 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.090
 then I must tell you that if mine is first 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.310
 impressions of this new were good 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.099
 now they are fantastic 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.259
 because we say this mouse e 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:49.509
 spectacular never experienced such a thing 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.759
 and I have to say at the beginning I am 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:53.379
 found a little strange and let's say we did one 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.780
 feeling a little weird 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:58.560
 this ledge on which we can 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.750
 place it and three fingers on the mouse 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.620
 but let's say after a while what you do 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.529
 the habit 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.720
 this mouse is a boys team i ve 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:10.840
 I recommend it as I did before 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:14.740
 and nothing this was to foresee to do 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:17.590
 see how this super mouse works 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.420
 see you guys at the next video 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.880
 I remind you to pass for mine 

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:24.040
 channel to sign up put milia 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.100
