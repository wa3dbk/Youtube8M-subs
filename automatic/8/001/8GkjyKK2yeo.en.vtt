00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.760 
keep pulling it like it'll keep going it
okay<00:02:20.260> keep<00:02:20.680> giving<00:02:21.150> but<00:02:22.170> once<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.290> pull<00:02:23.560> back

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
okay keep giving but once you pull back

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.590 
okay keep giving but once you pull back
of<00:02:24.040> course<00:02:24.220> because<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.880> teeth<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.450> are

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
of course because of the teeth that are

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.860 
of course because of the teeth that are
in<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.380> in<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.950> clip<00:02:27.220> here<00:02:27.460> they<00:02:28.300> won't<00:02:28.630> go

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
in the in the clip here they won't go

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.230 
in the in the clip here they won't go
back<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.830> won't<00:02:30.040> give<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.280> mean<00:02:30.580> these<00:02:31.030> have

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
back so it won't give I mean these have

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.090 
back so it won't give I mean these have
really<00:02:31.480> good<00:02:31.750> ratings<00:02:32.110> as<00:02:32.260> far<00:02:32.500> as<00:02:32.650> how<00:02:32.890> much

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
really good ratings as far as how much

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.280 
really good ratings as far as how much
weight<00:02:33.580> they<00:02:33.820> hold<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.780> fact<00:02:35.020> that<00:02:35.110> they

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
weight they hold and the fact that they

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.840 
weight they hold and the fact that they
don't<00:02:35.410> slip<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.100> they're<00:02:36.760> actually<00:02:36.959> cheap

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
don't slip and they're actually cheap

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.280 
don't slip and they're actually cheap
for<00:02:39.850> what<00:02:40.240> they're<00:02:40.510> supposed<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.870> be<00:02:41.020> used<00:02:41.200> for

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
for what they're supposed to be used for

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.210 
for what they're supposed to be used for
so<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.730> straps<00:02:43.060> are<00:02:43.240> actually<00:02:43.680> really<00:02:44.680> really

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
so the straps are actually really really

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.560 
so the straps are actually really really
long<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:47.680> should<00:02:47.709> not<00:02:48.370> have<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.760> problem<00:02:49.420> as

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
long you should not have a problem as

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.940 
long you should not have a problem as
far<00:02:49.600> as<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.080> length<00:02:50.260> is<00:02:50.500> concerned<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:52.950> tell

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
far as the length is concerned I tell

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.410 
far as the length is concerned I tell
you<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.070> truth<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.310> haven't<00:02:54.489> really<00:02:54.940> measured

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
you the truth I haven't really measured

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.190 
you the truth I haven't really measured
it<00:02:55.620> but<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.950> mean<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:58.840> easily<00:02:59.830> easily<00:03:00.430> have

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
it but I mean you easily easily have

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.410 
it but I mean you easily easily have
over<00:03:02.200> 6<00:03:02.590> feet<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:05.770> fan<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.459> work<00:03:06.700> with<00:03:06.940> once

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
over 6 feet of a fan to work with once

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.020 
over 6 feet of a fan to work with once
it's<00:03:07.600> actually<00:03:07.989> hung<00:03:08.230> up<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.850> can

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
it's actually hung up and you can

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.400 
it's actually hung up and you can
shorten<00:03:10.330> it<00:03:10.420> as<00:03:10.570> much<00:03:10.720> as<00:03:10.840> possible<00:03:11.050> and

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
shorten it as much as possible and

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.890 
shorten it as much as possible and
pretty<00:03:11.590> much<00:03:11.800> this<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:12.760> how<00:03:13.090> it'll<00:03:13.300> look<00:03:13.390> the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
pretty much this is how it'll look the

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.590 
pretty much this is how it'll look the
band<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.830> know<00:03:14.920> will<00:03:15.130> run<00:03:16.060> through<00:03:16.390> the

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
band you know will run through the

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.420 
band you know will run through the
through<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.230> ring<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.739> then<00:03:18.190> you'll

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
through the ring and then you'll

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.220 
through the ring and then you'll
eventually<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:19.360> know<00:03:19.450> whenever<00:03:20.049> they're

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
eventually you know whenever they're

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.050 
eventually you know whenever they're
hanging<00:03:20.620> or<00:03:20.709> whatever<00:03:21.040> you'll<00:03:21.310> put<00:03:21.549> your<00:03:21.700> foot

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
hanging or whatever you'll put your foot

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.850 
hanging or whatever you'll put your foot
through<00:03:22.090> here<00:03:22.600> or<00:03:22.840> your<00:03:22.989> hand<00:03:23.290> or<00:03:23.560> whatever

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
through here or your hand or whatever

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.050 
through here or your hand or whatever
