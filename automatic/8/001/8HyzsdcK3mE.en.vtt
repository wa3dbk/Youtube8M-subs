kepler has an issue and it's a big issue

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.700 
kepler has an issue and it's a big issue
when<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:13.490> comes<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.910> using<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.479> toilet<00:01:14.710> and

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
when it comes to using the toilet and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.290 
when it comes to using the toilet and
you<00:01:15.830> had<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.039> same<00:01:16.070> issue<00:01:16.430> when<00:01:16.670> he<00:01:16.789> was<00:01:16.940> using

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
you had the same issue when he was using

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.889 
you had the same issue when he was using
the<00:01:17.690> litter<00:01:17.930> box<00:01:18.520> Kepler<00:01:19.520> will<00:01:20.450> get<00:01:20.570> into<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
the litter box Kepler will get into the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.480 
the litter box Kepler will get into the
litter<00:01:21.050> box<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:21.619> he'll<00:01:21.860> dig<00:01:22.039> himself<00:01:22.430> a

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
litter box and he'll dig himself a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.910 
litter box and he'll dig himself a
little<00:01:22.610> hole<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.000> then<00:01:23.090> he'll<00:01:23.240> sit<00:01:23.420> down<00:01:23.920> he

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
little hole and then he'll sit down he

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.219 
little hole and then he'll sit down he
doesn't<00:01:25.130> try<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.550> squat<00:01:25.940> into<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.450> hole<00:01:26.630> he

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
doesn't try to squat into the hole he

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.719 
doesn't try to squat into the hole he
digs<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.530> hole<00:01:27.560> in<00:01:27.920> front<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.310> him<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.610> then

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
digs a hole in front of him and then

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.700 
digs a hole in front of him and then
just<00:01:28.910> sits<00:01:29.090> down<00:01:29.179> now<00:01:29.960> this<00:01:30.140> has<00:01:30.259> led<00:01:30.410> to<00:01:30.440> some

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
just sits down now this has led to some

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.710 
just sits down now this has led to some
problems<00:01:31.369> because<00:01:31.580> whenever<00:01:32.539> they<00:01:32.660> were

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
problems because whenever they were

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.240 
problems because whenever they were
using<00:01:32.929> the<00:01:33.110> litter<00:01:33.259> box<00:01:33.470> sometimes<00:01:33.710> his<00:01:34.070> poop

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
using the litter box sometimes his poop

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.520 
using the litter box sometimes his poop
would<00:01:34.399> be<00:01:34.550> kind<00:01:34.850> of<00:01:34.940> on<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.270> edge<00:01:35.530> this

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
would be kind of on the edge this

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.960 
would be kind of on the edge this
presents<00:01:36.830> some<00:01:37.070> serious<00:01:37.490> problems<00:01:37.850> when

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
presents some serious problems when

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.870 
presents some serious problems when
using<00:01:38.149> this<00:01:38.479> thing<00:01:38.780> because<00:01:39.310> Kepler<00:01:40.310> as<00:01:40.490> I

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
using this thing because Kepler as I

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.480 
using this thing because Kepler as I
watched<00:01:41.119> him<00:01:41.300> do<00:01:41.450> today<00:01:41.780> will<00:01:42.679> jump<00:01:43.039> up<00:01:43.190> here

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
watched him do today will jump up here

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.639 
watched him do today will jump up here
and<00:01:43.700> he'll<00:01:44.509> dig<00:01:44.720> a<00:01:44.750> little<00:01:44.929> hole<00:01:45.080> in<00:01:45.319> front<00:01:45.500> of

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
and he'll dig a little hole in front of

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.499 
and he'll dig a little hole in front of
him<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:47.060> then<00:01:47.270> he'll<00:01:47.420> pee<00:01:47.599> or<00:01:48.560> he'll<00:01:48.740> poop<00:01:49.509> all

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
him and then he'll pee or he'll poop all

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.570 
him and then he'll pee or he'll poop all
over<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.929> place<00:01:51.170> this<00:01:52.039> morning<00:01:52.250> I<00:01:52.459> was

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
over the place this morning I was

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.180 
over the place this morning I was
sitting<00:01:52.670> in<00:01:52.849> my<00:01:52.880> chair<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:53.179> I<00:01:53.300> heard<00:01:54.069> and<00:01:55.069> I

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
sitting in my chair and I heard and I

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.550 
sitting in my chair and I heard and I
was<00:01:55.310> thinking<00:01:55.429> huh<00:01:55.910> I<00:01:56.270> know<00:01:57.140> what<00:01:57.259> that<00:01:57.440> could

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
was thinking huh I know what that could

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.729 
was thinking huh I know what that could
be

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:57.739 
be

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.370 
be
Oh<00:01:58.459> Kepler<00:01:58.940> must<00:01:59.119> be<00:01:59.239> using<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.660> bathroom<00:02:00.200> and

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
Oh Kepler must be using the bathroom and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.440 
Oh Kepler must be using the bathroom and
then<00:02:00.530> I'm<00:02:00.649> thinking<00:02:00.679> why<00:02:01.190> do<00:02:01.250> I<00:02:01.640> hear<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:02.179> so

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
then I'm thinking why do I hear it so

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.499 
then I'm thinking why do I hear it so
strongly<00:02:02.899> it<00:02:03.200> sounded<00:02:03.500> like<00:02:03.530> dripping<00:02:04.509> and

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
strongly it sounded like dripping and

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.960 
strongly it sounded like dripping and
Kepler<00:02:05.929> did<00:02:06.170> manage<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.649> start<00:02:07.340> peeing<00:02:07.670> up

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
Kepler did manage to start peeing up

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.660 
Kepler did manage to start peeing up
here<00:02:08.330> but<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:09.020> quickly<00:02:09.289> went<00:02:10.160> all<00:02:10.340> over<00:02:10.369> the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
here but it quickly went all over the

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.949 
here but it quickly went all over the
floor<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.180> was<00:02:11.270> everywhere<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.870> was

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
floor and it was everywhere and I was

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.580 
floor and it was everywhere and I was
like<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.640> cleaned<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.060> up<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.590> then

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
like so I cleaned that up and then

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.570 
like so I cleaned that up and then
probably<00:02:16.489> 20<00:02:17.150> minutes<00:02:17.180> later<00:02:18.370> Kepler<00:02:19.370> came

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
probably 20 minutes later Kepler came

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.100 
probably 20 minutes later Kepler came
back<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:19.940> here<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:20.270> actually<00:02:20.390> watched<00:02:20.810> him

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
back in here and I actually watched him

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.309 
back in here and I actually watched him
poop<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.770> he<00:02:22.459> pooped<00:02:22.760> right<00:02:23.420> on<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.810> seat<00:02:24.050> and

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
poop and he pooped right on the seat and

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.710 
poop and he pooped right on the seat and
it<00:02:24.830> was<00:02:24.980> like<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:25.910> about<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.300> follow<00:02:26.480> also

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
it was like just about the follow also

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.540 
it was like just about the follow also
was<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:26.989> ton<00:02:27.349> it<00:02:27.680> was<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.860> ridiculous<00:02:28.400> amount

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
was a ton it was a ridiculous amount

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.220 
was a ton it was a ridiculous amount
there<00:02:28.940> was<00:02:29.030> about<00:02:29.239> to<00:02:29.360> fall<00:02:29.510> over<00:02:29.569> onto<00:02:30.110> the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
there was about to fall over onto the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.080 
there was about to fall over onto the
under<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:30.950> floor<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.489> he<00:02:31.640> doesn't<00:02:31.849> really

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
under the floor and he doesn't really

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.540 
under the floor and he doesn't really
make<00:02:32.360> any<00:02:32.599> attempt<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.230> call<00:02:33.470> like<00:02:33.709> cover<00:02:34.340> it

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
make any attempt to call like cover it

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.400 
make any attempt to call like cover it
he<00:02:34.910> just<00:02:35.090> does<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.450> then<00:02:35.629> he's<00:02:35.780> like<00:02:35.930> yeah<00:02:36.260> I'm

done

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.970 
done
so<00:02:38.000> yeah<00:02:38.540> that's<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.870> thing<00:02:39.140> sagging<00:02:39.709> however

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
so yeah that's a thing sagging however

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.949 
so yeah that's a thing sagging however
is<00:02:40.160> doing<00:02:40.400> well<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.910> they<00:02:41.000> both<00:02:41.239> aren't<00:02:41.599> using

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
is doing well and they both aren't using

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.449 
is doing well and they both aren't using
the<00:02:42.230> toilet<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.650> mean<00:02:42.800> they're<00:02:42.920> jumping<00:02:43.250> up<00:02:43.370> on

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
the toilet I mean they're jumping up on

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.970 
the toilet I mean they're jumping up on
the<00:02:43.520> toilet<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.090> that's<00:02:44.420> good<00:02:44.890> we're<00:02:45.890> getting

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
the toilet so that's good we're getting

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.449 
the toilet so that's good we're getting
somewhere

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
somewhere

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.680 
somewhere
I<00:02:46.700> mean<00:02:47.629> I<00:02:47.719> guess<00:02:47.930> at<00:02:48.170> this<00:02:48.319> point

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
I mean I guess at this point

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.050 
I mean I guess at this point
could<00:02:48.840> officially<00:02:49.350> say<00:02:49.620> my<00:02:50.250> cats<00:02:50.520> can<00:02:50.760> use<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
could officially say my cats can use the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.670 
could officially say my cats can use the
toilet<00:02:52.910> sort<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.030> there<00:02:54.810> sooner<00:02:55.050> had<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.290> filmed

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
toilet sort of there sooner had I filmed

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680 
toilet sort of there sooner had I filmed
that<00:02:55.710> last<00:02:56.070> click<00:02:56.430> then<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.910> Kepler<00:02:57.270> came<00:02:57.480> in

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
that last click then I Kepler came in

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.530 
that last click then I Kepler came in
and<00:02:57.930> did<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> little<00:02:58.380> Doody<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.330> cleaned<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.390> up

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
and did a little Doody I cleaned it up

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.450 
and did a little Doody I cleaned it up
you<00:03:01.410> guys<00:03:01.530> don't<00:03:01.740> go<00:03:01.860> look<00:03:02.010> at<00:03:02.130> that

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
you guys don't go look at that

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.700 
you guys don't go look at that
and<00:03:02.820> actually<00:03:03.630> one<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.020> most<00:03:04.200> convenient

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
and actually one of the most convenient

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.650 
and actually one of the most convenient
things<00:03:05.160> about<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.120> fact<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.420> this

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
things about this and the fact that this

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.360 
things about this and the fact that this
doesn't<00:03:06.930> actually<00:03:07.020> fit<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.710> that<00:03:07.950> when<00:03:08.250> I'm

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
doesn't actually fit is that when I'm

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.530 
doesn't actually fit is that when I'm
done<00:03:08.490> it<00:03:08.640> just<00:03:08.790> good<00:03:09.860> sure<00:03:11.030> sure<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.300> he<00:03:12.390> goes

done it just good sure sure and he goes
all<00:03:12.720> in<00:03:12.870> there<00:03:13.020> so<00:03:13.650> there's<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:13.950> bunch<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.190> like

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
all in there so there's a bunch of like

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.280 
cat poop and can't pee in litter in

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
there but it is washable you have to let

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.100 
there but it is washable you have to let
it<00:03:19.320> sit<00:03:19.410> 20<00:03:19.890> minutes<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.430> now<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:21.540> said<00:03:21.840> 20

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
it sit 20 minutes so now that said 20

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.890 
it sit 20 minutes so now that said 20
minutes<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.470> then<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.680> flush<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.040> and

minutes and then I flush it and

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.800 
minutes and then I flush it and
hopefully<00:03:24.900> one<00:03:25.230> day<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.740> won't<00:03:25.920> even<00:03:26.040> eat<00:03:26.250> that

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
hopefully one day we won't even eat that

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.360 
hopefully one day we won't even eat that
as<00:03:27.810> far<00:03:28.050> as<00:03:28.080> how<00:03:28.350> long<00:03:28.560> you're<00:03:28.800> really<00:03:29.040> doing

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
as far as how long you're really doing

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.770 
as far as how long you're really doing
this<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.790> talked<00:03:30.300> about<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.690> little

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
this I talked about it a little

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.890 
this I talked about it a little
yesterday<00:03:31.350> but<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:32.130> think<00:03:32.790> I'm<00:03:32.940> going<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.360> keep

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
yesterday but I think I'm going to keep

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.310 
yesterday but I think I'm going to keep
them<00:03:34.140> on<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.680> thing<00:03:35.010> for<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:36.690> says<00:03:37.020> two<00:03:37.260> to

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
them on that thing for it says two to

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.130 
them on that thing for it says two to
three<00:03:37.560> weeks<00:03:37.820> we'll<00:03:38.820> probably<00:03:39.090> do<00:03:39.510> one<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.930> two

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
three weeks we'll probably do one to two

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.290 
three weeks we'll probably do one to two
because<00:03:40.530> mutt<00:03:40.800> cats<00:03:41.100> are<00:03:41.340> smarter<00:03:41.910> than<00:03:41.940> the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
because mutt cats are smarter than the

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.090 
because mutt cats are smarter than the

average bear well if it's okay with Mau
and<00:03:47.100> assuming<00:03:47.790> we<00:03:48.150> we<00:03:48.690> are<00:03:48.870> okay<00:03:49.170> with<00:03:49.290> moving
