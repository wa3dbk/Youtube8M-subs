00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.110
 new stage new recipe this time 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.360
 we are in Lazio 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.849
 we will prepare the lamb chops 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.410
 is nothing more than the lamb alla 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.480
 scottadito as the name suggests 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.630
 they will still be served very hot 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.990
 listen to the fingers we are ready le 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.670
 our lamb chops go to 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.109
 cut to divide we keep a thickness 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.109
 about an inch and a half 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.820
 gently also because the meat is 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.809
 very soft the ribs go 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.879
 slightly beat this way 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.489
 cooking will be much faster 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.750
 we keep a little bit of their fat 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:03.530
 to keep them soft and count 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.530
 already with salt pepper 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:13.200
 we are ready to cook it we go to 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.150
 put the hot lard inside and 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:27.500
 it is like rubbing and immediately becomes hot 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:30.329
 We settle our early chops 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.939
 we cook them two minutes on each side 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.460
 just made the crust we go to 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.740
 turn to the other side you see how the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.930
 crust has formed but we keep the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.060
 beautiful intense stem inside the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.979
 meat we seal the meat holes 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.630
 itself and we maintain all the properties 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.180
 nutritive inside 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.610
 at this point our ribs are 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.369
 ready to be served see how 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.829
 they became golden brown but anyway 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.390
 inside they kept theirs 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.390
 culture rather to the blood 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.890
 we end with a few sprigs of 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.970
 rosemary to give a little perfume e 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.209
 to give a little color finally a thread 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.489
 of oil our ribs hear rite 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.950
 they are ready we just have to taste them 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.550
 I give you an appointment for the next recipe 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.550
 of regional cuisine
