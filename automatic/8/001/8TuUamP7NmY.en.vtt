because we do have an audience there's
an<00:01:43.530> audience<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.070> quite<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> number<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:45.259> people

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
an audience and quite a number of people

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.920 
an audience and quite a number of people
from<00:01:46.770> some<00:01:47.369> saloons<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.299> saloon<00:01:48.750> that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
