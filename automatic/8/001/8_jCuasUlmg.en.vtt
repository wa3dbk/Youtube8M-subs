so<00:00:00.240> today<00:00:00.750> what<00:00:01.020> we'll<00:00:01.230> be<00:00:01.439> showing<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:02.250> a<00:00:03.149> way

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
so today what we'll be showing is a way

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.740 
so today what we'll be showing is a way
of<00:00:03.480> extracting<00:00:04.250> stromal<00:00:05.250> cells<00:00:05.790> from<00:00:06.240> adipose

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
tissue or lipo aspirated fact it's the

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.620 
tissue or lipo aspirated fact it's the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
patient first part of the procedure is

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.729 
patient first part of the procedure is
take<00:00:31.769> blood<00:00:32.009> from<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.669> patient<00:00:36.559> what<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
take blood from the patient what the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:48.660 
take blood from the patient what the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.110 

now<00:00:49.670> I'm<00:00:49.760> going<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:49.969> use<00:00:50.120> two<00:00:50.390> sterile<00:00:50.809> tubes

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
now I'm going to use two sterile tubes

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.729 
now I'm going to use two sterile tubes
blank<00:00:53.120> blood<00:00:53.480> tubes<00:00:53.809> or<00:00:54.019> any<00:00:54.140> other<00:00:54.320> sterile

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
tubes 15 mil conical 's just try and put

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.160 
tubes 15 mil conical 's just try and put
an<00:00:58.610> even<00:00:58.879> concentration<00:00:59.690> because<00:00:59.960> what<00:01:00.110> I

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
an even concentration because what I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.710 
an even concentration because what I
want<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.409> do<00:01:00.530> now<00:01:00.710> is<00:01:00.739> Reese<00:01:01.070> pin<00:01:01.339> it<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:02.449> I<00:01:02.480> can

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
want to do now is Reese pin it so I can

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.780 
want to do now is Reese pin it so I can
remove<00:01:03.050> that<00:01:03.970> liposomal<00:01:06.070> mix<00:01:07.070> that's<00:01:07.369> present

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
remove that liposomal mix that's present

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.889 
remove that liposomal mix that's present
in<00:01:07.850> that<00:01:08.030> fluid<00:01:09.729> or<00:01:10.729> any<00:01:10.850> fat<00:01:11.210> leftover<00:01:12.399> and

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
in that fluid or any fat leftover and

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.029 
in that fluid or any fat leftover and
weary<00:01:14.899> spin<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.550> at<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.729> same<00:01:16.970> speed<00:01:18.039> 1,000

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
weary spin that at the same speed 1,000

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.249 
weary spin that at the same speed 1,000
G's<00:01:19.250> once<00:01:19.580> again<00:01:19.850> for<00:01:20.060> 10<00:01:20.240> minutes<00:01:20.570> what<00:01:21.110> we

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
G's once again for 10 minutes what we

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:22.960 
G's once again for 10 minutes what we
now<00:01:21.500> will<00:01:21.890> get<00:01:22.039> we'll<00:01:22.280> get<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.640> pellet

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
now will get we'll get the pellet

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.570 
now will get we'll get the pellet
reforming<00:01:23.780> but<00:01:24.350> we<00:01:24.440> can<00:01:24.619> remove<00:01:24.920> this<00:01:25.190> fluid

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
reforming but we can remove this fluid

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.190 
reforming but we can remove this fluid
layer<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.330> we<00:01:26.509> can<00:01:26.690> reach<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:26.869> spend

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
layer and we can reach to spend

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.910 
layer and we can reach to spend
ourselves<00:01:27.649> in<00:01:27.770> some<00:01:27.950> sterile<00:01:28.310> sailing<00:01:29.860> try<00:01:30.860> to

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
ourselves in some sterile sailing try to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:40.700 
ourselves in some sterile sailing try to
combine<00:01:31.369> them<00:01:31.550> all<00:01:31.840> in<00:01:32.840> one<00:01:33.140> two

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.340 

so<00:01:41.310> we've<00:01:41.460> combined<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.210> self<00:01:42.570> suspension

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
so we've combined that self suspension

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.930 
so we've combined that self suspension
with<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.100> patient's<00:01:44.580> PRP<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:46.700> we<00:01:47.700> want<00:01:47.880> to

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
with the patient's PRP and we want to

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.760 
with the patient's PRP and we want to
make<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.210> about<00:01:48.420> 15<00:01:49.080> mils<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.500> want<00:01:49.620> to<00:01:49.680> have

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
make it about 15 mils we want to have

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.530 
make it about 15 mils we want to have
enough<00:01:50.010> surface<00:01:50.280> area<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.970> when<00:01:51.120> we<00:01:51.240> put<00:01:51.450> in

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
enough surface area so when we put in

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.380 
enough surface area so when we put in
the<00:01:51.570> light<00:01:51.950> we've<00:01:52.950> been<00:01:53.340> trying<00:01:53.760> to<00:01:53.880> show<00:01:54.180> is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
the light we've been trying to show is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.290 
the light we've been trying to show is
that<00:01:54.470> in<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.590> very<00:01:55.620> simple<00:01:56.280> way<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.520> how<00:01:56.940> we<00:01:57.000> can

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
that in a very simple way of how we can

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.790 
that in a very simple way of how we can
combine<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:57.780> benefits<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.620> body

combine the benefits of what the body

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.640 
combine the benefits of what the body
can<00:01:58.890> give<00:01:59.250> us<00:01:59.430> to<00:02:00.060> give<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.360> back<00:02:00.510> to<00:02:01.200> help<00:02:01.410> in
