00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 welcome to fruit ev today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.710
 I will be my personal best 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.180
 tips and tricks for the samsung galaxy 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:16.650
 introduce s 5 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:18.660
 So let's get started so we start 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.340
 time to the first thing I noticed 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.510
 before I could even do that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.519
 Handy was that I first 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.260
 once felt a thousand times any 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.150
 data regulations and licenses 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.920
 had to confirm in the spirit 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.720
 Turn is that my photos mine 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.219
 soul and all my data no longer 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.780
 belong to me and the operators mine 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.250
 can use data for everything if it is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.690
 me confirmed if the operators the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.190
 I exclude from society 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.270
 that's pretty much on my bag 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.800
 I finally got it 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.059
 managed and what comes around the corner 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.809
 does not come to palm trees yes 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.910
 exactly 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.710
 at bagassi and nowhere where do you find 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.270
 a setting to disable that 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.039
 The solution is quite simple 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.629
 on the home screen the fingers 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.190
 contract and also start 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.050
 press settings and already finds 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.160
 the menu item may magazine and here 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.160
 then you can disable it and already 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.609
 there are crawl wherever you want the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.290
 gloriously 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.060
 Let's get to number two 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.290
 for march numbers enthusiastic and mobile phone 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.580
 professionals are interesting because if you are now 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.689
 on phone clicks asterisk rhombus zero 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.460
 star 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.750
 Trautwein enters 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.920
 Self-test generator 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.689
 Here you can test all functions 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.570
 the smartphone you have to offer 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.650
 can test the colors 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.650
 you can test the cameras 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.159
 you can test the leds 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.820
 here you can have sensors of it and still 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.260
 much more 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.940
 Just click through it 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.680
 very interesting but a useless one 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.730
 I still have for you if you know 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.920
 now, for example, on the sensor 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.440
 since and above on the images it clicks 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.970
 then a process appears small dog 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.480
 it is actually the dog of paris 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.370
 hilton 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.930
 you do not know we are coming to the tip 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.340
 number three has certainly noticed 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.930
 if you have the fingerprint sensor 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.640
 uses your finger does not always 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.020
 it is recognized by the error rate 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.370
 I recommend you the same 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.870
 to save finger often 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.729
 To do this, go to the settings 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.259
 fingerprint sensor and sets twice 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.550
 the same finger a tip number four 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.959
 You have already noticed that 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.490
 it's his attitude totally 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.020
 is confusing where you always 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.790
 stupid and stupid looking but you can do that 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.050
 just change right at the top right 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.980
 click on the three dots and the 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.780
 change view 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.490
 either in a tabs form 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.200
 or in a list form me personally 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.540
 find the tab on the 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.709
 Best tip number five Samsung 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.060
 Smartphones have the property 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.470
 own very large display 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.090
 that's why he is a very hand-operated company 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.680
 difficult to design so I too 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.120
 already apple made fun of it 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.410
 but samsung could not do that 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.150
 let sit and developed the 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.570
 proper operation to go 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:46.910
 Settings then on and on 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.200
 some turn on and on now 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.459
 just a left-right move on 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.440
 make the home screen and already 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.420
 it turns on automatically 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.280
 the screen is reached small uni 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.450
 all with just one hand the whole can 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.489
 you can enlarge it now, too 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.780
 shrinking depends on your hand on it 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.799
 I think this feature is very cool 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.420
 If you are just a hand to 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.519
 has available and that often comes on 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.140
 the day before eight the boys know what I am 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.760
 to use it again normally 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.640
 just click on the top left and you know 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.200
 the whole thing closes again 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.459
 Tip number 6 and injury 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.930
 To get open apps click one 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.670
 just press the lower left button 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.049
 just wanted the performance of the galaxy 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.970
 need to focus on a program 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.769
 to close the active application to 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.269
 just click on the graphic and 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.799
 accordingly the apps end and only 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.450
 The applications let him activate 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.519
 just wanted to use for example one 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.769
 play number 7 or so on 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.600
 Helpful tool is the toolbox around you 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.430
 to activate zeal the notifications 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.959
 open and turn on the toolbox 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.880
 then a circle with three appears 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.230
 Score from the screen this can 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.519
 move her wherever he goes 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.629
 just needs to edit it 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:50.950
 just go to settings device 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:53.650
 toolbox and then just edit here 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.780
 do what we like to do and 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.269
 turn off what he does not like on the 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.069
 toolbox and want to save 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.750
 Let's get to number eight 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.760
 Camera has some good one constantly you 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.319
 would like to show more clearly once 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.329
 Selective focus ultimately that 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.980
 focus in retrospect still were either 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.810
 everything in front or everything in the back 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.010
 sharp or even both that one can 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.930
 edit easily 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.849
 Another cool effect is the 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.340
 slow motion you just go one 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.169
 settings recording mode and presses 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:26.800
 on slow motion and choose the slowest 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:28.270
 yes it does not just look like it has 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.440
 really hurt because I still have one 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.150
 repeated a few times but since the 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.680
 I did not want to burst the balloon 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.750
 you say the balance here the smaller 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.010
 it is more painful that I know now 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.289
 from our own experience 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.120
 another mode is the treasure once 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.350
 mode there will automatically many 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.789
 Pictures shot and the smartphone 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.470
 then calculated supposedly the most beautiful 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.690
 face what says you can find that 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.010
 that the most beautiful photo is of it writes 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.360
 me in any case in comments that 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.650
 I would definitely be interested 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.910
 if you are wondering that here is not 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.710
 all settings can be clicked 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.599
 it is because of that not pictorial material 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.639
 is suitable for it and so you can one 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:59.200
 cool drama recording make it easy 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.349
 fast on the smartphone then pass 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.849
 you can make such a cool effect 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.020
 Tip number 9 I have two 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:06.669
 Remote controls for my collection 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.470
 TV but somehow it smells like that 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.450
 again and again after that we do not do that 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.820
 Samsung offers a cool one 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.990
 fg smart remote so that can be completely 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.820
 just turn my tv on and on 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.260
 I turn off my smartphone always 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.830
 I never have to go back to my house 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.870
 search 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.099
 Tip number Take 10 screenshots 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.930
 There are now two options 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.370
 the first simple farmer home button 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.440
 hold down until a white edge 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.970
 shows up and a sound then sounds 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.560
 the screenshot is in yours 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.570
 Another possibility is the gallery 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.490
 karate kid chris method easy with the 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.770
 Apply karate hand over the display 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.180
 and polish and already should be 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.810
 again a screenshot in your gallery 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.180
 are located 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.740
 Tip number eleven everyone knows and have it 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.539
 The battery is empty again since you 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.310
 has watched for hours movies and photos 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.470
 and videos has been made of it 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.030
 synonymous with the s5 not spared the 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.400
 You can extend battery life in 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.990
 three energy-saving modes switch with it 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.640
 pull both fingers on top of the bar 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.790
 and it opens up the fast access 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.260
 menu and now just the economy mode 1 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.970
 then all become unimportant 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.560
 things shut off and the black and white 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.270
 displayed and just the most important thing 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.830
 make phone calls and text messages 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.180
 left over you can indeed additional 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.380
 functions simple but that works 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.580
 again because of the battery power 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.320
 I would let that be if you only 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.790
 you have a few percent left 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.640
 last tip on you should you lonely 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:18.830
 then I recommend you the svs of 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:21.830
 samsung just talk about it 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.830
 series 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.190
 I love you 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:39.360
 good night so people that were mine 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.370

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.960
 s 5 I hope you liked it 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.240

 and you can find more funny videos 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.790

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.220
 social media
