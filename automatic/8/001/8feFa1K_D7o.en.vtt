game itself as you progress through your
career<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.939> city<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.299> actually<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
career the city is actually going to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.960 
career the city is actually going to
change<00:01:31.020> based<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.470> how<00:01:32.280> well<00:01:32.460> you're<00:01:32.640> doing<00:01:32.670> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
change based on how well you're doing so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.280 
change based on how well you're doing so
the<00:01:33.090> idea<00:01:33.180> being<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.570> your<00:01:33.869> brand<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the idea being that your brand is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.660 
the idea being that your brand is
getting<00:01:34.530> more<00:01:34.680> notoriety<00:01:34.950> more<00:01:35.400> people<00:01:35.610> are

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
getting more notoriety more people are

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.679 
getting more notoriety more people are
starting<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.909> ride<00:01:36.119> your<00:01:36.270> boards<00:01:36.540> you're

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
starting to ride your boards you're

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.730 
starting to ride your boards you're
going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> start<00:01:37.020> seeing<00:01:37.110> your<00:01:37.409> brand<00:01:37.619> on

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
going to start seeing your brand on

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.020 
going to start seeing your brand on
other<00:01:37.860> people's<00:01:38.159> boards<00:01:38.430> you're<00:01:38.729> gonna<00:01:38.820> start

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
other people's boards you're gonna start

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.730 
other people's boards you're gonna start
to<00:01:39.090> see<00:01:39.180> billboards<00:01:39.390> or<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> city's<00:01:40.079> change

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
to see billboards or the city's change

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.499 
to see billboards or the city's change
so<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> idea<00:01:41.220> being<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:42.150> know<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.329> city

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
so the idea being that you know the city

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.510 
so the idea being that you know the city
sort<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.899> evolves<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.710> go<00:01:43.829> through<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.399> as

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
sort of evolves as you go through and as

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.770 
sort of evolves as you go through and as
your<00:01:44.670> brand<00:01:44.880> grows<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.210> prominence<00:01:45.630> you're

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
your brand grows in prominence you're

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.880 
your brand grows in prominence you're
actually<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.170> see<00:01:46.290> yourself<00:01:46.649> more<00:01:46.860> in

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
actually going to see yourself more in

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.039 
actually going to see yourself more in
the<00:01:47.100> city<00:01:47.280> that's<00:01:47.850> really<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.659> cool<00:01:48.750> i

of what san van Alona was in skate 2

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.470 
of what san van Alona was in skate 2
which<00:03:36.250> was<00:03:36.459> a<00:03:36.489> very<00:03:36.670> unfriendly<00:03:37.000> place<00:03:37.299> to

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
which was a very unfriendly place to

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.550 
which was a very unfriendly place to
skate<00:03:37.630> there's<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> lot<00:03:37.959> of<00:03:37.989> security<00:03:38.260> guard

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
skate there's a lot of security guard

skates offers emoticons guy that Norway
exactly<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.430> idea<00:03:42.459> is<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:42.850> poor<00:03:43.269> car

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450

on all levels so

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.399 
on all levels so

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
it's very inclusive for skateboarding

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.050
