one zero and breaks more on the rear not
much<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.509> bit<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:56.030> obviously

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
much just a little bit and obviously

much just a little bit and obviously
crappy<00:01:58.679> tires<00:02:00.439> say<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:01.619> can<00:02:01.770> slide<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:03.030> that's

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
crappy tires say we can slide so that's

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.270 
crappy tires say we can slide so that's
about<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:05.729> any<00:02:06.119> good<00:02:06.420> drift<00:02:06.659> card<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.920> yeah

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
about it so any good drift card and yeah

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.630 
about it so any good drift card and yeah
you<00:02:08.880> talk<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.750> want<00:02:10.019> on<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> nice<00:02:10.590> steady<00:02:11.310> curve

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you talk you want on a nice steady curve

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.330 
you talk you want on a nice steady curve
otherwise<00:02:12.299> you're<00:02:12.569> gonna<00:02:12.630> have<00:02:12.870> problems

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
otherwise you're gonna have problems

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.949 
otherwise you're gonna have problems
once<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.459> get<00:02:14.610> into<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:16.220> peak<00:02:17.220> rev<00:02:17.519> range

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
once you get into you peak rev range

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.900 
once you get into you peak rev range
because<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:18.989> will<00:02:19.290> it'll<00:02:19.620> if<00:02:20.549> you've<00:02:20.730> got<00:02:20.880> a

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
because it will it'll if you've got a

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.650 
because it will it'll if you've got a
big<00:02:21.120> triangle<00:02:22.549> you<00:02:23.549> have<00:02:23.579> a<00:02:23.730> lot<00:02:24.269> harder<00:02:24.480> time

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
big triangle you have a lot harder time

00:02:24.660 --> 00:03:56.450 
big triangle you have a lot harder time
keeping<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.410> car<00:02:25.620> sideways<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:28.790> cars

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:09.960 

well

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.420 

yeah<00:04:10.970> that<00:04:11.150> went<00:04:11.330> a<00:04:11.390> rock<00:04:11.630> I<00:04:11.900> don't<00:04:12.440> Monica<00:04:12.980> she

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
yeah that went a rock I don't Monica she

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.680 
yeah that went a rock I don't Monica she
should<00:04:13.610> really<00:04:14.000> nicely

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
should really nicely
