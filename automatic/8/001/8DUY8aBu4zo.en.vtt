episode my HD PVR accidentally
disconnected<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:49.980> did<00:03:50.190> not<00:03:50.310> record<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.790> rest

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.060 
disconnected and did not record the rest
of<00:03:51.300> this<00:03:51.420> game<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:52.020> I<00:03:52.590> thought<00:03:52.770> that<00:03:52.830> it

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
of this game and I thought that it

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.930 
of this game and I thought that it
might've<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.580> might<00:03:53.700> have<00:03:53.790> just

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
might've and might have just

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.270 
might've and might have just

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
looking at the computer and that's when

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.780 
looking at the computer and that's when
I<00:04:01.050> realized<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.800> thought<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.400> might<00:04:02.460> have<00:04:02.670> like

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790

um you know disconnected at some point

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.440 
um you know disconnected at some point
when<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.220> video<00:04:05.400> was<00:04:05.550> like<00:04:05.970> already<00:04:06.210> mostly

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
when the video was like already mostly

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.000 
when the video was like already mostly
recorded<00:04:07.020> so<00:04:07.470> it's<00:04:07.560> hoping<00:04:07.800> that<00:04:07.920> what

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
recorded so it's hoping that what

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.010 
recorded so it's hoping that what
happened<00:04:08.340> turns<00:04:08.790> out<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.060> didn't<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.540> by<00:04:09.930> the
