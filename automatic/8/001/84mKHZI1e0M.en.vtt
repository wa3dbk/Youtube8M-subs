00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.440
 Hello dear friends in touch 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.180
 Alexey Kuzmichyov today's video lesson 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.210
 we will be focused first 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.340
 queue for newbies i will show you one 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.890
 very simple and fast way which 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.760
 will help blur the background on any of your 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.189
 Photo 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.840
 well then let's get started first 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.970
 queue we need to highlight 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.730
 the object that we will not have 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.340
 blur in this case it is mine 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.530
 lantern in order to highlight it 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.930
 I will use a very convenient tool 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.680
 this is the quick mask mode you can find it 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.390
 here here below the palette squares 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.420
 here here is such an icon 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.090
 we click on it and we turn on the mode 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.210
 work with quick mask 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.960
 now select the brush tool 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.330
 make sure you have 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.150
 transparency and pressure for her stood on 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.890
 100 percent and also make sure 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.729
 you had a brush with one hundred percent 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.659
 stiffness now slightly increase 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.700
 image to make it convenient to work and 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:19.109
 using brush start painting 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.149
 our lantern like this if you where 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:24.270
 then allocate something carelessly for example 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.409
 got out abroad don't worry just 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.689
 take the eraser 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.060
 also make sure you have a hard 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.850
 and transparency by pressure he also had 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.240
 at 100 percent and just wipe it off 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.649
 using unnecessary areas of selection here 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.590
 as you see, and now 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.170
 can be continued with a brush 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.369
 work further well what for us 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:57.119
 so you need to circle the whole 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:02:01.729
 our lantern slightly enlarge image 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:06.820
 and work out the smaller details 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:08.890
 small diameter brush Well 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.380
 we plant her friends I finished the selection 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.020
 our lantern in order to save time 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.110
 lesson I did not show you the whole 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.370
 the process here is nothing complicated i 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.910
 just worked everything neatly 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.920
 contours and small details that's what i have 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.800
 the result was as you see here 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.620
 I had some kind of wand I did too 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.590
 just in case I selected well now 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.110
 let's turn off quick mask mode 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.040
 again click here on the icon and we 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.450
 you load the selection as you can see 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.270
 now let's invert this 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.760
 area go to point selection 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.860
 version and now we duplicate 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.080
 the resulting plot on a new layer 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.260
 press the jay control combination on 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.260
 keyboard and as you can see on the new layer 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.070
 we only fit our lantern background 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.230
 us left below now we are with you 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.239
 you need to blur the bottom layer if it is 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.550
 you are blocked and standing in front of him 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.100
 here is such a lock just click on 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.400
 two times with the left key and press 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.470
 the resulting window ok key let's 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.500
 also make a duplicate of this layer 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.459
 press the combination control jay 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.980
 so that later we could 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.360
 look at the result and now 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.829
 go to filter 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:30.280
 pick up here blur according to gauss and 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:32.530
 blur our background as much as 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.120
 we want the best to use 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.850
 small radii of about 3-10 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.510
 if but 10 I will probably be too 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.420
 too 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.910
 as you can see our images already 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.579
 does not look very natural therefore 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.060
 let's put four somewhere 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:54.090
 pixel here so we leave and click 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.799
 ok key 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.040
 As you can see, in principle, our image 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.660
 already looks pretty good 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.310
 only we had a problem on 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.040
 the contours of our lantern 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.040
 if you take a closer look here and there 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.140
 such ugly glow and halo 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.540
 you and I need to get rid of them 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.329
 for this let's take the tool 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.340
 finger cheers we have here 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.660
 intensity we set for him approximately 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.470
 before 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.470
 percent 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.759
 there will be 0 and size about 35 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.439
 pixel begin to gently clean these 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:32.819
 eagle and 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:37.360
 under our lantern like this 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:40.689
 just shifting these areas 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.479
 so to speak we fill them under our 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:56.469
 torch 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:59.469
 also here as you see all the sites where 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:02.740
 I walked with the finger tool 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:09.940
 I have no halo image looks 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:13.449
 naturally and naturally already like this 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:39.069
 this way and also working on the bottom 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:42.759
 part go down also here and with 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:45.300
 other side here here especially 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.300
 noticeably 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.400
 like this , as you see here 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.360
 there is a small stick on it too 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.630
 visible halo 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.490
 so take here the finger diameter 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:16.980
 smaller and neat as well 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:22.770
 this section will work on refuel these 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:39.370
 an eagle under our chopsticks 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:41.320
 and also here for example 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.889
 put let's look at our 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.680
 the final result I will combine these 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:49.540
 Two layers that we caught appeared 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.020
 in the process of working in a separate group 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.360
 Select both of the control key and 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.600
 further press the combination control jay 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.240
 on the keyboard and see what happened 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.540
 and so here is a picture that we had 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:09.960
 at the very beginning we work and now with a developed 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.960
 already we have background as you can see before and after
