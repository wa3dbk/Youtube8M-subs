00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.599
 hello today there is a little short 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:25.450
 But very tasty video recipe 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.400
 video what to eat 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.349
 I'm sure you already noticed that I 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.580
 with the swing with blogs just not 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.540
 I have to come afterwards 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.860
 Allow a lot of time to pass and yes and 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.360
 I think I'm interested too 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.860
 no longer really if that is different 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.180
 I like to write a comment then 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.180
 I can think about it again 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.800
 Do I cut them to the end ? 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.540
 but I have three in our week 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.159
 I think it was in our rainbow 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.260
 something cooked very well 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.299
 Delicious and I wanted you to 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.890
 Show today if you already know me 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:55.659
 a little longer, you know that 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.400
 I can not eat certain things 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.229
 because I just can not stand it 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.570
 and these include, among others 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.040
 Noodles that has me a long way 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.449
 very disturbed because i very much like 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.799
 Noodles have eaten meanwhile 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.450
 suddenly not anymore 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.490
 I just always find for 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.950
 different things substitute namely 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.049
 completely satisfied and so have 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.580
 I also curasan some time ago 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.110
 I personally discover her for me 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.060
 like to eat kurabi 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.300
 But I know that is not all that is 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.520
 probably some days away but me 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.200
 promise you choose this kuranyi 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.490
 In this situation you do not taste it 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.290
 tastes it just does not taste good 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.630
 simply simply reorganized after la or 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.120
 noodles and with lots of vegetables and very 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.950
 healthy and if you want to see 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.409
 how it works then stay tuned 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.390
 ok friends let's go I have mine 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.460
 vegetable carbines are here below 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.500
 Things first need Kurabi 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.930
 of course I have three in total 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.670
 Piece of 500 grams of pure children 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.810
 minced meat a zucchini 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.840
 a paprika tomatoes a very small 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.350
 two broccoli carrots a mug 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.180
 a bowl of peeled tomatoes disappeared 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.560
 mozzarella and if you like cheese 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.960
 fanatic as I am then again 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.060
 Extra cheese spices depending on what you guys 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.860
 like and olive oil 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.869
 ok there is not now but you need 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.159
 also olive oil you the ideas we can 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.360
 of course with a bad one 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.799
 I did not do it now because I did 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.290
 just not so on the taste of 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.819
 I have the orchids of the vegetables 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.379
 cut as small as possible not only 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.209
 because I find the appetizing after 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.370
 in the crowd but also because I like that 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.019
 make sure it's over in the end 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.760
 I simply peeled kuranyi 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.129
 and decide to cut because of that 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.109
 subsequently replaced our lasagne plates 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.969
 your best bet is a euro 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:36.340
 kuranyi slices first bite-tight too 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:38.560
 cook over cooks you but yes yes 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.969
 not too hard you can too 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.739
 salt a little bit while cooking 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.599
 but do not be too much you will 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.879
 End enough when that's done 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.290
 grab a big pot on 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.419
 best you ignore that here 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.379
 looks awful is old and not 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.599
 more not nice but he 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:58.060
 works and then you do 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:03:00.519
 olive oil pure then you wait in the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.779
 pot has children and here you can now 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.709
 In any case, start that 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:04.709
 was so good to salt 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.090
 that looked like this then you can 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.160
 you add your vegetables 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.630
 Of course you do not have exactly 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.220
 to take the same vegetables as I can 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.620
 take what you want and that tastes 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.780
 But I think that this mixture is here 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.980
 that fits quite well together 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.800
 by quantities and then come on the 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.180
 peeled tomatoes I have to 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.790
 the whole then always as well as possible 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.650
 small canned tomatoes are not only 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.140
 much more aromatic than the normal 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.540
 tomatoes are still at least for the time being 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.880
 also very juicy and give us so good 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.480
 sauce so vegetables and meat as an 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.950
 really beautiful bolognese will be if you 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.390
 have too much juice you let the whole 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.100
 just a bit with the lid open 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.590
 simmer until properly boiled 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.030
 is and if you have too little juice like 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.850
 Right now I'll leave you that 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.709
 Best with lid cooking over time 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.269
 should it look like this then me 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.590
 think that is so nice and colorful 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.660
 goes very well with our rainbow 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.700
 topic now could be the mass after yours 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.480
 flavor I'll take it to your salt 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:12.070
 pepper thyme rosemary and very much 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.390
 garlic always tries in between 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.500
 that you are not too salty or 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.000
 is approached 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.799
 and if you like the taste in the end 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.419
 Missed and the vegetables are so far through 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.240
 then you are so expensive lasagne too 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.710
 shuffle if you had enough and also 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.240
 calculated a bit better than 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.650
 I'll catch you with one 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.330
 layer kurabi 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.979
 then you can kind of at the end 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.810
 do better too 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.740
 But I do not have enough now 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.740
 I start with the mass 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.560
 on top of that the mass comes my way 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.560
 kurabi layer 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.740
 and then the breed and the tail 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.460
 mozzarella now and over in 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.070
 the oven I usually have at about 200 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.300
 had 15 minutes in there and then 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.980
 after ten minutes I'll have it again 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.710
 extra cheese on it because I like that 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.290
 just very dear and then that is 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:25.600
 whole already done again and so 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:26.830
 looks the whole then in the end if 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.920
 you 've seasoned it well then 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.240
 it simply tastes like lasagne 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.070
 It is super delicious I love 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.440
 this recipe and also many friends of 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.620
 I can not stand the kohlrabi 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.180
 I really enjoy eating this food 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.000
 best try it out then you see 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.140
 whether it tastes or not and yes that was 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.730
 it again from me 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.290
 I hope you all have a good day 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:51.280
 and takes good care of you 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:57.010
 and if you have to see us in the next 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:59.110
 video until then because I'm just great 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.800
 Replacing has replaced what it never did 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.800
 more of it replacement 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:19.760
 Various replacement daisies reported 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:21.680
 would be 20 hours to do what he wanted 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.930
 I say I react to a few things 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.120
 just very very strong because of that 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.390
 I try not to do that if possible 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.390
 help
