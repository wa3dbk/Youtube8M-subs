cans<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> thing<00:00:35.730> about<00:00:35.760> these<00:00:36.120> hands

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
cans but the thing about these hands

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.780 
cans but the thing about these hands
they're<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.930> 8<00:00:37.079> ounce<00:00:37.290> cans<00:00:37.790> so

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
they're going to be 8 ounce cans so

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.639 
they're going to be 8 ounce cans so
that's<00:00:39.270> about<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.690> small<00:00:39.930> as<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.500> can

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
that's about as small as I can you can

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.380 
that's about as small as I can you can
get<00:00:40.890> before<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.430> think<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.790> considered<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
get before I think it's considered a

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.709 
get before I think it's considered a
shot<00:00:43.430> you've<00:00:44.430> ever<00:00:44.579> had<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> sample<00:00:45.510> can

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
shot you've ever had like a sample can

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.660 
shot you've ever had like a sample can
if<00:00:45.899> you've<00:00:46.020> ever<00:00:46.140> been<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.379> mayhem<00:00:46.980> or<00:00:47.219> opera

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
if you've ever been to mayhem or opera

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.150 
if you've ever been to mayhem or opera
or<00:00:47.730> any<00:00:48.660> other<00:00:49.260> answers<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:52.829> 8<00:00:52.920> ounce

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
or any other answers and the 8 ounce

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.049 
or any other answers and the 8 ounce
cans<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:55.219> that's<00:00:56.219> that's<00:00:56.520> what's<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> be

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
cans so that's that's what's going to be

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.180 
cans so that's that's what's going to be
here<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.570> town<00:00:57.750> scan<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.260> half<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.710> 16

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
here in a town scan is half of the 16

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.490 
here in a town scan is half of the 16
ounce<00:00:59.309> which<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> American<00:01:00.570> Standard<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
ounce which is the American Standard and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
ounce which is the American Standard and
I<00:01:01.590> know<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.800> do<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.039> some<00:01:02.399> European<00:01:02.940> viewers

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
I know I do have some European viewers

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.140 
I know I do have some European viewers
so<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.260> synthesized<00:01:05.129> American<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.820> is

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
so the synthesized American can is

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
so the synthesized American can is
double<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.659> size<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.290> these<00:01:07.439> hands<00:01:07.740> um<00:01:08.270> I<00:01:10.040> mean

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
double the size of these hands um I mean

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.800 
double the size of these hands um I mean
they<00:01:11.189> look<00:01:11.369> cool<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.939> look<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.299> screen<00:01:12.659> you

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
they look cool if you look on screen you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.960 
they look cool if you look on screen you
can<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.070> black<00:01:14.369> hand<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
can see it's just a black hand with a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.149 
can see it's just a black hand with a
monster<00:01:15.630> logo<00:01:15.780> over<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.619> really<00:01:16.920> hope

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
monster logo over it and I really hope

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.539 
monster logo over it and I really hope
that<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:18.030> keep<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.659> because<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.650> have

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
that they keep that because I have

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.280 
that they keep that because I have
enough<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:21.030> personally<00:01:21.509> that's<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.080> say

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
enough can personally that's just say

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.350 
enough can personally that's just say
monster<00:01:22.740> energy<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.189> them<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> think<00:01:24.119> it'd

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
monster energy on them so I think it'd

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.450 
monster energy on them so I think it'd
be<00:01:24.390> pretty<00:01:24.630> sweet<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.650> black<00:01:26.130> cancer

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
be pretty sweet and just black cancer

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.179 
be pretty sweet and just black cancer
the<00:01:26.759> monster<00:01:27.150> logo<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.689> nothing<00:01:28.020> else<00:01:28.189> maybe

everywhere it's gonna suck probably

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.520 
everywhere it's gonna suck probably
going<00:03:23.300> to<00:03:23.360> lead<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.570> more<00:03:23.840> problems<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.440> it's

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.340 
the logo I mean I really can't say how
much<00:03:44.150> I'm<00:03:44.360> really<00:03:44.510> just<00:03:44.750> hoping<00:03:45.080> that<00:03:45.140> they

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
much I'm really just hoping that they

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.850 
much I'm really just hoping that they
leave<00:03:45.560> that<00:03:45.830> um<00:03:46.550> I<00:03:47.540> think<00:03:47.900> it's<00:03:48.350> pretty<00:03:48.500> cool<00:03:48.800> I

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
leave that um I think it's pretty cool I

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.590 
leave that um I think it's pretty cool I
think<00:03:49.130> this<00:03:49.280> whole<00:03:49.430> concept<00:03:49.700> is<00:03:50.060> pretty<00:03:50.120> cool

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600
