 Good, let's continue our series now 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.420

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.940
 We'll learn how to make the footer. 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.180
 good is good first thing that will do the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.000
 people will insert a table here is this 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.279
 table will initially have a column 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.779
 in a line 1,024 okay beauty I can already 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.990
 come here in their alignment 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.360
 centralize them I'll do if footer 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.910
 in a way that it has the logo of the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.850
 company and the contact information 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.090
 touch and also I want q background 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.010
 aac of the faith wheel it is gradient 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.940
 So I'm going to teach at fire works how to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.860
 People are going to make this background. 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.960
 integrated and okay 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.969
 Good to do first, we have. 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.340
 have an idea the mother that we want 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.449
 stay our footer 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.059
 I'll open the css here and let's go 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.520
 pass the first instruction I go 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:10.060
 put it here 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:13.360
 Footer opens and closes the keys and beauty 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.900
 Let's put it here that 's the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.990
 and let's put of 100 pixels 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.380
 I think it's going to be a legal size 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.830
 beauty 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.720
 here we come again in the footer again and 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.490
 will apply on it 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.110
 Ok beauty now I have a space that 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.150
 I want him to stay now, we'll go. 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.119
 there in fire works to create this 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.460
 background of grader in gradient okay 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.250
 Good here in firework I'm going to create a 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.650
 new document and what will make people 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.110
 in a way that does not get heavy on the site 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.110
 that I could make a document with the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.210
 size 1024 wide by 100 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.860
 Height only happens and it gets very 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.150
 heavy on site 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.790
 so I set the height to 100 and the 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.220
 I can leave 10 pixels wide 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.260
 she's so cool 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.900
 He is going to do a little business. 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.670
 so why because lanusse was that 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.740

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.800
 repeating the year so that it is 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.540
 Entire page is good for us. 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.000
 work, I'm going to increase the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:26.170
 Ok visualization let's put here a 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.220
 right rectangle let's make a gradient 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.090
 black also also linear and 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.680
 I'll put 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.750
 one side need darker and 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.030
 another a lighter gray 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.760
 I just do not want it to be this way. 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.750
 be darker then drags 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.690
 low 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.600
 there is a ready background that I do 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:56.920
 for saving him and I will save him as pg 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.150
 underline wheel up beauty and click on 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.049
 to save 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.500
 for us to apply this bg that we 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:09.750
 comes in css like we did here in 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.189
 top we call the background image 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:19.079
 can come by the browser even I do not have 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:19.079
 problem select bg here 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.300
 a semicolon at the end 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.560
 can save and see how the 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.990

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.360
 width of 10 pixels but here it is over 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.100

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.620

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.490

 For this before I'll share this 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:55.100
 table in two columns on the left side 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:59.340

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:11.640
 ok and here in css we define what goes 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:15.120

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.769

00:04:57.619 --> 00:05:03.139
 centralized and also has a 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:05.330

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.029

 change here is the name of the company will be 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.610
 a paragraph with only the information 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:22.279
 contact will be a spam 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.729
 so here at the beginning and end of spam 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:28.699

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.849

 ok good to set the paragraph the green 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:42.910
 footer pp and let's define how people 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.490
 would you like 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:49.500
 I'll put it in bold for 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.500
 This comes from you and use the tram 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.500
 beauty 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:02.549
 the size that the site source 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:02.549
 source site I can put 12 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.069
 and the glue 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.490
 It has to be I can open up the palette 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:17.110
 that has to be white 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:17.110
 It's good the beauty and the alignment, too. 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.520
 this alinghi 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.490
 left left 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.340
 good let's see how it was 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.020
 placed here in the corner but this format 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.990
 I do not like it, come on. 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.360
 also change the type of the 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:42.720
 letter I can come to make it easier for the 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:45.449
 css time and I'll change the lyrics to soul 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:50.640
 which is a letter that I really like 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:54.550
 okay okay I can apply 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:58.120
 That's it, it's beautiful 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:02.500
 in case of spam I can copy is the 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:06.910
 paragraph and place span span font to 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:10.300
 I want normal beauty and the rest is equal to 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:12.340
 difference will only be in bold or 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:16.360
 normal beauty 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:18.220
 then he pulled the data back here ok we 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:23.020
 can run and see how it goes 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:24.730
 stay in the browser né f12 and see how it is 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.780
 that will stay in the browser but I think 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:31.090
 It's going to be cool to leave so much. 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:34.270
 The secret is that we created a beautiful footer 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:36.910
 Yeah, and some important information. 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.800
 It is with respect to the clear website if you 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.590
 want to put more data next to 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.670
 right and you can how the site was the 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.010
 even though I created 

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.930
 I did not put anything else on the side 

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:49.330
 For example, you can right if you 

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:51.070
 have created website for other people 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.410
 You may be putting the logo on 

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:55.270
 you do not link to your website 

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.080
 saying that it was you who created this 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.840
 site 

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.550
 All right, well, our class is getting better. 

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.740
 I hope you liked it here. 

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:05.050
 to learn how we make the wheel is 

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:09.460
 very simple and in the next class we will 

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:11.170
 You'll learn how to make os - okay then. 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:14.580
 Until the next class 

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.580
 A hug to everyone and bye
