00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.860 
over the next couple days they'll heal
and<00:01:54.950> it's<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.220> healing<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.880> makes<00:01:57.720> them

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
and it's the healing that makes them

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.090 
and it's the healing that makes them
stronger<00:01:58.140> because<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.650> like<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.920> know<00:01:59.010> if

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
stronger because just like you know if

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.410 
stronger because just like you know if
you<00:01:59.190> ever<00:01:59.250> got<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.490> really<00:01:59.700> bad<00:01:59.880> cut<00:02:00.150> and<00:02:00.330> you've

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
you ever got a really bad cut and you've

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.120 
you ever got a really bad cut and you've
got<00:02:00.510> scar<00:02:00.840> tissue<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.260> kind<00:02:01.440> of<00:02:01.500> harder<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
got scar tissue it's kind of harder and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.300 
got scar tissue it's kind of harder and
and<00:02:02.880> coarser<00:02:03.840> than<00:02:03.870> your<00:02:04.170> regular<00:02:04.290> skin<00:02:04.740> same

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and coarser than your regular skin same

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.500 
and coarser than your regular skin same
thing<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.520> muscles<00:02:05.910> every<00:02:06.210> time<00:02:06.330> that<00:02:06.450> you

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
thing with muscles every time that you

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.749 
thing with muscles every time that you
break<00:02:06.720> them<00:02:06.900> down<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.590> build<00:02:07.800> up<00:02:07.980> a<00:02:08.190> little

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
break them down they build up a little

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.160 
break them down they build up a little
harder<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.270> they<00:02:09.450> can<00:02:09.660> resist<00:02:10.050> that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
harder so that they can resist that

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.839 
harder so that they can resist that
amount<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.530> force<00:02:10.739> again<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.670> keep

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
amount of force again and you keep

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.949 
amount of force again and you keep
breaking<00:02:12.090> them<00:02:12.299> down<00:02:12.359> and<00:02:12.659> building<00:02:12.840> up

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
breaking them down and building up

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.000 
breaking them down and building up
breaking<00:02:13.170> them<00:02:13.349> down<00:02:13.379> building<00:02:13.590> up<00:02:13.739> anyway

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
breaking them down building up anyway

good<00:03:28.049> my<00:03:28.260> brain<00:03:28.530> just<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:30.680> that's<00:03:31.680> what<00:03:31.889> I'm

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
good my brain just and that's what I'm

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.740 
good my brain just and that's what I'm
addicted<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.400> about<00:03:32.699> running<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.180> mental

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
addicted to about running is the mental

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.960 
addicted to about running is the mental
capacity<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.949> the<00:03:34.980> knowledge<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.699> can<00:03:35.849> do

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
capacity and the knowledge that I can do

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.150 
capacity and the knowledge that I can do
this<00:03:36.120> it's<00:03:37.049> not<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.230> physical<00:03:37.379> sensation<00:03:38.040> I
