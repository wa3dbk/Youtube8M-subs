I'm good I'm feeling the excitement we

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.720 
I'm good I'm feeling the excitement we
are<00:00:10.410> once<00:00:10.590> again<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:10.950> front<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.250> ATM

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
are once again in front of the ATM

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.890 
are once again in front of the ATM
machine<00:00:12.090> but<00:00:12.269> I'm<00:00:12.360> thinking<00:00:12.780> there's

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
machine but I'm thinking there's

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.299 
machine but I'm thinking there's
something<00:00:13.320> else<00:00:13.469> going<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.889> besides

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
something else going on besides

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.519 
something else going on besides
dispensing<00:00:14.940> money<00:00:15.179> what's<00:00:15.809> happening<00:00:16.199> here

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
dispensing money what's happening here

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.740 
dispensing money what's happening here
exactly<00:00:16.980> actually<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.670> not<00:00:18.029> real<00:00:18.330> ATM

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
exactly actually this is not real ATM

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.480 
exactly actually this is not real ATM
even<00:00:19.260> if<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.500> think<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.039> can<00:00:20.250> try<00:00:20.460> it

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
even if you think so you can try it

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.260 
even if you think so you can try it
that's<00:00:20.699> it

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
that's it

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.189 
that's it
we've<00:00:21.600> built<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:21.990> Bank<00:00:22.289> ATM<00:00:22.500> really<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.220> show

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.939 

because<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.289> assume<00:00:28.470> you're<00:00:28.560> gonna<00:00:28.650> tell<00:00:28.859> me

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
because I assume you're gonna tell me

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
there's some cameras here yet I don't

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.389 
there's some cameras here yet I don't
see<00:00:30.570> any<00:00:30.810> there<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.710> some<00:00:31.890> cameras<00:00:32.250> here

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
see any there are some cameras here

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.330 
see any there are some cameras here
actually<00:00:32.579> there<00:00:32.910> are<00:00:33.059> four<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.800> see<00:00:35.160> this

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
actually there are four and I see this

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.639 
actually there are four and I see this
one<00:00:35.550> yeah<00:00:35.880> exactly<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:37.170> camera<00:00:37.380> here

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
one yeah exactly we have one camera here

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:46.060 
one yeah exactly we have one camera here
we<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.610> long<00:00:38.879> pier<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.360> top<00:00:39.600> oh<00:00:39.870> wow

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
right you just said we have a camera

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.100 
right you just said we have a camera
right<00:00:48.090> there<00:00:48.149> I'm<00:00:48.360> staring<00:00:48.750> at<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.079> I

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110

don't see anything

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.700 
don't see anything
that's<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> point<00:00:51.780> that's<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> point<00:00:52.320> that's

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that's the point that's the point that's

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.170 
that's the point that's the point that's
the<00:00:52.829> punters<00:00:53.129> then<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.699> another<00:00:53.910> camera

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the punters then we have another camera

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.090 
the punters then we have another camera
here<00:00:54.510> as<00:00:54.629> well<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.649> oh<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.949> is

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
here as well that one I can oh this is

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.680 
here as well that one I can oh this is
right<00:00:56.280> here

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.420 

it's<00:00:59.960> a<00:01:00.020> tiny<00:01:00.260> little<00:01:00.530> camera<00:01:00.800> it's<00:01:01.160> a<00:01:01.250> tiny

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
it's a tiny little camera it's a tiny

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.190 
it's a tiny little camera it's a tiny
little<00:01:01.550> camera<00:01:01.910> indeed<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.080> whole

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
little camera indeed and the whole

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.380 
little camera indeed and the whole
purpose<00:01:03.470> we<00:01:04.010> have<00:01:04.040> witnessed<00:01:04.730> here<00:01:05.120> reacts

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
purpose we have witnessed here reacts

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.420 
purpose we have witnessed here reacts
you<00:01:05.600> have<00:01:05.750> it<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.050> we<00:01:06.140> can<00:01:06.290> see<00:01:06.470> 3d<00:01:06.890> on<00:01:07.100> a<00:01:07.130> camera

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
you have it so we can see 3d on a camera

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.240 
you have it so we can see 3d on a camera
which<00:01:07.910> is<00:01:08.120> a<00:01:08.150> little<00:01:08.570> bit<00:01:08.740> unconventional<00:01:09.740> in

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
which is a little bit unconventional in

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.580 
which is a little bit unconventional in
its<00:01:10.400> form<00:01:10.610> factor<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:11.180> we<00:01:11.270> have<00:01:11.630> separated<00:01:12.170> in

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
its form factor so we have separated in

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.770 
its form factor so we have separated in
the<00:01:13.130> sensor<00:01:13.460> unit<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.030> then<00:01:14.300> we<00:01:14.480> have<00:01:14.660> the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
the sensor unit and then we have the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.600 
the sensor unit and then we have the
main<00:01:14.960> unit<00:01:15.350> here<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:15.770> we<00:01:15.950> got<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.130> link<00:01:16.430> in

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
main unit here and we got a link in

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.510 
main unit here and we got a link in
between<00:01:16.760> and<00:01:17.240> it<00:01:17.420> is<00:01:17.630> 26<00:01:18.500> feet<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.340> get

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
between and it is 26 feet so you get

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.190 
between and it is 26 feet so you get
plenty<00:01:19.820> of<00:01:20.000> flexibility<00:01:20.540> when<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:20.810> are<00:01:21.020> going

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
plenty of flexibility when you are going

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.920 
plenty of flexibility when you are going
course<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.100> this<00:01:22.280> little<00:01:22.640> camera<00:01:23.240> had<00:01:23.510> the

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
course so this little camera had the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.580 
course so this little camera had the
sensor<00:01:24.230> unit<00:01:24.560> it's<00:01:24.830> 720p<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:27.110> then<00:01:27.440> we

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
sensor unit it's 720p and and then we

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.930 
sensor unit it's 720p and and then we
have<00:01:27.740> all<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.070> rest<00:01:28.250> of<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.460> intelligence

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
have all the rest of the intelligence

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.330 
have all the rest of the intelligence
even<00:01:29.240> here<00:01:29.360> in<00:01:29.630> this<00:01:29.780> main<00:01:30.530> right<00:01:30.950> in<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.190> main

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
even here in this main right in the main

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.100 
even here in this main right in the main
you<00:01:31.490> if<00:01:31.610> you<00:01:31.760> wanna<00:01:31.880> keep<00:01:32.420> it<00:01:32.600> really<00:01:32.869> small

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
you if you wanna keep it really small

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.740 
you if you wanna keep it really small
and<00:01:33.380> add<00:01:33.590> on<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.860> main<00:01:34.010> so<00:01:34.700> now<00:01:35.210> is<00:01:35.330> access

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
and add on the main so now is access

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.140 
and add on the main so now is access
done<00:01:36.020> these<00:01:37.010> sort<00:01:37.250> of<00:01:37.310> covert<00:01:37.610> cameras<00:01:37.970> before

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
done these sort of covert cameras before

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.570 
done these sort of covert cameras before
we<00:01:38.479> have<00:01:38.690> but<00:01:39.140> this<00:01:39.259> is<00:01:39.440> really<00:01:39.710> small<00:01:40.040> this<00:01:40.310> is

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
we have but this is really small this is

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.490 
we have but this is really small this is
really<00:01:41.060> small<00:01:41.150> we've<00:01:41.509> had<00:01:41.720> some<00:01:42.020> solutions

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
really small we've had some solutions

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.800 
really small we've had some solutions
for<00:01:42.560> encoders<00:01:43.070> before<00:01:43.460> coverage<00:01:44.330> solutions

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
for encoders before coverage solutions

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.499 
for encoders before coverage solutions
but<00:01:45.020> this<00:01:45.410> is<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.680> first<00:01:45.890> time<00:01:46.190> or<00:01:46.550> in<00:01:47.060> an<00:01:47.180> IP

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509

camera that we're making this kind of

camera that we're making this kind of
modern<00:01:49.400> edge<00:01:49.550> alert<00:01:50.479> system<00:01:50.900> and<00:01:51.640> we've<00:01:52.640> never

having<00:01:53.660> conventional<00:01:54.229> IP<00:01:54.650> cameras<00:01:55.100> are

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
having conventional IP cameras are

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.920 
having conventional IP cameras are
sometimes<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.820> little<00:01:55.850> bit<00:01:56.060> too<00:01:56.180> big<00:01:56.509> to<00:01:56.720> fit

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
sometimes a little bit too big to fit

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.230 
sometimes a little bit too big to fit
into<00:01:57.170> those<00:01:57.740> devices<00:01:58.009> right<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.820> here<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.119> the

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
into those devices right and here is the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.300 
into those devices right and here is the
solution<00:01:59.390> for<00:01:59.690> it<00:01:59.960> right<00:02:00.680> it's<00:02:00.890> great<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:01.220> the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
solution for it right it's great so the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.710 
solution for it right it's great so the
solution<00:02:01.640> was<00:02:01.729> really<00:02:01.970> just<00:02:02.060> separating<00:02:02.630> the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
solution was really just separating the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.529 
solution was really just separating the
two<00:02:02.930> right<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:03.920> now<00:02:04.039> you<00:02:04.130> have<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.460> 26<00:02:05.420> feet

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
two right so now you have the 26 feet

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.630 
two right so now you have the 26 feet
they<00:02:05.720> can<00:02:05.750> go<00:02:06.050> plus<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.530> main<00:02:06.710> unit<00:02:07.039> yeah<00:02:07.250> get

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
they can go plus the main unit yeah get

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.080 
they can go plus the main unit yeah get
it<00:02:07.729> right<00:02:07.850> on<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.060> network<00:02:09.490> 720p<00:02:10.490> three

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
it right on the network 720p three

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.320 
it right on the network 720p three
