00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.360
 the own audience 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.360
 that is saying 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.890
 about how they are doing 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.190
 whether they are arrogant or optimistically stored 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:13.119
 I have you for example 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:13.990
 a salesman 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.539
 put euros in heathen she goes to tholen things to sell 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:18.949
 and this one 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.109
 colporteur 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.630
 That 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.449
 the game starts on Monday 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.710
 I'm excited 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.720
 the shoulders two divorced parents 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260
 corps in zealand 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
 but in his 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.640
 suited up 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.640
 spot this week 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.640
 This is a successful pairing 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.170
 who do not let citizens have regrets 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.420
 what a difference with a colleague 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.860
 a colleague has a head start in the colleagues 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.130
 also so successful no, it has already visited 15 houses 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.780
 sp to vote 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.400
 euro slammed his nose 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.370
 drag yourself through the streets 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.370
 something to do with its appearance nac was presented 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.030
 the suit 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.370
 because they are wearing 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.370
 so basically the same 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.350
 only it's the way they wear 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.720
 X 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.720
 my creases 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.340
 he doesn't get it 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.680
 I thought everyone wanted transparent toilet paper anyway 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.110
 that sells in advance 10 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.200
 difficult disney's difficult issues 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 poor market 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.620
 class hours figures 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.630
 yet the second man had felt depressed 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.789
 or maybe that opened my figure 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.070
 that's a shock 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.869
 there are a lot of things that are sometimes fun to laugh 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.899
 view the three points 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.339
 set the calendar to buy toilet paper 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.339
 I think I will 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:21.709
 little ones properly 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.089
 smiled lack 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:26.189
 the week 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.699
 body 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.699
 a sweater that is short on Siena 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.749
 then the bent legs 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.159
 big feet 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.159
 the arms so long without hanging 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.879
 think your couples it is already clear that he is going to be successful 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:48.909
 to have 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.020
 it is immediately one 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.020
 have bought a family suit 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:55.759
 then you even see that 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:59.219
 if your figures have nothing to say, storytellers already have a lot through them 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:00.299
 appearance 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.679
 and of course no back laws to think of 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:05.819
 everyone's ratings are upside down 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.480
 as with your example a second 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.069
 is someone who is every sign 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.439
 I don't want to go there 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.149
 then you are free to do that 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.779
 it is of course not always spider legs 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.589
 no it is not a law of medes and persians 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:20.489
 but I hear the viewer will be 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.629
 if you are never drawn women after the fall i care so tips can be for sale 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:25.409
 wife before 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:26.769
 according to kidnapping 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.749
 could be looked in especially for ours 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.229
 I his function 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:33.219
 must happen 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.579
 type the van also don't just make a cooling 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.849
 Cuomo can see 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.849
 jumps itches camps 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:45.619
 she looks with 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:46.909
 under the eyes 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.579
 into the world 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.119
 naturally forest optimists on the hull of a healthy outdoor air 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.839
 handkerchief 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:00.859
 what do you have head 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.289
 tholen 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:05.289
 or with a landed 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.649
 she smiles despite them 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:12.099
 that's it is a heavy burden 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.989
 it is not fun 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.989
 the artists get a milk tap 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.120
 beat each other up 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.300
 although the stuff is fired, she keeps smiling twenty years later you say 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.659
 don't buy anything anymore 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.370
 this date 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.180
 Muscular arms 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.180
 it is the centers turku peasant woman 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.189
 apron for 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.189
 therefore they could stay 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:45.559
 clogged 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:48.659
 that is of course one 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.719
 that's a bit uniform now 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:53.439
 firm legs 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:56.610
 this is different to wear 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.610
 brussels anp 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.130
 Some figures are mostly in the picture must give a certain muscle 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:10.740
 then 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.349
 normal man 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:13.930
 normal man 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.319
 the 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.419
 one man man man man man man 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.360
 morgan 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.990
 but you know it 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.909
 this happened milking cows 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.689
 Terribly kicked on a lot of criticism 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:29.779
 to that criticism 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.779
 altena going fast with their career 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:38.129
 he can get there per optional is still there 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.990
 teach which verse of the cow 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.960
 business is going 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.960
 very important that you never have to shorten 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:53.059
 Bangkok 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:54.730
 the way my head guesses 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.740
 shut up to seamlessly but naturally 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.740
 if he says so due to a bad pit stop 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.819
 before her 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:13.650
 a lot more a pack will make you and I think I know exactly that expensive 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.650
 my one 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.879
 steel 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.879
 be allowed to 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.639
 9 6 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.550
 You will have Europa League 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.039
 rafferty 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.339
 Robben came back later 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:42.339
 7 but he can also say otherwise of course 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.099
 he can also say 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.099
 don't swing me 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.610
 a smack 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
 to knock down 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:04.800
 it is now a karate or sofia course 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.770
 those are all questions that you don't ask at the conclusion of the mas 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.360
 but what the inspectorate looks like 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.069
 be answered 

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:17.110
 case such agents got together with you and then our type suddenly becomes one 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.820
 secondary character 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.999
 it's a little bit 

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:21.999
 and if all goes well but the next altintop also came back 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:24.939
 yes but if I'm not doing well 

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:26.649
 what's the problem 

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:28.599
 but the times it goes well 

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:30.310
 another story comes back 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.289
 get those large reserves portable with figure 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:36.650
 surprisingly, the canucks don't get their own series 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.839
 A good example of this is a reversal 

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:40.149
 from suske and wiske 

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:41.720
 I have a very own series 

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.009
 did not succeed so well 

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:45.909
 because bilthoven's figure was not so successful 

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:47.030
 he is only stronger 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.030
 the international 

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:54.279
 it was delicious
