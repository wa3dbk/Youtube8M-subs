00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
10 a and the 7 2 2 a and they also do

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.630 
10 a and the 7 2 2 a and they also do
some<00:00:36.500> other<00:00:36.560> cabinets<00:00:36.980> in<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.190> range<00:00:37.400> which

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
some other cabinets in the range which

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.310 
some other cabinets in the range which
I'll<00:00:37.850> cover<00:00:38.090> later<00:00:38.360> on<00:00:38.690> but<00:00:38.990> first<00:00:39.140> of<00:00:39.290> all

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
I'll cover later on but first of all

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.570 
I'll cover later on but first of all
starting<00:00:39.650> on<00:00:39.800> some<00:00:39.950> of<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.070> components

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
starting on some of the components

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.190 
starting on some of the components
inside<00:00:41.470> with<00:00:42.470> the<00:00:42.770> new<00:00:43.220> drivers<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:44.330> RCF<00:00:44.900> have

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
inside with the new drivers and RCF have

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.260 
inside with the new drivers and RCF have
designs<00:00:45.920> they've<00:00:46.610> got<00:00:46.850> very<00:00:47.059> lightweight

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
designs they've got very lightweight

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.270 
designs they've got very lightweight
neodymium<00:00:47.870> magnets<00:00:48.230> on<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.559> back<00:00:48.980> of<00:00:49.160> them<00:00:49.250> so

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
neodymium magnets on the back of them so

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.580 
neodymium magnets on the back of them so
makes<00:00:50.059> them<00:00:50.180> not<00:00:50.270> easier<00:00:50.600> to<00:00:50.720> transport<00:00:51.080> it

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
makes them not easier to transport it

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.620 
makes them not easier to transport it
also<00:00:52.160> gives<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:52.760> much<00:00:53.030> better<00:00:53.239> performance

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
also gives you a much better performance

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.190 
also gives you a much better performance
than<00:00:54.050> from<00:00:54.650> sort<00:00:54.800> of<00:00:54.830> the<00:00:54.920> art<00:00:55.129> 3<00:00:55.460> series<00:00:55.790> range

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200

go<00:01:48.350> through<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.740> limiter<00:01:49.610> light<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.690> you<00:01:50.959> can

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
go through the limiter light and you can

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.840 
go through the limiter light and you can
see<00:01:51.259> they're<00:01:51.440> now<00:01:51.560> basically<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.520> amplifiers

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
see they're now basically the amplifiers

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.639 
see they're now basically the amplifiers

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
billing limit limiter circuit to prevent

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.830 
billing limit limiter circuit to prevent
clipping<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.970> amplifiers<00:01:56.270> all<00:01:56.420> over

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
clipping of the amplifiers all over

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.680 
clipping of the amplifiers all over
driving<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.619> drivers<00:01:58.069> as<00:01:58.190> such<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:59.179> signal

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
driving the drivers as such the signal

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.320 
driving the drivers as such the signal
LED<00:01:59.929> this<00:02:00.830> basically<00:02:01.490> lights<00:02:01.789> screen<00:02:02.119> if

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
LED this basically lights screen if

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.150 
LED this basically lights screen if
there<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:02.569> a<00:02:02.600> signal<00:02:02.780> present<00:02:03.020> on<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.770> main

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
there is a signal present on the main

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.630 
there is a signal present on the main
input<00:02:05.060> next<00:02:06.050> one<00:02:06.229> is<00:02:06.319> the<00:02:06.410> status<00:02:06.800> now<00:02:07.490> that

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
input next one is the status now that

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.749 
input next one is the status now that
will<00:02:07.819> flash<00:02:08.179> if<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.170> temperature<00:02:09.830> protection

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
will flash if the temperature protection

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.730 
will flash if the temperature protection
circuit<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.150> active<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:11.780> if<00:02:12.020> overheats<00:02:12.530> that

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
circuit is active so if overheats that

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.020 
circuit is active so if overheats that
will<00:02:12.830> start<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.099> flash<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.610> underneath<00:02:13.970> that

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
will start to flash and underneath that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.270 
will start to flash and underneath that
you've<00:02:14.270> basically<00:02:14.810> got<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.380> mains<00:02:16.130> power

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
you've basically got the mains power

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.540 
you've basically got the mains power
on/off<00:02:16.580> switch<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.150> see<00:02:18.040> next<00:02:19.040> time<00:02:19.130> it's<00:02:19.400> a

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
on/off switch and I see next time it's a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.230 
on/off switch and I see next time it's a
boy<00:02:19.780> yeah<00:02:20.780> I'm<00:02:21.290> doing<00:02:21.620> an<00:02:21.709> ende<00:02:22.069> hi<00:02:22.459> I'm<00:02:22.730> Scott
