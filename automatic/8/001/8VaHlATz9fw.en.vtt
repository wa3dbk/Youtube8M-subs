better on the bike the air filters drop
a<00:02:48.750> tiny<00:02:49.109> bit<00:02:50.420> by<00:02:51.420> doing<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.049> this

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
a tiny bit by doing this it is this

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
like this and all it is is you have to

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.189 
like this and all it is is you have to
drill<00:04:07.049> out<00:04:07.849> may<00:04:08.849> look<00:04:09.060> bad<00:04:09.359> right<00:04:09.389> now<00:04:09.690> there

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
drill out may look bad right now there

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.409 
drill out may look bad right now there
was<00:04:10.349> not<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.650> bad<00:04:10.829> you<00:04:11.099> drill<00:04:11.310> out<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:12.299> you

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
was not that bad you drill out and you

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.000 
was not that bad you drill out and you
pull<00:04:12.599> this<00:04:12.750> thing<00:04:12.959> out<00:04:13.079> when<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:13.709> pull<00:04:13.859> this

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
pull this thing out when you pull this

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.680 
pull this thing out when you pull this
thing<00:04:14.190> out<00:04:14.310> this<00:04:14.699> is<00:04:14.909> your<00:04:15.120> other<00:04:15.239> piece<00:04:15.540> as

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
thing out this is your other piece as

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.029 
thing out this is your other piece as
your<00:04:15.810> stage<00:04:16.049> then<00:04:16.289> you<00:04:16.349> have<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.680> cut<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:16.950> in

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
your stage then you have to cut it in

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.069 
your stage then you have to cut it in
half<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.150> can<00:04:18.299> fit<00:04:18.479> in<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.630> hole<00:04:18.659> to<00:04:18.930> come

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
half so you can fit in a hole to come

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.009 
half so you can fit in a hole to come
out<00:04:19.609> it's<00:04:20.609> a<00:04:20.669> tree<00:04:20.880> our<00:04:21.030> job

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
out it's a tree our job

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.650 
out it's a tree our job
but<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:23.250> know<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.550> think<00:04:23.729> it's<00:04:23.970> well<00:04:24.120> worth<00:04:24.150> it

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
but you know I think it's well worth it

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.749 
but you know I think it's well worth it
actually<00:04:25.470> it's<00:04:25.590> fired<00:04:25.860> up<00:04:26.069> when<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.370> see<00:04:26.550> how

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
actually it's fired up when you see how

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.230 
actually it's fired up when you see how
well<00:04:27.860> she's<00:04:28.860> home<00:04:29.099> because<00:04:29.819> she's<00:04:30.000> something

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
well she's home because she's something

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.360 
well she's home because she's something
a<00:04:30.270> little<00:04:30.449> different<00:04:30.780> whatever<00:04:31.069> and<00:04:32.069> I<00:04:32.129> think

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
a little different whatever and I think

00:04:32.370 --> 00:05:07.100 
a little different whatever and I think
she's<00:04:32.520> grinning<00:04:32.849> quite<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.090> bit<00:04:33.270> better

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:17.530 

there

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
maybe it's pretty better some tests I'm

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.550 
maybe it's pretty better some tests I'm
trying<00:05:23.820> not<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.000> remit<00:05:24.720> a<00:05:24.780> hog<00:05:24.960> too<00:05:25.200> much<00:05:25.350> to

trying not to remit a hog too much to

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.460 
trying not to remit a hog too much to
make<00:05:25.710> with<00:05:25.860> a<00:05:25.920> rev<00:05:26.070> limiter<00:05:26.520> on<00:05:26.550> it<00:05:26.790> I<00:05:27.260> did<00:05:28.260> that

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
make with a rev limiter on it I did that

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.090 
make with a rev limiter on it I did that
on<00:05:28.620> my<00:05:28.680> one<00:05:29.280> can<00:05:29.520> also<00:05:29.670> I<00:05:30.470> went<00:05:31.470> then<00:05:31.710> stood<00:05:31.980> up

8,000 get that high anyway and this is

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.870 
8,000 get that high anyway and this is
my<00:05:40.710> little<00:05:40.890> tack<00:05:41.160> whatever<00:05:41.490> that's<00:05:41.700> why<00:05:41.820> it

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
my little tack whatever that's why it

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.880 
my little tack whatever that's why it
looked<00:05:42.030> kind<00:05:42.180> of<00:05:42.210> funny<00:05:42.360> and<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.320> day<00:05:43.470> job<00:05:43.770> is

just<00:05:44.010> make<00:05:44.220> sure<00:05:44.250> I<00:05:44.370> don't<00:05:44.400> waste<00:05:44.730> stay<00:05:44.910> for

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
just make sure I don't waste stay for

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.620

nothing<00:05:45.420> like<00:05:45.750> black<00:05:45.960> tape<00:05:46.700> anyway<00:05:47.700> well<00:05:48.450> work

to<00:05:48.750> change<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.110> swingarm<00:05:50.300> yeah<00:05:51.300> I<00:05:51.510> think<00:05:51.840> it

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
to change the swingarm yeah I think it

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.330 
to change the swingarm yeah I think it
was<00:05:52.170> the<00:05:52.290> best<00:05:52.470> thing<00:05:52.590> I<00:05:52.710> ever<00:05:52.740> did<00:05:52.950> to<00:05:53.160> that

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
was the best thing I ever did to that

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.380 
was the best thing I ever did to that
