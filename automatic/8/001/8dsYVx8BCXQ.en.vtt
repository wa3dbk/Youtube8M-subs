00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.520
 speed control work 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.500
 the drive elements of a 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.970
 Hydraulic system is in charge of 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.460
 flow control valves 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.969
 combined with a valve limiter 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.370
 Pressure 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.290
 this combination affects the flow 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.660
 volumetric which constitutes the 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.740
 decisive parameter for the speed of 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.740
 the work operation 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.539
 the constant sneakers offer a flow 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.980
 volumetric also constant it 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.019
 means that a reduction of 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.550
 section would only cause an increase 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.469
 of the flow velocity and of course 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.239
 an increase in pressure in the area 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.699
 narrowing this situation is not 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.600
 desirable since the volumetric flow rate does not 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.600
 varies in this case 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.710
 here we see the speed of the 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.020
 operations of a cylinder 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.320
 with the reducing valve open 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.320
 flow 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.100
 if the resistance increases due to 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.740
 said throttling valve 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.950
 pressure increases in the duct 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.810
 before it the limiting valve 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.820
 of pressure starts to open so the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.710
 volumetric flow is divided a part 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.210
 flow to the cylinder while the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.210
 another flows to the reservoir 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.830
 the volumetric flow that now supplies 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.120
 effect has as a consequence a 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.120
 lower work speed 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.560
 here we see another effect that has a 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.540
 flow reducing valve how much 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.440
 the greater the load the slower the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.440
 advance movement 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.780
 to get a configuration that does not 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.250
 depends on the load can be resorted to 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.250
 a flow regulating valve 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.599
 This type of valve is constituted 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.030
 by an adjustment reducer and a reducer 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.140
 of regulation with the adjustment reducer 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.940
 the flow can be determined 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.849
 volumetric and consequently the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.069
 plunger speed when increasing the 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.739
 load on the output side increases and the 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.840
 pressure this pressure acts on the 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.670
 regulation reducer together with 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.770
 the force of the spring then the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.870
 reducer leaves the step open in order 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.880
 to compensate for the greater resistance of 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.380
 this mode the higher outlet pressure does not 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.599
 acts on the limiting valve of 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.730
 pressure avoiding that a 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.730
 change in volumetric flow 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.490
 next let's see an example the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.480
 lathe has to work 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.700
 regardless of the load because if 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.860
 the advance is not constant you would get 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.390
 an unequal result the valve 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.980
 flow regulator seeks a 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.310
 constant speed of movement of 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.310
 Advance 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.160
 There are two methods to strangle a 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.570
 volumetric flow here we see the 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.430
 throttling of the flow of 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.320
 feeding the strangulation of 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.120
 Feed pipe used to 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.220
 advancing the cylinder causes a 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.780
 heating the oil however if 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.790
 the oil is hot decreases the 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.210
 precision of the movement of the plunger 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.210
 cylinder 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.480
 there are machines in which 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.370
 circumstance does not matter but 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.410
 these facilities work with maximum 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.490
 precision so it is not desirable 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.490
 the oil gets hot 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.060
 In these cases, a 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.610
 strangulation in the duct 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.380
 reflux it means that it is 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.600
 strangled the oil that flows towards 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.550
 the deposit in that area does not matter that 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.110
 the oil is heated at the same time 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.210
 cylinder plunger that the subject 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.890
 hydraulically in this situation should 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.570
 take into account that the relationship between 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.340
 the surfaces on both sides of the limb 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.020
 does not cause a multiplication of the 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.390
 pressure that means that the system 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:26.100
 it has to be designed to resist 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.100
 the corresponding high pressures
