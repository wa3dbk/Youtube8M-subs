when<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.320> push<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.800> start<00:00:38.399> by<00:00:38.610> cutting<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
when you push on it start by cutting the

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.210 
when you push on it start by cutting the
head<00:00:39.239> off<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.630> pineapple<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.739> below<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
head off the pineapple just below the

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.490 
head off the pineapple just below the
top<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.180> conserve<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:42.809> much<00:00:42.840> fruit<00:00:43.320> as

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
top so as to conserve as much fruit as

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.010 
top so as to conserve as much fruit as
possible<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.489> turn<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.300> pineapple<00:00:45.750> over

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
possible then turn the pineapple over

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.950 
possible then turn the pineapple over
and<00:00:46.200> cut<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> base<00:00:47.130> off<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> same<00:00:47.850> way<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and cut the base off in the same way the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.470 
and cut the base off in the same way the
next<00:00:49.260> step<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.829> remove<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.460> skin<00:00:50.760> cutting

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
next step is to remove the skin cutting

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.690 
next step is to remove the skin cutting
down<00:00:51.780> from<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> top<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.469> long<00:00:52.829> strips<00:00:53.040> don't

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
down from the top in long strips don't

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.639 
down from the top in long strips don't
cut<00:00:53.940> into<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> fruit<00:00:54.510> too<00:00:54.750> deeply<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.200> remove

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
cut into the fruit too deeply to remove

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.590 
cut into the fruit too deeply to remove
the<00:00:55.800> eyes<00:00:55.920> as<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.730> will<00:00:56.940> waste<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.360> lot<00:00:57.540> of

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the eyes as this will waste a lot of

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.200 
the eyes as this will waste a lot of
fruit<00:00:57.989> once<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.739> skin<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:58.980> removed<00:00:59.219> cut<00:01:00.030> out

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
fruit once the skin is removed cut out

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.299 
fruit once the skin is removed cut out
the<00:01:00.239> eyes<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> pineapple<00:01:01.190> following<00:01:02.190> the
