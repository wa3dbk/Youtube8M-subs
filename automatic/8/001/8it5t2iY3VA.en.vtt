00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
think of this little nugget of laggy

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.620 
think of this little nugget of laggy
gold<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.759> right<00:00:15.000> here<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.269> see<00:00:15.420> that

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
gold in this right here you see that

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.779 
gold in this right here you see that
that<00:00:16.139> lag<00:00:16.410> spike<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.010> happens<00:00:17.369> like<00:00:17.609> every

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
that lag spike that happens like every

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.150 
that lag spike that happens like every
two<00:00:18.449> seconds<00:00:18.990> right<00:00:19.170> there<00:00:19.410> yeah<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.740> can<00:00:19.949> see

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
two seconds right there yeah you can see

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.460 
two seconds right there yeah you can see
it<00:00:20.189> right<00:00:20.369> there<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.939> just<00:00:21.420> jumps<00:00:21.869> up<00:00:22.020> randomly

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
it right there it just jumps up randomly

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.859 
it right there it just jumps up randomly
consistently<00:00:23.460> every<00:00:23.939> two<00:00:24.420> seconds<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.810> don't

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
consistently every two seconds I don't

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.450 
consistently every two seconds I don't
know<00:00:25.050> why<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.500> doing<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.220> it

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
know why it's doing that but it

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.400 
know why it's doing that but it
basically<00:00:26.580> adds<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:27.900> little

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
basically adds up to this this little

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.529 
basically adds up to this this little
frame<00:00:28.560> skip<00:00:28.859> Ajay<00:00:29.070> get<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:30.240> think<00:00:30.420> it

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
frame skip Ajay get and I think it

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.720 
frame skip Ajay get and I think it
happened<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.439> first<00:00:31.710> episode<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
happened in the first episode of the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.850 
happened in the first episode of the
Narnia<00:00:33.090> craft<00:00:33.329> 1.8<00:00:33.840> adventures<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.590> didn't

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
notice it for some reason or I don't

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.479 
notice it for some reason or I don't
know<00:00:37.230> what<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> hell<00:00:37.559> happened<00:00:37.710> maybe<00:00:38.129> Alice

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
know what the hell happened maybe Alice

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.490 
know what the hell happened maybe Alice
