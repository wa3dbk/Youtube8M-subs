00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:50.450 

I<00:00:46.940> think<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> industry<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.600> changing<00:00:49.460> faster

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
I think the industry is changing faster

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.880 
I think the industry is changing faster
than<00:00:50.489> what<00:00:50.790> we<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.329> keep<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:51.870> when<00:00:52.800> it

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
than what we can keep up with when it

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.439 
than what we can keep up with when it
comes<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.250> steel<00:00:53.579> which<00:00:53.790> is<00:00:53.940> constantly

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
comes to steel which is constantly

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.389 
comes to steel which is constantly
changing<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.170> may<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.440> change<00:00:55.769> from<00:00:55.949> year<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
changing it may not change from year to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.790 
changing it may not change from year to
year<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.699> could<00:00:56.879> change<00:00:57.150> mid<00:00:57.570> model<00:00:57.930> year<00:00:58.110> so

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
year it could change mid model year so

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.850 
year it could change mid model year so
you<00:00:58.860> could<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.250> a<00:01:00.260> 2010/2011<00:01:01.260> vehicle<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
you could have a 2010/2011 vehicle and

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.310 
you could have a 2010/2011 vehicle and
the<00:01:02.449> manufacturing<00:01:03.449> process<00:01:03.930> changed

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the manufacturing process changed

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.200 
the manufacturing process changed
mid-year<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.040> have<00:01:05.460> two<00:01:05.640> different<00:01:05.759> repair

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
mid-year and have two different repair

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
mid-year and have two different repair
processes<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> same<00:01:07.229> vehicle<00:01:07.680> when<00:01:08.490> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
processes on the same vehicle when I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.710 
processes on the same vehicle when I
started<00:01:09.060> 15<00:01:09.450> years<00:01:09.479> ago<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:12.600> know

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
started 15 years ago and now you know

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.169 
started 15 years ago and now you know
they're<00:01:12.929> the<00:01:13.619> way<00:01:13.770> accidents<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.729> collisions

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
they're the way accidents and collisions

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.990 
they're the way accidents and collisions
and<00:01:15.420> repair<00:01:16.320> processes<00:01:16.800> have<00:01:17.160> changed<00:01:17.729> is

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
and repair processes have changed is

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.350 
and repair processes have changed is
pretty<00:01:18.840> dramatic<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.850> when<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.060> look<00:01:21.210> at

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
pretty dramatic so when you look at

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.270 
pretty dramatic so when you look at
newer<00:01:21.600> vehicles<00:01:22.380> at<00:01:22.500> our<00:01:22.590> own<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.130> Road

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
newer vehicles at our own kind of Road

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.639 
newer vehicles at our own kind of Road
now<00:01:23.550> I<00:01:23.580> seriously<00:01:24.420> think<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.899> have<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> safest

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
now I seriously think we have the safest

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:26.990 
now I seriously think we have the safest
automobiles<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> road<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.700> we've<00:01:26.850> ever

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
automobiles on a road that we've ever

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.900 
automobiles on a road that we've ever
had<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.470> technology<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:29.340> gone<00:01:29.640> into

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
had and the technology that's gone into

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.270 
had and the technology that's gone into
those<00:01:30.000> automobiles<00:01:30.660> is<00:01:31.380> what<00:01:31.679> helps<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.100> save

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
those automobiles is what helps to save

00:01:32.280 --> 00:02:06.310 
those automobiles is what helps to save
people

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.139 

biggest<00:02:07.159> thing<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.520> see<00:02:07.640> in<00:02:07.939> the<00:02:08.030> industry

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
biggest thing that I see in the industry

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.570 
biggest thing that I see in the industry
today<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:08.899> is<00:02:09.020> a<00:02:09.289> problem<00:02:09.709> is<00:02:10.039> it's<00:02:10.220> getting

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
today that is a problem is it's getting

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.250 
today that is a problem is it's getting
the<00:02:10.670> correct<00:02:10.879> education<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.780> technician

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
the correct education to the technician

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.050 
the correct education to the technician
making<00:02:12.920> him<00:02:13.040> understand<00:02:13.519> what<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.819> new

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
making him understand what the new

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.479 
making him understand what the new
vehicle<00:02:14.720> processes<00:02:15.319> are<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.830> new<00:02:16.010> vehicle

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
vehicle processes are the new vehicle

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.309 
vehicle processes are the new vehicle
content<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:17.540> my<00:02:17.720> opinion<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.230> biggest

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
content in my opinion the biggest

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.350 
content in my opinion the biggest
challenge<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:18.950> getting<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.310> information

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
challenge is getting the information

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.070 
challenge is getting the information
from<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.870> manufacturers<00:02:21.650> on<00:02:21.920> how<00:02:22.099> how<00:02:23.080> they

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
from the manufacturers on how how they

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.050 
from the manufacturers on how how they
wants<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.590> repair<00:02:24.890> their<00:02:25.069> vehicles<00:02:25.550> the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
wants to repair their vehicles the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.089 
wants to repair their vehicles the
biggest<00:02:26.420> challenges<00:02:26.989> I<00:02:27.170> think<00:02:27.200> are<00:02:27.590> training

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
biggest challenges I think are training

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.550 
biggest challenges I think are training
I<00:02:28.250> think<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.700> technicians<00:02:29.360> are<00:02:29.660> going<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:30.470> be

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
I think the technicians are going to be

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.530 
I think the technicians are going to be
constantly<00:02:31.160> looking<00:02:31.550> for<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:32.060> reaching<00:02:32.180> out

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
constantly looking for and reaching out

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.839 
constantly looking for and reaching out
for<00:02:33.170> information<00:02:33.920> on<00:02:34.069> how<00:02:34.099> to<00:02:34.280> deal<00:02:34.549> with<00:02:34.610> the

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
for information on how to deal with the

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.000 
for information on how to deal with the
technologies<00:02:35.540> in<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.810> vehicle<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.620> biggest

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
technologies in the vehicle the biggest

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.740 
technologies in the vehicle the biggest
challenges<00:02:37.430> we<00:02:37.640> have<00:02:37.970> in<00:02:38.180> this<00:02:38.299> industry<00:02:38.690> in

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
challenges we have in this industry in

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.839 
challenges we have in this industry in
my<00:02:38.870> opinion<00:02:39.349> is<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.739> lack<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.160> communication

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
my opinion is the lack of communication

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.309 
my opinion is the lack of communication
and<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.030> lack<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.269> knowledge<00:02:41.540> getting<00:02:42.140> down

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
and the lack of knowledge getting down

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.650 
and the lack of knowledge getting down
to<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.709> grassroots<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.970> actual<00:02:44.450> care

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
to the grassroots of the actual care

to the grassroots of the actual care
process<00:02:45.230> by<00:02:45.440> doing<00:02:45.739> it

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.170 

the<00:03:12.739> biggest<00:03:12.890> reason<00:03:13.099> it's<00:03:13.430> important<00:03:13.819> to<00:03:13.910> do

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
the biggest reason it's important to do

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.180 
the biggest reason it's important to do
correct<00:03:14.510> repairs<00:03:14.900> on<00:03:15.200> today's<00:03:15.530> vehicles<00:03:16.040> is

correct repairs on today's vehicles is

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.250 
correct repairs on today's vehicles is

elements of safety are so critical that
when<00:03:27.950> we<00:03:28.220> as<00:03:28.630> manufacturers<00:03:29.630> build<00:03:29.870> such<00:03:30.170> good
