00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.530
 a wonderful good day my 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.719
 ladies and gentlemen my name is trans 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.070
 rat and after a very long time 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.790
 Welcome back to a rat 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.739
 language 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.840
 today it's all about what was final 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.930
 just with reason he sees plays in the ce 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.489
 ie community testing in cairo for 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.269
 Crusher I think at the moment it will be 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.909
 pronounced 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.949
 In any case, there can be premium users 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.329
 ever play the patched game 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.070
 before the patch ever for everyone 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.990
 is publicly available 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.399
 however you know what I mean 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.869
 Anyway, my dice and thought 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.550
 ea or whatever they're called no idea 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.229
 if we owe it now 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.690
 are we going to do something where due 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.039
 This enormous shitstorm often becomes 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.200
 a lot was shot which I of course 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.910
 But people can understand, I tell you 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.960
 with final stand everything is okay 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.729
 before you start writing again like 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.020
 the children an ea shows me now 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.700
 of course no money for this 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.560
 Sure, it's just my personal 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.390
 feel and that is the thing stop 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.179
 just that Battlefield 4 hated 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.950
 at the gamescom back in beta 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.229
 I loved it then it came out and 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.210
 i hated hated hated guest 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.009
 until eventually label strike came 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.970
 then it was all right and then I have 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.759
 it is again guest 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.979
 so and now my friends through this 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.979
 I call it battlefield 2.0 patch 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.930
 and at the same time with final stand is 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.210
 Battlefield really finally back in 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.170
 Battlefield is a hit 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.759
 probably hands over your head 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.100
 together and say you can do that 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.140
 say these heavy tanks and blue and 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.479
 blood pus that's way too much 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.000
 futures and did not you see that though 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.780
 I personally stand often and it is still 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.360
 realist future wins and since 21 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.190
 42 I personally wish anyway 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.200
 a new feature battlefield and from 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.260
 That's why I feel right 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.780
 my hello we have hovercraft tanks 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.290
 things are things and the parts are too 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.709
 not ok because these tanks have no 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.070
 tower 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.230
 that means you just have to complete the whole 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.260
 to be able to meet dangerous turning and that 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.760
 is something that needs a bit of exercise 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.609
 and also needs a bit of skill 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.959
 and pay attention to that , you have to 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.549
 quite honestly say that the parts 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.079
 relatively difficult to control 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.990
 and you have to be able to drive it like that 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:56.560
 it is easy to recognize now 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:57.820
 So I can really without me 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.530
 now want to be incense yourself 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.820
 no bad shooter, however , had 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.290
 I'm looking for mine in battlefield 4 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.660
 problems with meeting people 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.040
 I always thought that would have come yes 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.260
 actually have to fall by now 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.540
 meanwhile I played cde 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.700
 I had these problems at all 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.050
 not I thought I was cool accurate 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.370
 shoot and death goes better 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.620
 it but not what I'm 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.440
 it following I hope that when final 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.760
 the whole thing turned out like that 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.950
 plays as in the ce of the others are the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.390
 cards just terrific so that 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.010
 are really the first battlefield 4 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.930
 cards of which I can say 'the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.460
 Of course I can only get fat now 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.100
 judge in conquest mode because i like you 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.660
 I could not play fast yet 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.340
 However clear snow setting you have to 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.830
 I like to play in the snow 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.150
 and in terms of size, that reminds me 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.860
 So much for Battlefield 3 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.640
 Poor roadkill and so should 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.930
 battlefield be 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.610
 now the first to come again the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.140
 cards are way too big blabla though 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.630
 people it's battlefield it's called 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.880
 Battlefield The Spatial Corner Battle 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.220
 corner you know so 2 against 29 is 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.310
 nonsense here are 64 players there must 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.440
 you already have a certain size of maps 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.890
 built to keep up the fun 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.080
 to be able to 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.250
 I mean the other hand, without the 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.480
 one can also want to have time 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.980
 Just call of duty if you play 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.080
 this whole vehicle battle and stuff like that 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.320
 i need or stop battlefield tdm 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.330
 but then call of duty 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.260
 ask community 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.510
 write me my comments what 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.370
 He says what you think is the finest 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.750
 but you also say horny shit finally 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.910
 again a reasonable battlefield 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.190
 or could I have saved myself 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.570
 I'm totally disappointed 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.130
 I stress again for my part 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.020
 my personal opinion without it 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.310
 to get money 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.480
 battlefield final stand is mine 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.630
 battlefield 4 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.490
 I'm looking forward to it and I think so 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.870
 you should definitely do it antonius 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.850
 not necessarily premium but buy 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.210
 this is valid if you do not have one 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.040
 So, yes , I'll give you that 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.090
 then close even if we 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.030
 maybe not necessarily on snow 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.280
 I go out very strong 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.280
 that it should be fun anyway 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.720
 will likely 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.300
 Of course you have to say clearly 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.920
 when you say, will I give much for it 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.940
 no more money out of all things 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.490
 now where the premium edition 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.110
 comes out for 50 euros and we have 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.919
 at that time I paid 100 euro 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.990
 of course totally 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.010
 otherwise if you liked it there 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.110
 this video and thumbs up 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.110
 then when I just stop not skin pure
