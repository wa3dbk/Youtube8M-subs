00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.870 
to stick of a blue tack and that'll hold
the<00:02:22.180> back<00:02:22.360> end<00:02:22.600> up<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.250> landing<00:02:24.550> gear<00:02:24.610> are

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
the back end up and the landing gear are

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.720 
the back end up and the landing gear are
gone<00:02:25.060> on<00:02:25.300> already<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.290> sags<00:02:26.560> down<00:02:26.770> but<00:02:27.700> I

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
gone on already so it sags down but I

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.440 
gone on already so it sags down but I
recommend<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.840> do<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:29.320> with<00:02:29.590> your

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
recommend this to do this with your

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.670 
recommend this to do this with your
y-wings<00:02:31.450> if<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.930> hasn't<00:02:32.200> happened<00:02:32.470> yet

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
y-wings if it hasn't happened yet

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.160 
y-wings if it hasn't happened yet
because<00:02:33.100> it'll<00:02:33.310> eventually<00:02:33.430> will<00:02:34.300> happen<00:02:34.630> now

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
because it'll eventually will happen now

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.890 
because it'll eventually will happen now
I'm<00:02:35.260> not<00:02:35.440> sure<00:02:35.680> with<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.060> vintage-y<00:02:37.060> wings

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
I'm not sure with the vintage-y wings

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.140 
I'm not sure with the vintage-y wings
the<00:02:38.200> new<00:02:38.350> ones<00:02:38.590> will<00:02:38.830> come<00:02:38.860> out<00:02:39.130> last<00:02:39.310> year<00:02:39.610> if

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
the new ones will come out last year if

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.280 
the new ones will come out last year if
we're<00:02:40.360> going<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.540> have<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.720> same<00:02:40.870> problems

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
we're going to have the same problems

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.490 
we're going to have the same problems
but<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.250> case<00:02:42.900> I'll<00:02:43.900> recommend<00:02:44.200> doing

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
but just in case I'll recommend doing

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.920 
but just in case I'll recommend doing
that<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:45.160> just<00:02:45.610> supports<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.360> back<00:02:46.510> end<00:02:46.750> up

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
that and just supports the back end up

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.010 
that and just supports the back end up
because<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.290> back<00:02:47.410> end<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.770> a<00:02:47.800> bit<00:02:48.040> heavy<00:02:48.340> so

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.660 

it's<00:02:53.020> very<00:02:53.230> nice<00:02:53.470> looking<00:02:53.800> what<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.430> really

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
it's very nice looking what I really

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.660 
it's very nice looking what I really
like<00:02:54.910> about<00:02:54.940> this<00:02:55.450> y-wing<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:56.170> held<00:02:56.670> the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
like about this y-wing it held the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.380 
like about this y-wing it held the
wavering<00:02:57.970> honor

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
wavering honor

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.860 
wavering honor
now<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.040> vintage<00:03:00.040> one<00:03:00.310> doesn't<00:03:01.000> have<00:03:01.150> that

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.580 

which<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:05.020> not<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.200> problem<00:03:05.380> but<00:03:05.830> just<00:03:07.380> makes<00:03:08.380> it

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
which is not a problem but just makes it

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.140 
which is not a problem but just makes it
look<00:03:08.800> a<00:03:08.830> bit<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:14.350> know<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.560> while<00:03:14.739> wing

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
look a bit you know the while wing

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.420 
look a bit you know the while wing
mock-ups<00:03:16.150> mentioned<00:03:16.959> before<00:03:17.260> has<00:03:17.680> always

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
not sure why but to me it does not by

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.800 
not sure why but to me it does not by
looks<00:03:36.130> but<00:03:36.400> just<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.820> role<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.390> aircraft

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810
