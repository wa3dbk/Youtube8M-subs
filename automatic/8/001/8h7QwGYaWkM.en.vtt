00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.989
 no 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.709
 hello franck anctil responsa debit 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.369
 binary of them located at saint lÃ´ in 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.780
 the sleeve 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.110
 I will introduce you today 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.279
 how to prune your fruit trees 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.710
 the size in green is done on 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.230
 pome fruit, example apple trees 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:32.239
 pear trees whose shapes we find that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:37.080
 we are not the master glassmaker half stems 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:40.080
 or body whose size in green consists 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.280
 so to give clarity to the subject so 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.559
 why the clack and it's for 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.149
 get the most beautiful fruits remove 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.399
 all that will be twig that can 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.010
 harm the fruits remove the suckers 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.600
 where gourmands are also called and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.309
 make a selection at the fruit level 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.920
 that is, when you have too much 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.510
 fruits on a eliminated subject eliminated 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.850
 of course also all those who are 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.800
 injured or sick to benefit the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.600
 fruits that will stay ahead to good 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.720
 maturity to make this size no 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.970
 used as a pruner tool 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.399
 instigators who must be first well 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.250
 sharpened to make straight cuts and 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.900
 also beforehand well cleaned and 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.200
 disinfected to avoid transmitting 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.520
 diseases about cutting a 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.250
 twig will always be made 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.960
 bevel and a centimeter 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.729
 close to the eye to avoid of course 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.220
 we have a desiccation and a bevel 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.659
 why to avoid that water stays at 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.579
 stagnate on and after causes 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.829
 the arrival of diseases on it is 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.920
 always a bevel and the blade of the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:46.890
 pruner flat side that stays along 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.020
 the remaining stem so the twig one 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.750
 Brady is a sprout of the year that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.430
 is not added yet and all very 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.189
 vigorous there I will show you 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.479
 how to cut a twig so here I 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.680
 will win the leaves for you 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.219
 show exactly where the cut is going 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.979
 be done 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.810
 and why am I doing this because here 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.549
 you have specific cases where you have to 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.369
 dar this level that can be 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.019
 turn yourself into fruit the year 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.880
 next by stopping fruit or so in 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.320
 wood buttons so we make a 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.910
 cut at that level so that the sap 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.910
 go in this fog 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.829
 so now we will continue to cut 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:24.819
 the twigs 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:32.840
 and that's from brady that are here shortened 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:35.150
 always envied of course then we go 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.010
 twig ferry that are on the 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.569
 ends also what to think 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.010
 because a plant is always a 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.420
 plant that has as it says frames 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.250
 so do not touch framing it's up to 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.590
 say the main branches and one 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.540
 delete of course the twigs for 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.319
 also give an aesthetic side to 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.120
 plant level 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.500
 what is it really like there 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.400
 it is a varied palette so fouquet the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.049
 shape with well pronounced elected and there 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.889
 we continue all the twigs 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.879
 we're going to shorten everything 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.280
 is young over the year are 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.269
 brushwood 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.280
 is what we can also do 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.079
 it's when we get to the ends 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.389
 so here we remove this twig 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.069
 and once all the others 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.889
 clues are removed what can we 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.219
 can we stop the subject from 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:17.959
 height 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.609
 it is to avoid always the sap 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.769
 always go in the most point 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.840
 climax is like that the sap goes down 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:29.870
 at the level to have a better 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.099
 freddy fication and that's our subject that 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.229
 took shape 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.030
 who now who will put a 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:37.519
 good policy fication directly 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.479
 next year on the cord this is the 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.489
 same size principle 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:48.709
 we cut the arms said to lighten 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:52.250
 given that light can penetrate and 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.930
 we also take advantage of course to clean 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.359
 for example if you have a fruit that has 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.129
 been rotten anyway started being 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.569
 eaten it is removed to avoid 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.579
 diseases come back on 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.199
 and when you have a punk band 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.130
 like that good there we have four apples 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.660
 and if you had 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.890
 six or seven steps but it would have taken 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.570
 take off two or three on top for 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.570
 can relieve a little bit off the sea 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.230
 thanks is this size will only be able 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.840
 get a good fried ification a 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.430
 good fruit set re and knowing that 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.320
 it's the last size of the year 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.820
 because the next size of 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.140
 training and fruiting 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.140
 will take place in March 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.040
 so the greedy is a 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.410
 it's a young shoot that appears 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.930
 always below the graft and who 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.870
 night at the plant so it's greedy there 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.240
 they must be removed 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.270
 we'll get them the farthest 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.270
 possible
