third variant of the Linux operating
system<00:01:02.270> I've<00:01:03.270> tried<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:05.840> this<00:01:06.840> computer<00:01:07.200> I

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
system I've tried for this computer I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.929 
system I've tried for this computer I
tried<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> move<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.270> first<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.490> was<00:01:11.490> as

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
tried to move to first and that was as

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.340 
tried to move to first and that was as
slow<00:01:12.420> as<00:01:12.450> Christmas<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:14.210> tried<00:01:15.210> Linux<00:01:16.140> Mint

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
slow as Christmas I tried Linux Mint

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.030 
slow as Christmas I tried Linux Mint
using<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> cinnamon<00:01:17.640> desktop<00:01:17.909> environment

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
using the cinnamon desktop environment

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.890 
using the cinnamon desktop environment
and<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.630> was<00:01:21.630> also

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.990 

very<00:01:25.560> very<00:01:25.830> slow<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:29.220> reason<00:01:29.610> I'm<00:01:29.730> switching

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
very very slow the reason I'm switching

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.570 
very very slow the reason I'm switching
is<00:01:30.390> because<00:01:30.660> of<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.350> fact<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.800> no<00:01:32.040> security

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
is because of the fact that no security

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.450 
is because of the fact that no security

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
one gig of memory that's handling itself

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.479 
one gig of memory that's handling itself
very<00:03:13.959> well<00:03:14.049> with<00:03:14.439> the<00:03:14.620> new<00:03:14.829> operating<00:03:15.370> system

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
very well with the new operating system

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.559 
very well with the new operating system
and<00:03:16.060> linux<00:03:16.359> mint<00:03:16.620> i<00:03:18.000> didn't<00:03:19.000> have<00:03:19.120> any<00:03:19.239> driver

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
and linux mint i didn't have any driver

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.449 
and linux mint i didn't have any driver
issues<00:03:20.049> everything<00:03:20.530> worked<00:03:20.799> upon

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
issues everything worked upon

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.429 
issues everything worked upon
installation<00:03:21.939> i<00:03:22.510> didn't<00:03:22.780> even<00:03:22.870> need<00:03:23.079> to<00:03:23.200> tweak

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:23.439 
installation i didn't even need to tweak

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
installation i didn't even need to tweak
the<00:03:23.590> nvidia<00:03:24.010> driver<00:03:24.340> with<00:03:25.209> my<00:03:25.420> aftermarket

the nvidia driver with my aftermarket

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.479 
the nvidia driver with my aftermarket
geforce<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:29.879> so<00:03:30.879> yeah<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.060> highly<00:03:31.510> recommend

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
geforce so so yeah I highly recommend

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.089 
geforce so so yeah I highly recommend

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
like you're going to be playing brand

new<00:03:47.079> games<00:03:47.349> on<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.680> system<00:03:47.889> anyways<00:03:48.689> you<00:03:49.689> can

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
new games on the system anyways you can

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.390 
new games on the system anyways you can
still<00:03:50.159> play<00:03:51.159> emulators<00:03:51.959> by<00:03:52.959> using<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:54.159> wine

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
still play emulators by using the wine

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.390 
still play emulators by using the wine
software<00:03:55.209> as<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.569> very<00:03:56.260> common<00:03:56.680> Linux<00:03:56.980> program

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
software as a very common Linux program

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.420 
software as a very common Linux program
that<00:03:57.700> will<00:03:57.819> allow<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.540> use<00:03:59.430> windows-based

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
that will allow you to use windows-based

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.640 
that will allow you to use windows-based
emulators<00:04:01.329> if<00:04:01.689> you<00:04:01.810> so<00:04:02.019> choose<00:04:02.290> if<00:04:02.530> you<00:04:02.560> want

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
emulators if you so choose if you want

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.360 
emulators if you so choose if you want
to<00:04:02.859> continue<00:04:03.040> using<00:04:03.430> those<00:04:04.229> or<00:04:05.229> any<00:04:06.069> of<00:04:06.280> the

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
to continue using those or any of the

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.979 
to continue using those or any of the
older<00:04:06.669> games<00:04:06.940> that<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.479> system<00:04:07.840> would<00:04:07.930> be

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
older games that the system would be

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.020 
older games that the system would be
able<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.319> play<00:04:08.440> anyways<00:04:09.069> you<00:04:09.340> could<00:04:09.519> use<00:04:09.729> wine

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
able to play anyways you could use wine

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.379 
able to play anyways you could use wine
to<00:04:10.060> play<00:04:10.479> them<00:04:11.400> like<00:04:12.400> I<00:04:12.519> said<00:04:12.729> this<00:04:12.879> is<00:04:13.120> the

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
to play them like I said this is the

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.259 
to play them like I said this is the
system's<00:04:14.169> been<00:04:14.319> far<00:04:15.069> outclassed<00:04:15.699> by<00:04:15.909> new

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
system's been far outclassed by new

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.539 
system's been far outclassed by new
systems<00:04:16.750> when<00:04:17.530> it<00:04:17.650> comes<00:04:17.829> to<00:04:17.979> playing<00:04:18.190> video

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549

systems when it comes to playing video
games<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.989> if<00:04:20.440> that's<00:04:20.650> your<00:04:20.949> concern<00:04:21.099> I<00:04:21.840> mean

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
games so if that's your concern I mean

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.930 
games so if that's your concern I mean
this<00:04:23.349> you're<00:04:24.070> not<00:04:24.190> going<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:24.400> be<00:04:24.490> using<00:04:24.699> this

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
this you're not going to be using this

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.969 
this you're not going to be using this
for<00:04:25.210> four<00:04:25.570> games<00:04:25.720> anyways<00:04:26.289> this<00:04:26.470> is<00:04:26.530> going<00:04:26.889> to

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
for four games anyways this is going to

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.670 
for four games anyways this is going to
be<00:04:27.130> an<00:04:27.280> office<00:04:27.930> computer<00:04:28.930> some<00:04:29.199> light<00:04:29.440> web

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
be an office computer some light web

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.710 
be an office computer some light web
browsing<00:04:32.610> it's<00:04:33.610> still<00:04:33.970> set<00:04:34.240> up<00:04:34.389> very<00:04:34.659> much

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
browsing it's still set up very much

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.210 
browsing it's still set up very much
like<00:04:35.259> you<00:04:35.590> would<00:04:36.190> expect<00:04:37.120> a<00:04:38.190> Windows<00:04:39.190> computer

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
like you would expect a Windows computer

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.300 
like you would expect a Windows computer
set<00:04:39.849> up<00:04:39.880> so<00:04:40.870> if<00:04:41.110> you're<00:04:41.259> new<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.500> linux<00:04:41.800> is<00:04:42.130> easy

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
set up so if you're new to linux is easy

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.970 
set up so if you're new to linux is easy
to<00:04:42.550> adopt<00:04:44.099> it's<00:04:45.099> got<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.310> menu<00:04:45.759> instead<00:04:46.120> of

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
to adopt it's got a menu instead of

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.010 
to adopt it's got a menu instead of
the<00:04:47.370> start<00:04:47.640> menu<00:04:47.820> but<00:04:48.180> it's<00:04:48.300> very<00:04:48.480> similar<00:04:48.990> and

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
the start menu but it's very similar and

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.690 
the start menu but it's very similar and
