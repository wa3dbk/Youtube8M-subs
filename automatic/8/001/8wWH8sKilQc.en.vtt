hello my amazing subscribers and welcome

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.900 
hello my amazing subscribers and welcome
newcomers<00:00:04.319> I<00:00:04.440> have<00:00:04.589> carnage<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.310> creator<00:00:05.339> and

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
newcomers I have carnage the creator and

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.920 
newcomers I have carnage the creator and
today<00:00:06.089> I'm<00:00:06.270> gonna<00:00:06.359> be<00:00:06.480> teaching<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.779> guys

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
today I'm gonna be teaching you guys

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.150 
today I'm gonna be teaching you guys
about<00:00:07.140> these<00:00:07.319> little<00:00:07.560> things<00:00:07.890> called

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
about these little things called

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.250 
about these little things called
weighted<00:00:08.700> pressure<00:00:09.059> plates<00:00:09.420> so<00:00:09.660> first<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
weighted pressure plates so first the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.740 
weighted pressure plates so first the
foremost<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.860> have<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.340> light<00:00:12.210> weighted

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
foremost you have a light weighted

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.120 
foremost you have a light weighted
pressure<00:00:12.960> plate<00:00:13.230> which<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.410> gold<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.009> then

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
pressure plate which is gold and then

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.980 
pressure plate which is gold and then
you<00:00:14.250> have<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> heavy<00:00:14.969> weighted<00:00:15.330> pressure<00:00:15.660> plate

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
you have a heavy weighted pressure plate

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.349 
you have a heavy weighted pressure plate
which<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.529> iron<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.580> if<00:00:17.970> you're<00:00:18.119> wondering

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
which is iron so if you're wondering

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.300 
which is iron so if you're wondering
what<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> X<00:00:18.960> values<00:00:19.080> for<00:00:19.619> these<00:00:19.830> things<00:00:20.130> are

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
what the X values for these things are

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.279 
what the X values for these things are
first<00:00:20.609> before<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.029> actually<00:00:21.060> decide<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:22.170> go

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
first before you actually decide to go

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.140 
first before you actually decide to go
and<00:00:22.470> make<00:00:22.619> them<00:00:22.800> for<00:00:22.980> yourself<00:00:23.340> they<00:00:23.699> use<00:00:23.910> for

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
and make them for yourself they use for

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.300 
and make them for yourself they use for
these<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.689> actually<00:00:24.900> output<00:00:25.650> different

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
these is to actually output different

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.429 
these is to actually output different
signal<00:00:26.789> strengths<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.330> redstone<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.019> these

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
signal strengths of redstone and these

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.450 
signal strengths of redstone and these
can<00:00:28.650> be<00:00:28.680> very<00:00:29.010> useful<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:29.820> comparators<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.460> if

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
can be very useful for comparators so if

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.650 
can be very useful for comparators so if
you<00:00:32.640> need<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.910> know<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> little<00:00:33.180> bit<00:00:33.360> more<00:00:33.540> about

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
you need to know a little bit more about

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.209 
you need to know a little bit more about
comparators<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.469> actually<00:00:34.800> go<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
comparators you can actually go in the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.830 
comparators you can actually go in the
description<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.910> video<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.390> there<00:00:36.750> will

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
description of this video and there will

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.600 
description of this video and there will
be<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.960> link<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.410> comparator<00:00:38.070> video<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.579> I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
be a link to a comparator video that I

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.549 
be a link to a comparator video that I
did<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.210> pretty<00:00:39.480> much<00:00:39.660> tells<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.050> anything

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
did that pretty much tells you anything

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.690 
did that pretty much tells you anything
and<00:00:40.680> everything<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.160> need<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.460> know<00:00:41.579> about

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and everything you need to know about

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.950 
and everything you need to know about
comparators<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.510> you're<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> little<00:00:42.780> bit

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
comparators so if you're a little bit

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.470 
comparators so if you're a little bit
fuzzy<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.620> go<00:00:44.550> check<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
fuzzy on that go check out the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.970 
fuzzy on that go check out the
description<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> video<00:00:46.500> for<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.739> but

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
description for the video for that but

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.440 
description for the video for that but
anyways<00:00:47.219> what<00:00:47.640> these<00:00:47.760> things<00:00:47.940> will<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.239> is

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
anyways what these things will do is

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.510 
anyways what these things will do is
output<00:00:49.079> different<00:00:49.530> signal<00:00:49.890> strings<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
output different signal strings and

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.939 
output different signal strings and
there's<00:00:50.730> 15<00:00:51.300> different<00:00:51.719> signal<00:00:52.079> string<00:00:52.289> next

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
there's 15 different signal string next

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.240 
there's 15 different signal string next
to<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> redstone<00:00:53.789> torch<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.960> 15<00:00:55.680> next<00:00:56.190> to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
to a redstone torch that is 15 next to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.310 
to a redstone torch that is 15 next to
that<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.520> 14<00:00:56.940> 13<00:00:57.629> 12<00:00:57.840> 11<00:00:58.260> 10<00:00:59.000> nine<00:01:00.000> eight<00:01:00.359> seven

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that is 14 13 12 11 10 nine eight seven

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.170 
that is 14 13 12 11 10 nine eight seven
six<00:01:01.559> five<00:01:02.039> four<00:01:03.000> three<00:01:03.589> two<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.220> one

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
six five four three two and one

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.760 
six five four three two and one
now<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.810> probably<00:01:07.020> noticed<00:01:07.290> something<00:01:07.710> about

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
now you probably noticed something about

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.100 
now you probably noticed something about
this<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.909> 15<00:01:09.689> signal

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
this and that is that a 15 signal

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.469 
this and that is that a 15 signal
strength<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> lot<00:01:10.890> stronger<00:01:11.280> than<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.119> one

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
strength is a lot stronger than a one

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.789 
strength is a lot stronger than a one
signal<00:01:12.960> strength<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.500> actually

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
signal strength and if you actually

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.280 
signal strength and if you actually
place<00:01:13.979> one<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:14.490> whoops<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.450> fell<00:01:15.869> down<00:01:15.900> if

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
place one more whoops we fell down if

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.620 
place one more whoops we fell down if
you<00:01:16.799> place<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:17.430> more<00:01:17.700> that's<00:01:18.150> actually

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you place one more that's actually

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.179 
you place one more that's actually
completely<00:01:19.200> turned<00:01:19.439> off<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.070> tell

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
completely turned off as you can tell

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.740 
completely turned off as you can tell
that's<00:01:20.369> really<00:01:20.820> really<00:01:21.000> dark<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.630> has

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
that's really really dark and that has

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
that's really really dark and that has
no<00:01:22.049> power<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.950> has<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> little<00:01:23.369> bit<00:01:23.460> of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
no power and that has a little bit of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.039 
no power and that has a little bit of
power<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.119> little<00:01:24.360> bit<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> little<00:01:24.840> bit

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
all the way up to 15 which is right next

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.580 
all the way up to 15 which is right next
to<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:29.939> torch<00:01:30.210> which<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.750> strong<00:01:31.259> as<00:01:31.439> it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
to it torch which is as strong as it

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.670 
to it torch which is as strong as it
possibly<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.490> get<00:01:32.790> now<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.200> weighted

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
possibly can get now on to the weighted

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.230 
possibly can get now on to the weighted
pressure<00:01:34.979> plates<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.700> way<00:01:35.820> these<00:01:36.030> things

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
pressure plates the way these things

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.710 
pressure plates the way these things
work<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.930> actually<00:01:37.500> measures<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
work is that actually measures the

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.330 
work is that actually measures the
different<00:01:39.720> amount<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.110> blocks<00:01:40.380> that's<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
different amount of blocks that's on the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.249 
different amount of blocks that's on the
pressure<00:01:41.610> plate<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.060> here<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.869> light

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
pressure plate so here we have the light

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.080 
pressure plate so here we have the light
pressure<00:01:43.590> plate<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.399> go<00:01:44.549> light<00:01:44.790> pressure

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
pressure plate and we go light pressure

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.870 
pressure plate and we go light pressure
plate<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.689> takes<00:01:46.170> between<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.369> four

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
plate it takes between one and four

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.960 
plate it takes between one and four
blocks<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.720> actually<00:01:49.590> light<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.460> first

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
blocks to actually light up the first

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.130 
blocks to actually light up the first
one<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:51.840> go

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
one so here we go

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.380 
one so here we go
let's<00:01:52.409> go<00:01:52.530> ahead<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.950> drop<00:01:53.130> ourselves<00:01:53.729> one

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
let's go ahead and drop ourselves one

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.480 
let's go ahead and drop ourselves one
block<00:01:54.659> that's<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.409> go<00:01:55.560> ahead<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.130> light

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
block that's going to go ahead and light

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.899 
block that's going to go ahead and light
it<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.600> place<00:01:57.869> two<00:01:58.700> three<00:01:59.700> and

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
it up and you can place two three and

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.510 
it up and you can place two three and
four<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.990> as<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.469> tell<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.040> didn't

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
four and as you can tell that didn't

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.550 
four and as you can tell that didn't
even<00:02:02.640> affect<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.659> second<00:02:04.020> one<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.409> have<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
even affect the second one so we have a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.980 
even affect the second one so we have a
signal<00:02:05.009> strength<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.880> however<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:06.869> you

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
signal strength of one however if you

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.320 
signal strength of one however if you
put<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.290> between<00:02:07.409> five<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.340> eight<00:02:08.670> blocks

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
put it between five and eight blocks

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.110 
put it between five and eight blocks
that's<00:02:09.959> actually<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.039> activate<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
that's actually going to activate the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.360 
that's actually going to activate the
at<00:02:12.209> 1:00<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:12.629> five<00:02:14.209> six<00:02:15.290> seven<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.470> eight<00:02:16.950> and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
at 1:00 so five six seven and eight and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.070 
at 1:00 so five six seven and eight and
as<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:17.670> can<00:02:17.760> tell<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.209> didn't<00:02:18.540> go<00:02:18.720> any<00:02:18.959> further

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
as you can tell it didn't go any further

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.110 
as you can tell it didn't go any further
than<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.830> second<00:02:20.190> one<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.430> that's<00:02:20.760> how<00:02:21.060> that

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
than the second one so that's how that

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.270 
than the second one so that's how that
works<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:22.170> more<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.709> have<00:02:22.739> on<00:02:23.099> there

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
works the more that you have on there

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.839 
works the more that you have on there
the<00:02:23.700> more<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.150> signal<00:02:24.720> strength<00:02:25.049> is<00:02:25.610> now<00:02:26.610> on

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
the more the signal strength is now on

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.300 
the more the signal strength is now on
to<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.209> heavy<00:02:27.540> pressure<00:02:27.989> plate<00:02:28.379> this<00:02:29.069> is

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
to the heavy pressure plate this is

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.300 
to the heavy pressure plate this is
where<00:02:29.519> it<00:02:29.670> takes<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.209> whole<00:02:30.569> lot<00:02:30.629> of<00:02:30.989> blocks<00:02:31.440> so

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
where it takes a whole lot of blocks so

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.610 
where it takes a whole lot of blocks so
for<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.180> heavy<00:02:33.420> one<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.989> actually<00:02:34.170> takes

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
for the heavy one it actually takes

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.490 
for the heavy one it actually takes
between<00:02:34.829> one<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.670> forty<00:02:36.299> two<00:02:36.569> blocks<00:02:37.140> to

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
between one and forty two blocks to

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.830 
between one and forty two blocks to
actually<00:02:37.950> put<00:02:38.549> it<00:02:38.670> as<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:39.060> signal<00:02:39.329> strength<00:02:39.690> of

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
actually put it as a signal strength of

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.550 
actually put it as a signal strength of
one<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:40.470> here<00:02:40.680> we<00:02:40.799> go<00:02:40.980> with<00:02:41.549> one<00:02:42.450> block<00:02:42.750> there's

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
one so here we go with one block there's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.830 
one so here we go with one block there's
one<00:02:43.890> now<00:02:44.430> we're<00:02:44.549> going<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.700> go<00:02:44.849> ahead<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.420> put

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
one now we're going to go ahead and put

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.360 
one now we're going to go ahead and put
it<00:02:45.930> all<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.200> way<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.349> 42<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.459> have<00:02:47.640> 2<00:02:48.359> 3<00:02:49.109> 4<00:02:49.739> 5

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
it all the way to 42 so we have 2 3 4 5

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.150 
it all the way to 42 so we have 2 3 4 5
6<00:02:51.090> 7<00:02:51.840> 8<00:02:52.019> 9<00:02:52.560> 10<00:02:52.890> 11<00:02:53.069> 12<00:02:53.459> 13<00:02:53.790> 14<00:02:54.120> 15<00:02:54.599> 16<00:02:54.930> 17<00:02:55.140> 18<00:02:55.590> 19<00:02:55.829> 20

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.259 
34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 and 42 now as
you<00:03:07.319> can<00:03:07.500> tell<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:07.980> did<00:03:08.190> not<00:03:08.489> affect<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
you can tell that did not affect the

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.240 
you can tell that did not affect the
second<00:03:09.659> one<00:03:09.780> at<00:03:09.930> all<00:03:10.109> however<00:03:10.620> if<00:03:10.890> we<00:03:11.010> go<00:03:11.129> ahead

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
second one at all however if we go ahead

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.300 
second one at all however if we go ahead
and<00:03:11.430> add<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:12.060> one<00:03:12.480> more<00:03:12.720> block<00:03:12.930> boom<00:03:13.920> we<00:03:14.159> have

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
and add just one more block boom we have

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.759 
and add just one more block boom we have
our<00:03:14.549> second<00:03:15.090> level<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:16.049> power<00:03:16.260> right<00:03:16.500> there

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
our second level of power right there

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.020 
our second level of power right there
that<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.410> redstone<00:03:19.410> with<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.859> power<00:03:20.130> of<00:03:20.340> 2

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
that is a redstone with the power of 2

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.080 
that is a redstone with the power of 2
and<00:03:21.329> then<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.049> goes<00:03:22.260> all<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.590> way<00:03:22.769> from<00:03:23.090> 43

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
and then that goes all the way from 43

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.420 
and then that goes all the way from 43
to<00:03:24.359> 85<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.109> right<00:03:25.260> now<00:03:25.349> we<00:03:25.410> have<00:03:25.620> 43<00:03:26.040> on<00:03:26.250> there

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
to 85 so right now we have 43 on there

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.699 
to 85 so right now we have 43 on there
and<00:03:26.700> we<00:03:26.849> can<00:03:27.000> put<00:03:27.150> all<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.510> way<00:03:27.599> up<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.870> 85<00:03:28.410> and

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
and we can put all the way up to 85 and

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.710 
and we can put all the way up to 85 and
it<00:03:28.799> will<00:03:28.980> not<00:03:29.220> affect<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:30.060> third<00:03:30.299> piston

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
it will not affect that third piston

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.720
