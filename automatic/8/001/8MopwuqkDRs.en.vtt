00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.830
 we are no longer growing in 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.309
 europe him managing pathology 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.260
 vegetable 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.250
 we try to keep alive 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.179
 plants just waiting to die 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.740
 so sick they are 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.150
 nothing to do with agriculture has 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.190
 spent with a trend and cultivate 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.320
 healthy plants we did not put a 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.000
 pesticide in 1950 are the wheats in 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.189
 europe did not have a treatment 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.220
 fungal that were involved 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.480
 now it's at least 3 4 otherwise the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.730
 wheat it is rotten before arriving in 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.740
 the silo incorporating a huge difference 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.180
 and rise to the level but it shows 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.480
 not passed as we swayed 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.370
 products he holds the wheat he is well 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.200
 except that if this breaks the figure then 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.730
 it is that we subway nitrogen it falls 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.860
 you must have seen in the fields the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.210
 wheat that falls then we put hormones 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.989
 to shorten the stems for that 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.370
 the mules are much lower than 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.950
 formerly once wounded one 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.210
 doctor when you wait they are 60 cm 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.739
 because we shorten them with 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.600
 hormones for when his weapons once 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.460
 aborted weapons then yahoo ride in 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.890
 face and makes disappear all there any 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.570
 the flora because it generates pressure 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.940
 dicotyledons finally it's a species 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.850
 of world completely strain I believe 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.840
 but people do not know it so 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.890
 now the fields formerly the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.540
 chances were full of poppies 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.210
 complained about there were plenty of others 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.840
 species to a biodiversity in one 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.640
 country like Holland has already lost 75% 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.869
 with all its strength there is a flowers 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.700
 the poorest of the planet the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:27.420
 holland but intensified at 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.960
 agricultural level in an incredible way you 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.960
 did you see your soil 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:40.340
 exciting is impressive the no 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.890
 the winner because we are with lilian the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.060
 chitin we put ourselves another and a 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.140
 other account since when we started 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.310
 to show that the only moore is 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.860
 biologically asked us about ourselves 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.750
 shut up so we left the institute and we 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.100
 started our business because we 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.450
 felt that the duty of scientificity 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.940
 still to alert the agricultural world 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.890
 that the way that was chosen was 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.710
 not the right one for the would not allow 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.000
 to make a sustainable agriculture it does not 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.890
 can be perennial farmers 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.229
 that if we are on living soils it is 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.300
 the soil and house 80% of the biomass 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.039
 alive so if you kill we are where 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.750
 90% is that killing all 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.620
 who is at the source of life is 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.730
 still a microbe that feed 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.970
 our plants that make that take back his 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.930
 sen are nutritious to us while 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.340
 now people actually we are 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.600
 still in society the most 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.340
 comfortable in the history of humanity 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.010
 our social security expenditure 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.209
 increases by 6% a year ago anyway 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.950
 questions to ask when is this 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.769
 that people are so well fed that it 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.430
 could be so sick 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.110
 the problem is that indeed 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.100
 the argumentation is yes look they 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.840
 live longer and longer 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.730
 of course the people who right now 80 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.070
 years have not known agriculture 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.920
 chemical before the age of 50 since 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.690
 it's up to 70 in Paris, so up to 50 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.739
 years they ate 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.610
 I'm still a kid of milk 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.769
 cow who tasted milk from 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.750
 cow it really wants to stand up delannoy h 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.950
 it is not now so this is what is 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.630
 so recent in the history of 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.299
 humanity that we will not know 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.860
 real results and we're worried 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.110
 you take the population of children to 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.459
 at present in europe 17% of 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.720
 children are obese hong kong we are in 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.950
 right to ask questions about 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.730
 this food quality the only one 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.549
 a real sponge 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.660
 so if I handle it poorly it is compact 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.329
 is tight it closes 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.530
 if I leave the crazy their job and he 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.030
 will blow on that only when you 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.160
 walk in the forest on a floor did not have the 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.720
 soft side of the forest floor 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.090
 because in fact he is wandering through the 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.079
 wildlife while the balance was plowed 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.569
 and mistreated he is correctly 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.219
 compact and tight on itself 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.959
 when it's going to rain on one 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:32.749
 tightened balloon will not be able to return 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.519
 then to erosion but it's easier 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:36.590
 to blame the rain for being responsible for 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.909
 erosion of floods than to say 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.530
 that it is an agricultural system that has 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.510
 provoked since the innocents we 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.549
 have at this moment one for 20 years 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.139
 for twenty years we have been going through 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.219
 the driest years since 3000 years 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.870
 in the history of europe 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.189
 and never have there been so many floods 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.239
 that is, we invented with 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.950
 intensive agriculture 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.540
 innovations period sajus that is 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.469
 very strong and environmentalists on time 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.189
 is the question of knowing 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.749
 How far 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.150
 when is it humanity that 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:00.980
 begin to collapse at least one 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.400
 is street 90% of our biodiversity in 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.780
 Europe 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.209
 it's still going for us so the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.500
 ecologists say is that it's up to 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.090
 95% that if that's not going to let go is what 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.739
 we do not know the catastrophe of 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.480
 cretaceous ridiculous so we present what 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.889
 is happening right now but its value its 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.299
 mother his mother and then people wait 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.230
 may say that one day we will see 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.230
 when are you gonna fart
