00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello transport a new video 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.379
 so I'm going to show you how it's 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.620
 the Hebrides and on horseback 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:14.370
 we start to melt so see the woman 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:19.080
 that he has like these deficit go towards 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.630
 the front one is not like that but as 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.400
 that and we will not put it here or here 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.170
 but we're going to put a little 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.769
 further ahead of the withers the tourniquet which 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.480
 is here we will put it here like that I 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.679
 will explain to you why after 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.510
 then I have a few hours so 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:39.320
 like this you have on top like that 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.320
 then I come to the back of the stage 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.020
 I pose it on young woman is actually 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.559
 if I deny them in the time before 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.190
 that's when john wants he wants to 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.020
 watch on camera 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.420
 it was simply to be able to go back 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.129
 the whole and high schools the weight she has to 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.500
 avoid having hair that is 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.140
 completely upside down 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.570
 according to carpet and I do not think it is 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.180
 very nice unemployed so after we 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.400
 can that scene is enough mercury 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.650
 and we come from train stations vampire hotels 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.080
 here to clear the guarantor avoid 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.720
 Anything likes friction 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:22.710
 for two turns do not it seems 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.780
 in the passage of 120 here gone and I 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.329
 will come 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.860
 catch gathers so opted for the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.810
 buckle two sides but sir that's 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.450
 inflating the belly alain points they 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.810
 peel nerves I'm sure I'm coming 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.140
 not a few hiccups and we 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.490
 comes without handlebar on the left 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.590
 we just put the moment said attached 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.929
 to the symbols 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.119
 So there I'll put a hole because 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.530
 he knows that is false bombs 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.670
 does that why ben simply because 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.189
 that they can not be tight so it 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.429
 concluded he swells himself with air like this 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.750
 seems once that sells the deflate of 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.519
 the scene 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.810
 it will thus seems to be rather tight 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.220
 so that's why it's necessary 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.379
 look like before going up it's for 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.610
 avoid breaking your face 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.440
 now she is well attached 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.190
 it must never be attached to the middle one 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.870
 always both here so here you are 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.030
 check that everything is fine that nothing 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.819
 is not folded months but curry I do not have 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.670
 mounted I crossed them face more 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.390
 practice verifies that everything is the 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.980
 flat rug talk about my side all 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.599
 is flat here everything is nickel 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.310
 and finally we will be able to put the net 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.870
 good there are some he puts the net first 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.940
 then the scene I'm doing the green 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.079
 because you're his future janicot box 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.110
 let's go back unplug the agricultural 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.940
 like these genius and we want us 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.889
 enclose over the value of fal at 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:04.350
 the less it is a glitch before mastering 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:06.780
 so these practices have been portrayed 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.530
 put the net he takes the reins in 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.859
 the right hand 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.470
 the headrest in the left hand we come 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:16.650
 Remy can pass as above 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.680
 the neckline we release the muse roll which 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.060
 is here it was passed next to 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.310
 amounts like that do not bother you the same 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.989
 to lift it then we will come 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.530
 move the arm right arm under the 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.579
 horse's head ask on the chamfer 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.660
 and catch the rising ones like this 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.240
 then with my left hand I'm going 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.790
 come take the bit like these is 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.230
 press the teeth all that moment there 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.670
 we see that he resists he does not want the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.770
 all open mouth and in parliament 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.140
 in this case we take the thumb 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.940
 we slide it here you see ya not 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.070
 in it we do not see if we do not know if 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.620
 we see but there are no teeth here we 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.310
 glide and press the gums and 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:03.490
 the foll opens his mouth we pass them 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.870
 ears not to the headrest one clears the 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.770
 toupee because otherwise it's ugly and 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.770
 not comfortable 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.520
 seen that it's a muse roll the swiss and 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:19.209
 French and I know what I realize 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.590
 my French guard theory we have 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.120
 but it is passed under the amounts 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.950
 I hang on last because before 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.690
 to go to classes like that he has the 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.240
 mouth will find the free mouth one is 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.650
 caught up with the barley soup that's here on 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.230
 the task here like that it takes the task 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.140
 and so that it's tight and 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.940
 we can pass the point as it is 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.910
 as if the point between the throat is 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.430
 he is to be happy the point between the 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.780
 horse's throat or barley for 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.080
 the fun I go there entrusted moment 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.100
 now little in belgium hall too 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.100
 fast and joy 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:00.150
 we no longer have the usefulness of the halter so she 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:16.249
 and now we're going to attach the 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:18.979
 round house and it's tight not too much 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:20.629
 tight either otherwise it does not brake everything 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.509
 understood but and we will be able to pass 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:27.229
 of them must therefore under between the chamfer 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:29.979
 and putting role so that's our horse 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:34.219
 he to these protections 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:37.129
 he has his stage he is bridled 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:40.569
 if you have to leave right away I 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:44.479
 can you macerate like these 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:46.339
 and you hold your right hand here and the 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.389
 left hand the rest of the queens but if 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:50.050
 you have to wait a little longer 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.490
 in the box I advise you to do if they 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.099
 have siam and son james and never 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.080
 you have to move a little bit away 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:59.389
 take your do not but in general 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.610
 we will benefit progress in the corners 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.529
 here we are paid like that so that 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.169
 chauvel even if they lower their heads that 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:09.039
 danton and felt bad 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.039
 now you know everything
