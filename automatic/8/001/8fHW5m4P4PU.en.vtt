00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
stuck on you because there is a magnet

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.570 
stuck on you because there is a magnet
right<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:22.560> little<00:01:22.830> magnet<00:01:23.159> will<00:01:23.310> allow

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
right here this little magnet will allow

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.630 
right here this little magnet will allow
us<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.759> go<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> any<00:01:24.960> any<00:01:25.710> kind<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> surface<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
us to go to any any kind of surface that

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.969 
us to go to any any kind of surface that
is<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> metal<00:01:27.060> surface<00:01:27.390> which<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.590> metal

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
is a metal surface which I have a metal

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.600 
is a metal surface which I have a metal
surface<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.430> here<00:01:29.850> somewhere<00:01:30.630> there<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.430> can

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
surface up here somewhere there so I can

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.609 
surface up here somewhere there so I can
literally<00:01:34.130> shine<00:01:35.299> from<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.479> here<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:37.020> I've<00:01:37.439> got

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
literally shine from up here up I've got

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.980 
literally shine from up here up I've got
up<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.950> my<00:01:37.979> support<00:01:38.689> magnetically<00:01:39.689> attached

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
up on my support magnetically attached

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.410 
up on my support magnetically attached
and<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.579> my<00:01:41.729> pin<00:01:41.909> spot<00:01:42.150> here

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and you can see I have my pin spot here

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.249 
and you can see I have my pin spot here
that's<00:01:42.990> about<00:01:43.259> three<00:01:43.979> feet<00:01:44.430> away

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
that's about three feet away

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.270 
that's about three feet away
approximately<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.439> I'm<00:01:46.710> getting<00:01:46.979> about

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
approximately and I'm getting about

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.480 
approximately and I'm getting about
about<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.790> 10<00:01:48.060> inch<00:01:48.210> pin<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> circle<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:50.040> very

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
about a 10 inch pin in a circle but very

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.749 
about a 10 inch pin in a circle but very
strong<00:01:50.850> magnet<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.450> bottom<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.720> these<00:01:51.810> so

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
strong magnet in the bottom of these so

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.670 
strong magnet in the bottom of these so
they're<00:01:53.759> cool<00:01:54.000> from<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.450> standpoint<00:01:54.840> you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
they're cool from that standpoint you

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.840 
they're cool from that standpoint you
know<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.219> they<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.670> some

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
know just that they have some

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.280 
know just that they have some
flexibility<00:01:57.360> where<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.780> hang<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
flexibility where you can hang it on the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.249 
flexibility where you can hang it on the
on<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.670> suspended<00:02:00.180> ceiling<00:02:00.360> or<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
on the suspended ceiling or you can you

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.130 
on the suspended ceiling or you can you
know<00:02:01.290> any<00:02:01.619> metal<00:02:02.280> surface<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.990> will<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
know any metal surface that will be a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.119

end where it is right now
I'm<00:03:53.110> getting<00:03:53.769> about<00:03:53.920> a<00:03:54.489> five<00:03:55.000> foot<00:03:55.299> circle<00:03:55.660> now

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
I'm getting about a five foot circle now

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.820 
I'm getting about a five foot circle now
so<00:03:57.250> you're<00:03:57.519> figuring<00:03:57.850> maybe<00:03:58.200> every<00:03:59.200> 10<00:03:59.530> feet

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
so you're figuring maybe every 10 feet

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.890 
so you're figuring maybe every 10 feet
approximately<00:04:00.250> you're<00:04:00.970> getting<00:04:01.299> yeah<00:04:01.660> well

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
approximately you're getting yeah well

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.320 
approximately you're getting yeah well
maybe<00:04:01.989> maybe<00:04:02.380> a<00:04:02.470> little<00:04:02.739> bit<00:04:02.920> over<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.519> foot<00:04:04.000> in

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
maybe maybe a little bit over a foot in

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.440 
maybe maybe a little bit over a foot in
diameter<00:04:04.600> of<00:04:05.110> your<00:04:05.320> circle<00:04:05.769> so<00:04:06.430> I<00:04:06.730> can<00:04:07.209> shine

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
diameter of your circle so I can shine

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.810 
diameter of your circle so I can shine
this<00:04:07.630> you<00:04:07.900> know<00:04:07.989> from<00:04:08.170> 50<00:04:08.470> 60<00:04:08.799> feet<00:04:08.920> away<00:04:09.070> I<00:04:09.400> can

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
this you know from 50 60 feet away I can

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
might want the warm white so you can

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.080 
might want the warm white so you can
take<00:04:59.979> that<00:05:00.100> out<00:05:00.160> there's<00:05:00.490> a<00:05:00.639> warm<00:05:00.940> white

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
take that out there's a warm white

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.879 
take that out there's a warm white
filter<00:05:01.449> in<00:05:01.539> there<00:05:01.690> there's<00:05:02.289> a<00:05:02.380> little<00:05:02.740> bit<00:05:02.860> of

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
filter in there there's a little bit of

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.760 
filter in there there's a little bit of
a<00:05:03.070> metal<00:05:03.760> clip<00:05:04.030> in<00:05:04.270> here<00:05:04.449> you<00:05:05.050> pop<00:05:05.229> that<00:05:05.470> up<00:05:05.590> put

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
a metal clip in here you pop that up put

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.710 
a metal clip in here you pop that up put
the<00:05:05.919> filter<00:05:06.250> in<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:07.150> clip<00:05:07.360> of<00:05:07.539> course

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
the filter in you the clip of course

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.580 
the filter in you the clip of course
we're<00:05:07.840> gonna<00:05:07.930> hang<00:05:08.080> it<00:05:08.169> upside<00:05:08.289> down<00:05:08.440> you

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
we're gonna hang it upside down you

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.930 
we're gonna hang it upside down you
probably<00:05:09.070> should<00:05:09.250> have<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.430> clip<00:05:09.580> and<00:05:09.760> put<00:05:09.880> it

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
probably should have the clip and put it

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.570 
probably should have the clip and put it
back<00:05:10.060> in<00:05:10.210> there<00:05:10.389> but<00:05:11.039> little<00:05:12.039> gels<00:05:12.250> really

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
back in there but little gels really

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.520 
back in there but little gels really
really<00:05:12.970> cold<00:05:13.180> in<00:05:13.300> there<00:05:13.449> well<00:05:13.630> but<00:05:14.260> you<00:05:14.320> can<00:05:14.440> do

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
really cold in there well but you can do

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.960 
really cold in there well but you can do
some<00:05:14.710> different<00:05:15.100> color<00:05:15.400> changing<00:05:15.820> with<00:05:15.940> the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
some different color changing with the
