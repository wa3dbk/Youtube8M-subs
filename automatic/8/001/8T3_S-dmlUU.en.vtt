for<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> last<00:00:54.750> eight<00:00:55.110> months<00:00:56.030> people<00:00:57.030> are

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
for the last eight months people are

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.240 
for the last eight months people are
going<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.600> figure<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:58.949> we're

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
going to figure that so now we're

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.099 
going to figure that so now we're
starting<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.699> notice<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.270> mainstream<00:01:00.930> is

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
starting to notice the mainstream is

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.670 
starting to notice the mainstream is
figuring<00:01:01.770> out<00:01:01.770> about<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:03.570> dollar<00:01:03.840> losing<00:01:04.530> its

figuring out about the dollar losing its

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.250 
figuring out about the dollar losing its
value<00:01:05.250> we're<00:01:05.489> seeing<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> index<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.810> below

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
value we're seeing the index going below

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.840 
value we're seeing the index going below
75<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.930> pretty<00:01:10.320> obey<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.640> that

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
75 so that is pretty obey to going that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.719 
75 so that is pretty obey to going that
low<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.560> they're<00:01:13.560> saying<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.159> stuff<00:01:14.460> now

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
low and they're saying this stuff now

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.820 
low and they're saying this stuff now
about<00:01:15.060> shorty<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.630> dollar<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.350> makes<00:01:16.590> me

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
about shorty the dollar it makes me

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.820 
about shorty the dollar it makes me
wonder<00:01:17.750> does<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.930> mean<00:01:19.259> we're<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
wonder does this mean we're going to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.890 
wonder does this mean we're going to
have<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> bear<00:01:20.460> market<00:01:20.700> rally<00:01:21.150> nothing<00:01:21.689> goes

have a bear market rally nothing goes
straight<00:01:22.259> down<00:01:22.580> nothing<00:01:23.580> goes<00:01:23.880> straight<00:01:24.330> up

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
straight down nothing goes straight up

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.350 
straight down nothing goes straight up

dollar so that's going to be an

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.020 
dollar so that's going to be an
advantage<00:02:33.810> for<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.010> problem<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.730> that

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
advantage for it but the problem is that

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.290 
advantage for it but the problem is that
it's<00:02:36.510> dollars<00:02:37.400> itself<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.790> we're<00:02:38.910> seeing<00:02:39.120> a

lending money I close to nothing but as

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.320 
lending money I close to nothing but as
far<00:03:26.880> as<00:03:26.940> banks<00:03:27.860> lending<00:03:28.860> back<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.489> money<00:03:29.730> they

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.270 
far as banks lending back the money they
are<00:03:30.360> doing<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:31.050> lot<00:03:31.200> less<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.010> course

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
are doing it a lot less and of course

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.920 
are doing it a lot less and of course
the<00:03:32.519> interest<00:03:32.820> rates<00:03:33.060> are<00:03:33.300> much<00:03:33.330> higher<00:03:33.540> than

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
the interest rates are much higher than

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.270 
the interest rates are much higher than
that<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:35.660> we<00:03:36.660> see<00:03:36.989> banks<00:03:37.590> making<00:03:37.860> all<00:03:38.250> of

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
that and we see banks making all of

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.030 
that and we see banks making all of
these<00:03:38.730> profits<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.930> that's<00:03:40.470> because<00:03:40.830> they're

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
these profits and that's because they're

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.460 
these profits and that's because they're
reducing<00:03:41.700> their<00:03:41.910> risk<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.450> think<00:03:42.720> too<00:03:43.019> because

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
reducing their risk I think too because

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.699 
reducing their risk I think too because
they're<00:03:43.620> not<00:03:43.860> lending<00:03:44.430> out<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:45.000> money<00:03:45.709> that

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
they're not lending out that money that

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.930 
they're not lending out that money that
creates<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.730> problem<00:03:48.380> for<00:03:49.380> not<00:03:50.280> having<00:03:50.730> any

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
creates the problem for not having any

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.330 
creates the problem for not having any
job<00:03:51.209> both<00:03:51.420> but<00:03:51.630> either<00:03:52.110> way<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.739> have<00:03:53.130> to

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
job both but either way you have to

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.430 
job both but either way you have to
decide<00:03:53.760> which<00:03:54.090> variable<00:03:54.660> do<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.900> want<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.260> go

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
decide which variable do you want to go
