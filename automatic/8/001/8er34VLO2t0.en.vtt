00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.650
 and 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.910
 the first step in making bagpipes is 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.010
 Here is a 20-centimeter piece 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.689
 round woods 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.090
 billet with a diameter of 4 and a half 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.820
 centimeter is one of three samples 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.490
 creating harmony they call it bass 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.890
 cut a hole in it with a cane 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.890
 which will become air channels 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.350
 the necessary shape of the cane is attached 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.900
 lathe it is equipped 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.280
 a stationary silicon cutter which 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.280
 durable enough to handle 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.500
 strong ebony it is very hard 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.530
 dry that is ideal for turning 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.530
 processing 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.530
 for small decorative 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.130
 elements use a hand tool 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.900
 which is called the crest to create 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.320
 additional decorative tracks 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.130
 the master takes a cutting cutter 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.350
 track measures using 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.729
 calipers need it so they 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.729
 met design requirements 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.880
 then the master is drilling holes for 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.070
 creating a graduation nozzle which 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.030
 put on the pipe 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.710
 nozzle made of material 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.450
 imitating ivory and 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.630
 are intended solely for 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.729
 decorations of all such tips 7 on top 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.390
 also for decorating on the pipe puts on 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.360
 metal roller then cuts out so 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.579
 called a brass cane so you 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.710
 see made of plastic but lovers 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.710
 classics prefer tubes made of wood 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.310
 now he puts a mouthpiece on a cane 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.100
 can be extended to 20 centimeters if 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.750
 it requires the growth of a musician 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.580
 the piper will blow into the mouthpiece inflating 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.229
 mih 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.720
 small metal tube between two 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.539
 plastic reeds forms a chanter 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.690
 bagpipes set it inside the cane 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.060
 at the bottom of the bellows in the 48 hole for 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.110
 extract different notes and two for 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.900
 timbre changes 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.630
 for reliability the master ties up cinder 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.959
 hemp cord a for tightness 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.060
 wraps it in teflon tape then 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.060
 the form is fixed with copper wire 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.859
 bridle wide open chan produces 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.780
 higher sounds 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.760
 sticks cane segments 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.959
 cord so that they tight 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.599
 held each other 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.379
 this cord is very flexible besides it 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.980
 easy to replace 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.889
 if it breaks and here it is completely 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.750
 finished shade tube 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.700
 then through the zipper furs inserted 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.549
 detail which is called the trunk 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.799
 mih make from breathing synthetic 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.959
 material and 5 trunks goes through 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.599
 rubber seal of bellows and books and 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.599
 3 canes filter and mouthpiece are connected 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:06.239
 the master inserts the chanter into the special 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.549
 sleeve at the end of the bellows and using a cord 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.450
 ties it around the fabric then they say no 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:17.230
 closes 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:20.040
 forming a sealed seam now mih 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.870
 placed in a decorative velvet cover 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.829
 Growth I push through the hole which 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.879
 fringed with wool or silk 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.099
 rubber valve does not give air 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.430
 exit back through the blowpipe and 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.220
 sends it to the chanter 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.260
 we have 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.900
 still on one piece the cane and placed 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.270
 plastic tongue it vibrates over 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.030
 wide bore creating traditional 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.100
 the sharp sound of bagpipes the master inserts 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.100
 tongue in a cane and a cane in a trunk 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.500
 woolen cord and holds the cane on 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.410
 place while playing at last master 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.420
 attaching a growth contract and placing it 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.370
 in the trunk all the bagpipes ready left 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.920
 only find someone who can on it 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.080
 play whale her cheek should be very 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.370
 strong lungs because some songs 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.370
 last 20 minutes
