00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.529
 so warmly come to the underground car park 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.849
 Now I'm looking for gas membrane around 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.000
 a video shot I show that again 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.580
 how it works and we have here now 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.080
 let the material come 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:21.510
 carburetor membrane repair then catch 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.869
 Let's say I have a small 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.710
 we do a little bit something prepared for this 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.029
 now the screws here on more everything 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.630
 nice to lie down like that, too 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.630
 finds 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.420
 so here is these defects in the carburetor 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.420
 membrane 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.240
 First we have to start the age 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.900
 build as I said we do up here 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:15.010
 cut into rings 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:20.390
 For this we take a side cutter 12 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:27.740
 even with the ring customers a bit 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:29.479
 hard but now here the loose 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.110
 carburetor membrane as you can see it 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.119
 broken here now who to paste this 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.040
 hole just too big have ever 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.680
 made but he is just too big 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:51.910
 so small holes we could do with game 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:54.710
 emergency fields few kilometers in 2007 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.030
 said the ring is on it have it 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.030
 just a little bit of people that does not matter 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.510
 I have made a small mistake 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.530
 was a little too fast 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:29.700
 This nose here must know more where 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.890
 she comes but there I am 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.840
 carburettor white me is installed 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.840
 usually like that 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:54.790
 ok, I 'm the later of several 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:56.530
 This should be a conversation 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.049
 how to watch that makes that the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.670
 rather after the fact but I know it from the 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.909
 in the end I have I've 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.049
 repaired there are two directions 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.670
 you have to raise the 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.480
 user manual look like that 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.480
 heard correctly 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:34.710
 he does give a different hand but so 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.550
 she would normally have to do it 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:42.220
 Let's try it for now 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.360
 Provisionally she presses me this 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:52.860
 then has the inner bus then 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:52.860
 Then they will disappear 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.720
 the other side 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.890
 why get on it 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.620
 this is in the manual itself 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.580
 badly described the point 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.980
 must be about with us 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.300
 to match 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.990
 After that take in the turn he is yes 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:42.200
 even seconds give me one too 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:42.200
 make a bit generous yes 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.470
 it would affect alone too 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.890
 but as I said with the profession 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.890
 has bolt 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:21.420
 the rest is going to be where the 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.420
 mark is 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.930
 really nice to slip under it 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.140
 j 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.210
 great is the glue, too 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.330
 a little more filled out that's exactly 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.330
 right 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:12.990
 he tortures himself a bit too 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:12.990
 so is it possible to let dry 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.690
 the custom is in there eight hours 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.190
 eight hours he is okay but me 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:27.970
 wants to strongly believe that already a lot 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:29.710
 it was okay the whole joke 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.580
 then it can be reinstalled 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.580
 and then it can be the 33 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:40.800
 There was a lot of fun with repairs
