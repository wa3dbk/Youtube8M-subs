00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
roster I'm going to do a video for each

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.810 
roster I'm going to do a video for each
team<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.070> we're<00:00:11.190> going<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.370> talk<00:00:11.519> about<00:00:11.670> some

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
team and we're going to talk about some

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.379 
team and we're going to talk about some
depth<00:00:12.420> chart<00:00:12.719> advice<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.380> how<00:00:14.309> these<00:00:14.940> ratings

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
depth chart advice and how these ratings

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.390 
depth chart advice and how these ratings
would<00:00:15.540> affect<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.960> scheme<00:00:16.289> i<00:00:16.440> would<00:00:16.590> run<00:00:16.800> so

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
would affect the scheme i would run so

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.500 
would affect the scheme i would run so
first<00:00:17.640> we're<00:00:17.820> going<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.970> start<00:00:18.029> with<00:00:18.330> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
first we're going to start with the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.880 
first we're going to start with the
quarterback<00:00:18.900> position<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.500> got<00:00:19.650> Colin

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
quarterback position we got Colin

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.769 
quarterback position we got Colin
Kaepernick<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:21.090> main<00:00:21.240> thing<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.480> I'm<00:00:21.660> going

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
Kaepernick the main thing is I'm going

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.300 
Kaepernick the main thing is I'm going
to<00:00:21.840> look<00:00:22.020> at<00:00:22.230> quarterback<00:00:22.710> you're<00:00:23.039> always

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
to look at quarterback you're always

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.609 
to look at quarterback you're always
just<00:00:23.490> speed<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.300> acceleration<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.380> then<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
just speed and acceleration and then the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.920 
just speed and acceleration and then the
throwing<00:00:26.010> exertion<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.269> we<00:00:27.300> see<00:00:27.689> that

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
throwing exertion so here we see that

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.720 
throwing exertion so here we see that
Colin<00:00:28.680> Kaepernick<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.400> fastest

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
Colin Kaepernick is the fastest

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.669 
Colin Kaepernick is the fastest
quarterback<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.779> he's<00:00:30.990> also<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> have

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
quarterback and he's also going to have

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.130 
quarterback and he's also going to have
the<00:00:32.160> highest<00:00:32.610> acceleration<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.960> we're<00:00:34.079> going

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the highest acceleration so we're going

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.569 
the highest acceleration so we're going
to<00:00:34.260> want<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.440> use<00:00:34.500> them<00:00:34.800> whenever<00:00:35.040> running

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
to want to use them whenever running

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.729 
to want to use them whenever running
read<00:00:35.940> options<00:00:36.480> or<00:00:36.750> anything<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.559> nature

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
read options or anything of that nature

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.880 
read options or anything of that nature
and<00:00:38.340> then<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.300> far<00:00:39.570> as<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.110> throw<00:00:40.440> ratings

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and then as far as the throw ratings

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.310 
and then as far as the throw ratings
we're<00:00:41.340> gonna<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.750> k<00:00:42.750> /<00:00:42.809> nape<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
we're gonna have k / nape with the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.260 
we're gonna have k / nape with the
highest<00:00:43.500> throw<00:00:43.800> power<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.850> not<00:00:45.000> going<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
highest throw power it's not going to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.510 
highest throw power it's not going to
have<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> highest<00:00:45.890> short-throw<00:00:46.890> accuracy

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
have the highest short-throw accuracy

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.160 
have the highest short-throw accuracy
but<00:00:47.850> he<00:00:47.910> does<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> highest<00:00:48.420> medium<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
but he does have the highest medium and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.690 
but he does have the highest medium and
deep<00:00:49.289> accuracy<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> most<00:00:50.280> part<00:00:50.520> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
deep accuracy so for the most part you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.889 
deep accuracy so for the most part you
want<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> use<00:00:51.059> Colin<00:00:51.360> Kaepernick<00:00:51.809> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
want to use Colin Kaepernick a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.990 
want to use Colin Kaepernick a
quarterback<00:00:52.379> never<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.309> need<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.820> use

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
quarterback never really need to use

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000 
quarterback never really need to use
Colt<00:00:54.329> McCoy<00:00:54.660> or<00:00:54.840> anybody<00:00:55.170> else<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.710> running

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
Colt McCoy or anybody else at running

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.220 
Colt McCoy or anybody else at running
back<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.309> got<00:00:56.430> friend<00:00:56.820> or<00:00:57.059> at<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.079> running

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
back we got friend or at the running

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.900 
back we got friend or at the running
back<00:00:58.410> position<00:00:58.469> I'm<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> look<00:00:59.280> at<00:00:59.430> speed

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
back position I'm going to look at speed

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.520 
back position I'm going to look at speed
and<00:01:00.329> then<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:00.690> gonna<00:01:00.780> look<00:01:01.020> mainly<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
and then I'm gonna look mainly for the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.590 
and then I'm gonna look mainly for the
carry<00:01:01.829> rating<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.550> then<00:01:02.670> probably<00:01:02.910> trucking

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
carry rating and then probably trucking

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.740 
carry rating and then probably trucking
and<00:01:04.379> acceleration<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.119> speed<00:01:06.479> we're

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
and acceleration so for speed we're

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.780 
and acceleration so for speed we're
looking<00:01:07.049> at<00:01:07.260> LaMichael<00:01:08.220> James<00:01:08.250> going<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.700> be

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
looking at LaMichael James going to be

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.640 
looking at LaMichael James going to be
the<00:01:08.880> fastest<00:01:09.299> guy<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:10.200> let's<00:01:10.409> look<00:01:10.530> at

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the fastest guy but let's look at

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.960 
the fastest guy but let's look at
acceleration<00:01:11.130> because<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:11.640> also<00:01:11.820> going

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
acceleration because that's also going

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.179 
acceleration because that's also going
to<00:01:12.030> play<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> big<00:01:12.420> role<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.560> again

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
to play a big role in this so again

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.499 
to play a big role in this so again
LaMichael<00:01:14.640> James<00:01:14.670> has<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> highest

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
LaMichael James has the highest

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.630 
LaMichael James has the highest
acceleration<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.439> speed<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.369> might

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
acceleration and speed so you might

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.510 
acceleration and speed so you might
consider<00:01:17.790> using<00:01:18.119> him<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:19.020> maybe<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.619> toss<00:01:19.950> or

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
consider using him on maybe a toss or

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
consider using him on maybe a toss or
anything<00:01:21.090> maybe<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> counter<00:01:21.960> where<00:01:22.110> you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
anything maybe like a counter where you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.660 
anything maybe like a counter where you
need<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> backfield<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.520> don't

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
need to get out the backfield you don't

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.380 
need to get out the backfield you don't
want<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> get<00:01:23.909> caught<00:01:24.150> from<00:01:24.330> behind

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
want to get caught from behind

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.210 
want to get caught from behind
especially<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> dive<00:01:25.560> tackles<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
especially with the dive tackles and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.280 
especially with the dive tackles and
then<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.880> far<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.210> trucking<00:01:27.689> obviously<00:01:28.259> a

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
then as far as trucking obviously a

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.990 
then as far as trucking obviously a
board<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.460> most<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.880> that

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
board is going to have the most of that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.020 
board is going to have the most of that
and<00:01:30.720> then<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.110> far<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.380> caring<00:01:31.950> Frank<00:01:32.790> Gore's

risk fumbling now let's look at the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.170 
risk fumbling now let's look at the
fullback<00:01:40.650> I'm<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.189> gonna<00:01:41.340> really<00:01:41.549> focus<00:01:41.729> too

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
fullback I'm not gonna really focus too

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.999 
fullback I'm not gonna really focus too
much<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:43.049> he's<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:43.380> better<00:01:43.560> than<00:01:43.799> one

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
much on here if he's not better than one

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.200 
much on here if he's not better than one
of<00:01:44.100> your<00:01:44.189> running<00:01:44.460> backs<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.850> might<00:01:45.030> avoid

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
of your running backs you might avoid

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.060 
of your running backs you might avoid
just<00:01:45.509> packaged<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.200> running<00:01:46.470> back<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.860> then

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
just packaged in a running back and then

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.679 
just packaged in a running back and then
if<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.490> want<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.820> some<00:01:47.970> sort<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.299> fullback

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
dive as far as wide receiver what I mean

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.289 
dive as far as wide receiver what I mean
look<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.780> speed<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.530> well<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.490> some

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
look for here is speed as well as some

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.999 
look for here is speed as well as some
of<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> catching<00:01:54.869> ratings<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.470> route<00:01:55.710> running

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
of the catching ratings in route running

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.999 
of the catching ratings in route running
so<00:01:57.000> our<00:01:57.240> fastest<00:01:57.750> guy<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.530> Mario

good route running as far as a tenant
you<00:02:34.220> got<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.370> lot<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:34.610> speed<00:02:34.940> here<00:02:35.240> so<00:02:35.810> that's

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
you got a lot of speed here so that's

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.470

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
to throw to across the middle of field

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.570 
to throw to across the middle of field
especially<00:02:40.750> underneath<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:42.050> deep<00:02:42.770> zone<00:02:42.800> and

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
especially underneath the deep zone and

especially underneath the deep zone and
stuff<00:02:43.760> like<00:02:43.910> that<00:02:43.970> on<00:02:44.150> all<00:02:44.510> zone<00:02:44.810> defenses<00:02:45.459> and

stuff like that on all zone defenses and

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.340 
stuff like that on all zone defenses and
his<00:02:46.700> catch<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.270> going<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.510> be<00:02:47.630> pretty<00:02:47.840> decent

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
his catch is going to be pretty decent

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.260 
his catch is going to be pretty decent
as<00:02:48.470> well<00:02:48.709> it's<00:02:48.890> actually<00:02:49.040> not<00:02:49.310> great<00:02:49.700> see<00:02:50.120> what

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
as well it's actually not great see what

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.690 
as well it's actually not great see what
it<00:02:50.330> is<00:02:50.480> here<00:02:50.690> 78<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:52.040> he's<00:02:52.250> not<00:02:52.370> going<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.580> hold

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
it is here 78 so he's not going to hold

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.430 
it is here 78 so he's not going to hold
on<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.060> anything<00:02:53.239> where<00:02:53.450> he<00:02:53.570> gets<00:02:53.750> hit<00:02:54.290> really

hard<00:02:54.560> with<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.600> let's<00:02:56.600> move<00:02:57.260> on<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.680> the

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
hard with so let's move on to the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.520 
hard with so let's move on to the
offensive<00:02:58.730> line<00:02:59.020> my<00:03:00.020> offensive<00:03:00.380> line<00:03:00.410> is

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
great here I pretty much just looked for

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.120 
great here I pretty much just looked for
overall<00:03:02.209> ratings<00:03:02.750> don't<00:03:03.380> really<00:03:03.590> focus<00:03:03.770> too

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
overall ratings don't really focus too

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.060 
overall ratings don't really focus too
much<00:03:04.160> on<00:03:04.489> all<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.420> other<00:03:05.680> blocking<00:03:06.680> regions

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
much on all the other blocking regions

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.449 
much on all the other blocking regions
so<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:09.200> offensive<00:03:09.560> line<00:03:09.680> is<00:03:09.799> really<00:03:10.190> good

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
so the offensive line is really good

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.650 
so the offensive line is really good
across<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.760> board<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:11.390> can<00:03:11.510> run

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
across the board so you can run

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.410 
across the board so you can run
whichever<00:03:12.080> side<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:12.620> can<00:03:12.970> really<00:03:13.970> count<00:03:14.209> them

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
whichever side you can really count them

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.420 
whichever side you can really count them
and<00:03:14.480> holding<00:03:14.750> their<00:03:14.870> blocks<00:03:15.250> defensive<00:03:16.250> line

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
and holding their blocks defensive line

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.039 
and holding their blocks defensive line
I<00:03:16.730> don't<00:03:16.970> really<00:03:17.060> focus<00:03:17.299> on<00:03:17.540> this<00:03:17.720> too<00:03:17.870> much

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
I don't really focus on this too much

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.390 
I don't really focus on this too much
unless<00:03:18.440> you're<00:03:18.650> doing<00:03:18.769> some<00:03:19.040> sort<00:03:19.280> of

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
unless you're doing some sort of

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.150 
unless you're doing some sort of
defensive<00:03:19.730> end<00:03:20.120> nano<00:03:21.019> or<00:03:21.049> defensive<00:03:21.799> tackle

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
defensive end nano or defensive tackle

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.640 
defensive end nano or defensive tackle
nano<00:03:22.370> then<00:03:23.120> maybe<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.630> would<00:03:23.900> mess<00:03:24.230> with<00:03:24.260> this

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
nano then maybe I would mess with this

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.280 
nano then maybe I would mess with this
as<00:03:24.890> far<00:03:25.070> as<00:03:25.190> putting<00:03:25.400> somebody<00:03:25.790> faster<00:03:26.420> or

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
as far as putting somebody faster or

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.070 
as far as putting somebody faster or
maybe<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.830> skinnier<00:03:28.640> in<00:03:28.820> these<00:03:29.060> positions<00:03:29.269> to

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
maybe a skinnier in these positions to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.110 
maybe a skinnier in these positions to
see<00:03:30.230> if<00:03:30.350> you<00:03:30.470> get<00:03:30.650> any<00:03:30.830> better<00:03:31.130> effect<00:03:31.580> then

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
see if you get any better effect then

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.280 
see if you get any better effect then
again<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.480> really<00:03:32.660> know<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:32.810> had<00:03:33.019> to<00:03:33.110> time

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
again to really know you had to time

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.370 
again to really know you had to time
with<00:03:33.500> stopwatch<00:03:34.010> but<00:03:34.730> either<00:03:34.940> way<00:03:35.290> moving<00:03:36.290> on

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
with stopwatch but either way moving on

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.130 
with stopwatch but either way moving on
to<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.560> linebackers<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:38.540> we<00:03:38.600> got<00:03:38.780> ahmad

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
to the linebackers so we got ahmad

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.120 
to the linebackers so we got ahmad
brooks<00:03:39.410> he<00:03:40.280> is<00:03:40.510> 76<00:03:41.510> speed<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.110> then<00:03:42.739> Patrick

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
brooks he is 76 speed and then Patrick

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.170 
brooks he is 76 speed and then Patrick
Willis<00:03:43.310> 90<00:03:43.880> speed<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:45.010> Aldon<00:03:46.010> Smith<00:03:46.310> 84<00:03:46.880> speed

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
Willis 90 speed and Aldon Smith 84 speed

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.699 
Willis 90 speed and Aldon Smith 84 speed
what<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.450> mean<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:47.870> look<00:03:47.900> at<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.290> linebacker

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
what I mean you look at the linebacker

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.400 
what I mean you look at the linebacker
position<00:03:49.190> for<00:03:49.400> his<00:03:49.640> speed<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.870> Patrick<00:03:51.110> Willis

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
position for his speed so Patrick Willis

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.320 
position for his speed so Patrick Willis
is<00:03:51.620> going<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:51.799> be<00:03:51.890> your<00:03:51.980> fastest<00:03:52.430> guy<00:03:52.640> by<00:03:52.970> far

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
is going to be your fastest guy by far

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.300 
is going to be your fastest guy by far
and<00:03:53.630> so<00:03:54.320> we<00:03:54.470> definitely<00:03:54.680> want<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.130> use<00:03:55.190> him

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
and so we definitely want to use him

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.130 
and so we definitely want to use him
let's<00:03:55.940> look<00:03:56.060> at<00:03:56.180> his<00:03:56.299> catching<00:03:56.690> rating<00:03:57.019> a

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
let's look at his catching rating a

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.050 
let's look at his catching rating a
catching<00:03:57.560> rating<00:03:57.799> is<00:03:57.920> nothing<00:03:58.280> all<00:03:58.400> you<00:03:58.519> I'll

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
catching rating is nothing all you I'll

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.040 
catching rating is nothing all you I'll
look<00:03:59.269> at<00:03:59.480> especially<00:03:59.810> if

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
look at especially if

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.570 
look at especially if
I'm<00:04:01.440> using<00:04:01.650> them<00:04:01.860> in<00:04:01.950> coverage<00:04:02.340> because

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
I'm using them in coverage because

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.310 
I'm using them in coverage because
there's<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.000> lot<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.180> drop<00:04:03.450> kicks<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:03.990> you<00:04:04.050> need

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
there's a lot of drop kicks so you need

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.740 
there's a lot of drop kicks so you need
a<00:04:04.350> hike<00:04:04.620> at<00:04:04.920> Grady<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.400> be<00:04:05.520> able<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.760> get<00:04:06.480> high

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
a hike at Grady to be able to get high

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.470 
a hike at Grady to be able to get high
percentage<00:04:07.170> of<00:04:07.290> pics<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.580> Navarro<00:04:08.910> Bowman<00:04:09.180> is

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
percentage of pics so Navarro Bowman is

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.060 
percentage of pics so Navarro Bowman is
actually<00:04:09.780> can<00:04:09.900> have<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.140> highest<00:04:10.320> catching

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
actually can have the highest catching

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.820 
actually can have the highest catching
out<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.280> all<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.520> linebackers<00:04:12.120> but<00:04:12.930> uh<00:04:12.960> not

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
out of all the linebackers but uh not

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.699 
out of all the linebackers but uh not
sure<00:04:13.890> how<00:04:14.250> fast<00:04:14.550> he<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:14.840> 83<00:04:15.840> speeds<00:04:16.170> so<00:04:16.440> decent

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
sure how fast he is 83 speeds so decent

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.050 
sure how fast he is 83 speeds so decent
but<00:04:17.010> then<00:04:17.130> again<00:04:17.220> it's<00:04:17.459> not<00:04:17.549> going<00:04:17.670> to<00:04:17.760> keep<00:04:17.910> up

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
but then again it's not going to keep up

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.420 
but then again it's not going to keep up
with<00:04:18.090> most<00:04:18.540> wide<00:04:18.810> receivers<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:19.950> if<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.280> want

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
with most wide receivers so if you want

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.680 
with most wide receivers so if you want
to<00:04:20.489> use<00:04:20.610> somebody<00:04:20.790> in<00:04:21.090> coverage<00:04:21.450> i<00:04:21.540> would

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
to use somebody in coverage i would

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.720 
to use somebody in coverage i would
highly<00:04:21.780> recommend<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.500> use<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.800> corner<00:04:23.340> most

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
highly recommend you use a corner most

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.760 
highly recommend you use a corner most
of<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:23.910> corners<00:04:24.270> here<00:04:24.510> are<00:04:24.660> about<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.560> same

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
of the corners here are about the same

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.670 
of the corners here are about the same
speed<00:04:26.220> as<00:04:26.520> as<00:04:27.090> patrick<00:04:27.630> willis<00:04:27.840> so<00:04:28.320> unless<00:04:28.470> you

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
speed as as patrick willis so unless you

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.640 
speed as as patrick willis so unless you
use<00:04:28.830> someone<00:04:29.160> like<00:04:29.190> hover<00:04:29.840> then<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:31.470> pretty

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
use someone like hover then you pretty

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.610 
use someone like hover then you pretty
much<00:04:31.770> stuck<00:04:32.160> with<00:04:32.430> around<00:04:33.090> 90<00:04:33.570> speed<00:04:33.930> but

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
much stuck with around 90 speed but

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
much stuck with around 90 speed but
you're<00:04:34.860> definitely<00:04:35.040> going<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.340> have<00:04:35.430> better

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
you're definitely going to have better

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.080 
you're definitely going to have better
catch<00:04:35.940> ratings<00:04:36.450> here<00:04:36.660> so<00:04:37.410> if<00:04:37.950> you<00:04:38.130> use<00:04:38.430> one<00:04:39.000> of

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
catch ratings here so if you use one of

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.730 
catch ratings here so if you use one of
these<00:04:39.210> corners<00:04:39.660> you're<00:04:40.440> going<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.620> have<00:04:40.680> a

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
these corners you're going to have a

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.560 
these corners you're going to have a
better<00:04:40.920> catch<00:04:41.160> rating<00:04:41.520> as<00:04:41.610> far<00:04:41.790> as<00:04:41.910> being<00:04:42.330> able

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
better catch rating as far as being able

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.030 
better catch rating as far as being able
to<00:04:42.690> get<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:42.930> lot<00:04:43.200> of<00:04:43.230> interceptions<00:04:43.500> and

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
to get a lot of interceptions and

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.500 
to get a lot of interceptions and
holding<00:04:44.340> on<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.610> them<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:44.940> then<00:04:45.120> as<00:04:45.240> far<00:04:45.420> as

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
holding on to them and then as far as

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.140 
holding on to them and then as far as
safety<00:04:45.720> nothing<00:04:46.560> too<00:04:46.860> special<00:04:47.190> here<00:04:47.610> we<00:04:47.910> got

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
safety nothing too special here we got

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.740 
safety nothing too special here we got
Whitner<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.230> then<00:04:49.500> read<00:04:50.340> both<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.420> them<00:04:51.540> not

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
Whitner and then read both of them not

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.750 
Whitner and then read both of them not
very<00:04:52.050> fast<00:04:52.410> let's<00:04:53.220> go<00:04:53.310> ahead<00:04:53.460> look<00:04:53.610> at<00:04:53.700> the

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
very fast let's go ahead look at the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.250 
very fast let's go ahead look at the
catching<00:04:54.000> ratings<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.720> other<00:04:54.840> thing<00:04:55.020> I<00:04:55.080> look

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
catching ratings the other thing I look

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.770 
catching ratings the other thing I look
at<00:04:55.440> so<00:04:56.310> 52<00:04:57.090> and<00:04:58.550> 66<00:04:59.550> so<00:05:00.120> you<00:05:00.210> probably<00:05:00.450> want<00:05:00.720> to

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
at so 52 and 66 so you probably want to

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.050 
at so 52 and 66 so you probably want to
use<00:05:00.840> Eric<00:05:01.320> Reid<00:05:01.590> if<00:05:01.860> you<00:05:02.190> are<00:05:02.370> going<00:05:02.640> to<00:05:02.910> be

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
use Eric Reid if you are going to be

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.000 
use Eric Reid if you are going to be
trying<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.780> use<00:05:04.110> your<00:05:04.260> pic<00:05:04.410> with<00:05:04.620> this<00:05:04.770> team

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
trying to use your pic with this team

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.740 
trying to use your pic with this team
then<00:05:05.669> as<00:05:05.760> far<00:05:05.910> as<00:05:06.000> kick<00:05:06.210> return<00:05:06.480> and<00:05:06.660> punt

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
then as far as kick return and punt

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.690 
then as far as kick return and punt
returning<00:05:07.320> I<00:05:07.470> would<00:05:08.040> probably<00:05:08.160> leave<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.610> how

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
returning I would probably leave it how

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.659 
returning I would probably leave it how
it<00:05:08.730> is<00:05:08.910> LaMichael<00:05:09.480> James<00:05:09.510> a<00:05:10.440> decent<00:05:11.100> speed<00:05:11.340> for

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
it is LaMichael James a decent speed for

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.520 
it is LaMichael James a decent speed for
some<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.390> the<00:05:12.480> options<00:05:12.600> that<00:05:12.840> we<00:05:13.020> have<00:05:13.050> here

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
some of the options that we have here

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.740 
some of the options that we have here
and<00:05:13.860> probably<00:05:14.520> most<00:05:14.820> the<00:05:15.180> second<00:05:15.660> most

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
and probably most the second most

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.670 
and probably most the second most
important<00:05:16.110> thing<00:05:16.260> is<00:05:16.350> going<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.530> be<00:05:16.590> the

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
important thing is going to be the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.110 
important thing is going to be the
carrier<00:05:16.950> rating<00:05:17.310> here<00:05:17.460> as<00:05:17.580> well<00:05:17.730> he's<00:05:18.000> going

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
carrier rating here as well he's going

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.820 
carrier rating here as well he's going
to<00:05:18.180> have<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.419> highest<00:05:18.570> carrier<00:05:19.020> rating<00:05:19.290> so

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
to have the highest carrier rating so
