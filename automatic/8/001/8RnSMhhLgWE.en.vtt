in<00:00:02.010> just<00:00:02.460> the<00:00:02.610> last<00:00:02.820> 10<00:00:03.179> years<00:00:03.210> we've

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
in just the last 10 years we've

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.650 
in just the last 10 years we've
discovered<00:00:04.470> that<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:04.859> need<00:00:05.069> more<00:00:05.460> than<00:00:05.730> DNA<00:00:06.000> to

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
discovered that we need more than DNA to

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.470 
discovered that we need more than DNA to

spring to life clearly making a dinosaur
from<00:00:33.780> scratch<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.829> huge<00:00:35.399> undertaking<00:00:36.260> but

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
from scratch is a huge undertaking but

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.850 
from scratch is a huge undertaking but
that<00:00:37.469> doesn't<00:00:37.920> mean<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.399> impossible<00:00:39.379> if<00:00:40.379> we

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
that doesn't mean it's impossible if we

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.090 
that doesn't mean it's impossible if we
could<00:00:41.040> come<00:00:41.280> up<00:00:41.309> with<00:00:41.550> viable<00:00:42.000> DNA<00:00:42.180> which<00:00:42.840> is

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
could come up with viable DNA which is

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.619 
could come up with viable DNA which is
again<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.460> critical<00:00:44.940> parts<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
again one of the critical parts to the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.229 
again one of the critical parts to the
whole<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.110> think<00:00:46.260> equation<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.730> think<00:00:48.059> it's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
whole I think equation then I think it's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.139 
whole I think equation then I think it's
it's<00:00:48.480> reasonable<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.020> assume<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:50.149> we

it's reasonable to assume that we we

it's reasonable to assume that we we
could<00:00:51.390> get<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> system<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.140> work<00:00:52.520> all<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
could get the system to work all the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.850 
could get the system to work all the
evidence<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.239> far<00:00:54.270> suggests<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.260> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
evidence so far suggests that it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.479 
evidence so far suggests that it
probably<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.940> done

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.310 

our<00:00:59.820> scientists<00:01:00.540> have<00:01:00.600> done<00:01:00.809> things<00:01:01.140> which

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
our scientists have done things which

nobody's ever done before yeah yeah but

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.270 
nobody's ever done before yeah yeah but
your<00:01:04.049> scientists<00:01:04.440> were<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.680> preoccupied<00:01:05.100> with

your scientists were so preoccupied with

whether or not they couldn't they can

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.149 
whether or not they couldn't they can
start<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:07.200> should<00:01:09.500> today<00:01:10.500> no

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
believes that in a hundred years or so

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.110 
believes that in a hundred years or so
it<00:02:25.959> would<00:02:26.260> be<00:02:26.380> possible<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.070> retro<00:02:27.640> engineer

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
it would be possible to retro engineer

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.300 
it would be possible to retro engineer
animals<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.989> look<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:29.560> like<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.070> ancient

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
animals that look just like the ancient

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.790 
animals that look just like the ancient
dinosaurs

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
dinosaurs

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.460 
dinosaurs
one<00:02:33.520> could<00:02:33.850> take<00:02:34.360> everything<00:02:35.230> we<00:02:35.320> know<00:02:35.440> about

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
one could take everything we know about

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.620 
one could take everything we know about
development<00:02:36.190> all<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.400> genetics<00:02:37.120> all<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.480> non

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
development all the genetics all the non

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.570 
development all the genetics all the non
genetics<00:02:38.140> parts<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:38.950> we<00:02:39.400> could

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
genetics parts of it and we could

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.090 
genetics parts of it and we could
probably<00:02:39.820> create<00:02:40.570> any<00:02:40.930> kind<00:02:41.320> of<00:02:41.470> Anatomy<00:02:41.950> that

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
probably create any kind of Anatomy that

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.540 
probably create any kind of Anatomy that
we<00:02:42.220> see<00:02:42.520> out<00:02:43.000> there<00:02:43.320> why<00:02:44.320> can't<00:02:44.350> we<00:02:44.860> take<00:02:45.100> all

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
we see out there why can't we take all

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.180 
we see out there why can't we take all
that<00:02:45.940> information<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:47.530> chains<00:02:47.830> around<00:02:48.130> a

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
that information just chains around a

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.970 
that information just chains around a
little<00:02:48.280> bit<00:02:48.460> and<00:02:48.700> produce<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.720> t-rex<00:02:50.020> or

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
little bit and produce a t-rex or

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.500 
little bit and produce a t-rex or
something<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.490> looks<00:02:51.640> just<00:02:52.060> like<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.810> t-rex<00:02:53.170> I

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
something that looks just like a t-rex I

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.360 
something that looks just like a t-rex I
think<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.720> kind<00:02:56.050> of<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.770> scenario<00:02:57.010> is

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
think that kind of a of a scenario is

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.850 
think that kind of a of a scenario is
quite<00:02:57.700> possible<00:02:58.240> maybe<00:02:59.140> sooner<00:02:59.590> than<00:02:59.740> we

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
quite possible maybe sooner than we

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.210 
quite possible maybe sooner than we
think<00:03:03.180> have<00:03:04.180> we<00:03:04.450> seen<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:05.050> last<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.650> Jurassic

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
think have we seen the last of Jurassic

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.640 
think have we seen the last of Jurassic
Park

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.440 

maybe<00:03:09.340> not

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.479 

you<00:03:16.450> know<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:16.569> have<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.379> admit<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:17.709> I'm<00:03:18.010> I've

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
you know I have to admit that I'm I've

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.720 
you know I have to admit that I'm I've
certainly<00:03:19.260> imagined<00:03:20.260> walking<00:03:20.920> up<00:03:21.280> on<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.459> stage

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
certainly imagined walking up on a stage

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.069 
certainly imagined walking up on a stage
to<00:03:21.939> give<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.150> talk<00:03:22.329> and<00:03:22.540> having<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.870> little

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
to give it talk and having a little

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.069 
to give it talk and having a little
little<00:03:24.150> Dino<00:03:25.150> chick<00:03:25.540> in<00:03:25.689> there<00:03:25.780> or<00:03:25.870> whatever

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
little Dino chick in there or whatever

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.390 
little Dino chick in there or whatever
you<00:03:26.140> want<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.349> call<00:03:26.439> and<00:03:26.590> walk<00:03:26.769> up<00:03:26.950> behind<00:03:27.069> me

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
you want to call and walk up behind me

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.180 
you want to call and walk up behind me
I'd<00:03:27.489> be<00:03:27.700> kind<00:03:27.909> of<00:03:27.970> cool
