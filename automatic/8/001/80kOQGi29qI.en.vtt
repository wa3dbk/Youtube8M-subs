00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.699 
cool right how we got ahold of that not
really<00:02:48.879> sure<00:02:49.090> but<00:02:49.750> in<00:02:49.900> his<00:02:50.049> description<00:02:50.349> he

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
really sure but in his description he

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.170 
really sure but in his description he
gave<00:02:50.739> credit<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.220> somebody<00:02:51.579> else<00:02:51.760> for<00:02:52.090> the

gave credit to somebody else for the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.900 
gave credit to somebody else for the
finding<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:53.019> probably<00:02:53.739> he<00:02:54.160> did<00:02:54.519> not<00:02:54.609> receive

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
finding so I probably he did not receive

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.339 
finding so I probably he did not receive
it<00:02:54.940> it's<00:02:55.120> probably<00:02:55.239> somebody<00:02:55.660> else's<00:02:56.079> and<00:02:56.260> he

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
it it's probably somebody else's and he

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.860 
it it's probably somebody else's and he
was<00:02:56.530> just<00:02:56.769> reviewing<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.549> do<00:02:58.209> like<00:02:58.510> how<00:02:58.690> it

was just reviewing it I do like how it
looks<00:02:59.019> though<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.319> think<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.890> shell<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.549> pretty

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
looks though I think the shell is pretty

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.860 
looks though I think the shell is pretty
cool<00:03:00.909> looking<00:03:01.030> although<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.540> does<00:03:01.720> look

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
cool looking although it does look

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.170 
cool looking although it does look
pretty<00:03:01.989> cheapy<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:03.010> kind<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.459> like<00:03:03.640> how<00:03:03.790> its<00:03:04.030> a

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
pretty cheapy I kind of like how its a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.899 
pretty cheapy I kind of like how its a

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
mix almost between the 3gs the ipod

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.699 
mix almost between the 3gs the ipod
touch<00:03:06.940> 5th<00:03:07.359> generation<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.140> iphone<00:03:08.260> 5

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
touch 5th generation and the iphone 5

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.680 
touch 5th generation and the iphone 5
how<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.280> all<00:03:09.370> kind<00:03:09.489> of<00:03:09.609> condensed<00:03:10.120> into<00:03:10.420> one

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
how it all kind of condensed into one

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.319 
how it all kind of condensed into one
and<00:03:11.349> just<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.890> cheaper<00:03:12.310> model<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.879> which<00:03:13.180> is

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
and just a cheaper model of it which is

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.030 
and just a cheaper model of it which is
nice<00:03:13.540> because<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:14.049> iphone<00:03:14.349> 5<00:03:14.530> minute<00:03:14.799> isn't

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
nice because the iphone 5 minute isn't

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.129 
nice because the iphone 5 minute isn't
exactly<00:03:15.519> cheap<00:03:15.849> the<00:03:16.120> 16<00:03:16.480> gig<00:03:16.569> models<00:03:16.959> two

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
exactly cheap the 16 gig models two

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.470 
exactly cheap the 16 gig models two
hundred<00:03:17.410> dollars<00:03:17.790> which<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:18.970> mean<00:03:19.209> that's<00:03:19.269> not

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
hundred dollars which I mean that's not

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.360 
hundred dollars which I mean that's not
too<00:03:19.750> bad<00:03:19.780> but<00:03:19.959> for<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.560> phone<00:03:20.799> some<00:03:21.099> people

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
too bad but for a phone some people

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.580 
too bad but for a phone some people
think<00:03:21.579> that's<00:03:21.760> outrageous<00:03:22.419> so<00:03:22.930> being<00:03:23.500> that

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
think that's outrageous so being that

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.960 
think that's outrageous so being that
it's<00:03:23.769> probably<00:03:23.889> going<00:03:24.099> to<00:03:24.160> be<00:03:24.220> about<00:03:24.310> 99

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
it's probably going to be about 99

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.909 
it's probably going to be about 99
that's<00:03:25.690> probably<00:03:25.900> be<00:03:26.139> a<00:03:26.169> lot<00:03:26.290> more<00:03:26.349> affordable

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
that's probably be a lot more affordable

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.199 
that's probably be a lot more affordable
