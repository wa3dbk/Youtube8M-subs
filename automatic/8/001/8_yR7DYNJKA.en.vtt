ok let's take a look at Internet
explorer<00:01:13.180> and<00:01:13.420> look<00:01:14.350> at<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:14.530> various<00:01:14.920> parts

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
explorer and look at the various parts

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.300 
explorer and look at the various parts
we've<00:01:15.460> got<00:01:15.810> available<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.960> us<00:01:17.140> first<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:18.250> all

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
we've got available to us first of all
