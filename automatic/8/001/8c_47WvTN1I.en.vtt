00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.359
 friend we are here with course 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.359
 Valderrama seeing what you think 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:24.080
 extraordinary there were many people 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:24.080
 as a way to teach look 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:37.710
 conditions to run I congratulate you of 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.460
 wholeheartedly we remember when 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.980
 you were champion of chile the ball of 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.890
 Several horses with huatanay to this 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.719
 remember more or less those times then 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.300
 Well, you can worry about your mouth 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:01:00.239
 of course I think that the first the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:01.949
 first teaches rest in the mouth 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.210
 of the horse the mouth exploded in the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.280
 principality 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.950
 the sport of the mouth and it puts a thing 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.450
 for society what they did more 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.450
 hard harder 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:24.210
 more horses ripped the huacana like this 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.310
 that exploded one that dominates as you want 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.790
 in the end because healthy water is a 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.040
 very important and fundamental part 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.040
 teaching that you have today 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.399
 because today I see many strikers 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.600
 put in the mouth and that's whole good 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.320
 we are living a very moment 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.100
 accelerated and there's no time to train 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.100
 as it used to be 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.399
 and that is very important today I do not know 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:04.310
 can do by mouth guys the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.310
 extension is not to go outside 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.200
 it is also bad 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.040
 and it's not good for people who want 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.819
 learn what is the main thing about a 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.000
 man who knows how to stick to the 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.000
 consequence of a horse that is more 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 in focus 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.440
 what do you think about the horse being 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.020
 portillo because it has still has not 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.910
 three years will be quietly stopped in 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.840
 a first terrain exit that never 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.840
 have left home 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:48.570
 that I'm going to congratulate because there is little 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.010
 people who worry want fell like 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.180
 he is teaching it and that is fundamental 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.239
 for the future is fundamental because the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.769
 it is necessary to give it more doubt that it is 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:04.350
 says advances never I want the rider of 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.230
 orders every god fell are afraid are going to 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.540
 Start skiing when you arrive then 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.700
 there was death here that this child 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.700
 that the horse is at the command of the 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:26.480
 I believe there is a confidence in the 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.650
 synchronization of thoughts that 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.650
 we perform cheer and solve 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.870
 but I say I'm going to 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.760
 congratulate because I like the people who 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.819
 the horse is already good and also 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.819
 a horse is the future also good
