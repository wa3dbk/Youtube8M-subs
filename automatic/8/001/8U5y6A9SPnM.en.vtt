00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.090

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.790
 explained tim said I hope that such car 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.619
 I start like many of us 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.119
 I think by waking up and lapointe 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.760
 thing I do is my shots and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.699
 it allows you to start the day 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.380
 sweetness it feels good and you will see 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.900
 that it would always be better 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.349
 days on the goods and then irina 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.850
 as I would say 95-109 at the end of 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.829
 Czech but social networks would be for 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.570
 a message leaving the gold plate there and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.610
 I drink mostly a lot of water 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.680
 general is addressing but like this video 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.440
 as accra for me the bike is good 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.860
 for my body and that's for sure 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.530
 I open my curtains and I'm his son 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.170
 which must be very expensive 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.120
 and poses actually chatting in the kitchens 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.519
 and I turn on Africa and its energy on 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.230
 my space to listen to the radio the 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.269
 music because it motivates me 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.199
 it feels good that allows good 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.880
 start the day and I start 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.380
 preparing my breakfast 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.610
 it's the most important meal so 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.860
 be careful 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.180
 what I do is I put a 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.740
 little bit of plain yogurt it's a 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.390
 little bit of hyper muscle on it and 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.890

 raspberries and a whale so that's it 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.340

 everyday 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.469
 then I go back to my room 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.090
 choose clothes in general I do 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:14.630
 common sense because it takes me a 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.630
 lead and I go to the bathroom 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.850
 today for the mouth I used 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.460
 a shower gel and a scrub could 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.560
 face and that's all I was not far from 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.640
 fly in the corner that day I'm 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.710
 very happy that we are here 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.510
 happens because it's spring and 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.000
 that means for those who serve only 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.440
 this right to sink sweet every day 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.180
 thank you my disease 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.570
 but it is obviously I brush the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.520
 teeth like all hope and I do not know 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.960
 if it amuses you as I have 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.430
 this chance to go and support someone 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.720
 who's calling me while I'm going 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.250
 in the team and afterwards 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.960
 and Saturday because of the water and it is 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:56.260
 gone for a topic then we start 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:59.500
 obviously it 'll go round is something 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.760
 that adapted soap buckets and as 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.810
 it's spring I do not want to 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.140
 run the same time with our game but 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.210
 just a little can still escape a 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.870
 little bit of blue on the rating 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.720
 superior to open the cell look 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.170
 in the spring it's the sun it's the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.000
 color 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.440
 this is very very lightly and 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.440
 Then I will come with a pencil 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.950
 winter put in the thousand doses 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.480
 lower 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.130
 because I think it illuminates the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.770
 look and it brings even more 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.500
 colors and I come to complete will he have 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.709
 lower with a lighthouse the same 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.709
 color 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.989
 then I used my mascara 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.319
 moment I love them it's a ticos and 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.489
 loÃ¯c mottier gas and in fact it's a 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.409
 mascara in which there is an eye liner 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.700
 do not hesitate to test it if you have 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.349
 the opportunity because it is really very 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.579
 very well 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.989
 and then as an editor I did not like 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.599
 finally not at all I drew but 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.069
 calm a little bit of powder 1 12 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.659
 hours to do kind we are tanned 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.659
 because it's not carrick spring 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.260
 and my cute blog with his little 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.780
 pot to the golden cape and so that's it 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.539
 blush to give pink to the cheeks 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.389
 give the color is just below with 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.190
 an ares group are then I put my 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.720
 pupil of the moment when I am there I am theirs 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.370
 this maquis like and you but not what 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:33.500
 you want something colorful 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:34.820
 of spring I hate my hair and 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.620
 I'm going to realize how much 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.270
 they are dirty and maybe I can not 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.289
 go laugh they'll all become 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.240
 champions so we have the trick that saves 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.699
 always it's my field 300 customers get 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.210
 baptize for brunettes and not for 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.530
 the brunettes started for the unaf and 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.789
 then I joke my roots with the 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.280
 first fingers the wounds with a comb 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.310
 to leave that I see it as this 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:02.090
 mobile sebum and I come to do the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.080
 timeless hairstyle press the trick 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.780
 it's a business that everyone 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.250
 knows how to do and who is doing very well at all 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.470
 the seasons and until spring nathan 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.729
 it's called easy then I 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.680
 have just tried a little arm 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:16.280
 mattress to say things less 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.039
 structured and more casual I 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.500
 then put on my shoes that I love 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.550
 so the converse 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.960
 it's a little bit my shoes that 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.030
 you come to any this is a 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.260
 else there in the spring its big but it 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.260
 also every second 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.380
 a scent of perfume and it's gone 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.900
 you can admire the bike our columns 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.560
 and so here at the workshop level 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.199
 I did the room things and 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.880
 spring at a time so to a small bone 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.440
 just plain white a little bit 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.600
 transparency with an eye on the 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.449
 chest jeans Faure everton 6-1 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.740
 slim all simple but I'm and at 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.509
 jacket level I chose the 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.400
 rosey lawn of fleury I found 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:05.620
 that it was very springy a jacket 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.509
 a little more transparency too 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.280
 which is not at all hot from mag is 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:10.780
 very fluid and very very nice to wear 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.370
 and will have to do when it's hot 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.949
 like that we do not want to take 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.850
 the head 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.010
 So that's a pretty outfit 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.110
 relaxed and at the same time 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:23.190
 pretty and spring is still what she 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.190
 hope it all begs you 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.639
 at 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.610
 so 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.260
 I hope in any case that it comes more 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.300
 play very big kisses and I leave you 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.300
 in the end with a little blooper 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.590
 Oh 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:56.900
 george dance while one is undefeated 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.900
 went to chance I knew we were redoing 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:09.080
 guys I think a real merry-go-round 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.030
 for nobody I stayed on two red 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:21.260
 are waiting or on your makeup and their 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.260
 zoom in on your head 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.950
 but this film is still there
