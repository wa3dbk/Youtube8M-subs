00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.939 

all<00:00:00.359> right<00:00:00.539> I<00:00:00.570> remember<00:00:01.110> telling<00:00:01.319> you<00:00:01.530> that<00:00:01.589> on

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
all right I remember telling you that on

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.649 
all right I remember telling you that on
the<00:00:02.730> port<00:00:03.000> side

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
the port side

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.019 
the port side
I<00:00:03.689> had<00:00:04.110> replaced<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.770> plank<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.520> was<00:00:05.700> able<00:00:05.850> to

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
I had replaced a plank and I was able to

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.240 
I had replaced a plank and I was able to
get<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.420> scene<00:00:06.690> work<00:00:06.870> pretty<00:00:07.350> tight<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:08.099> it's

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
get the scene work pretty tight so it's

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.100 
get the scene work pretty tight so it's
pretty<00:00:08.460> easy<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.820> caulk<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.450> did<00:00:09.630> some<00:00:09.840> pre

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
pretty easy to caulk and I did some pre

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.350 
pretty easy to caulk and I did some pre
twisted<00:00:10.620> cotton<00:00:11.010> on<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> other<00:00:11.370> side<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.969> he

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
twisted cotton on the other side and he

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.970 
twisted cotton on the other side and he
also<00:00:12.540> did<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> little<00:00:13.139> bit<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.380> looping<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
also did a little bit of looping of the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.189 
also did a little bit of looping of the
cotton<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.460> place<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.000> now<00:00:15.599> we're<00:00:15.809> on<00:00:15.839> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
cotton in place and now we're on the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.779 
cotton in place and now we're on the
starboard<00:00:16.680> side<00:00:16.740> but<00:00:17.190> it's<00:00:17.310> quite<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> bit

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
starboard side but it's quite a bit

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.330 
starboard side but it's quite a bit
different<00:00:17.820> situation<00:00:18.710> the<00:00:19.710> planking<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
different situation the planking on the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.730 
different situation the planking on the
starboard<00:00:20.789> side<00:00:20.850> seems<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.810> been<00:00:22.109> sanded

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
starboard side seems to have been sanded

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.470 
starboard side seems to have been sanded
down<00:00:22.949> quite<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> bit<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> plank<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.240> quite

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
down quite a bit so the plank and quite

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.880 
down quite a bit so the plank and quite
a<00:00:24.510> bit<00:00:24.750> thinner<00:00:25.019> than<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.350> was<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.680> other

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
a bit thinner than it was on the other

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.849 
a bit thinner than it was on the other
side<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.400> almost<00:00:26.900> down<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.930> 3/8<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.710> an

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
side this is almost down to 3/8 of an

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.720 
side this is almost down to 3/8 of an
inch<00:00:28.949> thick<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:30.090> seam<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.630> good<00:00:31.730> quarter

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
inch thick and the seam is good quarter

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.139 
inch thick and the seam is good quarter
of<00:00:32.820> an<00:00:32.910> inch<00:00:33.030> wide<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.520> can't<00:00:35.820> it

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
of an inch wide so I can't it

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.180 
of an inch wide so I can't it
I<00:00:36.180> can't<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.170> pre<00:00:37.380> twisted<00:00:37.829> cotton

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
I can't it with pre twisted cotton

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.979 
I can't it with pre twisted cotton
and<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.399> can't<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.180> by<00:00:39.329> looping<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.840> in

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and I can't it by looping it in

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.150 
and I can't it by looping it in
place<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.500> what's<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> happen

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
place because what's going to happen

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.889 
place because what's going to happen
it's<00:00:41.550> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.790> stick<00:00:42.090> out<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.420> back<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it's going to stick out the back of the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.860 
it's going to stick out the back of the
seam<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.160> too<00:00:44.370> much<00:00:44.550> cotton<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
seam it's just too much cotton for to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.869 
seam it's just too much cotton for to
close<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.430> thickness<00:00:47.640> of

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
close that up but for the thickness of

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.869 
close that up but for the thickness of
the<00:00:48.000> planking<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:50.100> other<00:00:50.219> thing<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.700> this

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the planking and the other thing is this

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.850 
the planking and the other thing is this
if<00:00:51.059> you've<00:00:51.210> tried<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.780> clock<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.170> real<00:00:52.350> hard<00:00:52.649> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
if you've tried to clock it real hard it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.380 
if you've tried to clock it real hard it
would<00:00:52.920> blow<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.370> back<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> planking<00:00:54.239> out

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
would blow the back of the planking out

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.660 
would blow the back of the planking out
it's<00:00:54.539> only<00:00:54.660> cedar<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:55.800> very<00:00:56.039> careful<00:00:56.550> with

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it's only cedar to be very careful with

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.000 
it's only cedar to be very careful with
a<00:00:56.699> situation<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.410> we've<00:00:58.590> decided

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
a situation like this so we've decided

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.689 
a situation like this so we've decided
that<00:00:59.460> we<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.899> fill<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.070> most<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
that we have to fill up most of the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.520 
that we have to fill up most of the
scene<00:01:02.969> with<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> little<00:01:03.539> batten<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> just

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
scene with a little batten that I just

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
scene with a little batten that I just
ripped<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> table<00:01:05.580> saw

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
ripped on a table saw

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.880 
ripped on a table saw
then<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.390> tape<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.049> ends<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> block

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
then I tape it to ends with a block

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.800 
then I tape it to ends with a block
plane<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.549> what<00:01:09.240> we're<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
plane and what we're going to do is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.330 
plane and what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.080> slip<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.680> into<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.070> seam

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
we're going to slip it into the seam

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.929 
we're going to slip it into the seam
like<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.159> one<00:01:14.159> side<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.640> its<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:14.880> to

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
like this and one side of its going to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.300 
like this and one side of its going to
be<00:01:15.030> glued<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> plank<00:01:16.140> above<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
be glued to the plank above it and the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.499 
be glued to the plank above it and the
other<00:01:17.460> side<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.150> caught<00:01:18.479> with

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
other side is going to be caught with

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.320 
other side is going to be caught with
cotton<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:19.710> I've<00:01:20.070> decided<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.700> glue<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.180> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
cotton now I've decided to glue it to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
cotton now I've decided to glue it to
the<00:01:21.360> top<00:01:21.689> plank<00:01:22.049> because<00:01:22.500> when<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.710> caulk<00:01:23.070> it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the top plank because when I caulk it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.340 
the top plank because when I caulk it
the<00:01:23.640> cotton<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.090> hanging<00:01:24.509> down<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the cotton is hanging down like this and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.929 
the cotton is hanging down like this and
it's<00:01:25.439> very<00:01:25.500> easy<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:26.220> me<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.340> caught<00:01:26.670> this

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
it's very easy for me to caught this

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.120 
it's very easy for me to caught this
side<00:01:27.000> without<00:01:27.960> getting<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.470> glue<00:01:28.829> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
side without getting in the glue and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.950 
side without getting in the glue and
besides<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.060> I'm<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.479> not<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
besides that I'm really not going to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.870 
besides that I'm really not going to
caulk<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.259> whole<00:01:31.680> length<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:32.670> only

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
caulk the whole length of it I'm only

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.850 
caulk the whole length of it I'm only
going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> caulk<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.630> or<00:01:33.780> push<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> cotton<00:01:34.740> in

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
going to caulk it or push the cotton in

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.770 
going to caulk it or push the cotton in
every<00:01:35.100> couple<00:01:35.460> inches<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.150> push<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.720> up

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
every couple inches just to push this up

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.960 
every couple inches just to push this up
against<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> plank<00:01:37.680> above<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.220> then<00:01:38.759> when

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
against the plank above it then when

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.080 
against the plank above it then when
it's<00:01:39.119> dry<00:01:39.540> when<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.189> glue<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.400> dry<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.880> that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
it's dry when that glue is dry on that

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
it's dry when that glue is dry on that
top<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.659> seam<00:01:43.049> I'm<00:01:43.380> going<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.979> strip<00:01:44.549> that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
top of that seam I'm going to strip that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.580 
top of that seam I'm going to strip that
cotton<00:01:45.240> out<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.509> there<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.899> that's<00:01:46.290> going<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
cotton out of there and that's going to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.219 
cotton out of there and that's going to
be<00:01:46.710> an<00:01:46.799> extension<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.270> plank<00:01:48.570> then<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
be an extension of the plank then I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.719 
be an extension of the plank then I
whittled<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.799> down<00:01:49.860> because<00:01:50.340> we'll<00:01:50.610> be

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
whittled it down because we'll be

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.850 
whittled it down because we'll be
hanging<00:01:51.000> out<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.299> little<00:01:51.689> bit<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.470> clock

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
hanging out a little bit and then clock

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.280 
hanging out a little bit and then clock
it<00:01:53.040> again<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.970> traditional<00:01:54.540> manner<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it again in a traditional manner and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.560 
it again in a traditional manner and
it'll<00:01:55.530> look<00:01:55.799> traditional<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.210> won't<00:01:57.390> give

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
it'll look traditional and it won't give

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.389 
it'll look traditional and it won't give
any<00:01:57.780> trouble<00:01:57.990> because<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.560> planks<00:01:58.890> were<00:01:59.009> able

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
any trouble because the planks were able

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.490 
any trouble because the planks were able
to<00:01:59.430> swell<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.939> contract<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:01.140> somebody

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
to swell and contract and if somebody

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.230 
to swell and contract and if somebody
ever<00:02:01.649> wanted<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.310> any<00:02:02.490> work<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:02.939> again

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
ever wanted to do any work on it again

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.170 
ever wanted to do any work on it again
they'd<00:02:03.479> find<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.049> very<00:02:04.770> much<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.670> way<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.850> was

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
they'd find it very much the way it was

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.920 
they'd find it very much the way it was
to<00:02:06.420> begin<00:02:06.570> with

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to begin with

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.540 
to begin with
alright<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.590> first<00:02:07.740> thing<00:02:08.009> we're<00:02:08.190> doing<00:02:08.220> is

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
alright the first thing we're doing is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.499 
alright the first thing we're doing is
mixing<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> glue<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> little

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
mixing the glue up on a little

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.420 
mixing the glue up on a little
call<00:02:10.569> it<00:02:10.689> here<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:11.019> like<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.290> mix<00:02:11.439> it<00:02:11.590> myself<00:02:11.830> and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
call it here I like to mix it myself and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.429 
call it here I like to mix it myself and
then<00:02:12.489> once<00:02:13.150> I've<00:02:13.299> got<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.599> mixed<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:14.019> just<00:02:14.200> pick

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
then once I've got it mixed I just pick

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.199 
then once I've got it mixed I just pick
it<00:02:14.470> up<00:02:14.680> with<00:02:14.829> that<00:02:14.950> same<00:02:15.250> putty<00:02:15.579> knife<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.090> I'm

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
it up with that same putty knife and I'm

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.839 
it up with that same putty knife and I'm
spreading<00:02:16.689> it<00:02:16.959> down<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.439> little<00:02:17.709> baton<00:02:18.640> and

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
spreading it down this little baton and

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.990 
spreading it down this little baton and
I'm<00:02:19.269> wiping<00:02:19.720> down<00:02:19.840> both<00:02:20.260> sides<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:21.099> that<00:02:21.310> what

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
I'm wiping down both sides so that what

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.330 
I'm wiping down both sides so that what
happens<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.720> gets<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:23.079> little<00:02:23.439> tiny<00:02:23.769> pile

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
happens is it gets a little tiny pile

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.250 
happens is it gets a little tiny pile
right<00:02:24.760> in<00:02:24.939> the<00:02:25.000> middle<00:02:25.239> as<00:02:25.360> neat<00:02:25.659> as<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:26.019> can

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
right in the middle as neat as I can

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.110 
right in the middle as neat as I can
make<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:26.890> when<00:02:27.129> I<00:02:27.159> slip<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.790> in<00:02:27.940> there

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
make it so that when I slip it in there

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.149 
make it so that when I slip it in there
it<00:02:28.510> doesn't<00:02:28.720> push<00:02:29.110> all<00:02:29.349> the<00:02:29.500> glue<00:02:29.680> off<00:02:29.890> one

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
it doesn't push all the glue off one

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.789 
it doesn't push all the glue off one
side<00:02:30.459> now<00:02:30.730> I've<00:02:30.879> got<00:02:31.060> just<00:02:31.390> enough<00:02:31.599> space<00:02:32.079> to

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
side now I've got just enough space to

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.490 
side now I've got just enough space to
get<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.099> thing<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.579> go<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:33.970> there<00:02:34.209> without

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
get the thing to go in there without

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.289 
get the thing to go in there without
wrecking<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.680> little<00:02:36.010> pile<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:36.909> I've<00:02:37.060> put

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
wrecking that little pile that I've put

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.300 
wrecking that little pile that I've put
down<00:02:37.329> there<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:37.989> then<00:02:38.530> what<00:02:38.739> I<00:02:38.769> do<00:02:38.859> is<00:02:39.129> I<00:02:39.280> just

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
down there so then what I do is I just

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.949 
down there so then what I do is I just
put<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.269> in<00:02:40.420> position<00:02:40.829> put<00:02:41.829> it<00:02:41.950> into<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.670> seam

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
put it in position put it into the seam

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.720 
put it in position put it into the seam
slide<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.200> in<00:02:44.349> there<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.950> pressure<00:02:45.280> kind

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
slide it in there with the pressure kind

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.819 
slide it in there with the pressure kind
of<00:02:45.879> down<00:02:46.150> against<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.810> plank<00:02:47.170> on<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.409> bottom

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
of down against the plank on the bottom

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.099 
of down against the plank on the bottom
so<00:02:48.010> again<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.609> just<00:02:49.030> don't<00:02:49.209> wipe<00:02:49.510> all<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.900> glue

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
so again I just don't wipe all the glue

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.349 
so again I just don't wipe all the glue
off<00:02:50.139> of<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.709> once<00:02:51.099> I<00:02:51.220> get<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.519> in<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.909> take<00:02:52.299> a

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
off of it once I get it in I take a

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.449 
off of it once I get it in I take a
little<00:02:52.659> bit<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.900> cotton<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.799> push<00:02:54.129> it<00:02:54.310> in

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
little bit of cotton and I push it in

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.759 
little bit of cotton and I push it in
under<00:02:54.909> the<00:02:55.030> baton<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.569> that<00:02:55.959> forces<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
under the baton and that forces the

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.399 
under the baton and that forces the
baton<00:02:57.159> up<00:02:57.280> against<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.790> seam<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.209> top<00:02:58.480> then<00:02:59.379> I

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
baton up against the seam on top then I

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.470 
baton up against the seam on top then I
get<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.859> end<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.489> here<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.909> another

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
get to the end of it here and another

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.960 
get to the end of it here and another
little<00:03:01.810> process<00:03:02.079> I<00:03:02.440> put<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.650> razor<00:03:03.340> knife<00:03:03.519> blade

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
little process I put a razor knife blade

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.599 
little process I put a razor knife blade
in<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.299> seam<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.840> spans<00:03:05.379> past<00:03:06.190> where

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
in the seam and that spans past where
