00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
ingredients first and then we're going

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:55.170 
ingredients first and then we're going
to<00:02:47.920> add<00:02:48.070> our<00:02:48.370> wet<00:02:48.910> ingredient<00:02:50.070> mixture<00:02:54.180> just

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
to add our wet ingredient mixture just

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.460

tin I found that this recipe is perfect

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.650 
tin I found that this recipe is perfect
for<00:03:29.470> this<00:03:29.560> because<00:03:30.340> it<00:03:30.610> makes<00:03:30.760> exactly<00:03:30.940> eight

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
for this because it makes exactly eight

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.820 
for this because it makes exactly eight
muffins<00:03:32.230> if<00:03:32.470> you<00:03:32.590> have<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:32.980> six<00:03:33.250> month<00:03:33.460> and<00:03:33.640> ten

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
muffins if you have a six month and ten

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.680 
muffins if you have a six month and ten
just<00:03:35.830> spread<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.760> batter<00:03:36.970> out<00:03:37.210> between

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
just spread the the batter out between

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.360 
just spread the the batter out between
the<00:03:37.900> six<00:03:38.110> muffins<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.830> they'll<00:03:39.070> be<00:03:39.160> a<00:03:39.190> little

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
the six muffins and they'll be a little

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.130 
the six muffins and they'll be a little
bit<00:03:39.520> bigger<00:03:39.700> you'll<00:03:40.480> have<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.750> extend<00:03:40.930> the

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
bit bigger you'll have to extend the

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.170 
bit bigger you'll have to extend the
baking<00:03:41.410> time<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> little<00:03:41.740> bit<00:03:41.950> but<00:03:42.610> that

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
baking time a little bit but that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.650 
baking time a little bit but that
shouldn't<00:03:43.540> be<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.720> problem<00:03:45.510> anyway<00:03:46.510> just

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
shouldn't be a problem anyway just

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.620 
shouldn't be a problem anyway just
evenly<00:03:47.080> distribute<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.580> batter<00:03:48.580> between<00:03:48.970> the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
evenly distribute the batter between the

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.850 
evenly distribute the batter between the
cops<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:50.230> just<00:03:51.160> put<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> little<00:03:51.430> in<00:03:51.700> each<00:03:51.880> one<00:03:52.120> and

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
cops I just put a little in each one and

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
cops I just put a little in each one and
then<00:03:53.860> when<00:03:54.010> they<00:03:54.130> are<00:03:54.160> all<00:03:54.460> fall<00:03:54.820> I<00:03:56.670> will<00:03:57.670> go

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
then when they are all fall I will go

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.560 
then when they are all fall I will go
back<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.110> add<00:03:59.110> more<00:03:59.140> two<00:03:59.850> ones<00:04:00.850> take<00:04:01.270> a<00:04:01.300> little

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
back and add more two ones take a little

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.260 
back and add more two ones take a little
less<00:04:01.750> out<00:04:01.990> of<00:04:02.080> another<00:04:02.880> just<00:04:03.880> until<00:04:04.180> they're

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
less out of another just until they're

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.880 
less out of another just until they're
all<00:04:04.420> about<00:04:05.290> equal<00:04:07.350> so<00:04:08.350> these<00:04:08.470> are<00:04:08.620> all<00:04:08.710> ready

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
all about equal so these are all ready

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.410

sugar just put a little bit on top of

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.030 
sugar just put a little bit on top of
each<00:04:11.830> muffin<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:13.620> now<00:04:14.620> we're<00:04:14.740> going<00:04:14.860> to<00:04:14.920> bake

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
each muffin and now we're going to bake

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.030 
each muffin and now we're going to bake
these<00:04:15.250> for<00:04:15.850> 18<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.540> 20<00:04:17.049> minutes<00:04:17.170> just<00:04:17.530> until<00:04:17.859> a
