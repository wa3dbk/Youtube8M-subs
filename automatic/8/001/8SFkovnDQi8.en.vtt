00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.000
 let's make a ratatouille together today 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.250
 the ingredients a little gratinated 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.049
 that the season therefore gives us this 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.760
 at the moment tomatoes are still fine 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.670
 cauliflower celery carrots onions leeks 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.410
 peppers and more we will reach them a little 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.330
 of tomato paste this that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.619
 see on this side or flour 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.910
 Parmesan and Emmental butter will be the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.280
 graphic design of ratatouille and me 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.610
 I begin to put the onion immediately 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.590
 oil and the garlic cloves 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.450
 cloves of garlic I will leave them whole 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.000
 just so poised as soon as 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.820
 will have I write side will have flavored 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.500
 in oil I will remove the details in zbik 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.230
 right now I can also add the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.730
 butter and now we know it belongs to the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.109
 family of onions a little more 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.870
 delicate then we will cook 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:04.860
 exactly together with the onion because 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.290
 always before this because onion porn 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.380
 shallot spring onion have times of 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.970
 relatively long cooking la 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.369
 ratatouille is a pretty recipe 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.040
 simple with a single commitment 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.590
 cook the vegetables gradually or 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.960
 however separately assembling them 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.700
 all together only at the end this 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.710
 because the cauliflower does not have the time to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.620
 cooking of tomato rather than del 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.890
 celery rather than del 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.410
 of the peppers then separate cooking 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.610
 or so as not to dirty so many pans 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.430
 gradual cooking adding gradually 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.830
 in the same pan the vegetables that 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.060
 they cook first by emitting only last 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.430
 those that have cooking time 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:52.330
 a lot of ball I go to tomatoes 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.330
 record 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:01.039
 here I go right with the with the 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:03.829
 I hope this knife bends down 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.429
 fat peel vigorously but 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:10.190
 in short, delicate if it can exist 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.129
 this then this mode energetic 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.810
 but delicate you see that already you see the 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:18.019
 tomato peel 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.799
 at this point take pavia away already from 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.360
 one 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.610
 we will get tomato fillets 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.819
 these will be tomato fillets that 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.250
 we will put it now until the season 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.250
 still gives us good fresh tomatoes 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.090
 this is fine otherwise in winter 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.519
 same recipe 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.459
 obviously we can do it with recipes 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.620
 a little more in season and with tomatoes 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.690
 those that we have preserved and placed 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.769
 under glass once all the facts 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.769
 fillets cut the tomato the pulp 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.739
 continue to brown now down there 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.980
 flame I remove the cloves of garlic that 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:04.959
 now they have flavored the oil began 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.840
 put and deciding cauliflower le 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.750
 cauliflower florets later net one 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.730
 ten minutes even if the weather varies 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.790
 obviously from how much you have cut 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.549
 the little florets puts us like these 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.739
 take about ten minutes 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.569
 realize that even bake together 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.230
 others and then they will cook again in 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.000
 oven 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.750
 always remember to keep of 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.790
 safeguard the consistency of the gods 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.769
 vegetables in succession I will add the 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:38.500
 carrots let cook the carrots 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.660
 added to the bottom for 5 minutes 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.329
 see in all this that I am not 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.150
 adding salt will adjust worth 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.310
 only at the end did he spend five 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.799
 carrots minutes from carrots 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.799
 I will add peppers and celery 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.580
 they will spend another five more 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.569
 minutes before adding the 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.569
 tomato concentrate 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.970
 and the tomato we have 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.650
 added we have already cut into cubes 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.650
 a chopped basil 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.760
 we are now at the end of the 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.970
 cooking 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.180
 I go to fix the last salt 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.480
 cooking time will be a quarter of an hour to 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.070
 maximum we prepare the scented crumbs 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.260
 that crumble we said 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.020
 we will put on our ratatouille e 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.130
 now we have put in this bowl 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.710
 I'm going to perfume butter butter 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.830
 also here with leaves a leaf of 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:57.490
 basil priests is a bit of leaflets of 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.670
 parsley add the herbs 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.670
 aromatic 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:10.070
 a sprinkle of cheese we will put 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.410
 the Parmesan is the equivalent of a pair 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.150
 of spoonfuls of Parmesan and a couple 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:20.690
 of spoonfuls of emmenthal I will go to 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:26.090
 work the butter by hand in 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:29.120
 way to dissolve it and make it absorb 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.160
 from the flour what you will have to get 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.190
 with the tip of the firm of the fingers 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:39.770
 of the hands you see is a compound 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:44.720
 crumbled we await the baking dish la 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:47.320
 we grease with oil sank we put the 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.320
 vegetables 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.330
 here 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.600
 the compound that is prepared is pulverized 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.600
 over it 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:16.869
 here it is 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.590
 we go into the oven we said under the 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.240
 grill rather than the maximum 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.100
 temperature until you will be 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.880
 formed a crispy crust and 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.640
 golden 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.820
 it will take approximately 10 15 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.820
 minutes 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.020
 here it is after the cooking time 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.750
 this is the result we will have to 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.500
 get a nice crispy crust 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:54.170
 with the soft fragrant vegetables underneath 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.070
 the scent really inviting I run 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.070
 hi table
