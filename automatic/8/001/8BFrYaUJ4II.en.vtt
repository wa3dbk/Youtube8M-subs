old something new something borrowed and
something<00:03:24.290> blue<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:25.190> I<00:03:25.700> put<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.060> throughout

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690

something blue and I put that throughout
the<00:03:26.989> album<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:27.620> this<00:03:27.769> is<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.190> something<00:03:28.430> old

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
the album so this is the something old

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.319 
the album so this is the something old
and<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.959> thought<00:03:30.200> maybe<00:03:30.470> if<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.549> just<00:03:31.579> cut<00:03:32.030> a

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
and I thought maybe if you just cut a

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.060 
and I thought maybe if you just cut a
picture<00:03:32.780> out<00:03:32.930> or<00:03:33.109> any<00:03:33.290> kind<00:03:33.470> of<00:03:33.560> general<00:03:33.890> or

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
picture out or any kind of general or

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.920 
picture out or any kind of general or
just<00:03:34.100> leave<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.579> blank<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.150> then<00:03:35.239> there's

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
just leave it blank and then there's

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.319 
just leave it blank and then there's
another<00:03:36.049> photo<00:03:36.680> mat<00:03:36.980> there<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:39.760> then<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:41.120> end

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
another photo mat there and then the end

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.569 
another photo mat there and then the end
