00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
which is quite thick and so I mean in a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.140 
which is quite thick and so I mean in a
pinch<00:01:07.290> i<00:01:07.439> will<00:01:07.590> use<00:01:07.740> search<00:01:08.340> feet<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:08.939> i

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
pinch i will use search feet but i

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.080 
pinch i will use search feet but i
prefer<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.810> use<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> thinner<00:01:10.380> top<00:01:11.310> coat<00:01:11.610> over

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
prefer to use a thinner top coat over

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.609 
prefer to use a thinner top coat over
the<00:01:12.180> top<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> base<00:01:12.750> before<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.350> start

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the top of the base before you start

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.490 
the top of the base before you start
your<00:01:14.130> spongy<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.689> reason<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.320> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
your spongy and the reason we do that is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.880 
your spongy and the reason we do that is
that<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.220> sponge<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:18.570> tacky<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.350> can

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
that the sponge can get tacky and can

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.830 
that the sponge can get tacky and can
actually<00:01:20.040> lift<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.820> your<00:01:21.000> base<00:01:21.210> color<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
actually lift up your base color and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.270 
actually lift up your base color and
then<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.020> get<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.200> patchy<00:01:22.500> result<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
then you get a patchy result and you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:37.359 
then you get a patchy result and you
don't<00:01:23.520> want<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.240> looks<00:01:24.540> yucky

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.560 

now<00:01:38.369> once<00:01:38.579> your<00:01:38.700> base<00:01:38.850> color<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.270> your<00:01:39.360> top

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
now once your base color on your top
