00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.990
 hello we meet today for 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.640
 a new tutorial on fl studio for 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.850
 answer the question of a subscriber who has 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.250
 followed then but rather on the vocoder 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.350
 especially to recreate the voices 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.840
 robotic a little to daft punk so I 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.510
 done on a first tutorial on at bolton 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.660
 on the vocoder of ableton on the vocoder 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.670
 of reason on the vocoder to drive 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.140
 audacity and I was asked he must do 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.910
 on fl studio 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.260
 so there is a little different but in the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.570
 principle we always arrive at the same 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.809
 result therefore that I propose to you 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.800
 show how to make a then balanced 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:04.920
 effect the studio version 11 years test 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.030
 for mac so always by the crossover 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.360
 but well then here we go on a 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.010
 a year ago I was soon then in the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.830
 principle I recall for those who do not 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.780
 do not know where we have two sound sources 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.390
 one who can be your voice or a 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.280
 simple one voice what is it 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.090
 call the modu the atrice so to 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 modulation and kenya ie the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.439
 carrier this is what will generate what 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.710
 will transform the way by playing to 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.460
 using an audio clip or via your 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.280
 keyboard 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.039
 we will mix both with a pole on 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.049
 part of a track on the canal 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.549
 left then the other on the right channel 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.079
 as I explained on the tutorial 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.570
 of audacity it's exactly the same 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.659
 principle and that will be mixed in the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.520
 vocoder to play with our 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.850
 keyboard turn our way into time 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.049
 real 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.759
 that's what I propose to you 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.850
 show then at first 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:04.079
 will have a track that will be devoted to the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.799
 golden voice on max hook f12 f2 forgiveness 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.860
 we're going to say for example here sees her on 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.130
 the second track i'm going to do f2 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.350
 again I will say that this is going to be the 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:22.110
 carrier or holy is a little matter 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.110
 and on the third we will put the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.870
 then vocoder to fetch the 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.519
 vocoder so we select our track 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.519
 here hop we'll get 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:42.860
 the presidential vocoder and vocoder reverb 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.900
 so that looked like that so 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.570
 with our small banks 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.490
 we will put it in 64 with a 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.930
 resolution a little bit finer we will have 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.410
 Precision level of the bands more 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.900
 the addiction at the level of the way will be 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.910
 so here we will find 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.040
 so on the left channel a long of 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.620
 modules to trice the caviar so the 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.160
 carrier here is mixing the two so 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.780
 at first we will put my 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.370
 voice ie here we will select 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.900
 the source so I risk having a 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.420
 back that will not necessarily be 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:24.530
 nice now so I'm going it's for 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.550
 not hear me in duplicate so when here 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.530
 we amara who enters this track 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:34.360
 for the door so we will select a 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:40.810
 synth then we will add 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:42.460
 here a synth for example a bone 3 then 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.590
 I forgot to say actually must 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.430
 orient the channels so that is to say 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.960
 on the way here we'll say he's on 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:59.530
 the channel 1 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:01.750
 here is the synth night will be on channel 2 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.370
 on track 2 we will look for them in 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.170
 the meadows 7.1 his lead type whatever they are 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.630
 rich in dynamics so what we 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.350
 can have a sound well a clean good 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.610
 and net 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.989
 so did I read somewhere 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.140
 the idea i'm going to take a look at this 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.140
 given 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.840
 very well so what are we going to do 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.430
 now it's they're driving and the 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.950
 channel 1 and 2 on the vocoder so so 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.810
 we select our path and I go on 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.200
 the vocoder track I'm doing a click 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.500
 law 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:45.520
 here at the level of the small routed arrow 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.830
 to the fright only game I see it 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.990
 signal from this track on this track there 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.200
 to collect what comes from the 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.990
 voice in the vocoder and the same for the 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.070
 carrier I select it and I click 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.360
 right on the vocoder track rothen 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.490
 so when I speak if I go back 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:11.669
 now the way here you start 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:15.250
 hear maneuvering so I go down 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:18.760
 so we're going route here is the voice on the 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.310
 left channel here and there 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.620
 the synth the bus to the door on the 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.330
 right so as to see the 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.360
 distinctions 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:33.700
 here we have to go up the volume 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.870
 there we hear from a big with 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.919
 a small shift for me so that's 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.720
 not obvious but we see that there is a 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.760
 signal when I speak we see that my 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.460
 voice and well interpreted at the level of 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.660
 the hour analysis there 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:48.960
 if the lesson of our saint and that we put 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.729
 obviously at 0 and here I increase here 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.830
 at the web level so it's mixing 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.500
 So now there are more than 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.539
 so try to talk and play in 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.509
 same time with the keyboard so as to 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:02.340
 modulate my voice through the keyboard with 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:06.650
 this instrument there we will try too 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.650
 well with notes that with chords 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.580
 etc., etc 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.080
 so you see we do it 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.139
 directly with one voice 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.000
 recorded live and a synth can be 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.220
 load obviously as I do 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.169
 for the tutorial on audacity in the 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.229
 sampler here it's called voice or but a 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:36.960
 extracts a sample of votes and in 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:38.699
 the second a sampler with a sequel 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.849
 chords rich in harmonic type 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:44.699
 lead on the configuring route so the 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:49.080
 two the carrier and the voice directly 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:50.520
 in the vocoder and all mixed so we 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.090
 can go up gradually 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:57.240
 if you want to have precision or 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.280
 dominant with the sound of the synth but 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.409
 otherwise everything is mixed here we do not forget 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.969
 the channel on one of the tracks completely 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:05.610
 left and on the other completely to 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:07.830
 right on the carrier and that's how 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.259
 we manage to reproduce so a 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.729
 principle of the vocoder on fl studio 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.110
 I hope this tutorial has been 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:14.070
 interesting do not hesitate to let me 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.630
 the comments I tell you see you soon 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.630
 hanged your tutoz go ciao
