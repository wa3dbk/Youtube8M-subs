what does it mean when you can augment
the<00:01:05.860> mind<00:01:06.040> if<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:06.310> can<00:01:06.430> improve<00:01:06.700> memory<00:01:06.909> what

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
the mind if you can improve memory what

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.370 
the mind if you can improve memory what
does<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.509> mean<00:01:07.630> as<00:01:07.750> you<00:01:07.840> could<00:01:07.960> augment<00:01:08.229> the

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
does it mean as you could augment the

does it mean as you could augment the
body<00:01:08.560> there<00:01:09.100> have<00:01:09.220> been<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:09.909> many<00:01:09.939> advances

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
body there have been so many advances

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.859 
body there have been so many advances
even<00:01:10.840> in<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.049> past<00:01:11.350> few<00:01:11.770> years<00:01:12.250> that<00:01:13.119> people

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
even in the past few years that people

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.580 
even in the past few years that people
are<00:01:14.680> aware<00:01:15.130> how<00:01:15.630> more<00:01:16.630> aware<00:01:16.899> at<00:01:17.049> least<00:01:17.290> how

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
are aware how more aware at least how

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.830 
are aware how more aware at least how
quickly<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.220> technologies<00:01:18.850> are<00:01:18.880> moving<00:01:19.539> as

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
quickly the technologies are moving as

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.749 
quickly the technologies are moving as
humans<00:01:20.320> especially<00:01:20.409> as<00:01:20.710> baby<00:01:21.070> boomers<00:01:21.310> are

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
humans especially as baby boomers are

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.820 
humans especially as baby boomers are
really<00:01:22.390> gonna<00:01:22.539> want<00:01:22.630> augmentation<00:01:23.560> pretty

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
really gonna want augmentation pretty

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.980 
really gonna want augmentation pretty
soon<00:01:24.100> as<00:01:24.310> we<00:01:24.490> start<00:01:24.759> with<00:01:24.939> the<00:01:25.030> K<00:01:25.299> we're<00:01:25.840> going

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
soon as we start with the K we're going

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.539 
soon as we start with the K we're going
to<00:01:26.049> be<00:01:26.140> demanding<00:01:26.770> more<00:01:27.340> and<00:01:27.399> more

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
to be demanding more and more

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.749

augmentation<00:01:29.039> I'd<00:01:30.039> like<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.340> have<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.490> better

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
augmentation I'd like to have a better

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:31.380 
augmentation I'd like to have a better
memory

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
memory

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.040 
memory
maybe<00:01:31.600> with<00:01:31.869> every<00:01:32.770> chip<00:01:33.009> I<00:01:33.759> probably<00:01:34.690> want<00:01:34.990> to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
maybe with every chip I probably want to

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.080 
maybe with every chip I probably want to
be<00:01:35.110> taller<00:01:35.470> so<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:35.770> could<00:01:35.950> play<00:01:36.100> for<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.399> NBA<00:01:36.490> I

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
be taller so I could play for the NBA I

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.389 
be taller so I could play for the NBA I
just<00:01:37.479> turned<00:01:37.690> 50<00:01:37.869> so<00:01:38.319> memory<00:01:38.979> is<00:01:39.009> like

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
just turned 50 so memory is like

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:51.449 
just turned 50 so memory is like
certification<00:01:50.130> actually<00:01:51.130> don't<00:01:51.310> need

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
certification actually don't need

certification actually don't need
anything<00:01:51.789> I<00:01:52.860> mean<00:01:53.860> if<00:01:54.069> I<00:01:54.159> could<00:01:54.369> fly<00:01:54.610> maybe

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
anything I mean if I could fly maybe

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.830 
anything I mean if I could fly maybe
would<00:01:55.270> be<00:01:55.299> okay

technological developments they're not

inevitable but they do have a lot of
momentum<00:05:46.560> behind<00:05:46.889> them<00:05:47.310> and<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:47.990> we<00:05:48.990> at<00:05:49.710> this

momentum behind them and so we at this

momentum behind them and so we at this
point<00:05:50.310> in<00:05:50.490> human<00:05:50.819> history<00:05:50.940> were<00:05:51.780> at<00:05:51.960> this

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
point in human history were at this

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.649 
point in human history were at this
moment<00:05:52.560> where<00:05:52.889> we<00:05:53.039> have<00:05:53.069> to<00:05:53.460> where<00:05:54.389> it's<00:05:54.509> our

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:54.659 
moment where we have to where it's our
