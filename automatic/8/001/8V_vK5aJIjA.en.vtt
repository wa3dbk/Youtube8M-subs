looking a little while for a chassis to
bring<00:00:37.530> over<00:00:37.680> that's<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.960> really<00:00:39.960> good<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> look

is<00:03:37.680> bottom<00:03:38.400> mounted<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:44.310> let's<00:03:45.120> have<00:03:45.210> a<00:03:45.270> look

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
is bottom mounted so let's have a look

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.990 
is bottom mounted so let's have a look
over<00:03:46.080> this<00:03:46.230> side<00:03:46.830> first<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.370> all<00:03:47.520> take<00:03:47.910> this

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
over this side first of all take this

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:58.580 
over this side first of all take this
panel<00:03:56.270> now<00:03:57.270> hopefully<00:03:57.570> you'll<00:03:57.900> see<00:03:58.170> there's<00:03:58.470> a

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
panel now hopefully you'll see there's a

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.160 
panel now hopefully you'll see there's a
little<00:03:58.770> recess<00:03:59.390> this<00:04:00.390> is<00:04:00.540> where<00:04:00.780> you'd<00:04:00.960> put

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
little recess this is where you'd put

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.630 
little recess this is where you'd put
the<00:04:01.350> plate<00:04:01.620> under<00:04:01.920> your<00:04:02.040> motherboard<00:04:02.490> if

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
the plate under your motherboard if

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.360 
the plate under your motherboard if
you've<00:04:02.790> got<00:04:02.940> one<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.210> the<00:04:03.590> higher-end<00:04:04.590> cpu

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
you've got one of the higher-end cpu

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.580 
you've got one of the higher-end cpu
coolers<00:04:07.970> there's<00:04:08.970> also<00:04:09.240> these<00:04:09.720> holes<00:04:10.080> here<00:04:10.380> so

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
coolers there's also these holes here so

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.310 
coolers there's also these holes here so
you<00:04:10.710> can<00:04:10.860> afraid<00:04:11.190> your<00:04:11.370> cable<00:04:11.790> in<00:04:11.880> between<00:04:12.450> the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
you can afraid your cable in between the

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.200 
you can afraid your cable in between the
back<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.710> the<00:04:13.830> motherboard<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:15.000> side

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
back of the motherboard and the side

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.270 
back of the motherboard and the side
panel<00:04:17.720> it's<00:04:18.720> not<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:18.930> screwless<00:04:19.650> design<00:04:20.070> we

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
panel it's not a screwless design we

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.440 
panel it's not a screwless design we
didn't<00:04:20.489> really<00:04:20.580> want<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.850> add<00:04:21.000> up<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.360> the

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
didn't really want to add up to the

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.510 
didn't really want to add up to the
costs<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:24.270> you<00:04:24.330> do<00:04:24.600> use<00:04:24.810> just<00:04:25.800> standard<00:04:26.190> screws

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
costs so you do use just standard screws

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.330 
costs so you do use just standard screws
for<00:04:26.850> your<00:04:27.110> CD<00:04:28.110> ROMs<00:04:28.350> etc<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.040> your<00:04:29.160> hard

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
for your CD ROMs etc and your hard

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.220 
for your CD ROMs etc and your hard
drives<00:04:29.610> but<00:04:29.910> screws<00:04:30.750> work<00:04:30.990> well<00:04:33.080> sometimes<00:04:34.080> I

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
drives but screws work well sometimes I

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.500 
drives but screws work well sometimes I
think<00:04:34.290> they<00:04:34.500> work<00:04:34.650> better

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.340 

so<00:04:39.290> let's<00:04:39.470> take<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.740> other<00:04:39.860> side<00:04:40.130> panel<00:04:40.460> off

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.400 

you'll<00:04:45.350> see<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.860> included<00:04:46.820> 140<00:04:47.360> mil<00:04:47.570> red<00:04:47.990> LED

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
you'll see the included 140 mil red LED

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.530 
you'll see the included 140 mil red LED
fair<00:04:50.890> and<00:04:51.890> internally<00:04:52.640> it's<00:04:52.880> nothing

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
fair and internally it's nothing

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.890 
fair and internally it's nothing
exciting<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:54.440> all<00:04:54.800> black<00:04:57.160> you'll<00:04:58.160> see<00:04:58.490> the

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
exciting it is all black you'll see the

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.990 
exciting it is all black you'll see the
front<00:05:00.730> 120ml<00:05:01.730> LED<00:05:02.060> then<00:05:03.250> and<00:05:04.250> we've<00:05:04.580> got<00:05:04.700> room

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
front 120ml LED then and we've got room

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.880 
front 120ml LED then and we've got room
to<00:05:05.360> attach<00:05:07.420> five<00:05:08.420> three<00:05:09.320> and<00:05:09.380> a<00:05:09.470> half<00:05:09.500> inch

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
to attach five three and a half inch

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:18.640 
to attach five three and a half inch
hard<00:05:10.160> drives<00:05:12.640> they<00:05:14.080> 5.25<00:05:15.080> bays<00:05:17.650> how

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
hard drives they 5.25 bays how

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.710 
hard drives they 5.25 bays how
construction<00:05:19.340> wise<00:05:19.550> for<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.300> money<00:05:20.510> it's

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
construction wise for the money it's

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.170 
construction wise for the money it's
actually<00:05:20.840> quite<00:05:21.110> solid<00:05:24.730> I've<00:05:25.730> certainly

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
actually quite solid I've certainly

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.240 
actually quite solid I've certainly
built<00:05:27.170> much<00:05:27.850> I'll<00:05:28.850> built<00:05:29.210> with<00:05:29.510> much<00:05:30.250> lesser

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
built much I'll built with much lesser

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.310 
built much I'll built with much lesser
quality<00:05:31.580> Chessie's<00:05:32.240> from<00:05:32.570> which<00:05:32.960> costs<00:05:33.290> more

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
quality Chessie's from which costs more

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:43.150 
quality Chessie's from which costs more
so<00:05:33.800> I<00:05:34.150> think<00:05:35.150> it's<00:05:35.390> a<00:05:35.570> a<00:05:36.250> decent<00:05:37.250> bit<00:05:37.370> of<00:05:37.460> kit<00:05:42.160> if

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
so I think it's a a decent bit of kit if

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.950 
so I think it's a a decent bit of kit if
you're<00:05:43.340> going<00:05:43.490> to<00:05:43.640> use<00:05:44.000> an<00:05:44.840> a<00:05:45.730> power<00:05:46.730> supply<00:05:47.000> at

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
you're going to use an a power supply at

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.140 
you're going to use an a power supply at
the<00:05:48.110> bottom<00:05:48.470> here<00:05:48.710> there's<00:05:49.610> quite<00:05:49.880> a<00:05:49.910> lot<00:05:50.060> of

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
the bottom here there's quite a lot of

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.120 
the bottom here there's quite a lot of
room<00:05:50.390> for<00:05:50.420> a<00:05:50.720> decent<00:05:51.170> sized<00:05:51.410> one<00:05:52.090> and<00:05:54.130> again

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
room for a decent sized one and again

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.130 
room for a decent sized one and again
for<00:05:55.610> a<00:05:55.640> video<00:05:55.790> card<00:05:56.240> you've<00:05:56.510> got<00:05:56.660> quite<00:05:56.870> a<00:05:56.930> lot

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
for a video card you've got quite a lot

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.870 
for a video card you've got quite a lot
of<00:05:57.260> room<00:05:57.500> I've<00:05:57.740> measured<00:05:57.920> it<00:05:58.130> up<00:05:58.250> already<00:05:58.580> it's

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
of room I've measured it up already it's

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.790 
of room I've measured it up already it's
around<00:05:59.180> about<00:05:59.300> ten<00:06:00.200> and<00:06:00.350> a<00:06:00.380> half<00:06:00.410> inches

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
around about ten and a half inches

around about ten and a half inches
maximum<00:06:02.440> which<00:06:03.440> okay<00:06:03.680> doesn't<00:06:04.040> get<00:06:04.160> you<00:06:04.310> into

maximum which okay doesn't get you into

300-pound type video cards but

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.720 
300-pound type video cards but
presumably<00:06:09.980> you're<00:06:10.250> not<00:06:10.370> going<00:06:10.490> to<00:06:10.580> spend

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
presumably you're not going to spend

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.250 
presumably you're not going to spend
twenty<00:06:11.030> pounds<00:06:11.330> on<00:06:11.480> a<00:06:11.510> case<00:06:11.780> if<00:06:12.020> you're<00:06:12.140> going

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
twenty pounds on a case if you're going

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.630 
twenty pounds on a case if you're going
to<00:06:12.320> be<00:06:12.470> buying<00:06:12.680> one<00:06:12.860> of<00:06:12.890> those<00:06:14.470> and<00:06:15.470> if<00:06:16.340> you<00:06:16.460> do

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
to be buying one of those and if you do

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.959 
to be buying one of those and if you do
were<00:06:16.910> you<00:06:17.120> pretty<00:06:17.450> much<00:06:17.630> mad

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:27.969 

so<00:06:22.969> it's<00:06:23.089> not<00:06:23.119> a<00:06:23.240> massive<00:06:23.419> case<00:06:25.210> it's<00:06:26.210> just<00:06:26.979> got

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
so it's not a massive case it's just got

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:32.170 
so it's not a massive case it's just got
the<00:06:28.610> room<00:06:28.789> required<00:06:29.330> for<00:06:29.779> the<00:06:30.379> standard<00:06:31.309> ATX
