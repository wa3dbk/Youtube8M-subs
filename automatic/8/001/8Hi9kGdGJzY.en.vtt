i'm back now with our 4l chemical cold
that<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.100> will<00:01:08.250> need<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.549> create<00:01:08.700> Mobius<00:01:09.330> fuel

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
that we will need to create Mobius fuel

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
crafting grid like cell which will then

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.609 
crafting grid like cell which will then
give<00:01:20.490> us<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.820> Mobius<00:01:21.270> fuel<00:01:21.540> again<00:01:22.229> we'll<00:01:22.470> come

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
give us one Mobius fuel again we'll come

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.039 
give us one Mobius fuel again we'll come
over<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.100> our<00:01:23.130> energy<00:01:23.549> condenser<00:01:24.049> place

into our solar flower as you can see

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.310 
into our solar flower as you can see
this<00:01:56.759> takes<00:01:57.000> quite<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.420> bit<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.719> time<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.170> get

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
this takes quite a bit of time to get

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.950 
this takes quite a bit of time to get
and<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.219> actually<00:01:59.640> need<00:01:59.790> eight<00:02:00.060> pieces<00:02:00.360> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
and we actually need eight pieces to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.200 
and we actually need eight pieces to
make<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.320> piece<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.710> dark<00:02:01.890> matter<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.430> again

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
make one piece of dark matter and again

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.149 
make one piece of dark matter and again
i<00:02:03.240> would<00:02:03.420> suggest<00:02:03.990> making<00:02:04.409> nine<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.100> you

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159

i would suggest making nine so that you
can<00:02:05.250> keep<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.549> over<00:02:05.759> here<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.000> your<00:02:06.119> mock-up

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
can keep one over here in your mock-up

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.619 
can keep one over here in your mock-up

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
it out in the crafting grid after you

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.880 
it out in the crafting grid after you
have<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> items<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.780> will<00:02:27.170> then<00:02:27.349> place<00:02:27.380> them

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
in a formation like so place your

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.470 
in a formation like so place your
diamond<00:02:31.099> block<00:02:31.310> in<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.550> middle<00:02:31.819> and<00:02:32.030> that

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
diamond block in the middle and that

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.259 
diamond block in the middle and that
gives<00:02:32.720> us<00:02:32.870> one<00:02:33.110> dark<00:02:33.349> matter<00:02:34.060> again<00:02:35.060> i<00:02:35.090> would

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
gives us one dark matter again i would

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.270 
gives us one dark matter again i would
suggest<00:02:35.480> coming<00:02:35.870> over<00:02:36.140> here<00:02:36.349> dark<00:02:36.950> matter<00:02:37.130> is

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
suggest coming over here dark matter is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.920 
suggest coming over here dark matter is
gonna<00:02:37.459> take<00:02:37.670> quite<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.090> while<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.360> make<00:02:38.630> as<00:02:38.840> you

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
gonna take quite a while to make as you

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.440 
gonna take quite a while to make as you
can<00:02:39.050> see<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.319> gauge<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.530> going<00:02:39.920> up<00:02:40.040> slowly

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
can see the gauge is going up slowly

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.490 
can see the gauge is going up slowly
hopefully<00:02:41.450> by<00:02:41.599> now<00:02:41.780> you've<00:02:42.019> been<00:02:42.290> using

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
hopefully by now you've been using

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.470 
hopefully by now you've been using
quarries<00:02:43.099> you<00:02:43.580> watch<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:43.790> video<00:02:44.120> about<00:02:44.360> how

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
quarries you watch that video about how

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.780 
quarries you watch that video about how
to<00:02:44.540> use<00:02:44.750> quarries<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:46.310> have<00:02:46.430> other<00:02:46.580> means

to use quarries and you have other means
a<00:02:46.940> scrap<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:47.269> you<00:02:47.510> can<00:02:47.660> feed<00:02:47.840> in<00:02:47.989> here<00:02:48.260> and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
a scrap that you can feed in here and

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.370 
a scrap that you can feed in here and
help<00:02:49.000> speed<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.090> process<00:02:50.239> up<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:50.840> making<00:02:51.140> dark

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
help speed the process up of making dark

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.370 
help speed the process up of making dark
matter<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.420> about<00:02:53.630> wraps<00:02:53.810> up<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.140> video

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
matter but that about wraps up the video

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.150 
matter but that about wraps up the video
all<00:02:54.830> before<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.340> ended<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:56.120> would<00:02:56.330> again<00:02:57.160> make

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
all before I ended I would again make

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.470 
all before I ended I would again make
