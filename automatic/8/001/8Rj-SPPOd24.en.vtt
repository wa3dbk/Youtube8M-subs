Australia we've had a number of world
record<00:02:42.710> holders<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:43.490> that<00:02:43.670> that's<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:44.060> pretty

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
record holders so that that's a pretty

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.740 
record holders so that that's a pretty
good<00:02:44.510> outcome<00:02:44.590> for<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.730> Wollongong<00:02:46.730> club<00:02:47.030> we're

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
good outcome for a Wollongong club we're

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
good outcome for a Wollongong club we're
actually<00:02:47.840> one<00:02:48.080> of<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.290> longest-running

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
actually one of the longest-running

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.040 
actually one of the longest-running
clubs<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.430> Wollongong<00:02:49.820> when<00:02:50.540> voluntary

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
clubs in Wollongong when voluntary

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.140 
clubs in Wollongong when voluntary
student<00:02:51.260> unionism<00:02:51.770> was<00:02:52.100> was<00:02:52.550> introduced<00:02:53.030> a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
student unionism was was introduced a

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.510 
student unionism was was introduced a
lot<00:02:53.270> of<00:02:53.360> clubs<00:02:53.630> here<00:02:53.900> folded<00:02:54.410> we<00:02:55.160> are<00:02:55.220> one<00:02:55.400> of

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
lot of clubs here folded we are one of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.780 
lot of clubs here folded we are one of
the<00:02:55.580> few<00:02:55.730> clubs<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.300> managed<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.720> keep<00:02:56.870> going

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
the few clubs that managed to keep going

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.150 
the few clubs that managed to keep going
so<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:59.300> think<00:02:59.840> that's<00:03:00.140> probably<00:03:00.290> testament<00:03:00.980> to

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
so I think that's probably testament to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.910 
so I think that's probably testament to
the<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:02.480> executive<00:03:03.080> that<00:03:03.110> we<00:03:03.440> have<00:03:03.650> people

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
the the executive that we have people

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.530 
the the executive that we have people
are<00:03:04.220> motivated<00:03:04.460> and<00:03:04.970> willing<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.300> drive

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
are motivated and willing to drive

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.300 
are motivated and willing to drive
things<00:03:05.720> forward<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.350> I<00:03:06.740> think<00:03:06.920> that's<00:03:07.100> also

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
things forward and I think that's also

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.770 
things forward and I think that's also
reflected<00:03:07.610> in<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.060> fact<00:03:08.240> that<00:03:08.360> we've<00:03:08.570> had

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
reflected in the fact that we've had

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.200 
reflected in the fact that we've had
this<00:03:09.590> competition<00:03:09.890> which<00:03:10.430> has<00:03:10.460> run<00:03:10.760> for<00:03:10.940> 20

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
this competition which has run for 20

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.230
