00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.920
 found for a favorite video of the month 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.110
 of September so I'll try to 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.700
 you make one every month he me 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.620
 seems that for the month of August I 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.360
 did not make a moon but here I go 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.610
 hold me too I wanted to tell you that 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.260
 I'm sorry do not do it at least two 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.910
 videos only during the holidays but 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.340
 during the holidays by posting about 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.199
 one every two days and there since I 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.570
 that I have classes and that I can not 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.340
 often filmed jeans will post an all 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.559
 weeks but I think that's it 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.160
 so you will go back to our sheep I 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.450
 will start with the favorites make up 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.630
 after I'm going to talk about clothes and 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.730
 then movies books that I'm in 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.230
 read or that you dont 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.090
 I would like to talk to you first of all 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.530
 I wanted to talk to you about this so I 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.300
 wanted to show in my last video 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.789
 gatting tell it so it's a highlighter 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.180
 of the Catrice brand so it's like 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:59.660
 this is it really highlighter 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.129
 simple and it costs only 4 euros it 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.750
 seems to me so here I think it's 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.339
 really good value for money and 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.049
 I'm really happy to have bought it 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.420
 not to have spent 20 euros for a 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.369
 elector of a big brand because 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.319
 this one is enough for me 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.270
 then I wanted to talk to you about a 

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:16.639
 favorite but it's really my favorite of 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.009
 month is the best discovery for 

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:20.509
 this is what I wanted 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.639
 show in my last video so 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.490
 it's a chanel mascara called 

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:26.479
 inimitable and that's the best 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.399
 tidal bore that I have never read 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.590
 in fact before I use I put that 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.119
 mascara and scar free stuff 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.649
 that costs really cheap kind 2,3 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.469
 euros and I thought why not 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.329
 tested a great brand to see my 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.479
 can the difference if it's better or 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.179
 not if it makes a lot more eyelashes 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.889
 beautiful and it is the verdict is that it 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.630
 really beautifies the eyelashes 

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:49.459
 it makes me decide to dengue you can 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.270
 go see in the video gatting me 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.340
 say that it gives 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.569
 and here I am really great 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.399
 if they are expensive I think he will 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.450
 same duration a lot of time then I 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.779
 wanted to show you my favorite 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.149
 this month's shoes so this is this 

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:03.619
 it's up to date boots and that I took 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.200
 on the site nasty galls so she 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.420
 was 100 dollars so that's 80 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.640
 euros and I found a 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.230
 a code to have $ 10 less there 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.989
 So basically I froze for 70 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.590
 euros and they are leather so that's it 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.670
 the talent is 7 8 cm is good for sure 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.050
 that I'm big enough I'm doing a 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.580
 meter 76 with good here I do not care if 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.319
 I like it here I do not see where 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.770
 is the problem no it's for his 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.870
 shoes 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.640
 Then I will show you a favorite 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.020
 that I did not wear this month actually 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.970
 but it's really a favorite and 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.200
 Besides, I can not wait to wear it 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.880
 this is a europe that is 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.000
 unfortunately is quite short and 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.280
 scalloped behind like that but that's it 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.790
 it's a dress to be flowers of 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.340
 roses with black and white and so I 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.360
 ask them on the box.com motel website and 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.700
 that's actually I think I'm going 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.769
 put a jean-renoir sweater over and 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.470
 make it a job for the winter finally 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.480
 papou the winter for now here I am 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.860
 think it might not hurt and 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.060
 here I really wanted you to 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.799
 show because I believe it's the 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.380
 most beautiful dress that I have and I find 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:14.420
 really great another favorite of this 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:17.630
 month it's this is an ace and gray josh 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.090
 black gray actually and that's actually I 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.130
 have already blue and a gray more 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.780
 dark and I find that one this one 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.070
 not go with a lot more clothes 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.549
 because already blue is more 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.410
 difficult 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.630
 and here I think it really was 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.489
 goes through all kinds with my boots to 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.900
 it's going great with 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.700
 and here is more dense and jigging one is 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.609
 really super comfortable they are worth 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.870
 than 22 euros so it's really I 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.000
 find that it's really the top 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.950
 another favorite of this month is this 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.329
 so it's a straightener to the idea that 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.280
 I have been for over a year now 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.840
 but at the beginning I 'm not bad 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.519
 used because I do not know if you 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.220
 have noticed but I cut my 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.900
 hair I cut almost 10 cm for 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.100
 he is really a super good 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.140
 form even though it was not really 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.660
 much damaged before but here I was 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.880
 want to restructure my hair 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.290
 because before it was curtain finally 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.609
 that's what my friends told me 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.690
 said yeah that's a little curtain 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.000
 anyway because it is precisely 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.190
 the most structure so I read is 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.940
 but I want in a time in the morning 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.650
 before going to class 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.410
 and that's really the best of 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.790
 ten o'clock you lilies choosing 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.650
 minutes and that's it's really the 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.230
 bomb and then I'll talk to you 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.670
 of a book that is this one I do not know 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.640
 if you 've already told me about it or 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.130
 not but so it's doctor savior 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.230
 boukris and the title is the factory of 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.000
 disease so you see there is a 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.830
 sting with money in and out 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.240
 does that mean marketing medicine 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.940
 I do not know if you've heard 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.320
 speak but it speaks of bhl to 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.670
 the industrialization of medicines 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.460
 how do you push to buy more 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.550
 in addition to drugs how do we do 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.020
 to get you sick the sooner 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.540
 possible and that you have a treatment 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.620
 the longest all that for for sure 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.650
 earn the most money 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.170
 and that's it for this book it's worth 17 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.880
 euros and the outings not so long ago 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.910
 that I think so you can find 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.470
 at chapter fnac or even wanted on 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.480
 amazon i ordered on amazon 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.550
 and here he is really an awesome I 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.080
 have not finished yet but here we are 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.150
 frankly it's great for his 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.430
 culture and and especially that it's a fact 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.900
 news so here I advise you 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.310
 true the penultimate thing of which I 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.640
 wanted to talk to you this is the movie 99 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.200
 francs with actor jean dujardin he 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.540
 came out really quite a lot of time and 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.940
 it's interpreted from a book but I'm going 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.670
 watch twice in a row during 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.650
 holidays and I was really scarred by 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.080
 this movie because it's really silly I 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.390
 I thought a lot of things in me this movie 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.040
 really make me like a click a 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.720
 little actually jean dujardin he plays the 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.210
 role of an advertiser and so he 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.440
 explains how a trend in two 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.900
 days she moves on to another trend 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.040
 start the consumer society 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.310
 advertisers 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.590
 hypocrisy in society and lo and behold 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.320
 it's really a great movie and it's 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.730
 also a fact of society and here it is 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.320
 is really great and I advise you 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.610
 really is the last thing I 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.650
 wanted to talk to you it's a music 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.330
 that I really like that I see 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.250
 there made me discover so there are some 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.520
 do not think I'm kissing you and so 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.170
 it's called sun araw or slapping game 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.240
 sorry for my horrible english 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.920
 but hey we will not change it's in 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.560
 does it's a trailer of a game 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.980
 video and music lasts about 10 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.270
 minutes 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.950
 so that's really a music 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.360
 I would put it in the info bar 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.280
 if you want to listen to it 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.690

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.830
