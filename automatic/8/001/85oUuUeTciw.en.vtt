00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:15.429 
riders it was just a gimmick and an idea

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.790

you<00:00:16.150> know<00:00:16.180> a<00:00:16.270> lot<00:00:16.480> of<00:00:16.509> hard<00:00:16.779> work<00:00:16.960> and<00:00:17.259> a<00:00:17.320> lot<00:00:17.770> of

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
you know a lot of hard work and a lot of

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.010 
you know a lot of hard work and a lot of
long<00:00:18.699> days<00:00:18.730> and<00:00:19.210> long<00:00:19.360> nights<00:00:19.390> and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
long days and long nights and

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.620 
long days and long nights and
frustrating<00:00:20.980> races<00:00:21.369> and<00:00:21.579> I<00:00:22.210> think<00:00:22.449> we've

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
frustrating races and I think we've

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.530 
frustrating races and I think we've
taken<00:00:23.439> life<00:00:23.980> lessons<00:00:24.460> and<00:00:24.669> we<00:00:25.029> built<00:00:25.270> a<00:00:25.390> really

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
taken life lessons and we built a really

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.450 
taken life lessons and we built a really
solid<00:00:25.840> program<00:00:26.349> out<00:00:26.500> of<00:00:26.529> absolutely<00:00:27.160> nothing

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
solid program out of absolutely nothing

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.790 
solid program out of absolutely nothing

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
I think we've created something that no

I think we've created something that no
one<00:00:29.919> else<00:00:30.040> has<00:00:30.160> ever<00:00:30.219> done
