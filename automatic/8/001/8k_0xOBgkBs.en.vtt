00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.190 
like almost every other game it gets
more<00:01:44.459> difficult<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.119> progress<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
more difficult as you progress the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.930 
more difficult as you progress the
robots<00:01:46.560> are<00:01:46.709> faster<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.429> bullets<00:01:47.759> are

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
robots are faster that bullets are

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.370 
robots are faster that bullets are
faster<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.599> they<00:01:48.690> don't<00:01:48.869> seem<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.289> as

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
faster and they don't seem to be as

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.620 
faster and they don't seem to be as
brain-dead<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:49.920> suicidal<00:01:50.729> they<00:01:51.300> were<00:01:51.420> still

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
brain-dead and suicidal they were still

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.359 
brain-dead and suicidal they were still
walking<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.989> the<00:01:52.110> walls<00:01:52.319> though<00:01:52.619> beating<00:01:53.250> them

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
walking to the walls though beating them

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.940 
walking to the walls though beating them
into<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> wall<00:01:53.879> can<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.149> an<00:01:54.239> effective<00:01:54.629> strategy

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
into a wall can be an effective strategy

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.290 
into a wall can be an effective strategy
another<00:01:55.950> thing<00:01:56.250> too<00:01:56.429> is<00:01:56.459> that<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.879> can<00:01:56.910> fire

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
another thing too is that you can fire

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.999 
another thing too is that you can fire
in<00:01:57.509> eight<00:01:57.690> directions<00:01:57.840> while<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:58.530> robots<00:01:58.860> are

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
in eight directions while the robots are

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.580 
in eight directions while the robots are
restricted<00:01:59.520> from<00:01:59.610> firing<00:02:00.000> diagonally<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
restricted from firing diagonally the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.859 
restricted from firing diagonally the
2600<00:02:02.280> version<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.729> missing<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.149> few<00:02:03.360> features

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
2600 version is missing a few features

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.600 
2600 version is missing a few features
like<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.319> voiceovers<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.160> more<00:02:05.340> intricate

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
like the voiceovers the more intricate

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.249 
like the voiceovers the more intricate
level<00:02:06.000> design<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.780> indestructible

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
level design and the indestructible

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.350 
level design and the indestructible
nests<00:02:07.679> of<00:02:07.860> evil<00:02:08.099> Otto<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.149> still<00:02:09.330> a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
nests of evil Otto but this is still a

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.190 
nests of evil Otto but this is still a
great<00:02:09.509> conversion<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.349> highly<00:02:10.770> recommend
