00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.189
 valentine company water pipe 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.189
 never for this specific purpose 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.210
 m2 Beijing

 what does he think he 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.570
 I think that was the right way out 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.890
 such a group 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.209

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.990
 why is it a pity that the dynamo 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.990
 yes Pushkin 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.250

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.250
 2 Obama well, I understand 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.980
 but what culture is 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.160
 believes the head 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.350
 it will certainly help you 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.740
 because just like a lawyer thinks 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.440
 capital used no 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.180
 she didn't accept 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.250
 and wildfires caused well 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.390
 etc 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.820
 and it's nice 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.909
 but nice 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.050
 so this is exactly what will help you 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.890
 to understand correctly 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.509
 mexico panama 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.860
 when this portal and a half hour to drink 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.300
 but it's a head 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.600
 you personally 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.900
 rubles it is only because there is on 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.290
 what 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.000
 will not be as it was 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.360
 fourth 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.830
 describe it 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.270
 this is a lottery 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.200
 n like this so 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.299
 I think so 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.700
 by word 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.740
 as brothers 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.369
 submit documents that prove 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.590
 we need here 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.329
 percent 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.549
 company is such an example 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.889
 and this 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.259
 of course we would like to see how it is 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:20.899
 looks week 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:22.009
 so 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.409
 ii 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.139
 and that's when I thought in this moment to 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.029
 she is 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:28.999
 but alas 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.189
 sure but 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.319
 usd itar tass 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.319
 so company was so much 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.319
 these guys became the first projects not so 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.869
 so I was not one operation except 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:47.769
 Togo 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.299
 so on the edge of it count it so then 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.629
 simply 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.960
 after that the center of this card 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.379
 but I was then 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.050
 this project is burgas 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.159
 fishermen 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.859
 moreover, I did not transmit therefore 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:03.769
 almost 5 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.699
 except on the second day 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.909
 l 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.999
 as he said, thanks to this, not 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:11.620

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.749
 see how it works on 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.749
 magnificent venture was 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.449
 but attack 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.909
 the second 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.509
 no there was 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:32.509
 and get free 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:33.779
 I thought 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.399
 this is a monument to your minimum 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:37.399
 an assistant 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:39.740

 percent of companies having at all 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.490
 I hope also such a company as Wagner 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.579
 I suggest you 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:50.740
 istanbul 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.029
 I would be living 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:55.799
 for example go there 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.909

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.669
 moment park 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.799
 and again this allows 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.999
 trainings hryvnia indicators pandora 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:07.309
