hardest ending to an easter egg ever
first<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.210> all<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.869> go<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.199> maze

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
first of all you have to go to the maze

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.839 
first of all you have to go to the maze
after<00:00:25.980> you're<00:00:26.189> finished<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.550> round

after you're finished with round

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.329 
after you're finished with round
infinity<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.449> buying<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.869> switch<00:00:28.170> after<00:00:28.859> you

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:29.339 
infinity and buying the switch after you

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.700 
infinity and buying the switch after you
go<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.060> maze<00:00:30.269> you're<00:00:30.869> gonna<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.349> get

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
go to the maze you're gonna have to get

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.200 
go to the maze you're gonna have to get
the<00:00:31.859> correct<00:00:32.189> switches<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.970> then<00:00:33.090> you'll

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the correct switches and then you'll

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.360 
the correct switches and then you'll
hear<00:00:33.540> them<00:00:33.660> sound<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.770> know<00:00:34.980> when<00:00:35.250> you

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
hear them sound that you know when you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.920 
hear them sound that you know when you
get<00:00:35.490> the<00:00:35.610> correct<00:00:35.760> switches<00:00:36.240> and<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.720> takes

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
get the correct switches and it takes

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.330 
get the correct switches and it takes
forever<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.560> you<00:00:37.680> might<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.950> leave<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
forever so you might have to leave the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
forever so you might have to leave the
maze<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.850> then<00:00:38.880> go<00:00:39.090> back<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:39.690> let<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
maze and then go back and then let it

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.320 
maze and then go back and then let it
always<00:00:40.740> set<00:00:40.980> multiple<00:00:41.550> times<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.030> then

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
always set multiple times and then

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.940 
always set multiple times and then
that's<00:00:42.780> not<00:00:42.900> even<00:00:43.080> the<00:00:43.140> hardest<00:00:43.380> part<00:00:43.560> because

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
that's not even the hardest part because

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.760 
that's not even the hardest part because
the<00:00:44.220> next<00:00:44.490> step<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.940> you're<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.900> to<00:00:45.990> throw<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the next step is you're going to throw a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.050 
the next step is you're going to throw a
coin<00:00:47.370> into<00:00:47.880> the<00:00:49.280> fountain<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.910> you

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
coin into the fountain that you

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.940 
coin into the fountain that you
destroyed<00:00:51.390> earlier<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.200> could<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.650> build

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
destroyed earlier so you could go build

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.860 
destroyed earlier so you could go build
a<00:00:53.040> nav<00:00:53.220> card<00:00:53.460> table<00:00:53.850> once<00:00:54.270> everybody's<00:00:54.690> thrown

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
a nav card table once everybody's thrown

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.800 
a nav card table once everybody's thrown
it<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:55.790> you're<00:00:56.790> gonna<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.390> four

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
it in there you're gonna have four

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.360 
it in there you're gonna have four
locations<00:00:58.500> where<00:00:58.710> you're<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.220> to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
locations where you're going to have to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.580 
locations where you're going to have to
shoot<00:00:59.700> all<00:01:00.330> these<00:01:00.660> targets<00:01:01.110> as<00:01:01.200> you<00:01:01.290> can<00:01:01.440> see

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
shoot all these targets as you can see

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.200 
shoot all these targets as you can see
in<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:01.740> gonna<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.220> pretty<00:01:02.670> even<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.090> to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
in your gonna have pretty even have to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.179 
in your gonna have pretty even have to
have<00:01:03.300> pretty<00:01:03.690> good<00:01:03.840> darn<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:04.949> good

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
have pretty good darn really good

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.450 
have pretty good darn really good
accuracy<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.240> do<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.539> and<00:01:06.780> you're<00:01:07.280> gonna<00:01:08.280> be

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
accuracy to do this and you're gonna be

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.459 
accuracy to do this and you're gonna be
able<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.329> shoot<00:01:09.539> every<00:01:10.020> single<00:01:10.320> one

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
able to have to shoot every single one

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:11.929 
able to have to shoot every single one
of<00:01:10.500> them<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.189> might<00:01:11.369> take<00:01:11.609> forever

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
of them so this might take forever

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.389 
of them so this might take forever
because<00:01:12.689> you're<00:01:13.590> gonna<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.859> to<00:01:14.009> figure<00:01:14.219> out

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
because you're gonna have to figure out

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:15.950 
because you're gonna have to figure out
where<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.729> spots<00:01:15.030> are<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.539> you<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.810> see

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
where all the spots are like you can see

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.899 
where all the spots are like you can see
right<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.649> fuck<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.159> had<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.399> figure<00:01:17.789> out

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
right here we fuck we had the figure out

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.730 
right here we fuck we had the figure out
like<00:01:18.090> where<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> spa<00:01:18.689> spawns<00:01:19.289> would<00:01:19.560> be

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
like where all the spa spawns would be

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.889 
like where all the spa spawns would be
so<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.759> could<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:20.999> this<00:01:21.179> down<00:01:21.390> right<00:01:21.659> away

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
so we could get this down right away

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.380 
so we could get this down right away
this<00:01:22.499> took<00:01:22.710> literally<00:01:23.039> half<00:01:23.520> an<00:01:23.670> hour<00:01:23.789> to<00:01:24.149> an

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
this took literally half an hour to an

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.169 
this took literally half an hour to an
hour<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.929> because<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.710> hard<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.280> once

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
hour to do because it's so hard and once

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.039 
hour to do because it's so hard and once
you<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.140> get<00:01:28.700> everything<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.909> get<00:01:30.179> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
you do it you get everything you get the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
ruin the ending to this because this is

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.239 
ruin the ending to this because this is
