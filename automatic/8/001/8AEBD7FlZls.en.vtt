00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.340
 hi everyone I'm rock and give them the 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.840
 welcome this boyfriend of testing and in 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.000
 this opportunity I will show you how 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.369
 can complete the queen's contract 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.860
 called scavenger wolves to be able to 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.840
 complete we will have to go to the patrol 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.600
 of the moon and heading towards the area 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.430
 which is called the wisdom room in 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.170
 If they do not know how to get to this 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.000
 location because you can simply follow 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.810
 the journey that I'm taking in the 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.910
 video 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.740
 this contract is pretty easy to 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.390
 only complete that not all 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.579
 people know how to get to this 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.280
 location and best of all is that what 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.379
 they can do alone they do not need to have 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.809
 patrol or have friends to be able to 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.179
 complete because it 's pretty easy to 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.969
 complete once we arrived towards 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.949
 this sector we will be arriving already at 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.690
 that would be the hall of wisdom and 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.280
 here you are going to find a great 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.079
 amount of enemies if they want us 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.879
 can kill to complete contracts and 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.889
 gain experience or simply the 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.569
 can then jump here when 

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:00.920
 come to this location because they are going to 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.559
 hold on to the left and let's 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.269
 find this new room that in 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.430
 the part of higher in the part 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.930
 superior let's find three 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.750
 slag 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.550
 of high level that has its life of color 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.110
 yellow then simply what 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.300
 have to do is kill those three 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.820
 scum these three scums are the 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.320
 scavenger wolves so be careful 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.910
 they are just shooting with a lot 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.890
 Care also eliminate the others 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.870
 enemies that are here in that 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.640
 sector but when they get there they are going 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.070
 to find are three wolves 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.570
 level 28 scavengers so when 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.430
 eliminate them because they will be able to 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.990
 complete the contract then I hope 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.580
 that you liked the video if it was like that 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.530
 do not forget to leave your like favorites 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.970
 I commented that thales have looked like these 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.100
 missions of the queen whether they like it or not 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.119

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.740
 channel if you have not done it yet 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.330
 then I hope you can find 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.100
 these scavenging wolves obviously 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.670
 complete the contract and we'll see you 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.670
 the next 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.340
