the<00:01:57.250> three<00:01:57.490> steps<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:58.150> good<00:01:58.540> drill<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.869> do<00:01:59.140> is<00:01:59.380> do

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
the three steps a good drill to do is do

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.469 
the three steps a good drill to do is do
the<00:01:59.650> complete<00:02:00.040> breaststroke<00:02:00.549> kick<00:02:00.790> moving

the complete breaststroke kick moving

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.390 
the complete breaststroke kick moving
backwards<00:02:01.990> through<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.380> water<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:02.890> like<00:02:03.220> this

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
backwards through the water I like this

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.950 
backwards through the water I like this
one<00:02:03.549> because<00:02:03.729> you<00:02:03.970> can<00:02:04.000> see<00:02:04.390> your<00:02:04.570> legs<00:02:04.720> as

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
one because you can see your legs as

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.210 
one because you can see your legs as
you're<00:02:05.080> going<00:02:05.439> and<00:02:05.649> you<00:02:05.860> can<00:02:06.009> monitor

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
you're going and you can monitor

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.620 
you're going and you can monitor
yourself<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.000> make<00:02:07.090> sure<00:02:07.119> you're<00:02:07.390> doing<00:02:07.479> it

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
yourself and make sure you're doing it

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.479 
yourself and make sure you're doing it
correctly<00:02:07.689> you<00:02:08.410> can<00:02:08.500> also<00:02:08.679> use<00:02:08.950> your<00:02:09.099> arms<00:02:09.399> to

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
correctly you can also use your arms to

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.250 
correctly you can also use your arms to
scull<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.539> have<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.720> worry<00:02:10.899> about<00:02:10.959> keeping

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
scull so you have to worry about keeping

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.580 
scull so you have to worry about keeping
yourself<00:02:11.500> up<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.550> looks<00:02:12.730> like<00:02:12.880> this<00:02:14.670> step<00:02:15.670> one

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
yourself up it looks like this step one

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:27.570 
yourself up it looks like this step one
two<00:02:18.360> three<00:02:20.220> one<00:02:21.780> two<00:02:22.780> three<00:02:24.930> knees<00:02:25.930> up<00:02:26.260> feet<00:02:26.650> to

two three one two three knees up feet to

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.479 
two three one two three knees up feet to
the<00:02:27.700> side<00:02:27.970> kick<00:02:28.840> okay<00:02:29.380> now<00:02:29.560> let's<00:02:29.800> transition

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
the side kick okay now let's transition

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.040 
the side kick okay now let's transition
from<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.790> breaststroke<00:02:31.269> kick<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.930> the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
from the breaststroke kick to the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.770 
from the breaststroke kick to the
eggbeater<00:02:32.230> kick<00:02:33.150> basically<00:02:34.150> eggbeater

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
eggbeater kick basically eggbeater

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.530 
eggbeater kick basically eggbeater
is<00:02:34.959> just<00:02:35.530> alternating<00:02:36.130> breaststroke<00:02:36.760> kick<00:02:36.970> so

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
is just alternating breaststroke kick so

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.940 
is just alternating breaststroke kick so
