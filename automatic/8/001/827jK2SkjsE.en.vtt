00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.180
 we are talking about the warrior computer 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.720
 the computer to answer mails for 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.030
 to get into the network to make a 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.570
 page type of youtube update the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.600
 Facebook 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.199
 put some videos on myspace in the 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.020
 social networks update update the 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.460
 trial for the trial it seems to me that 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.220
 It is now more popular cell the 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.689
 people have their cell phone and send it to 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.650
 social networks from the cell phone I think 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.000
 that the cell phone 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.130
 little by little the cell phone is taking over 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.570
 social networks that seems to me 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.900
 and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.700
 that computer warrior the netbook is a 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.990
 economic computer does not speak to you in the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.630
 soul 7 they are going to steal 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.460
 so even put your files 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.730
 important in what is called dropbox 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.760
 which is an external hard drive in the network 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.800
 then that you can have it or is it the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.540
 netbook there is also one the model of 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.420
 11 inch macbook air that is very 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.390
 pretty and that's what is called stylist 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.030
 style and if that 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:12.030
 open mouth first so nice me 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.030
 I would like stylish the term agile 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.980
 the 11 inch macbook air computer 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.200
 13 inches are pretty computers 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.140
 good and well we already know that the system 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.900
 Mac OS is less vulnerable to 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.520
 virus there is really something that is 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.380
 invulnerable to viruses because 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.390
 remember the one that puts the videos in the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.040
 computer is one if one does not have 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.380
 security policies and one does not have 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.720
 let's say those assigned a way 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.680
 judicious to use the computer 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.620
 inevitably you will get it from 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.390
 virus and that's what I've learned 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.110
 then there you share that netbook 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.510
 it's the netbook 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.730
 install the software you want and already 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.280
 the software for the production you 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.900
 you work a company you want to make of your 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.330
 computer that you can use to write 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.250
 certain things to send to make your 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.160
 studies to make your things take your 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.870
 notes so is a libya computer then 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.660
 complicate a very heavy computer if 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.160
 you travel a lot or if you or if you 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.250
 move 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.710
 a laptop computer thought is when 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.300
 you need a high machine 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.040
 computational performance is to say 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.560
 you need speed for the different 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.560
 applications that you use if you need 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.990
 do 3-d modeling on a site to 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.110
 stop others from a company development 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.000
 of architectural applications and 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.950
 hopes and in college or are you 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.140
 issue a specialization and you need 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.930
 show a modeling in autocad 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.050
 connect demonstrate modeling in certain 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.000
 3d tools like trini max or maya 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.920
 or whatever and always 30 are the laptop 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.770
 because I thought of you I'll 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.050
 the computational potential from one side to the 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.670
 another one without and if you are going to use videos and 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.110
 outdated facebook if you're going to see 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.470
 youtube if you are going to see what I know 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.750
 search in google consult the network see 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.230
 the mails respond with sending a 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.780
 contract send a letter or they were 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.290
 at a low charge because there you need is 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.290
 a netbook
