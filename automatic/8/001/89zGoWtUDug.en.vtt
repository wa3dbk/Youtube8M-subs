00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello to all today we get 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.640
 found for this commet play on 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.529
 vasilis that you elected during 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.360
 last votes before that i would just say 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.040
 a little word because as you can 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.049
 to see it there are more famous 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.330
 black stripes on the side that finally 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.310
 stop filming with my webcam that 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.230
 was a little rotten to have real 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.720
 material and it's very largely 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.880
 thanks to you I put the money that I 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.590
 wins and on youtube aside for 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.599
 just pay me this camera so a 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.119
 big thanks to all of you who put very 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.949
 proud and who appreciate my videos it's 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.809
 it makes me very happy and it allows me 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.030
 so trying to do things better 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.460
 more but right now we'll go 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.649
 to video and explanation on our 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.820
 little pokemon 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.620
 we will first start as 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.989
 usually by statistics to 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.329
 first sight it's really not bad of 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.850
 while it is good defensively with 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.710
 pv a stoned and especially a ripper 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.020
 special which is very good 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.760
 next to that there is an attack a 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.949
 special attack perfectly 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.140
 reasonable my only downside actually 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.260
 would be a speed which it is true is 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.150
 frankly bad but the problem 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.799
 it is that the double type of the city 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.840
 which is rock and plant is not 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.510
 necessarily very suitable for a defensive role 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.659
 he has four weaknesses that are pretty 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.850
 commented evenly eva 6 stops a lot 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.530
 trumps is for me a big point 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.340
 positive these are these two abilities 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.950
 Special 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.170
 it can have cupping that prevents the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.900
 switch ie if the opponent 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.880
 make you howls or drac or that 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.650
 will not work and vassilis restaurant 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.980
 in combat which is very convenient 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.590
 especially account 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.530
 looking to get in and the second month 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.330
 it's even better it's sink that goes 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.150
 increase the special tax of our 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.640
 protected if he receives a small attack that 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.550
 in addition to giving him immunity that 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.500
 it's really good but the huge 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.510
 vassilis problem is that basic 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.830
 he's not learning big oven and the problem 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.210
 extra is that in the sixth 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.490
 generation there is more to put some 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.650
 abilities and so to learn the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.050
 attacks on our time vassilis podium 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.630
 he knows how extremely complicated 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.340
 so my advice more create it 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.590
 strategically in his deliberation 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.130
 to import it will be ten times more 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.080
 easy we will take the attacks 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.820
 I propose to play my 6 in this 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.700
 which is called a staël hours role 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.250
 special a special sponge that is 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.500
 a pokémon that will cash bear and damage 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.390
 special but beware the little 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.550
 peculiarity is that I play it 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.630
 with one of the new objects the pokemon 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.040
 ixlink to know the fight jacket there rest 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.690
 fight what is it and well it's 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.480
 a new object that will increase the 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.600
 special defense of our friend even of 50 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.700
 % and 10 in return vanilla prevent 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.260
 to use 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.200
 with two statuses ie 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.910
 attacks like toxic hypnosis banking 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.030
 strikes and all those attacks that do not 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.830
 are not directly to the French for 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.480
 that this object is profitable in fact it 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.879
 must use attacks that have a 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.530
 side effect and first I can 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.510
 already you talk about gicquel are su 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.300
 as you know is an attack from 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.700
 type plant that will make life in 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.260
 absorption to our pokemon and that's it 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.150
 perfect since it's an attack 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.069
 offensive it's not blocked by 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.640
 the jacket fights and that she will allow 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.620
 to our pokémon to heal in seconds 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.940
 attack I advise you bombers who 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.610
 is a type attack for example 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.319
 pretty good for the ti cover and 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.970
 who especially can use but 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.640
 the opponent is there again 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.340
 benefits from a side effect of a 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.420
 attack and therefore the boost given by the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.860
 combat jacket in third attack 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.959
 unfortunately we find ourselves a little 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.959
 not obliged to play with power in 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.120
 title that an attack of a teacher is 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.709
 rather well seen that it is of this type but 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.700
 it does pretty little damage it is 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.560
 not very powerful 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.510
 its only advantage is that it can 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.269
 increase all statistics if 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.859
 you're lucky the good 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.269
 frankly we did not believe it too much 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.889
 because they show since time 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.720
 that I play with this attack 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.090
 it did not happen to me much when we 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.290
 a little bit of bad luck 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.569
 that's it but the problem is that it 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.829
 not learn for example radius gmt a 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.780
 rock attack a little bit more 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.280
 powerful go him he's not learning and that's 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.600
 in front of the big problem of this Pokemon 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.130
 which could have been much more 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.889
 powerful he had learned the good 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.540
 attacks actually for the last 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.130
 attack there are several solutions 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.539
 many players will put such 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.859
 reform and it's true that it's all about 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.870
 really want that it can touch 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.690
 a lot of type opponents and me this 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.220
 that I love 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.550
 my good if they attack him harassment 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.410
 kinatay little insect grips your 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.900
 adversary and that does him damage to 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.160
 each makes a turn you will start 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.480
 to be fed up it's true that I like 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.830
 a lot this attack that extends into 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.930
 this debt case are a lot of pokemon 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.000
 and there it is true that she is really 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.500
 very mental and I play my thinking a 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.330
 little bit the same way that I 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.640
 vassilis because frankly on 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.330
 pokemon to a little peton that infestation 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.040
 harassment it's extremely accounting 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.470
 is necessarily the advantage of the day are 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.720
 not so smooth is that we are 100% on 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.840
 the special and you'll understand it with 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.820
 its sink capacity the idea more or less 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.010
 it is to succeed in placing oneself on a 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.990
 attack to get a bus from the 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.090
 special tax and then be able to do 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.710
 damage that is reasonable and that 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.680
 works great if you get to 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.120
 to anticipate your opponent 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.920
 but be careful you have to know that as 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.230
 usually I present to you what for 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.000
 me is really funny and we will say 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.290
 that it's the most current with the sixth 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.610
 generation etc 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.770
 now there are many others 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.690
 ways to play vassilis and for 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.520
 most advanced strategists I have 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.409
 put a strategic card in the 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.959
 details of life 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:34.559
 where we will go back in detail on the 

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:36.119
 other ways to play down 6 because 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:38.580
 yes, we will not see often played in particular 

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:40.679
 with curse on the physical with 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.199
 their landslide is calm in grain 

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:45.119
 it's very good we 'll use it too 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.580
 often to place the traps of europe 

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:49.919
 it will be this once in a while playing with 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.409
 care and toxic so in a run 100% 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.050
 defensive but sometimes has the opposite 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:56.879
 will see with soul dance so there really 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.869
 to be something more defensive and 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:02.939
 do some pretty good damage for them 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:05.909
 What I propose is to invest 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:08.249
 a maximum in rain and in defense this 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:09.719
 special because for me even though he has 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:11.429
 a good special attack it will only do 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:13.439
 never huge damage and it's not 

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:15.389
 frankly his is now certain 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:17.009
 see and it's a choice that's all about 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:19.409
 made possible will not put the 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:21.989
 all areas and smes will prefer 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:23.429
 put some in special attack 

00:06:21.989 --> 00:06:26.119
 it's quite possible even if it 

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:28.379
 also depends on your style of play 

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:30.839
 the ideal for nature is to have it 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:32.759
 calm or poorly polished 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:35.969
 after of course if you have it by nature 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:38.509
 shy or modest it will work as well 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:41.099
 if in my opinion it's a little bit less 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:42.520
 to accompany I really want you 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.810
 advise this moureu 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.490
 I did how to play there is no 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.319
 long because they are two pokemon 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.490
 that work pretty well together at 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:50.710
 level of type coverage 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.509
 in particular but also because they are 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.340
 two pokemon who are my super lousy 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:57.610
 and that's very scary to your 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.409
 opponent and it's not bad at all but 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.240
 you can also consider playing it 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:05.319
 with heat pokemon a 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.030
 of children even backpack on simulator 

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:08.409
 we see facilitates from time to time 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.240
 and especially in the bunkers yesterday where 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:12.129
 it is true that he will cash a lot of 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.629
 everything now on console as I 

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:15.310
 you explained it is much more 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:16.569
 complicated because to see it with 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.789
 good attacks will do a lot 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:20.080
 of reproduction must be imported from 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:21.759
 the previous generation 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.530
 and even I gave up because 

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:25.900
 it was too complicated too long to do 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.849
 so it's a little pity especially 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.949
 that the extra problem of easy 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:32.319
 is that there are some attacks that 

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:34.449
 would have raised logical and who would have 

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:37.270
 made really good like banks there by 

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:39.580
 example who does not learn and that makes him 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.580
 in enormously who's the limit a little 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.050
 little in the strategy so here I go 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.310
 leave you on it I'm 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.169
 extremely proud because I did 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.280
 no rotten joke on those he has 

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:51.759
 around the head 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:56.680
 because at last he is not very handsome 

00:07:51.759 --> 00:08:00.180
 and it looks a bit like I'm telling you to 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.180
 soon for more videos
