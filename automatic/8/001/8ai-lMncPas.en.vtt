I've<00:02:02.520> remove<00:02:02.910> this<00:02:03.060> by<00:02:03.869> doing<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.259> what<00:02:04.740> I

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
I've remove this by doing this what I

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.930 
I've remove this by doing this what I
did<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:06.259> excluded<00:02:07.259> only<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.799> file<00:02:08.100> right

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940

so<00:02:09.660> even<00:02:10.350> if<00:02:10.830> there<00:02:11.519> are<00:02:11.640> some<00:02:11.670> DLL<00:02:12.209> files

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
so even if there are some DLL files

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.710 
so even if there are some DLL files
which<00:02:12.720> are<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.340> potential<00:02:14.340> threat<00:02:14.700> at<00:02:15.540> this

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
which are a potential threat at this

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.710 
which are a potential threat at this
defender<00:02:16.260> will<00:02:16.640> act<00:02:17.640> against<00:02:18.269> them<00:02:18.480> and

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
defender will act against them and

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.200 
defender will act against them and
delete<00:02:18.930> them<00:02:19.100> no<00:02:20.330> all<00:02:21.330> games<00:02:21.750> should<00:02:21.870> open

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.650 

let's<00:02:27.210> call<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:31.310> staking<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.490> clock<00:02:32.700> now

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
let's call in on staking the clock now

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.430 
let's call in on staking the clock now
might<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.020> guess<00:02:34.470> should<00:02:35.190> open

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.070 

they're<00:02:42.440> just<00:02:42.680> it's<00:02:43.400> open<00:02:43.760> right<00:02:43.790> now<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.660> guess

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
they're just it's open right now I guess

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.780 
they're just it's open right now I guess
this<00:02:45.800> is<00:02:45.980> it

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
this is it

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.450
