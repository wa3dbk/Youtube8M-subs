have a muzzle break on the end the the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.420 
have a muzzle break on the end the the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
previous scout rifle that we still have

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.700 
previous scout rifle that we still have
available<00:01:23.970> uses<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> flash<00:01:24.930> hider<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
available uses a flash hider with the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.380 
available uses a flash hider with the
muzzle<00:01:26.070> break<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.460> reduces<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.150> felt

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
muzzle break this reduces the felt

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.569 
muzzle break this reduces the felt
recoil<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:28.409> compensate<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> loss<00:01:29.369> of

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
recoil to compensate for the loss of

weight<00:01:29.759> that's<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.090> stock<00:01:30.390> okay<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.290> scout

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
weight that's in stock okay so the scout

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.090
