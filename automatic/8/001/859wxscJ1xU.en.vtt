afterwards<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.740> was<00:01:10.950> difficult<00:01:12.140> when<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.500> high

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
afterwards it was difficult when in high

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.950 
afterwards it was difficult when in high
school<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.400> decided<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> really

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
school I decided that what I really

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
school I decided that what I really
wanted<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:16.560> dance<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.460> think<00:01:17.759> that

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
wanted to do was dance I think that

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.800 
wanted to do was dance I think that
there<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.770> desire<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.610> me<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.299> dancing

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
there was a desire for me to be dancing

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.630 
there was a desire for me to be dancing
all<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.200> time<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.860> yet<00:01:23.159> at<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> same<00:01:23.430> time

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
all the time and yet at the same time

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.859 
all the time and yet at the same time
high<00:01:24.509> school<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:25.369> demanding<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:27.210> think<00:01:27.750> it

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
high school was demanding and I think it

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.840 
high school was demanding and I think it
was<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.590> difficult<00:01:28.829> because<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.430> didn't

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
was it was difficult because I didn't

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.420 
was it was difficult because I didn't
really<00:01:30.090> fit<00:01:30.450> into<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.930> social<00:01:31.470> network<00:01:32.130> of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
really fit into the social network of

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.490 
really fit into the social network of
high<00:01:32.579> school<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.210> people<00:01:33.930> didn't<00:01:34.439> really

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
high school and people didn't really

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.469 
high school and people didn't really
understand<00:01:35.220> why<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.490> wanted<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.000> spend<00:01:36.329> all

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
understand why I wanted to spend all

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.310 
understand why I wanted to spend all
this<00:01:36.630> time<00:01:36.689> dancing<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.650> think<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.880> me<00:01:39.320> it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
this time dancing I think that for me it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.679 
this time dancing I think that for me it
was<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.189> at<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.610> point<00:01:41.970> at<00:01:42.270> Valley<00:01:42.479> Idaho

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
was kind of at a point at Valley Idaho

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.660 
was kind of at a point at Valley Idaho
where<00:01:43.290> they<00:01:43.590> were<00:01:43.649> trying<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.310> introduce

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
where they were trying to introduce

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
where they were trying to introduce
modern<00:01:45.119> into<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> program<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.649> think

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
modern into the program and so I think

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.219 
modern into the program and so I think
that<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.340> really<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:48.600> got<00:01:48.720> me<00:01:48.899> excited

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
that that's really what got me excited

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.499 
that that's really what got me excited
the<00:01:49.799> last<00:01:50.040> few<00:01:50.280> years<00:01:50.369> i've<00:01:50.670> been<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.000> portland

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the last few years i've been in portland

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.160 
the last few years i've been in portland
and<00:01:52.009> trays<00:01:53.009> name<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:54.270> comes<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.630> everywhere

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and trays name just comes up everywhere

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.959 
and trays name just comes up everywhere
there<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.920> i<00:01:55.950> think<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.460> kind<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.820> just

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
there and so i think it all kind of just

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.910 
there and so i think it all kind of just
fell<00:01:57.180> into<00:01:57.329> place<00:01:57.450> when<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.350> found<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:58.890> that

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
fell into place when I I found out that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.639 
fell into place when I I found out that
they<00:01:59.219> were<00:01:59.250> going<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.329> located<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:01.049> Boise

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
they were going to be located in Boise

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.670 
they were going to be located in Boise
and<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.130> had<00:02:02.250> seen<00:02:02.520> his<00:02:02.700> work<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.180> was<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.719> drawn

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
and I had seen his work I was so drawn

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.800 
and I had seen his work I was so drawn

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
hollering or whistling I think was an

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.470 
hollering or whistling I think was an
interesting<00:03:56.190> reaction<00:03:56.579> it's<00:03:57.090> something<00:03:57.389> I've

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
interesting reaction it's something I've

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.990 
interesting reaction it's something I've
never<00:03:57.630> really<00:03:57.989> had<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.620> performing<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.400> even

never really had in performing and even
without<00:04:00.269> movement<00:04:00.630> or<00:04:01.250> anything<00:04:02.250> the

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
without movement or anything the

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.879 
without movement or anything the
audience<00:04:02.970> reacted<00:04:03.600> in<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:03.930> way<00:04:03.959> but<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.560> think

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
audience reacted in a way but I think

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:05.920 
audience reacted in a way but I think
that<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.190> thing<00:04:05.370> that<00:04:05.549> was<00:04:05.639> really

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
that the thing that was really

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.629 
that the thing that was really
interesting<00:04:06.930> was<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.440> after<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.340> initial

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
interesting was that after the initial

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.400 
interesting was that after the initial
shock<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:10.049> all<00:04:10.170> everybody<00:04:11.180> was<00:04:12.230> seemed<00:04:13.230> to

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
shock of it all everybody was seemed to

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.800 
shock of it all everybody was seemed to
be<00:04:13.530> absorbed<00:04:14.069> in<00:04:14.220> it

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
be absorbed in it

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.990 
be absorbed in it
and<00:04:15.349> I<00:04:15.530> think<00:04:15.590> that<00:04:15.890> I<00:04:16.310> think<00:04:16.730> that<00:04:16.880> that's

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
and I think that I think that that's

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.050 
and I think that I think that that's
what<00:04:17.299> Trey's<00:04:17.810> intent<00:04:18.230> was<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:19.310> became

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
what Trey's intent was and it became

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.360 
what Trey's intent was and it became
less<00:04:20.359> about<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.959> shock<00:04:21.290> of<00:04:21.320> these<00:04:21.889> balloons

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
less about the shock of these balloons

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.790 
less about the shock of these balloons
and<00:04:22.850> more<00:04:23.060> about<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:24.110> movement<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.710> the

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
and more about the movement and the

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.820 
and more about the movement and the
shape<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:26.060> it<00:04:26.210> really<00:04:26.419> is<00:04:26.660> such<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.080> joy<00:04:27.530> to

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
shape and and it really is such a joy to

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.670 
shape and and it really is such a joy to
perform<00:04:28.430> because<00:04:28.700> it's<00:04:29.090> i<00:04:29.660> can<00:04:29.990> smile<00:04:30.350> and

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
perform because it's i can smile and

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.129 
perform because it's i can smile and
that's<00:04:31.160> my<00:04:31.340> natural<00:04:31.450> tendency<00:04:32.450> is<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.630> smile

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
that's my natural tendency is to smile

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.760 
that's my natural tendency is to smile
so<00:04:33.650> it's<00:04:34.100> nice<00:04:34.669> to<00:04:35.000> be<00:04:35.030> able<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.690> perform<00:04:36.470> and

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
so it's nice to be able to perform and

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.730 
so it's nice to be able to perform and
to<00:04:36.830> have<00:04:37.070> it<00:04:37.100> feel<00:04:37.490> like<00:04:37.760> it's<00:04:38.000> it's<00:04:38.960> not<00:04:39.320> me

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
to have it feel like it's it's not me

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.040 
to have it feel like it's it's not me
