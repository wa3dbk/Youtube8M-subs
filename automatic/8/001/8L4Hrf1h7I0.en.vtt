at UM this is I've watched this hair

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.330 
at UM this is I've watched this hair
twice<00:00:32.780> only<00:00:33.780> thing<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.079> gets<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.680> gets<00:00:34.710> poofy

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
twice only thing it gets it gets poofy

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.600 
twice only thing it gets it gets poofy
when<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.640> watched<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.590> it<00:00:37.590> gets<00:00:37.739> curly<00:00:38.370> so

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
when you watched it and it gets curly so

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.049 
when you watched it and it gets curly so
I'm<00:00:38.760> pretty<00:00:38.940> sure<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.450> straighten<00:00:41.059> curly

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
I'm pretty sure I can straighten curly

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.069 
I'm pretty sure I can straighten curly
back<00:00:42.360> cuz<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.200> had<00:00:43.820> that<00:00:44.820> bone<00:00:45.030> straight<00:00:45.420> ahead

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
back cuz I had that bone straight ahead

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.810 
back cuz I had that bone straight ahead
it<00:00:46.170> pretty<00:00:46.410> much<00:00:46.620> straight<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.610> big

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
it pretty much straight and just and big

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.119 
it pretty much straight and just and big
curls<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> whole<00:00:49.200> curl<00:00:49.500> pattern<00:00:49.980> was

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
curls so the whole curl pattern was

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.100 
curls so the whole curl pattern was
different<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.910> once<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.270> watched<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.960> went

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
different and once I watched it it went

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110 
different and once I watched it it went
right<00:00:52.289> back<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.129> crop<00:00:53.460> pattern<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.000> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
right back to the crop pattern so I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.850 
right back to the crop pattern so I
didn't<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.629> any<00:00:54.840> problem<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.260> straining

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
