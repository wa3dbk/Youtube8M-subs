of a neat little add-on and then you get
the<00:00:53.399> key<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:54.149> which<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.510> used<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the key here which is used for the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.020 
the key here which is used for the
transformation<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.340> little

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
transformation you can see the little

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.090 
transformation you can see the little
key<00:00:57.300> slot<00:00:57.570> right<00:00:57.719> there<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.739> pretty<00:00:59.010> basic

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
key slot right there it's pretty basic

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.010 
key slot right there it's pretty basic
it's<00:00:59.460> really<00:00:59.730> lightweight<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.600> all<00:01:00.719> black

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
it's really lightweight it's all black

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.869 
it's really lightweight it's all black
except<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.559> little<00:01:01.770> piece<00:01:01.920> right<00:01:02.820> here

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
except for this little piece right here

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.170 
except for this little piece right here
when<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.329> pull<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:05.640> key

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
when you pull this out you get the key

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.609 
when you pull this out you get the key
itself<00:01:06.540> which<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.900> actually<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> really<00:01:07.530> cool

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
itself which is actually a really cool

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.260 
itself which is actually a really cool
design<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.310> kind<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.549> shaped<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.820> Braccio

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
design it's kind of shaped like Braccio

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.190 
design it's kind of shaped like Braccio
man<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.409> clearish<00:01:11.220> black<00:01:11.549> plastic<00:01:12.200> now

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
man it's a clearish black plastic now

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.660 
man it's a clearish black plastic now
aesthetically<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.950> terms<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.369> differences

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
aesthetically in terms of differences

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.760 
aesthetically in terms of differences
from<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> Japanese<00:01:15.360> version<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.810> main<00:01:16.409> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
from the Japanese version the main I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710 
from the Japanese version the main I
think<00:01:17.250> most<00:01:17.460> important<00:01:18.000> difference<00:01:18.299> comes<00:01:18.600> in

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
think most important difference comes in

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.140 
think most important difference comes in
the<00:01:18.840> form<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> key<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.700> Japanese

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the form of the key in the Japanese

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.050 
the form of the key in the Japanese
version<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.350> shinier<00:01:23.009> gold<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
version this is a shinier gold and the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.570 
version this is a shinier gold and the
key<00:01:24.299> itself<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.840> actually<00:01:25.350> metal<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.400> has

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
key itself is actually metal and it has

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.520 
key itself is actually metal and it has
a<00:01:26.610> string<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.659> unless<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.110> don't<00:01:28.170> believe

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
a string on it unless I don't believe

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.749 
a string on it unless I don't believe
this<00:01:28.619> came<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.979> string<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.340> lost<00:01:29.549> it

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
this came with a string and I lost it

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.460 
this came with a string and I lost it
but<00:01:29.939> Japanese<00:01:30.600> version<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.140> sure<00:01:31.259> has<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
but Japanese version for sure has a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.740 
but Japanese version for sure has a
string<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.460> metal<00:01:32.790> key<00:01:33.030> which<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:33.659> is

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
string and a metal key which I think is

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.120 
string and a metal key which I think is
the<00:01:33.900> core<00:01:34.140> difference<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.590> actually<00:01:34.890> why<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the core difference of actually why that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.380 
the core difference of actually why that
one<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.340> cooler<00:01:35.549> usually<00:01:36.000> I'm<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.240> it's

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
one is cooler usually I'm like it's

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.940 
one is cooler usually I'm like it's
pretty<00:01:36.600> okay<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.619> still<00:01:37.829> pretty

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
pretty okay and this is still pretty

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.920 
pretty okay and this is still pretty
okay<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.820> oh<00:01:39.150> my<00:01:39.270> god<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.810> says

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
okay it's not a oh my god that says

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.840 
okay it's not a oh my god that says

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
trash they're ruining sentai with our

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.179 
trash they're ruining sentai with our
Power<00:01:42.060> Rangers<00:01:42.420> nests<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.829> key<00:01:44.070> is

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
Power Rangers nests but the key is

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.679 
Power Rangers nests but the key is
definitely<00:01:44.610> cooler<00:01:44.790> I'll<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.180> say<00:01:45.509> that

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
definitely cooler I'll just say that

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.660 
definitely cooler I'll just say that
right<00:01:46.140> off<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.799> bat<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.280> said<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> might

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
right off the bat like I said I might

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.889 
right off the bat like I said I might
get<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.939> those<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.210> some<00:01:48.360> sentai<00:01:48.630> retro

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
get to those in some sentai retro

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.010 
get to those in some sentai retro
reviews<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.770> think<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.490> most

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
reviews but I think that is the most

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.480 
reviews but I think that is the most
important<00:01:52.020> difference<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.500> probably<00:01:52.799> out<00:01:53.250> of

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
important difference and probably out of

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.100 
important difference and probably out of
all<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.880> Dino<00:01:54.090> charge<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:54.720> Dino<00:01:54.869> charge

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
all of the Dino charge or Dino charge

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.539 
all of the Dino charge or Dino charge
compiled<00:01:55.380> I'm<00:01:55.740> gonna<00:01:55.950> probably<00:01:56.219> do<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.490> a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
compiled I'm gonna probably do that a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.389 
compiled I'm gonna probably do that a
lot<00:01:56.790> Dino<00:01:57.420> Thunder<00:01:57.689> morphers<00:01:58.399> that's

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
lot Dino Thunder morphers that's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.520 
lot Dino Thunder morphers that's
probably<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> biggest

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
probably the one of the biggest

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.280 
probably the one of the biggest
differences<00:02:01.950> amongst<00:02:02.399> them<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:03.960> look<00:02:04.140> wise

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
differences amongst them but look wise

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.990 
differences amongst them but look wise
for<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.950> believe<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.369> other<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:05.700> does

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
for this I believe the other one does

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.459 
for this I believe the other one does
look<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.270> little<00:02:06.390> bit<00:02:06.659> better<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.290> one

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
look a little bit better but this one

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.169 
look a little bit better but this one
honestly<00:02:08.129> looks<00:02:08.459> fine<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.789> think<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.060> looks

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
honestly looks fine I think it looks

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.059 
honestly looks fine I think it looks
good<00:02:09.390> there's<00:02:09.720> no<00:02:10.080> problems<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.860> think

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
good there's no problems with it I think

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.100 
good there's no problems with it I think
the<00:02:11.160> only<00:02:11.280> real<00:02:11.520> difference<00:02:11.640> here<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.120> key

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the only real difference here is the key

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.540 
the only real difference here is the key
look<00:02:13.230> wise<00:02:13.380> for<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.890> looks<00:02:14.070> good<00:02:14.280> you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
look wise for this it looks good you

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.580 
look wise for this it looks good you

for<00:02:34.770> cosplay<00:02:35.400> purposes<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.270> really<00:02:37.020> have<00:02:37.140> no

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
for cosplay purposes I really have no

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
problems with it on its own like I said

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.150 
problems with it on its own like I said
about<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.900> three<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.530> think<00:02:40.860> the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
about it the three I think the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.520 
about it the three I think the
differences<00:02:41.580> are<00:02:41.760> pretty<00:02:41.790> minor<00:02:42.420> at<00:02:43.170> least<00:02:43.380> to

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
differences are pretty minor at least to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.980 
differences are pretty minor at least to
me<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.830> terms<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.280> core<00:02:44.490> morphers<00:02:44.970> but<00:02:45.810> the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
me in terms of the core morphers but the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.449 
me in terms of the core morphers but the
most<00:02:46.230> major<00:02:46.470> difference<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.040> all<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.310> them

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
most major difference of all of them

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.740 
most major difference of all of them
happens<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.030> one<00:02:48.209> which<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.600> key

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
happens in this one which is the key

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.030 
happens in this one which is the key
which<00:02:49.050> I'll<00:02:49.170> mention<00:02:49.290> probably<00:02:49.770> again<00:02:49.950> I'll

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
which I'll mention probably again I'll

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.500 
which I'll mention probably again I'll
just<00:02:50.070> keep<00:02:50.250> talking<00:02:50.580> about<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.910> well<00:02:51.330> I'm<00:02:51.420> off

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
and then of course you can't switch off

and then of course you can't switch off
the<00:03:39.410> face<00:03:39.560> play<00:03:39.860> but<00:03:40.069> I<00:03:40.220> do<00:03:41.209> not<00:03:41.330> think<00:03:41.510> there's

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
the face play but I do not think there's

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.120 
the face play but I do not think there's
any<00:03:41.870> other<00:03:41.930> sounds<00:03:42.470> as<00:03:42.590> you<00:03:42.680> can<00:03:42.800> see<00:03:42.950> here

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
any other sounds as you can see here

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.620 
any other sounds as you can see here
there's<00:03:43.280> this<00:03:43.370> little<00:03:43.430> panel<00:03:44.330> here<00:03:44.450> which

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
there's this little panel here which

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.750 
there's this little panel here which
looks<00:03:44.959> like<00:03:45.020> three<00:03:45.380> buttons<00:03:45.770> but<00:03:46.340> unless<00:03:46.580> you

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
looks like three buttons but unless you

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.339 
looks like three buttons but unless you
have<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:47.000> press<00:03:47.239> really<00:03:47.510> hard<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:47.959> believe<00:03:48.170> only

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
have to press really hard I believe only

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:49.930 
have to press really hard I believe only
this<00:03:48.500> one's<00:03:48.709> pressable<00:03:49.099> and<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.670> made<00:03:49.819> the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
this one's pressable and I made the

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.059 
this one's pressable and I made the
mistake<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.360> my<00:03:50.450> Dino<00:03:50.660> Morpher<00:03:51.410> review<00:03:51.950> where

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
mistake in my Dino Morpher review where

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.290 
mistake in my Dino Morpher review where
I<00:03:52.099> thought<00:03:52.310> they<00:03:52.489> were<00:03:52.580> all<00:03:52.700> three<00:03:52.940> pressable

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
I thought they were all three pressable

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.760 
I thought they were all three pressable
but<00:03:53.630> in<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.810> Dino<00:03:53.989> Thunder<00:03:54.200> morph<00:03:54.500> are<00:03:54.620> only

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
but in the Dino Thunder morph are only

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.190 
but in the Dino Thunder morph are only
two<00:03:55.130> of<00:03:55.160> them<00:03:55.340> are<00:03:55.520> pressable<00:03:56.020> but<00:03:57.020> one<00:03:57.170> of

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
two of them are pressable but one of

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.900 
two of them are pressable but one of
them<00:03:57.440> like<00:03:57.800> this<00:03:57.950> one<00:03:58.100> you<00:03:58.220> can<00:03:58.340> see<00:03:58.370> is<00:03:58.670> like

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
them like this one you can see is like

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.780 
them like this one you can see is like
higher<00:03:59.720> up<00:03:59.989> but<00:04:00.530> these<00:04:00.650> two<00:04:00.890> here<00:04:01.459> are<00:04:01.580> like

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
higher up but these two here are like

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.250 
higher up but these two here are like
lower<00:04:01.970> down<00:04:02.270> and<00:04:02.510> one<00:04:02.690> of<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.870> buttons<00:04:03.080> and

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
lower down and one of the buttons and

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.840 
lower down and one of the buttons and
the<00:04:03.319> Dino<00:04:03.530> Thunder<00:04:03.680> more<00:04:03.980> fur<00:04:04.100> is<00:04:04.310> lower<00:04:04.550> down

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919
