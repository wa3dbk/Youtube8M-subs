hey guys so I have some kind of
disappointing<00:00:03.959> news<00:00:06.080> it's<00:00:07.080> somewhat<00:00:07.890> bad<00:00:08.069> but

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
disappointing news it's somewhat bad but

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.259 
disappointing news it's somewhat bad but
somewhat<00:00:08.639> good<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.849> guess<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.269> could<00:00:09.420> say<00:00:09.800> the

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
somewhat good I guess you could say the

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.330 
somewhat good I guess you could say the
parents<00:00:12.269> here<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.349> apparent<00:00:13.740> angelfish<00:00:15.109> were

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
parents here the apparent angelfish were

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.060 
parents here the apparent angelfish were
eating<00:00:17.340> some<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.850> eggs<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.480> as<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.890> found

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
eating some of the eggs and as I found

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.640 
eating some of the eggs and as I found
out<00:00:20.279> by<00:00:20.520> doing<00:00:20.789> some<00:00:21.029> research<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:22.470> is

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
out by doing some research that this is

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.730 
out by doing some research that this is
quite<00:00:22.859> normal<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.420> an<00:00:24.420> angelfish<00:00:25.109> pair<00:00:25.439> for

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
quite normal for an angelfish pair for

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.640 
quite normal for an angelfish pair for
their<00:00:25.859> first<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.910> know<00:00:27.029> batch<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.420> eggs<00:00:27.650> so

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
their first you know batch of eggs so

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.620 
their first you know batch of eggs so
once<00:00:29.250> they<00:00:29.400> get<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.789> their<00:00:30.000> second<00:00:30.480> batch

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
once they get on to their second batch

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.400 
once they get on to their second batch
or<00:00:30.869> third<00:00:31.109> batches<00:00:31.619> when<00:00:31.800> they'll<00:00:32.040> finally<00:00:32.340> I

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
or third batches when they'll finally I

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.889 
or third batches when they'll finally I
guess<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.559> could<00:00:34.680> say<00:00:34.829> be<00:00:35.070> properly

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
guess you could say be properly

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.090 
guess you could say be properly
accustomed<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.110> having<00:00:37.440> offspring<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:40.950> to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
accustomed to having offspring so to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.630 
accustomed to having offspring so to
protect<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.700> eggs<00:00:42.030> from<00:00:43.460> practically<00:00:44.460> being

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
protect the eggs from practically being

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.330 
protect the eggs from practically being
exterminated<00:00:45.000> by<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.539> parents<00:00:46.079> I've<00:00:46.739> went

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
exterminated by the parents I've went

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.500 
exterminated by the parents I've went
ahead<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.760> used<00:00:48.030> my<00:00:48.739> little<00:00:49.739> fright<00:00:50.180> net<00:00:51.180> here

box whatever you want to call it and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.490 
box whatever you want to call it and
I've<00:00:54.239> put<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.520> leaf<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.730> there<00:00:57.170> with<00:00:58.170> all<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
I've put the leaf in there with all the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.630 
I've put the leaf in there with all the
eggs<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.520> put<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.239> inside<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.109> little<00:01:01.949> box

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640

here<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.780> see<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.140> lot<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.470> them<00:01:04.559> have

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
here as you can see a lot of them have

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.740 
here as you can see a lot of them have
turned<00:01:04.920> white<00:01:05.220> meaning<00:01:05.700> those<00:01:05.909> haven't

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
turned white meaning those haven't

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.750 
turned white meaning those haven't
actually<00:01:07.020> been<00:01:07.350> fertilized<00:01:07.890> which<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.490> also

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
actually been fertilized which is also

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.710 
actually been fertilized which is also
once<00:01:09.720> again<00:01:09.990> very<00:01:10.200> normal<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:11.390> an<00:01:12.390> angel

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
once again very normal for an angel

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.700 
once again very normal for an angel
fish's<00:01:13.020> pair<00:01:13.260> first<00:01:14.220> batch<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:14.939> eggs<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.720> it's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
fish's pair first batch of eggs so it's

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.249 
fish's pair first batch of eggs so it's
completely<00:01:16.950> normal<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.970> know<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.360> didn't

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
completely normal and you know I didn't

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.899 
completely normal and you know I didn't
expect<00:01:19.320> their<00:01:20.310> first

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
expect their first

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.039 
expect their first
you<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.450> batch<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.369> do<00:01:23.369> well<00:01:23.610> anyways<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.360> as

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you know batch to do well anyways but as

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.149 
you know batch to do well anyways but as
you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.470> there's<00:01:25.650> still<00:01:25.860> quite<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> few

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
you can see there's still quite a few

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.160 
you can see there's still quite a few
eggs<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:26.820> clear<00:01:27.270> meaning<00:01:27.630> those<00:01:27.900> will

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
eggs that are clear meaning those will

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.609 
eggs that are clear meaning those will
hatch<00:01:28.560> into<00:01:29.210> fry<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.689> pretty<00:01:31.259> excited<00:01:31.590> about

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
hatch into fry so pretty excited about

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.550 
hatch into fry so pretty excited about
that<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.420> when<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.540> do<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.229> kind<00:01:34.530> of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
that and when you do this it's kind of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.530 
that and when you do this it's kind of
considered<00:01:34.860> artificial<00:01:35.670> hatching<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
considered artificial hatching of the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.149 
considered artificial hatching of the
eggs<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.799> make<00:01:37.979> sure

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
eggs and so you have to make sure

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.539 
eggs and so you have to make sure
there's<00:01:38.659> aeration<00:01:39.659> or<00:01:39.810> water<00:01:40.049> movement<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
there's aeration or water movement and

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
there's aeration or water movement and
what<00:01:41.729> I've<00:01:41.820> done<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.060> I've<00:01:42.450> gotten<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
what I've done is I've gotten the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.520 
what I've done is I've gotten the
outtake<00:01:44.070> from<00:01:44.490> my<00:01:44.700> filter<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.360> pointed<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.409> at

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
outtake from my filter and pointed it at

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.100 
outtake from my filter and pointed it at
the<00:01:46.710> box<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.460> has<00:01:48.119> constant<00:01:48.659> water<00:01:48.810> flow

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the box so it has constant water flow

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.039 
the box so it has constant water flow
and<00:01:49.670> everything's<00:01:50.670> being<00:01:50.939> moved<00:01:51.149> around<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
and everything's being moved around and

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.310 
and everything's being moved around and
you<00:01:52.590> know<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.100> eggs<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.460> proper<00:01:53.790> aeration

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
you know the eggs have proper aeration

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.830 
you know the eggs have proper aeration
so<00:01:55.320> probably<00:01:56.250> within<00:01:56.579> about<00:01:56.880> three<00:01:57.360> weeks<00:01:57.570> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
so probably within about three weeks to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.749 
so probably within about three weeks to
two<00:01:57.990> or<00:01:58.229> two<00:01:58.860> or<00:01:58.950> three<00:01:58.979> weeks<00:01:59.310> around<00:01:59.460> there

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
two or two or three weeks around there

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.359 
two or two or three weeks around there
the<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:01.049> pair<00:02:01.409> will<00:02:01.590> again<00:02:02.549> lay<00:02:02.790> eggs<00:02:03.149> and

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
the this pair will again lay eggs and

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.990 
the this pair will again lay eggs and
hopefully<00:02:05.369> they<00:02:05.490> do<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.700> right<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:05.939> time

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
hopefully they do it right this time

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.199 
hopefully they do it right this time
they<00:02:06.329> don't<00:02:06.509> eat<00:02:06.630> them<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:08.700> know<00:02:08.789> since

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
they don't eat them and you know since

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.270 
they don't eat them and you know since
this<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.450> our<00:02:09.569> second<00:02:09.989> batch<00:02:10.319> they<00:02:10.590> should<00:02:10.800> do

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
this is our second batch they should do

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.530 
this is our second batch they should do
pretty<00:02:11.520> well<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.790> think<00:02:11.970> because<00:02:12.330> I

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
pretty well I think because I

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.559 
pretty well I think because I
mainly<00:02:13.080> what<00:02:13.230> I've<00:02:13.319> read<00:02:13.530> on<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.799> internet<00:02:14.569> so
