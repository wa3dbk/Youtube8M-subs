00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:08.320
believe it or not this beast next to me
is an entry-level car but it's also a

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.280
Lamborghini which means it's one of the
most extreme entry-level cars you'll

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.299
find out there

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.090
meet the new 2015 lamborghini Huracan
you don't just buy a car for its headlights

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.180
but the Huracan does have some pretty
cool lights going on your note these

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.360
LEDs they sort of come up and down
vertically sort of like lightning

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.590
strikes and they dry your eye into the
general profile of the car here note

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.619
that the rate of the hood the rate of
the windshield sort of match each other

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.070
there's not a big kind of angular
differences you come up into the roof

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.120
line right here

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.920
very recognizable lamborghini profile
but less going on here along the side in

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.730
terms of cut lines in terms of
ventilation vs Lamborghinis other car

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.840
the Aventador so let's talk about this
name right here looks like it should be

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.200
pronounced hurricane or hurancan it's
actually pronounced HURACAN according

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.040
Lamborghini

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.960
the name comes from a famous Spanish
full so here's where the ball gets its

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.750
horns a mid-engine layout in the work on
5.2 liter v10 here with direct and port

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.979
injection 602 horsepower 413 pound-feet
of torque

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.940
thanks to plenty of carbon fiber and
aluminum in the chassis that we work on

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.280
only weighs eighty six pounds more than
a Ferrari 458 standard all-wheel drive a

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.600
seven-speed dual-clutch automatic
transmission means 0 to 60 in less than

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.220
3.2 seconds

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.490
that's wicked fast

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.369
Huracan is actually easier to drive than
you think there's more power system the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.680
steering than you'd expect for a
supercar and the brakes have a nice

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.409
linear feel despite the fact that
they're giant carbon ceramic brakes

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.729
which can call the car down from
extra-legal speeds very very quickly

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.780
obviously as you'd expect the 5.2 liter
v10 tons of power but more talking to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.149
you think for a naturally aspirated
engine lots of power from even 2500 2800

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.750
RPM all the way up through seven eight
thousand all the way up to the 8500 red

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.670
line in our test car here

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.600
great sound from the v10 engine takes on
a very different note as you get up

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.190
not just necessarily a certain rpm but
past a certain amount of acceleration or

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.429
once you really dig into that gas pedal
the engine just takes on a different

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.740
note sounds really really good actually

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.160
in terms of handling our editors agreed
that the Rubicon feels very planted the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.450
all-wheel-drive system has tons and tons
of grip the steering has good turn in

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.989
precision the nose . where you wanted to
but you really have to give the gas

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.370
you have lots of gas at exactly the
wrong moment mid-corner to make the tail

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.260
feel especially squirrely

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.250
from the air vents to the gauge wrap
around there's a lot of futuristic kind

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.030
of edgy textures and angles going on
your you kind of expect the interior of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.579
the bat will be able to seem like this
but honestly

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.269
lamborghini part of the volkswagen
group's a lot of Volkswagen Audi kind of

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.030
control scattered about the interior and
that's a really good thing because it

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.370
breeds familiarity this knob right here

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.420
audi MMI system users should be very
familiar with it it's got its familiar

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.799
four-quadrant buttons and controls the
action here on a 12.3 inch gauge display

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.519
which has your multimedia system also
things like your speedometer you're

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.470
attacking off your tachometer

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.640
there's three auxiliary gauges over here
below that a lot of toggle switches kind

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.650
of flow into the center stack here

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.489
here's the transmission now you pull up
right here to go into reverse you press

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.579
this to go in the park this is manual
mode if you want to just go into regular

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.379
dr and pull toward you with this large
paddle shifter right here speaking of

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.349
these paddle shifters unencumbered
access to them thanks to an f1-style

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.310
steering wheel that puts all of the
major controls even things like your

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.310
wipers your turn signals things that
would normally be on a stock on the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.920
steering column right here at your
fingertips

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.340
so a lot of idiosyncrasies a lot of
futuristic things in this car but

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.449
overall easy enough to kind of get a
feel around it and a lot more space and

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.419
you'd expect despite the fact that the
Huracan looks so low to the ground from

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:44.280
the outside while Lamborghinis flagship
aventador could set you back more than

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.780
half a million dollars

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.709
the Huracan which replaces the guy our
dough is a much more affordable car here

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.709
starting around two hundred and
thirty-five thousand dollars that's a

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.280
better price point for a lot of people
and i gotta say this car will turn just

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.060
as many heads
