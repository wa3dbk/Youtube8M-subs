00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.910
 in Paraguay we have always read it 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.910
 try a finite earth to support an infinite project 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.579
 the thesis of capitalism 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:10.509
 the infinite development 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.399
 of a destructive model let's accept it 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:15.219
 then we ask ourselves 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.529
 what could we expect from Copenhagen 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.439
 just this simple confession 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.739
 just as we are we can not continue 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.140
 and a simple purpose let's change course 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.949
 let's do it 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.810
 but without cynicism without a lie 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.820
 no fold agenda without document came out to speak out of nowhere 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.240
 With the truth in front 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.130
 even when we ask ourselves from venezuela lord president ladies 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.900
 Sirs 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.920
 until when are we going to allow 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.430
 such injustices and inequalities 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.630
 until when are we going to tolerate the act of the current economic order 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.069
 international 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:52.370
 and the current market mechanisms 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.550
 until when are we going to allow 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.800
 what big epidemics like the AIDS byh devastate entire populations 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.450
 until when are we going to allow the hungry can not feed and 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.510
 feed their own children until when are we going to allow them to continue 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.510
 millions of children dying from curable diseases 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.549
 until when are we going to allow armed conflicts 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.909
 who massacre millions of human beings 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.909
 innocent in order to appropriate the powerful from the resources of others 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.080
 villages 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.510
 cease aggression and war 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.820
 we ask the peoples of the world 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.230
 stay period 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.470
 to those who want to continue to dominate the world and exploit 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.290
 no more imperial military bases 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.020
 no coups d'etat 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.150
 let's build a fairer and more equitable social economic order 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.090
 let's eradicate poverty 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.310
 Let's stop the high emission levels immediately 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.159
 stop the environmental deterioration and avoid the great catastrophe of change 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:52.990
 climate 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.070
 I integrated mono into the noble objective 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.310
 to be all more free unsupported Mr. President 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.020
 almost two centuries ago 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.000
 a universal Venezuelan 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.280
 liberator nations and precursor of consciences 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.929
 left for posterity 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.649
 a full apothegm of will 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.099
 if nature is opposed 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.069
 we will fight against it 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.459
 and we will make him obey us 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.049
 It was Simon Bolivar 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.719
 the Liberator 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.329
 from the Bolivarian venezuela 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.329
 where a day like today by the way ten years ago 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:29.129
 ten years act we live 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.139
 the biggest climatic tragedy in our history 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.069
 the tragedy of vargas and call 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.489
 from that Venezuela whose revolution tries to conquer justice for everything 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.379
 His town 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.379
 only possible through the path of socialism 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.999
 socialism 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:53.179
 the other ghost that spoke Carlos carlos who walks around there also 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.599
 marlene common against ghost 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.719
 socialism is already on course 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.309
 is on the path to the salvation of the planet I have no doubt 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.309
 and capitalism the road to hell to the destruction of the world 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.079
 socialism 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.859
 from that venezuela that faces for it 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.859
 the threat of the American empire 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.879
 from the countries that make up the Bolivarian alliance 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.419
 we encourage 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.189
 I want with respect 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.619
 but from my soul exhort 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.189
 on behalf of many on this planet 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:30.669
 we encourage 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.639
 to the governments and the peoples of the earth 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.799
 To paraphrase Simón Bolívar, the Liberator 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.629
 if the destructive nature 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.359
 of capitalism is opposed 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.259
 so let's fight against it 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:46.539
 and let us escape 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:49.539
 do not wait idly for the death of humanity 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:53.789
 History calls us to union and struggle 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:56.750
 if capitalism resists 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.610
 we are obliged to give the battle against capitalism and open 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.109
 the ways of the salvation of the human species 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.589
 it is our turn 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:07.119
 raising the flag 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:09.229
 described by mahoma 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:11.869
 of equality of love of justice 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:13.629
 of humanism 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.969
 of true and deeper humanism 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.009
 if we did not do it 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.489
 the most wonderful creation of the universe 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.830
 the human being 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.120
 will disappear 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.249
 will disappear 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.249
 this planet has billions of year 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.090
 and I say 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.210
 this planet 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.300
 thousands of miles of millions of years signs another the human species 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.610
 that is, we do not need him to have him 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.069
 now we on earth do not live 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:49.789
 and we are destroying 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.740
 the pachamama as it says something 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.740
 as our brother says aborigines of suramérica 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:58.529
 finally Mr. President already to finish 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.499
 today we give 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:04.949
 today we give fidel Castro when he said 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.169
 a species is in danger of extinction 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.939
 the man 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:13.029
 today we give rose luxembourg when he said 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:14.729
 socialism 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.409
 o'barry marie 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:21.139
 today we give Christ the redeemer when he said blessed the poor 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.419
 because of them will be 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.969
 the kingdom of heaven 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.520
 Mr. president 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.180

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.490
 it will not be taken by humanity 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.300
 let's make this earth a heaven 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.479
 a heaven of life of peace 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.620
 and of peace demand 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.509

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:45.759
 for the human species 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.129
