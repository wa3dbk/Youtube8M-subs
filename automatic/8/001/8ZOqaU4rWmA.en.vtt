so<00:00:01.589> while<00:00:01.829> we're<00:00:02.010> letting<00:00:02.159> this<00:00:02.550> board<00:00:03.240> cool

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
so while we're letting this board cool

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.030 
so while we're letting this board cool
down<00:00:03.750> now<00:00:04.370> before<00:00:05.370> we<00:00:05.730> put<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.120> over<00:00:06.919> just<00:00:07.919> a

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
down now before we put it over just a

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.290 
down now before we put it over just a
little<00:00:08.540> deal<00:00:09.540> here<00:00:10.050> where<00:00:10.950> I'm<00:00:11.400> going<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.120> go

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
little deal here where I'm going to go

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.240 
little deal here where I'm going to go
in<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.889> explain<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> few<00:00:14.190> things<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:15.619> we<00:00:16.619> have<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
in to explain a few things I we have the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.010 
in to explain a few things I we have the
board<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:17.940> worked<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.330> up<00:00:18.539> here<00:00:18.810> and

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
board that we just worked on up here and

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.359 
board that we just worked on up here and
then<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.650> have<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:20.359> secondary<00:00:21.359> board<00:00:21.750> here<00:00:22.369> now

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
then we have a secondary board here now

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.040 
then we have a secondary board here now
this<00:00:23.730> secondary<00:00:24.150> board<00:00:24.510> came<00:00:24.720> from<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
this secondary board came from a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.130 
this secondary board came from a
computer<00:00:25.560> store<00:00:25.859> that's<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:27.029> locally<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.689> us

6150 chipset on it but what you can tell
is<00:00:50.809> if<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.989> look<00:00:52.199> at<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.360> discoloration

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
is if you look at it the discoloration

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.619 
is if you look at it the discoloration
on<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.399> then<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.610> heat<00:00:56.879> pattern<00:00:57.390> up

actually heated up and can't really tell

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.290 
actually heated up and can't really tell
in<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.920> video<00:02:36.150> but<00:02:37.150> there's<00:02:37.390> actually<00:02:39.300> solder

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
in the video but there's actually solder

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.070 
in the video but there's actually solder
right<00:02:40.630> here

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
right here

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.310 
right here
traces<00:02:41.770> of<00:02:41.800> solder<00:02:42.160> being<00:02:42.489> pulled<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.320> those

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
traces of solder being pulled and those

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.680 
traces of solder being pulled and those
solder<00:02:44.680> traces<00:02:45.250> they're<00:02:45.459> pulled<00:02:45.820> that<00:02:46.330> means

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
solder traces they're pulled that means

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.780 
solder traces they're pulled that means
that<00:02:46.900> these<00:02:47.050> capacitors<00:02:47.830> these<00:02:48.220> are<00:02:48.489> here

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
that these capacitors these are here

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.020 
that these capacitors these are here
capacitors<00:02:49.680> were<00:02:50.680> actually<00:02:51.340> blown<00:02:51.730> off<00:02:52.000> the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
capacitors were actually blown off the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.220 
capacitors were actually blown off the
board<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.840> blown<00:02:53.560> off<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:53.860> here<00:02:55.019> but<00:02:56.019> these

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
board and blown off of here but these

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.670 
board and blown off of here but these
are<00:02:56.440> also<00:02:56.590> capacitors<00:02:57.489> right<00:02:57.670> here<00:02:58.680> resistors

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
are also capacitors right here resistors

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.340 
are also capacitors right here resistors
and<00:02:59.860> capacitors<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.760> anyway<00:03:01.750> those<00:03:02.080> could

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
and capacitors and anyway those could

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.190 
and capacitors and anyway those could
have<00:03:02.380> been<00:03:02.500> blown<00:03:02.860> off<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.750> when<00:03:04.750> that's<00:03:04.900> done

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
have been blown off and when that's done

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.259 
have been blown off and when that's done
you<00:03:05.500> might<00:03:06.310> as<00:03:06.459> well<00:03:06.580> kiss<00:03:06.850> your<00:03:07.060> board

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
you might as well kiss your board

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.620 
you might as well kiss your board
goodbye<00:03:07.630> because<00:03:08.050> that's<00:03:08.320> not<00:03:08.560> going<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:09.010> work

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
goodbye because that's not going to work

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.520 
goodbye because that's not going to work
you<00:03:10.800> can't<00:03:11.800> fix<00:03:12.100> that<00:03:12.930> unless<00:03:13.930> you're<00:03:14.320> going

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
you can't fix that unless you're going

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.150 
you can't fix that unless you're going
in<00:03:14.769> there<00:03:14.920> with<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.130> pair<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.459> tweezers<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:17.160> an

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
in there with a pair of tweezers and an

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.960 
in there with a pair of tweezers and an
overhead<00:03:18.640> light<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.269> you<00:03:20.110> have<00:03:20.970> capacitors

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
overhead light and you have capacitors

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.210 
overhead light and you have capacitors
and<00:03:22.299> you're<00:03:22.930> planning<00:03:23.200> on<00:03:23.380> doing<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:23.799> by<00:03:23.950> hand

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
and you're planning on doing it by hand

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.229 
and you're planning on doing it by hand
or<00:03:24.930> does<00:03:25.930> that<00:03:25.959> other<00:03:26.500> because<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:28.030> won't

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
or does that other because you won't

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.449 
or does that other because you won't
even<00:03:28.420> know<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:28.750> it's<00:03:29.140> gone<00:03:29.380> once<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.190> start

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
even know that it's gone once you start

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.640 
even know that it's gone once you start
blowing<00:03:30.730> them<00:03:30.970> off<00:03:33.120> but<00:03:34.120> that's<00:03:34.299> actually<00:03:34.650> how

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
blowing them off but that's actually how

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.470 
blowing them off but that's actually how
you<00:03:35.709> can<00:03:36.010> tell<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.280> difference<00:03:36.850> say<00:03:37.420> if

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
you can tell the difference say if

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.170 
you can tell the difference say if
you're<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.900> repair<00:03:38.350> shop<00:03:38.380> or<00:03:39.070> if<00:03:39.790> you're<00:03:40.030> an

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
you're a repair shop or if you're an

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
you're a repair shop or if you're an
actual<00:03:41.730> person<00:03:42.730> doing<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.209> or<00:03:43.420> if<00:03:44.019> you're

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
actual person doing it or if you're

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.759 
actual person doing it or if you're
planning<00:03:44.500> on<00:03:44.769> using<00:03:45.160> hot<00:03:46.150> air<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.510> do<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.930> not

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
planning on using hot air to do that not

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.210 
planning on using hot air to do that not
a<00:03:47.829> great<00:03:48.100> idea<00:03:48.750> not<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.900> best<00:03:50.079> thing<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.320> do<00:03:50.620> I

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
a great idea not the best thing to do I

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.729 
a great idea not the best thing to do I
won't<00:03:51.850> do<00:03:52.090> it<00:03:52.239> personally<00:03:52.750> just<00:03:53.440> for<00:03:53.680> the

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
won't do it personally just for the

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.580 
won't do it personally just for the
simple<00:03:54.010> fact<00:03:54.070> of<00:03:54.400> what<00:03:54.579> happens<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.530> this<00:03:56.530> is

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
simple fact of what happens and this is

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.480 
simple fact of what happens and this is
how<00:03:56.860> you<00:03:56.920> can<00:03:57.190> tell<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.459> difference

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.900 

just<00:04:02.300> to<00:04:02.800> help<00:04:03.800> with<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.100> video<00:04:04.370> I<00:04:04.460> just<00:04:04.610> made

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
just to help with the video I just made

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.640 
just to help with the video I just made
I<00:04:05.620> actually<00:04:07.210> I'm<00:04:08.210> doing<00:04:08.570> a<00:04:08.600> close-up<00:04:08.990> on<00:04:09.350> this

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
I actually I'm doing a close-up on this

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.790 
I actually I'm doing a close-up on this
chipset<00:04:12.650> so<00:04:12.920> if<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.090> can<00:04:14.270> tell<00:04:14.740> hopefully<00:04:15.740> I

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
chipset so if you can tell hopefully I

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.270 
chipset so if you can tell hopefully I
won't<00:04:16.100> vibrate<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:17.239> too<00:04:17.450> much<00:04:17.980> that's<00:04:18.980> what

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
won't vibrate this too much that's what

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.390 
won't vibrate this too much that's what
I<00:04:19.340> was<00:04:19.550> talking<00:04:19.790> about<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.600> broken<00:04:21.500> jack<00:04:22.010> and

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
I was talking about the broken jack and

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.940 
I was talking about the broken jack and
then<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.330> streaking<00:04:23.750> here<00:04:24.260> you<00:04:24.410> can<00:04:24.620> see<00:04:24.830> it

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
then the streaking here you can see it

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.600 
then the streaking here you can see it
coming<00:04:25.280> off<00:04:26.320> so<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.500> streaking<00:04:27.890> coming<00:04:28.430> off

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
coming off so the streaking coming off

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.560 
coming off so the streaking coming off
the<00:04:29.320> thing<00:04:30.320> or<00:04:30.560> disorders<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:31.430> is<00:04:32.330> the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
the thing or disorders that is the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
the thing or disorders that is the
actual<00:04:32.930> damage<00:04:33.230> that<00:04:33.710> was<00:04:33.830> talking<00:04:34.280> about
