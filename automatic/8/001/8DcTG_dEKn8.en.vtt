torque<00:00:08.400> drill<00:00:08.639> we're<00:00:09.210> going<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.389> use<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.570> stick

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
torque drill we're going to use a stick

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.709 
torque drill we're going to use a stick
if<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.469> have<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> wiffle<00:00:10.950> ball<00:00:11.099> bat<00:00:11.340> or<00:00:11.639> a

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
if you have a wiffle ball bat or a

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.999 
if you have a wiffle ball bat or a
thunder<00:00:12.719> stick<00:00:12.960> or<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> hit<00:00:13.320> stick<00:00:13.559> anything

thunder stick or a hit stick anything

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.350 
thunder stick or a hit stick anything
that's<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.280> little<00:00:14.460> bit<00:00:14.610> lighter<00:00:14.820> than<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.059> bat

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
that's a little bit lighter than a bat

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.290 
that's a little bit lighter than a bat
is<00:00:15.809> going<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.049> work<00:00:16.230> real<00:00:16.500> well<00:00:16.680> initially

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
is going to work real well initially

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.130 
is going to work real well initially
show<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:18.720> get<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.930> most

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
show you that you can get the most

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.960 
show you that you can get the most
amount<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.500> repetitions<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.609> shortest

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
amount of repetitions in the shortest

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.990 
amount of repetitions in the shortest
amount<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.240> time<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.050> won't<00:00:22.230> get<00:00:22.410> fatigue

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
amount of time and you won't get fatigue

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.370 
amount of time and you won't get fatigue
so<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.090> have<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> Swift<00:00:24.539> sticks<00:00:24.779> here<00:00:25.019> we're

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
so we have the Swift sticks here we're

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.259 
so we have the Swift sticks here we're
gonna<00:00:25.470> get<00:00:25.710> into<00:00:25.980> our<00:00:26.130> torque<00:00:26.430> position<00:00:26.939> again

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
gonna get into our torque position again

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.790 
gonna get into our torque position again

we're gonna have a nice good bat angle

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.370 
we're gonna have a nice good bat angle
we<00:01:05.640> don't<00:01:05.820> want<00:01:06.000> our<00:01:06.030> bat<00:01:06.240> pointing<00:01:06.689> away<00:01:06.990> we

gonna do now is the same thing as the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.050 
gonna do now is the same thing as the
torque<00:01:13.500> drill<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.920> hands<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.939> we're

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
torque drill with the hands but we're

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.160 
torque drill with the hands but we're
just<00:01:15.090> gonna<00:01:15.270> rotate

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
just gonna rotate

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.499 
just gonna rotate
lift<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> elbow<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> knob<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
lift the elbow so that the knob of the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.649 
lift the elbow so that the knob of the
bat<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:19.350> pointing<00:01:19.890> slightly<00:01:20.070> up<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.479> bat

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
bat is pointing slightly up and the bat

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.320 
bat is pointing slightly up and the bat
is<00:01:21.869> still<00:01:22.140> against<00:01:22.500> our<00:01:22.650> shoulder<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:24.090> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
is still against our shoulder this is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.850 
is still against our shoulder this is
really<00:01:24.630> important<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.439> want<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.680> make

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
really important because we want to make

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.999 
really important because we want to make
sure<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.850> rotate<00:01:27.479> our<00:01:27.829> hands<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
sure that we rotate our hands to the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.510 
sure that we rotate our hands to the
ball<00:01:29.600> not<00:01:30.600> throw<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.259> bat<00:01:31.439> away<00:01:31.920> from<00:01:32.400> our

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
ball not throw the bat away from our

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.179 
ball not throw the bat away from our
body<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.869> closer<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.409> keep<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> bat<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.159> your

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
body the closer you keep the bat to your

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.340 
body the closer you keep the bat to your
shoulder<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.450> better<00:01:36.659> off<00:01:36.840> your<00:01:37.020> swing<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
shoulder the better off your swing is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.230 
shoulder the better off your swing is
gonna<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.729> power<00:01:38.970> you're<00:01:39.119> gonna

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
gonna be the more power you're gonna

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.510 
gonna be the more power you're gonna
have<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.079> you're<00:01:40.439> gonna<00:01:40.530> maintain<00:01:40.770> balance<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
have and you're gonna maintain balance a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.109 
have and you're gonna maintain balance a
lot<00:01:41.640> better<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.780> again<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.380> rotate<00:01:44.119> we're

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
lot better so again as you rotate we're

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.200 
lot better so again as you rotate we're
gonna<00:01:45.210> rotate<00:01:45.799> front<00:01:46.799> elbow<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.220> naba<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.030> bat

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
gonna rotate front elbow up naba the bat

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.729 
gonna rotate front elbow up naba the bat
pulling<00:01:48.689> forward<00:01:48.990> bat<00:01:49.649> against<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> shoulder
