00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
where Haven is going to be heading I

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.759 
where Haven is going to be heading I
think<00:00:12.059> it's<00:00:12.179> gonna<00:00:12.269> be<00:00:12.420> interesting<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:13.650> know

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
think it's gonna be interesting you know

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.390 
think it's gonna be interesting you know
in<00:00:14.040> terms<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.490> my<00:00:14.549> character<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.210> think<00:00:15.540> I'm

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
in terms of my character I think I'm

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.010 
in terms of my character I think I'm
slowly<00:00:17.400> starting<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:18.090> hopefully<00:00:18.690> be<00:00:18.810> able<00:00:18.900> to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
slowly starting to hopefully be able to

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.380 
slowly starting to hopefully be able to
unveil<00:00:19.230> some<00:00:19.859> some<00:00:20.279> depth<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.970> character

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
unveil some some depth to the character

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.740 
unveil some some depth to the character
that<00:00:21.590> and<00:00:22.590> some<00:00:22.800> layers<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:24.210> know<00:00:24.330> none

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
that and some layers that you know none

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.970 
that and some layers that you know none
of<00:00:24.779> us<00:00:24.930> really<00:00:25.230> knew<00:00:25.380> we're<00:00:25.529> gonna<00:00:25.619> be<00:00:25.800> there

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
of us really knew we're gonna be there

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.250 
of us really knew we're gonna be there
because<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.340> think<00:00:26.490> initially<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.869> character

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
because I think initially the character

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.689 
because I think initially the character
of<00:00:28.320> Dwight<00:00:28.619> was<00:00:28.830> kind<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.130> collapsible

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
of Dwight was kind of collapsible

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.359 
of Dwight was kind of collapsible
because<00:00:29.970> no<00:00:30.150> one<00:00:30.330> no<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:30.990> knew<00:00:31.199> if<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.279> was

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
because no one no one knew if I was

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.130 
because no one no one knew if I was
gonna<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.700> able<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.180> no<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.750> didn't

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
gonna be able to do this no I didn't

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.459 
gonna be able to do this no I didn't
know

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469
