 i the novelty that has that is that it is a the browser 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:22.179
 but with the difference that it plays flash videos is not a matter of those tasks 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.309

 a porn video work 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.680
 record the money 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 I do not know what 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.140
 in that area 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.579
 that they do not have 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:59.749
 read and 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.510
 within a previous symbol a single trick 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.400
 in alepo apple- 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.370
 then let's go 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.000
 there the cape carel willink of this page 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.470
 list 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.190
 we touch make the erection 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.750
 we leave the finger tight so we appear select all 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.610
 we select all the ing and we put copy 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.910
 we are going 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.180
 dt application 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.780
 we go pasqui fails 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.730
 One of Javier Aresti Fader is going to get a little sign saying that he detected 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.790
 the program that they have copied an internet address 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.240
 and if they want to paste it into the program to open that page in good law that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.980
 he allows it 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.210
 and opens the page again d &amp; s network 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.040
 and maybe he's pulling 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.400
 the old cities there is a page on the internet and tony tucker 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.399
 mirotic and now yes saleh 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.319
 and if from a job 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.319
 I'm going to look for this same one and edited 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:22.069
 the caste 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.479
 has less merit of orders 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:26.439
 and if he touched it, nothing happens 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:31.409
 but every Wednesday a page in flash appears here in this button all 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.859
 that touched 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.279
 who in fact right on this page is only this video 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.649
 so this Monday goes out 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:42.909
 I touch it 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.049
 and I'm playing 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.049
 thing to get away and not being able to do it 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:54.749
 I will miss you 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.759
 it was found as if they had 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.669
 in applications of 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.179
 although this one is already and how good I'm going to go 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.609
 of the video 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.879
 good pa is that min program so is enciso is 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:16.319
 here I have a very similar to safari evo more Thessaloniki we hurt extend 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.359
 investigate if he could care more about safari wolves and put them on 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.569
 program was noticed followed 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.599
 to put more pages have several pages simultaneously and return safari 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.779
 good and beautiful and sciences 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.779
 and yes with milestones 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:41.169
 we will explore back to him he is not interested and that is to share the page on cd 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.249
 other things 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:46.400
 but its internet peers is very saturated 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.179
 the service is that transcends the page in the program this one 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.349
 and it seems that it does not go at all and everything is still fine 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.389
 this seems like to have patience 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:01.789
 for example, they rang for another page 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:06.869
 in which 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:09.869
 for example there are things to notice 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:15.609
 so whoever is not alarmed only apparently works for whatever they are 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:16.459
 videos 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.709
 in flash 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.820
 everything for whatever applications ccoo games in flash does not work 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.569
 that is to say that this application 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.520
 and apparently this is a police 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.370
 these things are advertising 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.370
 also appears the blue square of death 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.990
 so 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.360
 in terms absolutely everything 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.430
 that you could visualize is an obligation unfortunately 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.059
 there are not some things that are lost 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:47.050
 but good 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.729
 inside everything 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.750
 you can not do that it leaves it installed may and in which it is installed 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:53.599
 application 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.599
 do not be something that we can not do imminent publication 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.430
 occasional and debit by air 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.339
 can visualize 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:04.949
 but it still works 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.229
 and well that would be all 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.629
 out there I hope it has served you are not approximate 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:11.169
 see you later
