00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.659
 which means 2 means old or 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.520
 for old devices that have more 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.939
 or less like 512 mb of ram 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.789
 of which can not be done 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:23.439
 infinite but also going to have 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:26.619
 worlds not infinite but a little more 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.750
 great of what are now ok a little 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.719
 bigger not infinite for the 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.719
 devices for example with 512 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:37.329
 megabytes of memory as I tell them how 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.670
 for my iphone 4 can not stand worlds 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.350
 infinities possibly for ipod 4 and 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.299
 all those devices and good people 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.209
 the infinite worlds are more or less 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.720
 for those who have the devices with 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:53.049
 more memory of the bouquet ok as for example 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.959
 from 800 mb up 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.450
 a giga are for these devices not 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:00.849
 since the update but that down 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.239
 It is not enough for the 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:06.670
 devices with very little ram memory ok 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:09.099
 so good people we went to the new one 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.049
