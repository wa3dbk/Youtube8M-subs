00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.970
 the first range rover appeared in 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.530
 1970 late 2012 is more than 40 years after 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.120
 land rover launched its fourth 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.530
 range rover generation that want to 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.400
 the ultimate in 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.500
 luxury carcasses 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.029
 the new version now reaches 5 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.070
 meters long but its height goes down to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.600
 1 m 84 enough to fit in easily 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.699
 in the car parks the French range 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.789
 offers a petrol 510 v8 or 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.949
 diesel well of 258 all 339 horsepower 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.869
 it's the most powerful diesel a v8 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.239
 that we try associated with a finish 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.219
 high-end autobiography with in 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.380
 so impressive red option of 22 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.910
 points this new range rover makes strong 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.230
 impression as soon as one climbs aboard 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.030
 ubiquitous leather rises to the top of the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.620
 dashboard and counterports on the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.399
 flag sky and in alcantara and the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.079
 thick carpet 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.850
 the luxury is obvious but the orders 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.469
 stay clear and simple the screen 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.000
 central contains a multitude of settings 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.500
 whose type of massage you 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.640
 want it has a function 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.469
 split screen 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.629
 the passenger does not see the same thing 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.070
 that the driver and rear passenger 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.390
 are also pampered with their own 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.850
 clean heated seats and plenty of it 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.229
 pass the opening chest obviously 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.760
 electric is gigantic 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.369
 compared to the previous generation 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.290
 this one has lost more than 300 kilos but 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.780
 our big baby weighs more than two 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.560
 tons three diesel v8 assaults and its 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.270
 huge couple 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.640
 it accelerates loudly and the sound of the same v8 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.350
 diesel is nice this engine seems 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.799
 tireless and easily revive even at 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.110
 high speed 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.920
 despite the huge 22-inch wheels the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.990
 comfort is simply 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.270
 impressive as much by the sweetness of 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.860
 suspensions only for silence and even 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.450
 if he does not take too much roll this is 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.710
 we normally put more to 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.590
 scion highways only on small roads 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.240
 sinuous 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.159
 not to mention the off-road where go 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.539
 turns out to be a true adventurer much more 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.880
 capable in crossing that most 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.140
 suv but we wonder who is there 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.880
 to cross with such 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.350
 not very well protected 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.990
 bodywork and especially considering the price 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.479
 our high-end model costs 1,621 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.829
 1500 euros off options a budget 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.060
 Pharaonic but it is true that 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.700
 overall benefits of this new 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.530
 range are impressive at least the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.130
 new red costs 90 thousand euros with 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.530
 the diesel v6 in finish hse and x5 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.399
 cayenne q7 and other jld it's almost 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.399
 low cost next
