00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.740
 to bring in reviews I am marios presents 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.849
 of the house ok cities your model and travel 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.730
 62 the second version as you see belt 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.770
 with an ergonomic cut look at this 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.169
 from here it looks clearer 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.480
 looking to give greater support to what 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.029
 It would be the bottle and with a technology 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.070
 the airbag control this you see here 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.720
 this technology here what does 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.669
 is to generate an air chamber all this 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.860
 that we have here to isolate this 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.260
 bottle and give us much more comfort in 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.789
 the area where we carry the greatest weight that 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.340
 would be the area where we take the 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:44.030
 I'll hydration to agree and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.430
 teach a little bit how it goes 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.610
 the bottle should be centered in agreement 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.620
 to some models that goes on one side with 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.329
 the other with locke city is recommended 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.239
 take it completely focused on the 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.899
 back so as we see are two 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.780
 Velcro tapes easy to put 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.820
 we regulate second tape to give more 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.030
 subjection and we can also play with the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.920
 another side to finish regulating it to 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.740
 our body once is the double 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.869
 tape we have to look that we have the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.840
 centered belt the bottle centered 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.850
 with your back and we have here all the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.740
 things I will explain to you 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.110
 handle it in an easy way let's see 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.820
 first the front part first 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.350
 everything to carry the number on many 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.789
 races we want to take the number 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.220
 we have a good belt so here 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.590
 we have a system that are two magnets 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.020
 stronger than what they seek is to catch 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.060
 the number without having to hook 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.460
 no way and I can take it in the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.380
 front then this bag here 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.759
 that we have we can move it with the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.800
 which is taken with a velcro we can 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.080
 put and remove also closes with the 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.540
 same system 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.950
 and what you are looking for is to leave here the 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.720
 waste all the food that we 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.700
 we are eating the gels everything 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.350
 we carry what we can deposit here has 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.390
 the opening at the bottom for 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.530
 that is going out and also this of 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.360
 this part of here is completely 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.880
 washable once we got home now the 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.479
 we go and it's not always full of what 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.530
 remains of the gels back 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.940
 pocket as we had the one of 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.540
 in front we have the one from behind but be 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.120
 intended to carry full gels worth 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.820
 fix and also close with the system 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.930
 of magnet then on this side and in the 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.970
 another one we have this this tape and this rubber 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.800
 elastic to hold the sticks ie 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.230
 this belt allows us to carry 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.070
 sticks when we went out to train in this 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.100
 side we have the same thing and also 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.110
 includes to be able to hook here two 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.720
 gels for example we could take the 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.100
 that are open we can leave them here 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.090
 until we finish them instead of 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.440
 we have to carry that with the garbage 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.240
 We can see it here or those who are 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.490
 closed we can take two things here 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.010
 hanging finally curious detail 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.510
 curious in a belt in this part of 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.939
 here set 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.739
 incorporates the thermal blanket is worth so 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.769
 if we go running here we will take a 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.290
 plus protection included here too 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.670
 has a built-in bottom 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.950
 which is also mandatory in many 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.740
 racing for safety the whistle in this 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.620
 part to notice here we arrived he 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.610
 the whistle in case we need assistance or 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.530
 to be located then what you 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.200
 said this the thermal blanket and the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.200
 Finally, the bottle was shown to you 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.600
 support that carries here an elastic band 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.580
 600 milliliter cut hard 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.100
 to give you greater support easy to put 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.980
 we do not have to be working to put and 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.230
 We close with the rubber around the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.450
 nozzle so that it does not move us is 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.540
 say that the belt is and weighs 320 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.870
 grams all complete is worth 600 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.840
 milliliters of water capacity the brand 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.510
 says that up to 50 kilometers that 5 hours 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.920
 of training good here we have something 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.570
 more than half a liter of water this 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.250
 it will depend on the person of the time very 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.870
 of competition to carry the clubs 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.420
 to be able to get almost the minimum material 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.430
 here kept in agreement dorsal all 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.070
 thought to be able to take it here and 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.420
 also everything full of holes and what of the 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.560
 thermal blanket that really is a 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.510
 detail that we had not seen until 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.390
 now in the belts and that's coming 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.770
 already included in stoke city if travel 62
