interesting to see if that's true and if

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.700 
interesting to see if that's true and if
this<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.369> next<00:01:47.670> big<00:01:48.060> step<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.720> in

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
this is the next big step in in

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.340 
this is the next big step in in
artificial<00:01:50.520> intelligence<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:51.630> if

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
artificial intelligence and if

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
it's a headset that kind of looks like

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.110 
it's a headset that kind of looks like
something<00:03:48.180> from<00:03:48.799> Star<00:03:49.799> Trek<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.340> gob<00:03:50.519> you

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
something from Star Trek the gob you

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.300 
something from Star Trek the gob you
know<00:03:51.269> from<00:03:51.989> reading<00:03:52.200> rainbow<00:03:52.650> what<00:03:52.920> he<00:03:53.040> wore

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.789 
know from reading rainbow what he wore
except<00:03:54.239> this<00:03:54.389> maybe<00:03:54.660> looks<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.470> little<00:03:55.650> bit

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
except this maybe looks a little bit

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.699 
except this maybe looks a little bit
cooler<00:03:56.480> so<00:03:57.480> they<00:03:57.780> said<00:03:58.019> in<00:03:58.230> research<00:03:58.650> and

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
cooler so they said in research and

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.680 
cooler so they said in research and
development<00:03:58.799> that<00:03:59.340> is<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.760> does<00:04:00.239> have<00:04:00.450> head

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
development that is it does have head

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.780 
development that is it does have head
tracking<00:04:00.989> they're<00:04:01.290> working<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.459> playing

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
tracking they're working and playing

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.250 
tracking they're working and playing
around<00:04:03.000> with<00:04:03.359> it<00:04:03.510> with<00:04:03.690> several<00:04:03.989> different

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
around with it with several different

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.330 
around with it with several different
dates<00:04:04.410> including<00:04:04.950> first-person<00:04:05.519> shooters<00:04:05.880> so

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
dates including first-person shooters so

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.180 
dates including first-person shooters so
and<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.549> is<00:04:08.730> 3d<00:04:09.389> apparently<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:10.260> this<00:04:10.980> could<00:04:11.130> be

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
and it is 3d apparently so this could be

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.340 
and it is 3d apparently so this could be
the<00:04:11.489> next<00:04:11.730> system<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.209> course<00:04:12.420> Tony<00:04:12.660> they<00:04:13.230> have

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
the next system of course Tony they have

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.050 
the next system of course Tony they have
several<00:04:13.739> games<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:14.160> are<00:04:14.280> 3d<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.910> they've
