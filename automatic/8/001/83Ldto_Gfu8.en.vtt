going to be dexterity and tactical mass

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.260 
going to be dexterity and tactical mass
so<00:03:21.630> I<00:03:21.660> run<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.620> wild<00:03:22.890> card<00:03:23.100> perk<00:03:23.490> 3<00:03:23.790> greed<00:03:24.060> on

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
so I run the wild card perk 3 greed on

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.110 
so I run the wild card perk 3 greed on
the<00:03:24.810> preferred<00:03:25.320> class<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.890> do<00:03:26.220> run<00:03:26.550> dexterity
