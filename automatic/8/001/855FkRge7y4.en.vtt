00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
or picture mode which is really handy

now<00:01:02.010> do<00:01:02.070> note<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.570> switching<00:01:03.570> between<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
now do note that switching between the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.170 
now do note that switching between the
front<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.589> rear<00:01:04.739> camera<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.460> seems<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.790> be

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
front and rear camera there seems to be

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.149 
front and rear camera there seems to be
some<00:01:06.659> lag<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.350> sometimes<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.979> this

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
some lag and I sometimes get this

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.070 
some lag and I sometimes get this
flashing<00:01:08.610> back<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.240> forth<00:01:09.479> between<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.900> two

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
flashing back and forth between the two

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.260 
flashing back and forth between the two
I<00:01:10.260> think<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.100> might<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.490> Bluetooth<00:01:11.909> issue

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
I think it might be a Bluetooth issue

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.920 
I think it might be a Bluetooth issue
between<00:01:12.630> my<00:01:12.960> phone<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:14.180> SmartWatch<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.900> I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
