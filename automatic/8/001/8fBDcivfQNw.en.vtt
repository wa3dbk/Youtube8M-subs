00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.960
 gold located this motorcycle story this is a 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.130
 sport that takes place on the slopes of 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.340
 his mother 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.310
 it's four rounds four drivers the 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.039
 endless motorbikes its engine speed 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.170
 Peugeot 106 cubic meters methanol and 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.059
 its four towers shaped the 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.059
 speeds around 120 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.170
 you are a lot of contacts a lot 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.830
 adrenaline and it's really hard 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.830
 mentally 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.220
 a race and its measurements and its 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.040
 quarterback matches just back two 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.900
 semifinals and a final so the 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.340
 starts and starts stopped with rubber band 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.890
 ie savior of bullshit 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.600
 prohibition to move and after his 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.800
 four rounds where everything was allowed on 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.590
 will not let him contact to make 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.240
 fall and we just have a white line to 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.460
 do not overtake had the rear wheel 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.700
 after that's all we have is four 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.170
 thoroughly tours like airlines excused this is 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.810
 typically a gliding sport is so 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.360
 why because we have 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.890
 very powerful engines and so we arrive 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.410
 without cutting the gas so the herod king 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.850
 patina so a thousand times you have everything 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.479
 your equipment your motorcycle so see 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.610
 enter the track 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.800
 you have to know that life goes off 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.390
 this sport by speed 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.820
 I must learn to know 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.140
 take a turn as you go 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.820
 you will be taking this bend your life 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.590
 it's good in all this is a 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.700
 question of patience and after you have 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.410
 settings to do 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.509
 once your list has come to me 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.520
 look for the speed and the speed is 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.929
 made with a lot of clouds 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.369
 if we can compare it is a little 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.039
 as a nurse was a lot of 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.229
 technicality at the motorcycle level must 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.280
 make the euro pressures back the 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.000
 reports etc 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.410
 the sprinklers but it's really easy 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.209
 once you understand the slide 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.039
 you have some stuff we can go 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.039
 quickly snapped up his other senses 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.959
 at the possible end withdrawal behind everything 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.239
 that like a story tour there are some 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.560
 risks so the main risks of 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.660
 this year will be done hit by a 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.120
 other pilot since we have no brake 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.800
 can not invite someone we also have 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.180
 the boards outside so sometimes 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.370
 we have you why we slide we can 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.930
 really hurt myself 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.060
 we have what the right foot position 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.080
 relatively straight so that too is 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.790
 dangerous since we can approach a 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.299
 pilot who is on the ground to improve 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.690
 security anyway we put some 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.400
 severe blows 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.709
 all around the boards and that makes that 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.239
 still we amortize after we have here 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.790
 also a circuit breaker since when we 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.160
 no charge if the motorcycle racing is 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.069
 tell and as a tomb which these lives 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.720
 it's the bike can not speed up or 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:01.750
 hit another another person 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:05.110
 hears for novice pilots getting 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.610
 to say already it's a sport not common but 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.720
 we must also say that it is really 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.040
 a huge sensation and a lot 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.079
 of adrenaline the screw is the fact of the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.799
 control one's body with their motorcycle 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.420
 and tour can get there it takes 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.660
 to really be when you have to know 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.670
 fly but it's open to all 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.799
 world you have to get in touch with 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.750
 the pilots we will welcome you by the 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.100
 social networks you will find us and
