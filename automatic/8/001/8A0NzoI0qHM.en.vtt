going on there at the moment but the
problem<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.520> was<00:02:55.850> sort<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.210> Army<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.810> hiring

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
problem I was sort of Army and hiring

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.070 
problem I was sort of Army and hiring
about<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.470> this<00:02:57.800> video<00:02:58.430> quality<00:02:58.760> on<00:02:59.090> the

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
about is this video quality on the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.050 
about is this video quality on the
vo-tech<00:03:00.890> one<00:03:01.100> didn't<00:03:01.370> seem<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:01.670> be<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:01.910> much

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
vo-tech one didn't seem to be that much

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.250 
vo-tech one didn't seem to be that much
better<00:03:02.240> than<00:03:02.360> this<00:03:02.510> one<00:03:02.690> but<00:03:02.840> then<00:03:02.960> I've<00:03:03.080> gone

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
better than this one but then I've gone

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.340 
better than this one but then I've gone
into<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.590> settings<00:03:03.980> over<00:03:04.190> here<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.900> found

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
into the settings over here and I found

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.100 
into the settings over here and I found
that<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.800> could<00:03:07.030> increase<00:03:08.030> this<00:03:08.510> all<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.080> way

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
that I could increase this all the way

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.980 
that I could increase this all the way
down<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.440> 1280<00:03:10.400> by<00:03:10.610> 720<00:03:11.000> that's<00:03:11.300> pretty<00:03:11.570> huge

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
down to 1280 by 720 that's pretty huge

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.590 
down to 1280 by 720 that's pretty huge
and<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:12.770> set<00:03:13.010> this<00:03:13.220> quality<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:13.970> excellent<00:03:14.420> i'm

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
and I set this quality the excellent i'm

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.760 
and I set this quality the excellent i'm
not<00:03:14.720> sure<00:03:14.900> what<00:03:15.020> this<00:03:15.140> constant<00:03:15.590> bit<00:03:15.739> rate

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
not sure what this constant bit rate

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.070 
not sure what this constant bit rate
doesn't<00:03:16.160> love<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.459> exactly<00:03:16.940> sure<00:03:17.360> how<00:03:17.930> that

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
doesn't love it exactly sure how that

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.479 
doesn't love it exactly sure how that
works<00:03:18.230> so<00:03:18.530> i<00:03:18.590> just<00:03:18.739> went<00:03:18.830> on<00:03:18.950> excellent

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
works so i just went on excellent

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.990 
works so i just went on excellent
quality<00:03:19.850> but<00:03:20.540> when<00:03:20.660> i<00:03:20.690> do<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:22.459> with<00:03:22.820> the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
quality but when i do that and with the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.070 
quality but when i do that and with the
smaller<00:03:23.330> settings<00:03:23.840> back<00:03:24.080> over<00:03:24.380> here<00:03:24.790> this

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
smaller settings back over here this

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.350 
smaller settings back over here this
camera<00:03:27.080> here<00:03:27.290> now<00:03:27.620> shows<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:27.980> much<00:03:28.550> see<00:03:28.940> all<00:03:29.180> the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
camera here now shows a much see all the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.390 
camera here now shows a much see all the
quality<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.080> woodwork<00:03:30.500> in<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.040> next<00:03:31.280> door

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
quality of the woodwork in the next door

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.870 
quality of the woodwork in the next door
neighbor<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:33.020> substantially<00:03:33.470> better<00:03:34.100> so

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
neighbor that is substantially better so

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.790 
neighbor that is substantially better so
i'm<00:03:35.120> thinking<00:03:35.150> i<00:03:35.780> might<00:03:35.870> stick<00:03:36.410> with<00:03:36.560> these

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
i'm thinking i might stick with these

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.360 
i'm thinking i might stick with these
cameras<00:03:37.400> rather<00:03:37.790> than<00:03:38.120> these<00:03:38.630> ones<00:03:38.959> but<00:03:39.800> yeah

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
cameras rather than these ones but yeah

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.430 
cameras rather than these ones but yeah
not<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.090> hundred<00:03:41.420> percent<00:03:41.540> sure<00:03:41.840> which<00:03:42.230> i'm

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
phone scam cameras got to be more

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.279

backlighting<00:05:26.140> to<00:05:26.680> light<00:05:26.890> things<00:05:27.100> up<00:05:27.340> but<00:05:28.289> even

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
backlighting to light things up but even

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.020 
backlighting to light things up but even

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
when I take this one around a bit more

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.830 
when I take this one around a bit more
it<00:05:32.310> gets<00:05:33.310> a<00:05:33.460> little<00:05:33.880> bit<00:05:34.150> more<00:05:34.270> color<00:05:34.570> in<00:05:34.660> it

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840

only not I would say the pitch quality
is<00:05:42.940> very<00:05:42.970> similar<00:05:43.960> on<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.620> two<00:05:44.830> cameras

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050

I think I mean the DB power one works
image<00:06:33.930> quality<00:06:34.140> is<00:06:34.380> very<00:06:34.980> very<00:06:35.970> similar<00:06:36.330> to

with the password settings that was just

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.720 
with the password settings that was just

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:52.730 
because I didn't know how to use it

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.040 
because I didn't know how to use it
whereas<00:06:53.730> the<00:06:53.910> DB<00:06:54.210> camera<00:06:54.570> doesn't<00:06:54.810> appear<00:06:55.020> to
