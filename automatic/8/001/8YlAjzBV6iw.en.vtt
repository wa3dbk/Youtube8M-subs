manufactured ski our philosophy is to

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.049 
manufactured ski our philosophy is to
build<00:01:03.110> schemes<00:01:03.500> going<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:03.949> hold<00:01:04.280> up<00:01:04.430> stand<00:01:04.940> the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
test of time the way do we do that is by

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.060 
test of time the way do we do that is by
using<00:01:07.640> small<00:01:08.570> batches<00:01:08.810> of<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:09.590> best<00:01:09.830> quality
