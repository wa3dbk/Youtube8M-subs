but<00:00:35.969> first<00:00:36.329> let's<00:00:36.870> cover<00:00:37.079> some<00:00:37.320> amazing<00:00:37.980> shark

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
but first let's cover some amazing shark

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.380 
but first let's cover some amazing shark
facts<00:00:39.530> like<00:00:40.530> did<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.219> most<00:00:41.760> sharks

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
facts like did you know that most sharks

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.990 
facts like did you know that most sharks
are<00:00:42.710> completely<00:00:43.710> harmless<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.280> humans

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
are completely harmless to humans

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.119 
are completely harmless to humans
and<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:47.129> first<00:00:47.430> sharks<00:00:48.030> were<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> ocean

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
and the first sharks were in the ocean

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.049 
and the first sharks were in the ocean
200<00:00:50.129> million<00:00:50.789> years<00:00:51.030> before<00:00:51.329> dinosaurs<00:00:53.059> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
200 million years before dinosaurs and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.110 
200 million years before dinosaurs and
although<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.629> don't<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.899> why<00:00:55.520> 90%<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.670> shark

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
although we don't know why 90% of shark

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.830 
although we don't know why 90% of shark
attacks<00:00:57.570> are<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.559> men

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
attacks are on men

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.750 
attacks are on men
that's<00:01:00.840> right<00:01:01.109> 90%<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> time<00:01:02.190> sharks<00:01:02.640> will

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that's right 90% of the time sharks will

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
that's right 90% of the time sharks will
bite<00:01:02.969> men<00:01:03.739> 100%<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.890> time<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.510> going<00:01:06.510> back

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
bite men 100% of the time but going back

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.200 
bite men 100% of the time but going back
to<00:01:06.840> our<00:01:07.110> original<00:01:07.200> photo<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.880> real

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
to our original photo this is a real

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.590 
to our original photo this is a real
type<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.840> shark<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.890> existed<00:01:11.520> millions<00:01:12.180> of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
type of shark that existed millions of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.370 
type of shark that existed millions of
years<00:01:12.840> ago<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.860> called<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.280> helicopter<00:01:14.490> young

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
years ago it's called a helicopter young

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.320 
years ago it's called a helicopter young
scientists<00:01:16.380> first<00:01:16.680> found<00:01:17.119> fossils<00:01:18.119> like

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
scientists first found fossils like

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.080 
scientists first found fossils like
these<00:01:18.950> but<00:01:19.950> because<00:01:20.340> sharks<00:01:20.670> don't<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
these but because sharks don't have a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.120 
these but because sharks don't have a
lot<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> bones<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:21.930> didn't<00:01:22.170> find<00:01:22.380> much<00:01:22.830> else

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
lot of bones they didn't find much else

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.039 
lot of bones they didn't find much else
and<00:01:23.460> they<00:01:24.000> had<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.299> piece<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.720> thing<00:01:24.900> together

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
and they had to piece the thing together

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.210 
and they had to piece the thing together
in<00:01:25.670> fact<00:01:26.670> here's<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.720> small<00:01:28.259> sample<00:01:29.009> of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
in fact here's just a small sample of

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.640 
in fact here's just a small sample of
what<00:01:29.490> they<00:01:29.820> thought<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.780> helicopter<00:01:31.470> Ian

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
what they thought the helicopter Ian

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.330 
what they thought the helicopter Ian
might<00:01:32.369> look<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:33.500> Bill's<00:01:34.500> channel<00:01:35.040> which<00:01:35.189> is

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
might look like Bill's channel which is

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.700 
might look like Bill's channel which is
a<00:01:35.460> well<00:01:35.729> known<00:01:35.759> animal<00:01:36.600> channel<00:01:36.900> indicated

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
a well known animal channel indicated

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.460 
a well known animal channel indicated
that<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.100> essentially<00:01:39.000> was<00:01:39.180> real<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:40.439> I

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that this essentially was real but I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.700 
that this essentially was real but I
don't<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:41.360> but<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.600> now<00:01:42.780> extinct<00:01:43.409> shark

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
don't know but it's a now extinct shark

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.609 
don't know but it's a now extinct shark
and<00:01:43.950> he<00:01:44.220> photoshopped<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:45.390> woman<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.049> which

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and he photoshopped this woman in which

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.950 
and he photoshopped this woman in which
i<00:01:46.740> think<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.040> deceptive<00:01:47.670> not<00:01:48.360> only<00:01:48.659> did<00:01:48.840> they

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
i think is deceptive not only did they

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.649 
i think is deceptive not only did they
not<00:01:49.140> exist<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.799> same<00:01:49.920> time<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> shark

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
not exist at the same time but the shark

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.870 
not exist at the same time but the shark
was<00:01:51.810> only<00:01:52.079> ten<00:01:52.290> foot<00:01:52.560> long<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.610> wouldn't

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
was only ten foot long so it wouldn't

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.080 
was only ten foot long so it wouldn't
look<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.329> big<00:01:55.430> that<00:01:56.430> would<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.670> kind<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.030> like

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
look this big that would be kind of like

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.709 
look this big that would be kind of like
saying<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> real<00:01:58.290> shark<00:01:59.090> sure<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.390> great

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
saying this is a real shark sure a great

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.889 
saying this is a real shark sure a great
white<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> real<00:02:01.560> shark<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:03.149> isn't<00:02:03.509> a

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
white is a real shark but this isn't a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:04.560
