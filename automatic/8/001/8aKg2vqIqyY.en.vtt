actual<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:51.620> nice<00:03:51.859> performance<00:03:52.459> so<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.840> was<00:03:53.930> kind

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
actual a nice performance so it was kind

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.210 
actual a nice performance so it was kind
of<00:03:54.139> one<00:03:54.230> of<00:03:54.290> those<00:03:54.380> things<00:03:54.590> where<00:03:54.739> one<00:03:55.010> thing

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
of one of those things where one thing

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.220 
of one of those things where one thing
kind<00:03:55.370> of<00:03:55.489> led<00:03:55.639> to<00:03:55.669> another<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:56.239> pretty<00:03:57.019> soon

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
kind of led to another and pretty soon
