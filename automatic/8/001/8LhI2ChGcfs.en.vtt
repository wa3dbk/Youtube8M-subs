single-player<00:01:41.070> game<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:42.689> something<00:01:43.110> very

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
single-player game so something very

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.630 
single-player game so something very
cool<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> demo<00:01:44.009> was<00:01:44.220> something<00:01:44.520> called

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
cool in the demo was something called

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.039 
cool in the demo was something called
the<00:01:44.820> Goliath<00:01:45.240> can't<00:01:45.479> tell<00:01:45.630> us<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> little<00:01:45.899> bit

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the Goliath can't tell us a little bit

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.780 
the Goliath can't tell us a little bit

our<00:01:49.649> cool<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.250> advanced<00:01:50.579> military

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
our cool you know advanced military

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.969 
our cool you know advanced military
hardware<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.439> player<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.619> going<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> be

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
hardware that the player is going to be

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.530 
hardware that the player is going to be
able<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.189> use<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.490> game<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.939> it's

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
able to use in the game and it's

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.389 
able to use in the game and it's
basically<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.079> six-wheeled<00:01:55.560> unmanned<00:01:56.130> combat

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
basically a six-wheeled unmanned combat

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
basically a six-wheeled unmanned combat
vehicle<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.450> what<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.719> does<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.079> responds

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
vehicle and what it does is it responds

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.020 
vehicle and what it does is it responds
to<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.710> players<00:01:58.950> orders<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.670> player<00:01:59.850> can

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
to the players orders the player can

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.420 
to the players orders the player can
give<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.290> targets<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.500> attack<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.340> will

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
give it targets to attack and it will

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.219 
give it targets to attack and it will
take<00:02:02.579> out<00:02:02.759> high-value<00:02:03.240> targets<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.899> you

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
take out high-value targets for you you

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.990 
take out high-value targets for you you
can<00:02:04.350> also<00:02:04.469> use<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:05.009> mobile<00:02:05.310> cover<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.909> it

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
can also use it for mobile cover so it

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.069 
can also use it for mobile cover so it
provides<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.360> lot<00:02:06.509> interesting<00:02:06.869> gameplay

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
provides a lot interesting gameplay

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.990 
provides a lot interesting gameplay
opportunities<00:02:07.890> it's<00:02:08.429> actually<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.789> one<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
opportunities it's actually just one of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.400 
opportunities it's actually just one of
the<00:02:09.060> few<00:02:09.330> pieces<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.780> hardware<00:02:09.899> you'll<00:02:10.289> have

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
the few pieces of hardware you'll have

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.690 
the few pieces of hardware you'll have
access<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.009> game<00:02:11.160> there's<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.430> quite<00:02:11.670> a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
access to in the game there's a quite a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.300 
access to in the game there's a quite a
wider<00:02:12.180> variety<00:02:12.470> that's<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.650> only<00:02:14.040> one<00:02:14.160> we're

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
showing today in this demo you have a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.199 
showing today in this demo you have a
really<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.680> foundation<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.700> multiplayer

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
really a foundation in multiplayer

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.760 
really a foundation in multiplayer
gaming<00:02:18.629> can<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.110> tell<00:02:19.260> us<00:02:19.290> something<00:02:19.560> about

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
gaming can you tell us something about

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.680 
gaming can you tell us something about
the<00:02:19.980> multiplayer<00:02:20.580> component<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.330> game<00:02:21.480> I

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690

can't tell you there will be a

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.089 
can't tell you there will be a
large-scale<00:02:27.900> warfare<00:02:28.349> game<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.800> it's<00:02:28.980> going

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
large-scale warfare game so it's going

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.680 
large-scale warfare game so it's going
to<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:29.250> more<00:02:29.400> than<00:02:29.459> just<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.910> infantry<00:02:30.360> only

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
to be more than just the infantry only

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.330 
to be more than just the infantry only
shooter<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.290> you're<00:02:31.769> going<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.920> be<00:02:32.010> able<00:02:32.040> to

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
shooter and you're going to be able to

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.619 
shooter and you're going to be able to
use<00:02:32.459> vehicles<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.180> there's<00:02:33.360> going<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.540> be<00:02:33.569> a

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
use vehicles and there's going to be a

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.600 
use vehicles and there's going to be a

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
we're still fairly early in development

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.050 
we're still fairly early in development
we've<00:04:11.410> been<00:04:11.560> working<00:04:11.680> on<00:04:11.860> it<00:04:11.920> for<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:12.099> year<00:04:12.400> but

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
we've been working on it for a year but

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.250 
we've been working on it for a year but
there's<00:04:13.239> still<00:04:13.299> a<00:04:13.420> fair<00:04:13.599> bit<00:04:13.629> of<00:04:13.750> time<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:14.080> go

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260
