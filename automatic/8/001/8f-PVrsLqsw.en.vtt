00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.430
 bay night was the same today 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.670
 equal 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.070
 had only 34 first chances of 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.000
 the head of the fan at the beginning of the game because 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:33.739
 but three if I'm not mistaken it was souza is the 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.209
 of lyon and no more nothing more is what 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.100
 besides having to win must twist 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.709
 also against the opponents last 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.530
 round will be complicated without it and the worst 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.019
 this is not it is worse is to rescue morale 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.300
 of those athletes where the most difficult is 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.060
 very complicated very difficult is not 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.440
 possible we are going to dedicate to this is the 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.030
 only way we can improve 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.920
 but we have achieved victory, if not 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.260
 You have to raise his morale. 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.930
 after the two defeats at home Jorge 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.760

 change the midfield attack team in 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.150
 relation to new contractors who 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.980

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.260
 Itabaiana none of them 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.660
 none of them can debut 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.370
 now will mount a lot of keep the 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.530

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.810
 with reason then you have to be calm to 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.890
