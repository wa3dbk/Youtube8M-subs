00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.010
 Hello my love 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.080
 Today I want you my stroller 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.850
 demonstrate 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.600
 I will be behind the camera today 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.099
 and try so calmly with the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.830
 hand to pass the camera I have 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.240
 unfortunately no tripod 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.630
 That's why I hope that 's not yours 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.000
 I really disturb and try very well 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.059
 as possible to show the children so the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.789
 prams we have of ebay and 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.559
 Although the brand baby lux is the one 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.489
 or maybe someone else knows that 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.739
 have a few customer reviews in the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.239
 Internet read there split 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.829
 a bit of opinion but I am the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.470
 that this is just that 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.689
 It's enough because that's how long you need one 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.369
 stroller not because in buggy age 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.909
 and you usually then to 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.909
 small narrow buggy and the good here 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.210
 in the left about that still the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.470
 baby bowl was there 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.000
 I have a picture of it 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.540
 instagram posted you're welcome 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.619
 look and yes so the model is called 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:35.479
 there always and we chose the gray 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:40.500
 white option decided 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.210
 We had a choice of wheels and we did 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.000
 We decided for pneumatic tires 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.549
 simply because then again 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.890
 bit cushioned and easy yourself 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.070
 continue to drive there was a choice 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.040
 then still Hartchrom mature so that would be 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.570
 I prefer it okay then I start too 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.600
 just down below if ever here 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.320
 below is and here is one below 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.920
 have a large shopping basket with it here 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.700
 I now all the extra 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.310
 but that does not need anything 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.660
 right now here it is I do not know 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.590
 I assume that is still only 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:23.440
 such a sun visor then it is for 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:28.560
 the age is such a tray around 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:36.360
 to hold drinks or just 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:38.769
 such a thing and then again one of the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.750
 bottle holder human age as well 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:49.049
 always and then the bag is already 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.049
 lehmann he is overcrowded a cut 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.049
 then it goes on and that you have 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.569
 The hood you can do so hard 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.489
 together 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:08.260
 Of course we would like that 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:11.560
 would like a bit folded like that 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.660
 you look in the children 1 lay hangs 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.820
 here is a diaper bag that is 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.250
 really the only negative I think 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.100
 that the diaper bag i'll show you this 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.760
 times that is in my opinion much too 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.579
 small 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.820
 way too small here it does not look so good 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.769
 but i can tell you this is here 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.090
 the fold here without any 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.640
 side pocket without a zipper 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.380
 in vain so that 's really it 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.130
 only thing to complain about 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:43.530
 and I'm really superior to me 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.530
 to get an extra diaper bag 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:59.550
 then you have to make such a backup here 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:08.430
 as I wanted to understand the page 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:13.890
 with the zipper on then you have 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:21.060
 Here is a soft bag that you can 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:23.820
 then open it again and then 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.720
 There's a baby mattress in here 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:32.310
 that was there, I think that's enough 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:35.000
 that's not too hard, nothing that can 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.830
 By the way, you wash yourself 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.620
 yes and then you can do the thing too 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:54.150
 remove completely 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:55.880
 that's just going to be removed 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:07.750
 somehow not 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:07.750
 Anyway, you could look it like this 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:17.770
 here in front of the part that you can 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:22.240
 Remove make and then you can 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.190
 turn that flap down and that 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.919
 seal that up and then you have yours 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.419
 buggy that 's it , do not be angry if 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.910
 I do not do that now that goes with it 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:34.600
 a hand extremely heavy and I am 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:45.120
 just what alone on the dare 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:47.710
 then the small pocket extras here 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.050
 can you then their income is so baby 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.880
 Let's leave that open or when to 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.380
 example spring sun you can 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.800
 we open this up a bit 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:02.470
 sunbeam intercepted then we have 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:08.800
 Here was another bag that was 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:14.380
 with a rain cover and exactly that 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:18.520
 were the cases for understanding the 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:22.570
 Just protect and then it was still there 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.780
 a mosquito net and here in this bag 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.780
 the 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.490
 what I wanted to say was this swivel 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.230
 you can slide on this page 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.230
 have that you can look at the baby 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.150
 but then you can also think like that 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.610
 that the child looks forward and so to speak 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.490
 behind the child so go now as to 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:01.410
 example for the buggy that's why you have 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:06.570
 also brake there and brake here 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:08.220
 that means front and back and I hope 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.600
 I have forgotten nothing now 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:16.710
 I'll show you some more 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:19.950
 I paid for the farther away 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:23.610
 complete set so stroller the 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:26.430
 all the extras and the baby seat 209 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.450
 euro although free shipping as I said 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.480

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:33.410

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.910
 put in the infobox 

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.610

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.380

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.550
 The video did you like it too 

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.340
 now really not the best quality 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:48.170
 I was next the quietest hand had 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:50.460
 and a bit out of breath and you 

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.740
 then I'm happy when you next 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.850
 see you again and say it again 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.850
 lie there
