pieces for my miniature crafting I don't

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
pieces for my miniature crafting I don't
do<00:00:10.110> scaling<00:00:11.360> proper<00:00:12.360> scaling<00:00:12.690> at<00:00:13.139> least<00:00:13.500> for

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
do scaling proper scaling at least for

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.120 
do scaling proper scaling at least for
my<00:00:14.580> miniature<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.330> then<00:00:15.719> I've<00:00:16.590> seen<00:00:16.830> people

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
my miniature and then I've seen people

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.750 
my miniature and then I've seen people
doing<00:00:17.340> like<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.940> know<00:00:19.609> 112<00:00:20.609> or<00:00:21.590> 124<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:23.460> scale

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
doing like you know 112 or 124 to scale

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.570 
doing like you know 112 or 124 to scale
some<00:00:24.630> thinking<00:00:24.960> maybe<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.260> should<00:00:25.289> try<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.830> but

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
some thinking maybe I should try it but

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.779 
some thinking maybe I should try it but
I'm<00:00:26.849> not<00:00:27.060> sure<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.630> really<00:00:27.869> my<00:00:28.019> style<00:00:28.349> and

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
I'm not sure if it's really my style and

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:35.889 
I'm not sure if it's really my style and
on<00:00:29.789> these<00:00:30.599> miniatures<00:00:31.199> are<00:00:33.230> 1/12<00:00:34.230> scale<00:00:34.430> and

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
on these miniatures are 1/12 scale and

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.500 
on these miniatures are 1/12 scale and
it's<00:00:37.010> pretty<00:00:38.010> small<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.700> can't<00:00:38.940> imagine<00:00:39.059> in

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
it's pretty small so I can't imagine in

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.400 
it's pretty small so I can't imagine in
1:24<00:00:40.350> scale<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.210> don't<00:00:42.270> know<00:00:42.450> if<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.690> do

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
1:24 scale and I don't know if I can do

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.700 
1:24 scale and I don't know if I can do
that<00:00:43.649> or<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.510> particularly<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:46.020> doing

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that or not I particularly like doing

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.860 
that or not I particularly like doing
smaller<00:00:47.100> objects<00:00:47.760> such<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.329> my<00:00:49.700> macaroon

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
smaller objects such as like my macaroon

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.310 
smaller objects such as like my macaroon
but<00:00:51.870> they're<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.379> scale<00:00:52.649> at<00:00:52.860> all<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:54.320> yeah

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
but they're not to scale at all so yeah

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.889 
but they're not to scale at all so yeah
I'm<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.789> redo<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.329> probably

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
I'm going to have to redo this probably

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.810 
I'm going to have to redo this probably
but<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.649> way<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.890> looks<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.309> mean<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
but I like the way it looks I mean and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.150 
but I like the way it looks I mean and
then<00:01:00.329> specifically<00:01:01.320> doing<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:02.010> doll

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
then specifically doing it for doll

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.880 
then specifically doing it for doll
houses<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.270> doll<00:01:03.570> house<00:01:03.890> products

for<00:01:42.690> this<00:01:42.840> size<00:01:43.140> cake<00:01:43.640> but<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.880> glass<00:01:45.680> cover

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
for this size cake but the glass cover

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.500 
for this size cake but the glass cover
as<00:01:47.760> this<00:01:48.510> one<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:49.620> not<00:01:49.800> fit<00:01:50.400> over<00:01:50.910> it<00:01:50.940> because

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
as this one it's not fit over it because

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.780 
as this one it's not fit over it because
the<00:01:51.750> diameter<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.560> not<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.890> right<00:01:53.070> diameter

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the diameter is not the right diameter

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.660 
the diameter is not the right diameter
like<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.930> say<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.260> supposed<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.400> scale

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
like I say it's supposed to be to scale

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.430 
like I say it's supposed to be to scale
but<00:01:57.000> I'm<00:01:57.120> not<00:01:57.240> sure<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.690> is<00:01:57.750> even<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.229> light

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
but I'm not sure this is even a light

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.310 
but I'm not sure this is even a light
scale<00:01:58.800> because<00:01:59.040> as<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.610> tell<00:01:59.910> like<00:02:00.259> Y<00:02:01.259> is

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
scale because as you can tell like Y is

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.810 
scale because as you can tell like Y is
a<00:02:01.590> cookie<00:02:02.490> jar<00:02:03.020> for<00:02:04.020> instance<00:02:04.440> bigger<00:02:05.430> than<00:02:05.790> a

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
a cookie jar for instance bigger than a

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.570 
a cookie jar for instance bigger than a
cake<00:02:06.450> stand<00:02:06.660> so<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.320> isn't<00:02:07.800> quite<00:02:08.280> really

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
cake stand so that isn't quite really

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.710 
cake stand so that isn't quite really
make<00:02:08.759> much<00:02:09.570> sense<00:02:10.910> if<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.120> want<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.390> be<00:02:12.480> very

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
make much sense if you want to be very

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.290 
make much sense if you want to be very
realistic<00:02:13.110> that's<00:02:13.620> not<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.400> right<00:02:14.580> scale<00:02:14.940> so

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
realistic that's not the right scale so

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.699 
realistic that's not the right scale so
I<00:02:15.330> think<00:02:15.630> my<00:02:16.230> cake<00:02:16.590> or<00:02:17.239> pretty<00:02:18.239> good<00:02:19.050> size<00:02:19.290> but

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
I think my cake or pretty good size but

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.510 
I think my cake or pretty good size but
it's<00:02:19.950> just<00:02:20.100> on<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:22.200> different<00:02:22.350> different<00:02:23.310> more

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
it's just on a different different more

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.610 
it's just on a different different more
if<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.910> want<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.360> professionally<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:25.110> have

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
if I want to do it professionally I have

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.580 
if I want to do it professionally I have
to<00:02:25.830> start<00:02:26.790> measuring<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.480> with<00:02:27.600> mores<00:02:27.989> which<00:02:28.290> I

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
to start measuring it with mores which I

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.680 
to start measuring it with mores which I
don't<00:02:29.130> ever<00:02:29.400> want<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.700> restrict<00:02:30.000> myself<00:02:30.390> to

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
don't ever want to restrict myself to

food that are cute not we're going to
scale<00:02:41.790> for<00:02:42.240> dollhouses<00:02:42.800> so<00:02:43.910> but<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.030> might

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
scale for dollhouses so but it might

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
scale for dollhouses so but it might
give<00:02:45.540> me<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.780> lot<00:02:46.770> more<00:02:47.040> variety<00:02:47.600> if<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:48.840> it

more<00:02:49.650> free<00:02:50.070> style<00:02:51.030> instead<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.050> scale<00:02:52.350> so

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
more free style instead of to scale so

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.300 
more free style instead of to scale so
that's<00:02:53.550> what<00:02:53.700> I'm<00:02:53.790> thinking<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:55.100> I<00:02:56.100> bought

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
this glass stand with a more I guess

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.950

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
more flat top so down I'll put it aside

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.030 
more flat top so down I'll put it aside

thing it's freshly opened kind of style

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.899 
thing it's freshly opened kind of style
so<00:04:57.770> it<00:04:58.729> looks<00:04:58.880> better<00:04:58.970> setting<00:04:59.900> on<00:05:00.080> this

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909
