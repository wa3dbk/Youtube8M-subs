00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 let's have the sauce ready now if we go 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.520
 of flown with the ingredients for that 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.740
 white chocolate tiramisu for this 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.920
 white chocolate tiramisu we will 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.370
 need 500 grams of mascarpone cheese 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.760
 at room temperature 300 grams of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.119
 white chocolate melted to bain- marie 2 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.269
 cups of hot water 5 tablespoons of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.590
 soluble coffee a quarter cup of liquor 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:33.300
 of coffee one and a half box of soletas and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.820
 100 grams of grated white chocolate 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.670
 we are already there then with him with this 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.110
 with this recipe we will start diet of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.210
 it is truly a delight and it is different 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.700
 because normally the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.280
 traditional tiramisu what is this 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.050
 mascarpone and of course with coffee but 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.550
 Now let's give it a special touch and 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.620
 I like that personally 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.940
 more highlights much more I'm super fan 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.039
 of white chocolate so it's left 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.480
 very very well the first thing we're going to 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.460
 to do is here we have hot water and 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.539
 let's dissolve the soluble coffee that the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.820
 soluble coffee is what we have 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.270
 usually at home to prepare 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.760
 our coffees and cough the dust if 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.920
 Have a coffee that you like too 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.270
 it can be perfectly nothing else anymore 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.910
 prepared let's put a little bit of 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.800
 coffee liqueur that tastes good to coffee 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.650
 that is a bit strong cited the 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.250
 mix because in this mixture we are going to 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.020
 bathe let's submerge the ballots to 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.790
 go arranging them at the bottom of the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.800
 container this is a refractory 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.600
 only lined with aluminum foil 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.220
 so that to be able to unmold 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.729
 much better is in that this technique 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.680
 It is infallible and infallible because we take 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.610
 in aluminum we take it off with care 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.460
 and ready 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.600
 otherwise we would have to use the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.340
 refractory bring to the table the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.800
 refractory complete especially in this 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.509
 dessert because if not you will not be able to 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.090
 unmold then if they want to do it 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.710
 without aluminum foil, it works perfectly 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.890
 then they will bring to the table the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.420
 refractory complete with the dessert not what 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.580
 they will be able to unmold and well 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.000
 always to me a dessert desmolda or that 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.149
 I think it looks a lot more then always 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.190
 we try to do it and with this technique 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.390
 of lined aluminum foil 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:16.170
 there is no loss we are here nothing more 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.600
 immersing our tickets in the coffee 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.410
 let's go here to reserve the and while 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.380
 let's now here in the blender to pour 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.920
 the mascarpone cheese that we have here already 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.830
 ready 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.280
 we are going to start to beat it to incorporate 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.280
 a little air 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.640
 is ready we are going to incorporate a little 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.740
 of air and we're going to add chocolate 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.390
 molten white that we have here eye 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.680
 remember that for chocolate to 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.350
 melt chocolate always has to 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.880
 be a double boiler or in the microwave 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.490
 bain marie we have no loses that you 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.170
 we are the water 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.430
 the container where the chocolate is not 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.350
 it has to be in contact with the water 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.390
 simply with the steam that is generated 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.310
 of the hot water we are going to put here 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.600
 arribita and with that steam quoted leaves 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.000
 melting the chocolate moving 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.070
 constantly or if it's not in the bathroom 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.170
 Mary then in the microwave nothing more than 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.580
 eye in the microwave the microwave usually 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.930
 also burning the chocolate then 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.060
 let's put it in intervals of 15 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.030
 seconds we put the container with 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.430
 microwave chocolate 15 seconds what 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.570
 we take out we move him and then we go back to 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.520
 put another 15 seconds and so 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.410
 successively until our 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.900
 chocolate is perfectly fine 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.640
 cast so we're going here add the 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.700
 white chocolate that I already have 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.819
 previously cast 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.099
 it will go perfectly incorporating 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.099
 well with mascarpone cheese 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.840
 to this list 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.300
 the mascarpone cheese also already 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.350
 found in several supermarkets in 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.350
 almost all I have seen 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.100
 perfect let's go here nothing else with the 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.380
 spoon 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.720
 to soak our ballots a little more 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.880
 so they have more tantito coffee flavor 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.370
 nothing else a little I do not want them either 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.730
 a lot of liquid I just want the 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.000
 tickets absorb well well 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.000
 coffee ready 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.030
 let's turn it off 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.160
 and we are going to pour some of this mixture 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.500
 on top of the letters 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.560
 if it is that we go we must put either 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.710
 this mixture on top of the tickets to 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.470
 cover them perfectly well a little bit 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.440
 more and we're going to put another layer of pigtails 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.020
 soaked in the coffee to accommodate is 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.430
 nothing is more ready to see what 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.260
 thing is really richer this post 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.000
 successes I think it's my favorites and 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.430
 it is excellently good with any 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.470
 food as Italian type remains 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.009
 perfectly fine so we 're going here 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.159
 to soak the ballots 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.419
 to put the next layer we already have there 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.610
 the accommodated tickets 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.080
 now let's put the rest of the 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.330
 mixture of mascarpone cheese with 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.789
 white chocolate now nothing else what 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.379
 delight to cover it completely and 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.830
 then we will cool around 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:03.210
 45 50 minutes or until a firm 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.430
 Once they see that the 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.490
 mix good then we're going to 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.899
 remove to unmold and decorate with 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.080
 white chocolate like to see you we're going 

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:16.070
 to see and well, this one is ready and 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.410
 maximum to take it then 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.900
 to the refrigerator that is more or less 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.560
 small 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.070
 to this one 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.610
 but I'm going to take the refrigerator 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:31.000
 I have a ready one here 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:34.810
 we're going to take it out we're going to 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.909
 unmold and let's cover it with the 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.349
 grated white chocolate see how easy 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.780
 is to unmold what we have here already with 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:43.629
 aluminum foil then let's remove 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.969
 the dough and aluminum foil taking off with 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:48.430
 with care especially when it's okay 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:51.139
 well frozen is well not frozen 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.460
 it would be refrigerated and firm 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.039
 it will not have any problem 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.740
 to be, let's put it in a 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.780
 plate 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.139
 and we're going to decorate it with chocolate 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.139
 White 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:09.979
 it is also next 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.979
 It took us the truth not long 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.800
 and everybody likes to go 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.560
 excellently good with pasta or with 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.289
 anything and Italian food and nothing 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.840
 more what is so much richer chocolate 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.490
 Grated white and good well now 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.550
 let's go straight to the table 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:31.170
 presentation is with us 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.120

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.620
 refractory previously covered as the 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.780
 aluminum places a layer of soletas 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.280
 previously soaked in the coffee over 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.960
 these place a layer of the mixture of 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.040
 cheese repeats the procedure until 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.750
 finish with the ingredients 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.880
 ending with a layer of cheese 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.250
 Sprinkle grated chocolate this
