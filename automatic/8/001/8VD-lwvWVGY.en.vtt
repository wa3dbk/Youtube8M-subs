like<00:00:30.779> predictive<00:00:31.410> police<00:00:31.740> telling<00:00:32.610> police

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
like predictive police telling police

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.299 
like predictive police telling police
work<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.390> go<00:00:33.540> before<00:00:33.809> crime<00:00:34.230> happens<00:00:34.650> so<00:00:35.190> that

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
work to go before crime happens so that

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.740 
work to go before crime happens so that
they<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.520> prevent<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.390> know<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.570> can

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
they can prevent it you know you can

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.450 
they can prevent it you know you can
also<00:00:36.960> predict<00:00:37.530> where<00:00:37.800> people<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.220> find<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
also predict where people can find a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.070 
also predict where people can find a
place<00:00:38.580> to<00:00:38.790> park<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.270> air<00:00:39.390> up<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> office

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
place to park with air up to the office

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.229 
place to park with air up to the office
you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.770> predict<00:00:41.250> which<00:00:41.430> train<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.820> gonna<00:00:42.090> be

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
you can predict which train is gonna be

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.820 
you can predict which train is gonna be
full<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.720> you<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:43.080> maybe<00:00:43.260> sit<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
full so that you can maybe sit on the

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.740 
full so that you can maybe sit on the
next<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.250> see<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.210> these<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.570> very

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
next one see and these are very

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.090 
next one see and these are very
important<00:00:46.140> things<00:00:46.350> they're<00:00:47.070> actually

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
important things they're actually

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.040 
important things they're actually
happening<00:00:47.760> today<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.660> know<00:00:48.750> we're<00:00:48.930> working

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
happening today you know we're working

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.840 
happening today you know we're working
on<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.379> project<00:00:49.620> with<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.190> French<00:00:50.489> National

on a project with a French National

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.020 
on a project with a French National
Railway<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.720> predict<00:00:52.199> people<00:00:53.040> flows<00:00:53.730> and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
Railway to predict people flows and

Railway to predict people flows and
public<00:00:54.360> transports<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.080> we're<00:00:55.530> offering<00:00:56.010> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
public transports and we're offering you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.639 
public transports and we're offering you
know<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.700> mobile<00:00:57.120> app<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.540> passengers<00:00:58.050> that

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
know a mobile app to passengers that

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.930 
know a mobile app to passengers that
tells<00:00:58.890> them<00:00:59.100> whether<00:00:59.430> or<00:00:59.579> not<00:00:59.700> they're<00:00:59.820> gonna

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
tells them whether or not they're gonna

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.990 
tells them whether or not they're gonna
find<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> place<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.600> sit<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.530> train<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.219> why

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
find a place to sit on the train and why

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.479 
find a place to sit on the train and why
is<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.210> important<00:01:03.719> because<00:01:04.309> once<00:01:05.309> people

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
is this important because once people

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.950 
is this important because once people
have<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.790> information<00:01:06.000> they<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.570> decide<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
have that information they can decide to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.810 
have that information they can decide to
go<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.140> next<00:01:07.470> train<00:01:07.649> the<00:01:07.800> one<00:01:07.920> before<00:01:08.340> so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
go to next train the one before so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.730 
go to next train the one before so
instead<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.090> having<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.570> strong<00:01:10.440> peak

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
instead of having like one strong peak

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
instead of having like one strong peak
hour<00:01:10.950> you're<00:01:11.670> actually<00:01:12.030> defusing<00:01:12.539> the<00:01:12.570> load

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
hour you're actually defusing the load

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.320 
hour you're actually defusing the load
and<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.500> know<00:01:13.830> increasing<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and you know increasing like the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:24.080 
and you know increasing like the
efficiency<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> whole<00:01:16.050> network

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.780 

right<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:24.899> what<00:01:25.170> happens<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.369> feedback

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
right now what happens is the feedback

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.880 
right now what happens is the feedback
loop<00:01:27.030> between<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:28.200> moment<00:01:28.590> where<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.770> observe

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
loop between a moment where you observe

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.980 
loop between a moment where you observe
something<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.579> city<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.390> moment<00:01:30.780> where

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
something in a city in a moment where

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.300 
something in a city in a moment where
you<00:01:31.110> actually<00:01:31.259> do<00:01:31.590> something<00:01:31.829> about<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you actually do something about and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.580 
you actually do something about and
measure<00:01:32.610> its<00:01:32.820> effect<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.360> very<00:01:33.810> long<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.470> we

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
measure its effect is very long what we

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.130 
measure its effect is very long what we
have<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:34.860> big<00:01:35.009> data<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.640> not<00:01:36.329> only<00:01:36.479> real-time

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
have with big data is not only real-time

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.289 
have with big data is not only real-time
feedback<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:38.039> what's<00:01:38.220> happening<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:39.030> also

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
feedback on what's happening it's also

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.469 
feedback on what's happening it's also
real-time<00:01:39.990> analytics<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.240> solution<00:01:42.240> you

saying this doesn't work or by just
committing<00:01:54.869> some<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.350> their<00:01:55.470> own<00:01:55.619> data<00:01:55.950> so

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
committing some of their own data so

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.070 
committing some of their own data so
that<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.970> can<00:01:57.149> make<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.479> whole<00:01:57.659> system<00:01:57.899> work

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
that you can make the whole system work

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.260 
that you can make the whole system work
better<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.830> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.459> very<00:01:59.610> unique<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.179> this

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
better and this is very unique and this

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.960 
better and this is very unique and this
is<00:02:00.330> very<00:02:00.630> important<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.440> see<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:02.789> the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
is very important you see this like the

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.480 
is very important you see this like the
ability<00:02:03.179> to<00:02:04.080> try<00:02:04.380> out<00:02:04.560> new<00:02:04.590> policies<00:02:05.250> and

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
ability to try out new policies and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.930 
ability to try out new policies and
organically<00:02:06.179> grow<00:02:07.049> with<00:02:07.619> your<00:02:07.830> citizens<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
organically grow with your citizens is

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.390 
organically grow with your citizens is
something<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.569> turns<00:02:09.780> city<00:02:10.110> into<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.099> real

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
something that turns city into a real

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.110 
something that turns city into a real
human<00:02:11.849> place

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.270 

from<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.209> scientist<00:02:15.629> perspective<00:02:16.160> being<00:02:17.160> able

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
from a scientist perspective being able

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.479 
from a scientist perspective being able
to<00:02:17.459> observe<00:02:18.090> those<00:02:18.900> huge<00:02:19.379> amounts<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.739> data<00:02:19.950> is

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
to observe those huge amounts of data is

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.360 
to observe those huge amounts of data is
giving<00:02:20.940> me<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.569> know<00:02:21.660> for<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> first-time<00:02:22.410> you

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
giving me you know for a first-time you

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.699 
giving me you know for a first-time you
know<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.519> window<00:02:23.970> into<00:02:24.180> how<00:02:24.540> people<00:02:24.959> move

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
know a window into how people move

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.650 
know a window into how people move
around<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.099> cities<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.580> what<00:02:26.760> they<00:02:26.879> do<00:02:26.940> one

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
around in cities and what they do one

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.199 
around in cities and what they do one
single<00:02:27.870> person<00:02:28.349> isn't<00:02:28.500> predictable<00:02:28.860> but<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
single person isn't predictable but the

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.320 
single person isn't predictable but the
mass<00:02:30.739> population<00:02:31.739> actually<00:02:32.310> behaves<00:02:32.849> in<00:02:33.030> very

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
mass population actually behaves in very

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.530 
mass population actually behaves in very
predictable<00:02:33.810> patterns<00:02:34.200> right<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.130> is

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
predictable patterns right so this is

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.880 
predictable patterns right so this is
enormous<00:02:36.540> ly<00:02:36.810> interesting<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.380> exciting<00:02:37.590> to

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
enormous ly interesting and exciting to

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.640 
enormous ly interesting and exciting to
look<00:02:38.010> at<00:02:38.300> from<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.390> citizens<00:02:39.810> perspective<00:02:40.380> I

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
look at from a citizens perspective I

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.979 
look at from a citizens perspective I
want<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.370> be<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.549> a<00:02:41.640> city<00:02:41.849> you<00:02:42.209> know<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.720> learns

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
want to be in a city you know the learns

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.050 
want to be in a city you know the learns
from<00:02:43.470> whatever<00:02:43.620> I'm<00:02:43.890> doing<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.430> actually

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
from whatever I'm doing and actually

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.910 
from whatever I'm doing and actually
adapts<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.599> me<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.349> I<00:02:46.410> don't<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.830> be

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
adapts to me so that I don't have to be

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.350 
adapts to me so that I don't have to be
constrained<00:02:47.400> anymore<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:47.940> can<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.239> have

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
constrained anymore and I can just have

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.240 
constrained anymore and I can just have
a<00:02:48.420> better<00:02:48.569> quality<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.019> life<00:02:49.140> even<00:02:49.590> if<00:02:50.099> there

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
a better quality of life even if there

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.979 
a better quality of life even if there
are<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.489> 10<00:02:50.760> billion<00:02:51.090> people<00:02:51.360> living<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:51.900> it

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
are like 10 billion people living in it

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.549 
are like 10 billion people living in it
and<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.739> for<00:02:52.980> me<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.190> most<00:02:53.430> exciting
