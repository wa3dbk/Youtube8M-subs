players<00:01:19.320> turn<00:01:19.619> they<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:19.979> two<00:01:20.250> choices<00:01:20.520> their

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
players turn they have two choices their

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.300 
players turn they have two choices their
first<00:01:21.180> choice<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.720> roll<00:01:22.020> forward<00:01:22.290> ice<00:01:22.590> so

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
first choice is to roll forward ice so

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.679 
first choice is to roll forward ice so
they<00:01:23.430> would<00:01:23.580> take<00:01:23.759> four<00:01:24.030> dice<00:01:24.240> out<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.570> their

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
they would take four dice out of their

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.590 
they would take four dice out of their
pool<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:25.439> these<00:01:25.650> dice<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.159> roll<00:01:26.189> them<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
pool of all these dice and roll them and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.880 
pool of all these dice and roll them and
then<00:01:27.869> what<00:01:28.080> they<00:01:28.200> would<00:01:28.350> do<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.710> they<00:01:28.740> would

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
then what they would do is they would

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.340 
then what they would do is they would
take<00:01:29.130> their<00:01:29.340> four<00:01:29.640> dice<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:31.020> they<00:01:31.170> would<00:01:31.290> have

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
take their four dice and they would have

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.740 
take their four dice and they would have
a<00:01:31.439> choice<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.950> placing<00:01:32.369> them<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.750> four

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
a choice of placing them on four

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.060 
a choice of placing them on four
different<00:01:33.990> tiles<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.560> they<00:01:34.680> always<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.009> to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
different tiles so they always have to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.010 
different tiles so they always have to
place<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.640> four<00:01:35.850> dice<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.299> four<00:01:36.600> separate

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
place the four dice on four separate

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.649 
place the four dice on four separate
tile<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.500> let's<00:01:37.650> say<00:01:37.770> they<00:01:37.829> placed<00:01:38.130> here<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
tile so let's say they placed here and

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.550 
tile so let's say they placed here and
here<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.780> here<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:43.200> would<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
here and here and here that would be the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.319 
here and here and here that would be the
end<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.860> their<00:01:44.040> turn<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.549> then<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> next

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
end of their turn and then the next

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.450 
end of their turn and then the next
player<00:01:45.600> would<00:01:45.750> also<00:01:45.930> roll<00:01:46.290> dice<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.860> they

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
player would also roll dice and they

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.859 
player would also roll dice and they
would<00:01:47.610> place<00:01:47.820> their<00:01:48.060> dice<00:01:48.240> if<00:01:48.420> they<00:01:48.540> wanted<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
would place their dice if they wanted to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.600 
would place their dice if they wanted to
so<00:01:49.259> let's<00:01:49.470> say<00:01:49.619> they<00:01:49.770> roll<00:01:49.950> their<00:01:49.979> dice<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
so let's say they roll their dice and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.240 
so let's say they roll their dice and
they<00:01:50.700> came<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:50.909> with<00:01:51.030> these<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.710> now<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
they came up with these for now the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.560 
they came up with these for now the
point<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> game<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.000> try<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
point of the game is to try and have the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.780 
point of the game is to try and have the
highest<00:01:54.780> pip<00:01:55.200> total<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> tile<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.369> your<00:01:56.579> turn

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
highest pip total on a tile on your turn

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.819 
highest pip total on a tile on your turn
in<00:01:57.060> order<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.750> able<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.020> score<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.530> tile

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
in order to be able to score that tile

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.130 
in order to be able to score that tile
so<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.520> example<00:01:59.610> right<00:02:00.000> now<00:02:00.030> red<00:02:00.540> has<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> six

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
so for example right now red has a six

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.080 
so for example right now red has a six
here<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.560> six<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.610> two<00:02:03.119> here<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.649> a<00:02:05.090> 3-over

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
here a six here a two here and a 3-over

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.930 
here a six here a two here and a 3-over
on<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.450> white<00:02:06.659> tile<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.640> problem<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.759> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
on this white tile the problem is that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.729 
on this white tile the problem is that
you<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.179> only<00:02:09.330> score<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.750> tile<00:02:10.020> if<00:02:10.319> there<00:02:10.649> are

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
you can only score a tile if there are

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.680 
you can only score a tile if there are
both<00:02:11.069> players<00:02:11.489> colored<00:02:11.910> ice<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.330> them<00:02:12.420> so

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
both players colored ice on them so

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.510 
both players colored ice on them so
example<00:02:12.990> red<00:02:13.140> can<00:02:13.350> now<00:02:13.500> not<00:02:13.800> flip<00:02:14.130> any<00:02:14.340> of

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
example red can now not flip any of

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.370 
example red can now not flip any of
these<00:02:14.640> four<00:02:14.940> tiles<00:02:15.180> because<00:02:15.750> right<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
these four tiles because right is the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.950 
these four tiles because right is the
only<00:02:16.530> presence<00:02:16.950> there<00:02:17.480> but<00:02:18.480> what<00:02:18.630> blue<00:02:18.840> may

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
only presence there but what blue may

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.170 
only presence there but what blue may
want<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.230> do<00:02:19.350> is<00:02:19.500> they'll<00:02:19.650> put<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.830> six<00:02:20.130> here<00:02:20.430> so

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
want to do is they'll put a six here so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.090 
want to do is they'll put a six here so
now<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.690> tile<00:02:21.960> is<00:02:22.170> matched<00:02:22.440> out<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.920> neither

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
now that tile is matched out and neither

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.920 
now that tile is matched out and neither
player<00:02:23.310> can<00:02:23.430> flip<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.790> they'll<00:02:24.390> put<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.600> three

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
player can flip it they'll put a three

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.990 
player can flip it they'll put a three
here<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.380> match<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.800> three<00:02:26.070> they'll<00:02:26.820> put<00:02:26.970> a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
here to match the three they'll put a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.480 
here to match the three they'll put a
two<00:02:27.240> over<00:02:27.540> here<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.810> match<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.140> two<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.620> just

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
two over here to match the two and just

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.920 
two over here to match the two and just
for<00:02:29.700> example<00:02:29.790> let's<00:02:30.120> say<00:02:30.390> they<00:02:30.540> place<00:02:30.750> this

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
for example let's say they place this

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.010 
for example let's say they place this
last<00:02:31.170> two<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.920> six<00:02:32.720> now<00:02:33.720> would<00:02:33.990> be

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
last two on with the six now would be

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.600 
last two on with the six now would be
the<00:02:34.140> red<00:02:34.500> player's<00:02:34.770> turn<00:02:35.040> again<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.370> they

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
the red player's turn again and they

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.160 
the red player's turn again and they
have<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> choice<00:02:36.060> they<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.510> either<00:02:36.660> roll<00:02:36.840> for

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
have a choice they can either roll for

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.360 
have a choice they can either roll for
more<00:02:37.380> dice<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.770> place<00:02:37.950> them<00:02:38.160> all<00:02:38.280> on

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
more dice and place them all on

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.850 
more dice and place them all on
individual<00:02:38.790> tiles<00:02:39.180> or<00:02:39.330> they<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:40.320> flip<00:02:40.590> one

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
individual tiles or they can flip one

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.740 
individual tiles or they can flip one
tile<00:02:41.100> on<00:02:41.400> which<00:02:41.580> their<00:02:41.880> pips<00:02:42.210> are<00:02:42.450> higher<00:02:42.720> than

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
tile on which their pips are higher than

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.110 
tile on which their pips are higher than
their<00:02:43.170> opponents<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.100> for<00:02:44.310> example<00:02:44.370> they

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
their opponents so for example they

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.640 
their opponents so for example they
could<00:02:45.300> flip<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.690> black<00:02:45.960> towel<00:02:46.200> because<00:02:46.380> they

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
could flip this black towel because they

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.170 
could flip this black towel because they
have<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.860> six<00:02:47.280> while<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.550> opponent<00:02:47.880> only<00:02:48.030> has<00:02:48.150> a

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
have a six while the opponent only has a

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.090 
have a six while the opponent only has a
total<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.600> two<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.770> they're<00:02:49.890> going<00:02:50.040> to

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
total of two and so they're going to

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.350 
total of two and so they're going to
look<00:02:50.220> at<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.640> they<00:02:50.760> would<00:02:50.880> say<00:02:51.030> okay<00:02:51.240> I'm

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
look at it and they would say okay I'm

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.460 
look at it and they would say okay I'm
going<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.540> score<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:51.840> tile<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.290> all<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
going to score this tile and all the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.870 
going to score this tile and all the
Dyson<00:02:52.770> come<00:02:52.950> off<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.250> they'd<00:02:53.340> be<00:02:53.370> out<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
Dyson come off and they'd be out of the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.210 
Dyson come off and they'd be out of the
game<00:02:54.110> but<00:02:55.110> they're<00:02:55.260> going<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.560> flip<00:02:55.770> this<00:02:55.800> tile

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
game but they're going to flip this tile

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.530 
game but they're going to flip this tile
over<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.670> they're<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.000> score<00:02:57.300> points

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
over and they're going to score points

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.630 
over and they're going to score points
and<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.290> says<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.560> score<00:02:58.800> only<00:02:59.010> singles

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
and so it says you score only singles

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.970 
and so it says you score only singles
well<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.630> dice<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.080> we're<00:03:01.230> on<00:03:01.380> there<00:03:01.650> were<00:03:01.920> a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
well the dice that we're on there were a

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.310 
well the dice that we're on there were a
six<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.490> A<00:03:02.580> two<00:03:02.610> there<00:03:03.300> are<00:03:03.420> no<00:03:03.570> singles<00:03:04.110> there

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
six and A two there are no singles there

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.170 
six and A two there are no singles there
so<00:03:04.770> they<00:03:04.920> score<00:03:05.250> no<00:03:05.430> points<00:03:05.460> after<00:03:05.940> flipping

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
so they score no points after flipping

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.260 
so they score no points after flipping
the<00:03:06.390> tile<00:03:06.600> wonderful<00:03:07.880> then<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.000> game<00:03:09.120> would

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
the tile wonderful then the game would

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.030 
the tile wonderful then the game would
continue<00:03:09.690> on<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.170> be<00:03:10.290> more<00:03:10.440> rolling<00:03:10.860> and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
continue on to be more rolling and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.430 
continue on to be more rolling and
placing<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:11.850> let's<00:03:12.060> say<00:03:12.270> blue<00:03:12.570> placed<00:03:12.870> here

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
placing so let's say blue placed here

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.020 
placing so let's say blue placed here
and<00:03:13.740> read<00:03:13.890> placed<00:03:14.160> here<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.550> then<00:03:14.640> on<00:03:14.730> blues

turn<00:03:15.410> he<00:03:16.410> wants<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.739> flip<00:03:16.890> this<00:03:17.070> tile<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.489> he's

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
turn he wants to flip this tile so he's

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.070 
turn he wants to flip this tile so he's
going<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.820> flip<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.360> you'll<00:03:18.900> see<00:03:19.050> that

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
going to flip it and you'll see that

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.970 
going to flip it and you'll see that
this<00:03:19.290> tile<00:03:19.560> says<00:03:20.390> score<00:03:21.390> only<00:03:22.260> doubles<00:03:22.739> or

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
this tile says score only doubles or

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.880 
this tile says score only doubles or
higher<00:03:23.250> well<00:03:24.000> there's<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.930> doubles<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.470> six<00:03:25.709> out

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
higher well there's a doubles of six out

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.630 
higher well there's a doubles of six out
there<00:03:26.100> so<00:03:26.280> he'll<00:03:26.459> score<00:03:26.760> 12<00:03:27.090> points<00:03:27.600> and

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
there so he'll score 12 points and

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.560 
there so he'll score 12 points and
essentially<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.700> game<00:03:29.880> goes<00:03:30.060> on<00:03:30.239> like<00:03:30.420> this

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
essentially the game goes on like this

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.300 
essentially the game goes on like this
until<00:03:30.630> either<00:03:31.290> all<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.860> dice<00:03:32.040> have<00:03:32.190> been

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
until either all of the dice have been

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.740 
until either all of the dice have been
played<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:32.760> then<00:03:32.880> all<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.239> tiles<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.540> can

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
played and then all the tiles that can

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.720 
played and then all the tiles that can
be<00:03:33.840> flipped<00:03:33.989> or<00:03:34.170> flipped<00:03:34.489> really<00:03:35.489> thats

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
be flipped or flipped really thats

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.800 
be flipped or flipped really thats
that's<00:03:35.910> actually<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.239> only<00:03:36.360> way<00:03:36.600> for<00:03:36.750> the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
that's actually the only way for the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.570 
that's actually the only way for the
game<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.080> end<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:37.440> once<00:03:37.650> all<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.100> dice<00:03:38.280> the

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
game to end so once all of the dice the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.680 
game to end so once all of the dice the
dice<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:38.880> been<00:03:39.000> played<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.330> everybody's

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
dice have been played and everybody's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.509 
dice have been played and everybody's
flipped<00:03:39.900> any<00:03:40.110> tiles<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.470> they<00:03:40.620> can<00:03:40.860> flip<00:03:41.130> the

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
flipped any tiles that they can flip the

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.759 
flipped any tiles that they can flip the
game<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:41.790> going<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.030> end<00:03:42.269> now<00:03:43.230> there<00:03:43.440> are<00:03:43.470> these

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
game is going to end now there are these

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.160 
game is going to end now there are these
three<00:03:44.250> special<00:03:44.940> or<00:03:45.120> four<00:03:45.480> special<00:03:45.959> white

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
three special or four special white

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.100 
three special or four special white
tiles<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:46.890> white<00:03:47.580> tiles<00:03:47.880> modify<00:03:48.600> or<00:03:48.930> they

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
tiles and the white tiles modify or they

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.360 
tiles and the white tiles modify or they
give<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.410> special<00:03:49.680> action<00:03:50.160> during<00:03:50.280> the

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
give you a special action during the

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.180 
give you a special action during the
game<00:03:50.550> so<00:03:50.580> this<00:03:50.820> one<00:03:50.970> says<00:03:51.180> after<00:03:51.510> rolling<00:03:52.350> may

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
game so this one says after rolling may

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.520 
game so this one says after rolling may
put<00:03:53.519> two<00:03:53.880> dice<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.450> any<00:03:54.720> tile<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.290> rules

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
put two dice on any tile and the rules

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.780 
put two dice on any tile and the rules
generally<00:03:55.800> say<00:03:56.160> that<00:03:56.310> when<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.489> roll<00:03:56.670> you

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
generally say that when you roll you

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.940 
generally say that when you roll you
might<00:03:56.910> only<00:03:57.030> put<00:03:57.269> one<00:03:57.300> guy<00:03:57.600> on<00:03:58.019> a<00:03:58.050> tile<00:03:58.350> so<00:03:58.830> this

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
might only put one guy on a tile so this

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.710 
might only put one guy on a tile so this
one<00:03:59.130> allows<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.580> once<00:03:59.880> per<00:04:00.120> during<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.450> game

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
one allows you once per during the game

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.720 
one allows you once per during the game
to<00:04:00.959> place<00:04:01.380> an<00:04:01.530> extra<00:04:01.830> Diana<00:04:02.190> tile<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.519> maybe

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
to place an extra Diana tile to maybe

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.100 
to place an extra Diana tile to maybe
get<00:04:02.880> an<00:04:03.000> advantage<00:04:03.300> to<00:04:03.450> allow<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.900> flip

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
get an advantage to allow you to flip

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.990 
get an advantage to allow you to flip
that<00:04:04.290> tile<00:04:04.620> however<00:04:05.400> since<00:04:05.550> you<00:04:05.670> don't<00:04:05.880> know

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
that tile however since you don't know

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.340 
that tile however since you don't know
what's<00:04:06.209> under<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.510> tile<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:07.050> don't<00:04:07.230> know

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
what's under that tile you don't know

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.540 
what's under that tile you don't know
what<00:04:07.530> you'll<00:04:07.680> be<00:04:07.709> getting<00:04:07.830> when<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.310> flip<00:04:08.519> it

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
what you'll be getting when you flip it

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.080 
what you'll be getting when you flip it
as<00:04:09.380> I<00:04:10.380> said<00:04:10.650> you<00:04:10.980> play<00:04:11.190> until<00:04:11.459> all<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:11.880> tiles

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
as I said you play until all the tiles

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.790 
as I said you play until all the tiles
the<00:04:12.330> candy<00:04:12.720> flip<00:04:12.900> tab<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.320> flipped<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.709> the

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
the candy flip tab and flipped in the

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.560 
the candy flip tab and flipped in the
game<00:04:13.980> ends<00:04:14.220> sooner<00:04:14.610> whoever<00:04:14.970> has<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.390> higher

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
game ends sooner whoever has the higher

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.400 
game ends sooner whoever has the higher
point<00:04:15.959> total<00:04:16.320> wins<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:18.090> that's<00:04:18.299> de<00:04:18.660> douceur<00:04:19.169> de

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
point total wins so that's de douceur de

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.159 
point total wins so that's de douceur de
dos<00:04:19.680> or<00:04:20.010> whatever<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.519> game<00:04:20.700> is<00:04:20.850> called<00:04:21.169> and

my

my
enzyme<00:04:23.229> is<00:04:23.530> that<00:04:24.130> this<00:04:24.430> game<00:04:24.760> is<00:04:25.500> terrible

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
enzyme is that this game is terrible

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.610 
enzyme is that this game is terrible
essentially<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:28.389> have<00:04:28.419> a<00:04:28.660> handful<00:04:29.260> of<00:04:29.320> dice

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
essentially you have a handful of dice

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.530 
essentially you have a handful of dice
and<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:29.919> roll<00:04:30.160> them<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.639> you<00:04:30.940> try<00:04:31.270> your<00:04:31.510> best

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
and you roll them and you try your best

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.180 
and you roll them and you try your best
to<00:04:31.840> match<00:04:32.080> your<00:04:32.380> dice<00:04:32.590> up<00:04:32.889> with<00:04:33.070> your

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
to match your dice up with your

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.590 
to match your dice up with your
opponent's<00:04:33.610> die<00:04:33.729> so<00:04:33.940> that<00:04:33.970> they<00:04:34.180> can't<00:04:34.389> flip

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
opponent's die so that they can't flip

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.140 
opponent's die so that they can't flip
anything<00:04:34.990> over<00:04:35.290> or<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.370> get<00:04:36.550> on<00:04:36.729> two<00:04:36.850> separate

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
anything over or to get on two separate

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.790 
anything over or to get on two separate
tiles<00:04:37.570> so<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:37.990> can<00:04:38.169> flip<00:04:38.380> something

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
tiles so that you can flip something

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.830 
tiles so that you can flip something
over<00:04:39.070> but<00:04:39.520> all<00:04:39.729> the<00:04:39.940> while<00:04:40.120> you<00:04:40.419> have<00:04:40.540> no

control over the rolling you have no

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.600 
control over the rolling you have no
idea<00:04:43.720> as<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.320> what's<00:04:44.680> underneath<00:04:45.010> that<00:04:45.280> tile

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.570 
idea as to what's underneath that tile
and<00:04:45.940> half<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.630> time<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:47.169> tiles<00:04:47.560> don't<00:04:48.190> really

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
and half the time the tiles don't really

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.219 
and half the time the tiles don't really
tell<00:04:48.790> you<00:04:48.910> exactly<00:04:49.449> what<00:04:49.690> they<00:04:49.870> mean<00:04:50.110> in

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
tell you exactly what they mean in

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.140 
tell you exactly what they mean in
scoring<00:04:50.620> score<00:04:51.190> only<00:04:51.340> singles<00:04:51.880> well<00:04:52.030> does

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
scoring score only singles well does

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.480 
scoring score only singles well does
that<00:04:52.180> mean<00:04:52.330> that<00:04:52.479> I<00:04:52.660> only<00:04:52.960> score<00:04:53.260> I<00:04:53.500> die<00:04:54.190> that

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
that mean that I only score I die that

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.159 
that mean that I only score I die that
is<00:04:54.699> the<00:04:54.880> only<00:04:55.030> type<00:04:55.389> of<00:04:55.419> that<00:04:55.690> died<00:04:55.840> there<00:04:56.020> for

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
is the only type of that died there for

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.750 
is the only type of that died there for
example<00:04:56.440> if<00:04:56.530> it's<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.740> only<00:04:56.860> to<00:04:57.160> do<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.430> score

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
example if it's the only to do I score

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.510 
example if it's the only to do I score
that<00:04:57.940> one<00:04:58.090> because<00:04:58.210> it's<00:04:58.449> a<00:04:58.539> single<00:04:59.370> or<00:05:00.370> does

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
that one because it's a single or does

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.920 
that one because it's a single or does
it<00:05:00.550> mean<00:05:00.760> that<00:05:00.789> I<00:05:00.940> only<00:05:01.210> scored<00:05:01.479> dice<00:05:01.660> there

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
it mean that I only scored dice there

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.580 
it mean that I only scored dice there
with<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.110> one<00:05:02.320> value<00:05:02.770> I<00:05:02.949> don't<00:05:03.340> know<00:05:04.590> but

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
with the one value I don't know but

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.350 
with the one value I don't know but
really<00:05:05.919> the<00:05:06.310> winning<00:05:06.610> is<00:05:06.699> going<00:05:06.910> to<00:05:07.000> come<00:05:07.180> down

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
really the winning is going to come down

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.420 
really the winning is going to come down
to<00:05:07.419> who<00:05:07.750> ever<00:05:07.870> gets<00:05:08.110> luckier<00:05:08.590> and<00:05:08.710> finds<00:05:09.310> the

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
to who ever gets luckier and finds the

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.670 
to who ever gets luckier and finds the
right<00:05:09.460> tile<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:10.180> flip<00:05:10.389> over<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:10.870> gets<00:05:11.380> a<00:05:11.500> big

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
right tile to flip over and gets a big

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.469 
right tile to flip over and gets a big
score<00:05:11.979> so<00:05:12.250> some<00:05:12.580> of<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.760> titles<00:05:13.000> double<00:05:13.360> your

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
score so some of the titles double your

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.779 
score so some of the titles double your
entire<00:05:13.900> die<00:05:14.260> total<00:05:14.710> for<00:05:14.889> the<00:05:14.979> for<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.490> tile

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
entire die total for the for the tile

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.879 
entire die total for the for the tile

well some of them give you score only

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.150 
well some of them give you score only
singles<00:05:19.289> there's<00:05:20.289> really<00:05:20.530> nothing<00:05:20.949> to<00:05:20.979> this

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160

factor to it so I would heavily suggest

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.190 
factor to it so I would heavily suggest
not<00:05:27.220> taking<00:05:27.789> a<00:05:27.880> look<00:05:28.030> at<00:05:28.150> this<00:05:28.270> game<00:05:28.570> if<00:05:28.840> you
