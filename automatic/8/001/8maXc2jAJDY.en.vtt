minifigure actually fit in there the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.910 
minifigure actually fit in there the
answer<00:03:09.049> is<00:03:09.200> kind<00:03:09.590> of<00:03:09.829> yes<00:03:11.260> where<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.410> seat<00:03:12.680> is

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
answer is kind of yes where the seat is

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.640

just<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.419> see<00:05:13.570> how<00:05:13.690> far<00:05:13.900> it<00:05:14.080> might<00:05:14.320> go<00:05:14.590> you<00:05:15.550> can

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
just to see how far it might go you can

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.420 
just to see how far it might go you can
easily<00:05:16.060> get<00:05:16.419> this<00:05:16.570> to<00:05:16.690> go<00:05:16.810> 2025<00:05:17.650> feet<00:05:17.680> or<00:05:18.100> even

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
easily get this to go 2025 feet or even

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.490 
easily get this to go 2025 feet or even
more<00:05:18.669> there<00:05:19.480> is<00:05:19.600> a<00:05:19.630> certain<00:05:19.990> point<00:05:20.169> where<00:05:20.470> you

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
more there is a certain point where you

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.920 
more there is a certain point where you
pull<00:05:20.950> it<00:05:21.070> back<00:05:21.100> and<00:05:21.550> it<00:05:21.700> does<00:05:21.940> stop<00:05:22.330> it<00:05:22.600> so<00:05:22.840> you

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
pull it back and it does stop it so you

it's a really cool design and like I

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.630 
it's a really cool design and like I
showed<00:05:58.480> you<00:05:58.540> guys<00:05:58.780> you<00:05:59.680> can<00:05:59.950> put<00:05:59.980> a<00:06:00.190> minifigure

in<00:06:00.910> here<00:06:01.090> you<00:06:01.510> can<00:06:01.660> either<00:06:01.870> do<00:06:02.169> it<00:06:02.320> you<00:06:02.800> know

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
in here you can either do it you know

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.400 
in here you can either do it you know
like<00:06:03.070> I<00:06:03.190> showed<00:06:03.840> leaving<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:04.990> seat<00:06:05.200> the<00:06:05.320> way

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
like I showed leaving the seat the way

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.460 
like I showed leaving the seat the way
it<00:06:05.560> is<00:06:05.710> or<00:06:05.980> just<00:06:06.220> doing<00:06:06.400> that<00:06:06.640> small

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
it is or just doing that small

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.050 
it is or just doing that small
modification<00:06:08.470> taking<00:06:08.950> off<00:06:09.190> the<00:06:09.640> bottom<00:06:09.940> of

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
modification taking off the bottom of

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.150 
modification taking off the bottom of
the<00:06:10.150> seat<00:06:10.390> you<00:06:10.990> can<00:06:11.020> easily<00:06:11.410> get<00:06:11.710> a<00:06:11.740> minifigure

the seat you can easily get a minifigure
in<00:06:12.430> there<00:06:12.960> so<00:06:13.960> I<00:06:14.020> think<00:06:14.260> that's<00:06:14.530> kind<00:06:14.740> of<00:06:14.890> cool

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
in there so I think that's kind of cool

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.380 
in there so I think that's kind of cool
you<00:06:15.460> know<00:06:15.550> to<00:06:15.729> be<00:06:15.820> able<00:06:15.910> to<00:06:16.060> put<00:06:16.180> them<00:06:16.300> any

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
you know to be able to put them any

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.279 
you know to be able to put them any
figure<00:06:16.660> in<00:06:16.780> there<00:06:16.930> and

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
figure in there and

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.549 
figure in there and
use<00:06:17.439> it<00:06:17.589> as<00:06:17.740> a<00:06:17.770> race<00:06:18.039> car<00:06:18.960> rolls<00:06:19.960> really<00:06:20.259> nice

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:20.559 
use it as a race car rolls really nice

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:25.589 
use it as a race car rolls really nice
really<00:06:21.309> smooth<00:06:22.770> but<00:06:23.770> yeah<00:06:23.919> just<00:06:24.300> it's<00:06:25.300> a<00:06:25.419> cool

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 
really smooth but yeah just it's a cool

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:29.639 
really smooth but yeah just it's a cool
design<00:06:25.749> ok<00:06:26.439> here's<00:06:26.710> one<00:06:26.949> thing<00:06:27.159> though<00:06:28.649> we

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:29.649 
design ok here's one thing though we

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:31.139 
design ok here's one thing though we
have<00:06:29.830> a<00:06:29.860> dog<00:06:30.129> in<00:06:30.309> our<00:06:30.339> house<00:06:30.520> and<00:06:30.729> he<00:06:30.819> sheds<00:06:31.059> a

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:34.659 
lot so there's hair on the ground if

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:36.179 
lot so there's hair on the ground if
you're<00:06:34.869> not<00:06:35.020> careful<00:06:35.259> you're<00:06:35.680> gonna<00:06:35.740> pick<00:06:36.069> up

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:36.189

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
anyways the engine the mechanism itself

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.369 
anyways the engine the mechanism itself
is<00:06:42.909> really<00:06:43.210> self-contained<00:06:43.930> so<00:06:44.169> you're<00:06:44.319> not

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:44.379 
is really self-contained so you're not

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:47.649 
going to get stuff inside of it to

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:49.829 
going to get stuff inside of it to
really<00:06:47.949> mess<00:06:48.189> with<00:06:48.369> it<00:06:48.520> but<00:06:49.059> you<00:06:49.180> you<00:06:49.479> run<00:06:49.689> this

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:49.839
