okay<00:00:03.110> what<00:00:03.320> we're<00:00:03.440> going<00:00:03.530> to<00:00:03.620> do<00:00:03.770> now<00:00:04.040> is<00:00:04.370> show

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
okay what we're going to do now is show

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.600 
okay what we're going to do now is show
you<00:00:05.029> the<00:00:05.480> router<00:00:05.810> plate<00:00:06.230> in<00:00:06.500> action<00:00:07.100> and<00:00:07.310> as

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
you the router plate in action and as

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.749 
you the router plate in action and as
we've<00:00:07.820> said<00:00:08.090> previously<00:00:09.040> the<00:00:10.040> track<00:00:10.370> system

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
we've said previously the track system

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.879 
we've said previously the track system
coupled<00:00:11.599> with<00:00:11.629> the<00:00:11.839> router<00:00:12.080> what<00:00:12.530> it<00:00:12.650> does

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
coupled with the router what it does

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.549 
coupled with the router what it does
exceptionally<00:00:13.459> well<00:00:14.059> is<00:00:14.389> it<00:00:15.079> does<00:00:15.259> straight

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
exceptionally well is it does straight

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.279 
exceptionally well is it does straight
line<00:00:15.740> routing<00:00:16.420> so<00:00:17.420> if<00:00:17.539> we<00:00:17.689> wanted<00:00:17.929> to<00:00:18.050> cut<00:00:18.260> a

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
line routing so if we wanted to cut a

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.779 
line routing so if we wanted to cut a
groove<00:00:18.590> in<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:18.890> in<00:00:19.099> the<00:00:19.250> edge<00:00:19.400> of<00:00:19.640> this<00:00:19.730> a

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
groove in the in the edge of this a

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.200 
groove in the in the edge of this a
rabbet<00:00:20.390> so<00:00:20.869> we<00:00:21.050> could<00:00:21.170> recess<00:00:21.560> in<00:00:21.769> the<00:00:21.830> back

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
rabbet so we could recess in the back

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.939 
rabbet so we could recess in the back
trying<00:00:23.210> to<00:00:23.300> do<00:00:23.449> that<00:00:23.599> freehand<00:00:24.230> or<00:00:24.439> with<00:00:24.769> any

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
trying to do that freehand or with any

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.620 
trying to do that freehand or with any
kind<00:00:25.189> of<00:00:25.250> other<00:00:25.400> guy<00:00:25.609> it<00:00:25.670> can<00:00:25.880> be<00:00:26.000> difficult

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
kind of other guy it can be difficult

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.540 
kind of other guy it can be difficult
dedos<00:00:27.410> right<00:00:27.650> on<00:00:27.800> down<00:00:27.919> the<00:00:28.009> line<00:00:28.250> so<00:00:28.460> what

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
dedos right on down the line so what

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.740 
dedos right on down the line so what
we've<00:00:28.699> done<00:00:28.849> here<00:00:29.060> is<00:00:29.179> we've<00:00:29.330> kept<00:00:29.630> the

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
we've done here is we've kept the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.440 
we've done here is we've kept the
quarter-inch<00:00:30.140> bit<00:00:30.560> in<00:00:30.740> there<00:00:31.039> and<00:00:31.390> there's<00:00:32.390> a

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
quarter-inch bit in there and there's a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.569 
quarter-inch bit in there and there's a
couple<00:00:32.840> notches<00:00:33.050> on<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:33.649> side<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.460> what

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
couple notches on the side and what

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.970 
couple notches on the side and what
those<00:00:34.789> notches<00:00:35.030> do<00:00:35.510> is<00:00:35.780> they<00:00:36.440> line<00:00:36.739> you

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
those notches do is they line you

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.240 
those notches do is they line you
directly<00:00:37.550> up<00:00:37.789> with<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:38.750> router<00:00:39.020> bit<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:40.100> it

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
directly up with the router bit so it

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.160 
directly up with the router bit so it
takes<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.610> guesswork<00:00:40.640> out<00:00:41.090> of<00:00:41.329> where's<00:00:41.899> the

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
takes the guesswork out of where's the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.160 
takes the guesswork out of where's the
bit<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:43.370> what<00:00:43.550> we<00:00:43.670> can<00:00:43.820> do<00:00:44.000> is<00:00:44.239> simply<00:00:44.660> take<00:00:44.899> and

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
bit so what we can do is simply take and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.979 
bit so what we can do is simply take and
bring<00:00:45.379> this<00:00:45.590> forward<00:00:46.059> and<00:00:47.059> just<00:00:47.480> Center<00:00:47.780> the

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
bring this forward and just Center the

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.900 
bring this forward and just Center the
edge<00:00:48.469> of<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:48.739> board<00:00:48.920> up<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:49.309> those<00:00:49.670> notches

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
edge of the board up and those notches

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.479 
edge of the board up and those notches
if<00:00:50.329> you<00:00:50.420> want<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:50.690> half<00:00:50.960> a<00:00:51.109> cut<00:00:51.350> or<00:00:52.039> in<00:00:52.160> this<00:00:52.219> case

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
if you want a half a cut or in this case

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.849 
if you want a half a cut or in this case
we<00:00:52.730> want<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.000> full<00:00:53.269> quarter<00:00:53.629> inch<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.710> what

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
we want the full quarter inch so what

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.170 
we want the full quarter inch so what
we're<00:00:55.010> going<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:55.219> do<00:00:55.430> is<00:00:55.609> we're<00:00:55.760> going<00:00:55.789> to<00:00:55.910> come

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
we're going to do is we're going to come

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.380 
we're going to do is we're going to come
in<00:00:56.329> here<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:56.899> go<00:00:57.440> right<00:00:57.469> out<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:57.949> edge<00:00:58.390> now

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
in here and go right out to the edge now

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.110 
in here and go right out to the edge now
the<00:00:59.780> track<00:01:00.079> system<00:01:00.710> is<00:01:00.829> designed<00:01:01.039> to<00:01:01.609> stick<00:01:01.969> in

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
the track system is designed to stick in

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.960 
the track system is designed to stick in
place<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.809> it<00:01:03.769> does<00:01:03.949> that<00:01:04.190> well<00:01:04.430> with<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.610> saw

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
place and it does that well with a saw

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.929 
place and it does that well with a saw
because<00:01:05.420> your<00:01:05.600> pressure<00:01:05.900> is<00:01:06.170> down<00:01:06.939> however

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
because your pressure is down however

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.510 
because your pressure is down however
with<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.450> router<00:01:08.860> you've<00:01:09.860> got<00:01:10.040> some<00:01:10.310> down

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
with a router you've got some down

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.190 
with a router you've got some down
pressure<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.240> you've<00:01:11.450> got<00:01:11.600> a<00:01:11.630> lot<00:01:11.840> of<00:01:11.960> side

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
pressure and you've got a lot of side

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.249 
pressure and you've got a lot of side
pressure<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.549> what<00:01:13.729> we<00:01:13.909> have<00:01:14.119> done<00:01:14.360> is<00:01:14.720> we<00:01:15.140> have

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
pressure so what we have done is we have

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.100 
pressure so what we have done is we have
introduced<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:16.100> toggle<00:01:16.909> clamps<00:01:17.299> system<00:01:17.900> and

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
introduced a toggle clamps system and

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.560 
introduced a toggle clamps system and
how<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.100> works<00:01:19.369> is<00:01:19.640> really<00:01:19.759> very<00:01:20.000> simple

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
how this works is really very simple

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.710 
how this works is really very simple
this<00:01:21.320> slides<00:01:21.770> into<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.159> bottom<00:01:22.579> and<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.689> you

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
this slides into the bottom and so you

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.789 
this slides into the bottom and so you
bring<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.320> over<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:25.990> see<00:01:26.990> where<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:27.500> want<00:01:27.710> to

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
bring this over to see where you want to

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.569 
bring this over to see where you want to
line<00:01:28.009> up<00:01:28.220> at<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:29.390> everything<00:01:30.170> is<00:01:30.350> just<00:01:31.040> what

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
line up at and everything is just what

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.969 
line up at and everything is just what
we<00:01:31.700> wanted<00:01:31.970> that<00:01:32.119> right<00:01:32.329> there<00:01:32.860> then<00:01:33.860> you

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
we wanted that right there then you

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.789 
we wanted that right there then you
simply<00:01:34.399> take<00:01:34.430> your<00:01:34.670> toggle<00:01:35.329> and<00:01:35.619> slide<00:01:36.619> it

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
simply take your toggle and slide it

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.469 
simply take your toggle and slide it
into<00:01:36.979> one<00:01:37.220> of<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.399> connected<00:01:37.880> ribs<00:01:38.119> on<00:01:38.360> the

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
into one of the connected ribs on the

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.929 
into one of the connected ribs on the
bottom<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.229> lock<00:01:39.680> it<00:01:39.860> down<00:01:40.040> now<00:01:40.340> at<00:01:40.850> that

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
bottom and lock it down now at that

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.429 
bottom and lock it down now at that
point<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.570> don't<00:01:41.600> need<00:01:41.899> a<00:01:41.930> lot<00:01:42.110> of<00:01:42.140> pressure

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
point you don't need a lot of pressure

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.910 
point you don't need a lot of pressure
we're<00:01:43.220> locked<00:01:43.460> in<00:01:43.640> place<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.119> ready<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.360> go

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
we're locked in place and ready to go

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.319 
we're locked in place and ready to go
and<00:01:45.920> we're<00:01:46.040> going<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.189> slide<00:01:46.579> down<00:01:46.610> here<00:01:46.939> to

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
and we're going to slide down here to

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.679 
and we're going to slide down here to
the<00:01:47.450> other<00:01:47.600> end

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.700 

and<00:01:50.869> we're<00:01:51.740> going<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.039> repeat<00:01:52.399> that<00:01:52.429> process

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
and we're going to repeat that process

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.230 
and we're going to repeat that process
and<00:01:54.710> again<00:01:55.310> we're<00:01:55.460> going<00:01:55.549> to<00:01:55.640> slip<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:55.999> toggle

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
and again we're going to slip a toggle

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.529 
and again we're going to slip a toggle
clamp<00:01:56.600> in<00:01:56.840> there<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:58.759> make<00:01:59.179> sure<00:01:59.210> that

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
clamp in there and make sure that

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.770 
clamp in there and make sure that
everything<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.520> locked<00:02:01.520> down<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.210> ready<00:02:02.689> to

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
everything is locked down and ready to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.020 
everything is locked down and ready to
go<00:02:05.319> just<00:02:06.319> like<00:02:06.439> that

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
go just like that

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.930 
go just like that
so<00:02:08.030> there's<00:02:08.239> our<00:02:08.390> setup<00:02:09.519> now<00:02:10.519> we're<00:02:10.729> going<00:02:10.849> to

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
so there's our setup now we're going to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.930 
so there's our setup now we're going to
make<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.239> cut<00:02:11.569> half<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.230> thickness<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.980> our

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
make that cut half the thickness of our

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.360 
make that cut half the thickness of our
board<00:02:14.269> and<00:02:14.540> since<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.290> fairly<00:02:15.590> thin

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
board and since this is a fairly thin

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.160 
board and since this is a fairly thin
board<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.970> start<00:02:17.239> off<00:02:17.420> with<00:02:17.660> we'll<00:02:17.870> just<00:02:18.049> go

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
board to start off with we'll just go

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.140 
board to start off with we'll just go
ahead<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.440> make<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.739> adjustment<00:02:18.860> in<00:02:19.459> one

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
ahead and make that adjustment in one

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.729 
ahead and make that adjustment in one
pass<00:02:21.459> obviously<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.580> want<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.849> use<00:02:23.590> what<00:02:24.590> ever

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
pass obviously you want to use what ever

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.740 
pass obviously you want to use what ever
the<00:02:24.890> router<00:02:25.040> tells<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.760> do<00:02:25.970> as<00:02:26.239> far<00:02:26.540> as<00:02:26.569> the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
the router tells you to do as far as the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.059 
the router tells you to do as far as the
depth<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.110> cut<00:02:27.319> in<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.620> router<00:02:27.799> bit

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
depth of cut in the router bit

00:02:28.069 --> 00:03:01.080 
depth of cut in the router bit
manufacturer<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:31.280> here<00:02:31.790> we<00:02:31.910> go

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.620 

and<00:03:02.200> just<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.410> easily<00:03:04.060> we're<00:03:05.060> able<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.420> come

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
and just that easily we're able to come

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.470 
and just that easily we're able to come
in<00:03:05.810> there<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.290> with<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.620> kind<00:03:06.800> of<00:03:06.950> control

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
in there and with that kind of control

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.400 
in there and with that kind of control
cut<00:03:08.480> 1/4<00:03:08.900> inch<00:03:09.200> in<00:03:09.350> this<00:03:09.470> case<00:03:09.770> rabbit<00:03:10.370> and

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
cut 1/4 inch in this case rabbit and

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.820 
cut 1/4 inch in this case rabbit and
from<00:03:12.410> setup<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.970> completion<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:15.410> count<00:03:15.620> along

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
from setup to completion so count along

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.700 
from setup to completion so count along
so<00:03:16.730> if<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.030> want<00:03:17.210> to<00:03:17.270> make<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.540> easier<00:03:17.900> do<00:03:18.590> it

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
so if you want to make it easier do it

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.580 
so if you want to make it easier do it
the<00:03:18.800> tree<00:03:18.980> track<00:03:19.220> way<00:03:19.430> Thanks<00:03:20.330> okay<00:03:21.170> now<00:03:21.350> once

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
the tree track way Thanks okay now once

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.440 
the tree track way Thanks okay now once
we<00:03:21.800> have<00:03:21.830> got<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.400> rabbit<00:03:22.640> cut<00:03:23.120> on<00:03:23.330> the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
we have got the rabbit cut on the

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.290 
we have got the rabbit cut on the
backside<00:03:24.020> our<00:03:24.470> next<00:03:24.890> step<00:03:25.100> would<00:03:25.760> be<00:03:25.820> to<00:03:25.970> cut<00:03:26.270> a

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
backside our next step would be to cut a

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.860 
backside our next step would be to cut a
dado<00:03:26.630> cross<00:03:27.290> grain<00:03:27.940> with<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:29.090> bigger<00:03:29.330> bit<00:03:29.660> so

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
dado cross grain with a bigger bit so

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.910 
dado cross grain with a bigger bit so
what<00:03:30.020> we're<00:03:30.110> going<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.260> do<00:03:30.440> is<00:03:30.590> we're<00:03:30.770> going<00:03:30.860> to

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.610 
what we're going to do is we're going to
swap<00:03:31.220> out<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.670> bigger<00:03:31.940> bit<00:03:32.180> here<00:03:32.570> and<00:03:32.750> when

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
swap out to a bigger bit here and when

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.080 
swap out to a bigger bit here and when
you<00:03:33.710> do<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.070> you're<00:03:34.250> going<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.460> enlarge<00:03:34.760> the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
you do that you're going to enlarge the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.340 
you do that you're going to enlarge the
hole<00:03:35.300> where<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.600> router<00:03:35.780> bit<00:03:36.020> goes<00:03:36.170> through

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
hole where the router bit goes through

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.220 
hole where the router bit goes through
the<00:03:36.440> plate<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.830> that's<00:03:36.890> perfectly<00:03:37.370> okay

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
the plate and that's perfectly okay

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.450 
the plate and that's perfectly okay
you're<00:03:39.230> then<00:03:39.470> going<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.740> use<00:03:39.980> your<00:03:40.220> notches

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
you're then going to use your notches

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.700 
you're then going to use your notches
let's<00:03:41.420> say<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:41.660> we're<00:03:41.780> going<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.930> put<00:03:42.170> a<00:03:42.380> half
