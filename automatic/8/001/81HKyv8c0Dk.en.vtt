of these boards as you can see I've got

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.740 
of these boards as you can see I've got
a<00:01:34.170> little<00:01:34.380> bit<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.650> an<00:01:34.740> issue<00:01:34.950> here<00:01:35.420> my<00:01:36.420> deck

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
a little bit of an issue here my deck

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.660 
a little bit of an issue here my deck
I've<00:01:37.619> got<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.689> stone<00:01:39.689> walk<00:01:40.049> around<00:01:40.439> at<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> base

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
I've got a stone walk around at the base

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
I've got a stone walk around at the base
of<00:01:41.850> my<00:01:41.939> deck<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.869> kind<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.200> jetted<00:01:43.560> out

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
of my deck and that kind of jetted out

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.889 
of my deck and that kind of jetted out
right<00:01:44.640> exactly<00:01:45.630> where<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.320> guess<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:48.630> top

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
right exactly where I guess the the top

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.499 
right exactly where I guess the the top
right<00:01:49.259> corner<00:01:49.530> came<00:01:49.950> together<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.579> kind<00:01:51.450> of

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
right corner came together so I kind of

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.999 
right corner came together so I kind of
did<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> little<00:01:51.930> bit<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.229> jury-rigged<00:01:52.740> here

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
did a little bit of a jury-rigged here

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.980 
did a little bit of a jury-rigged here
and<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.220> think<00:01:53.399> it'll<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:53.670> fine<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.180> came<00:01:54.390> level

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and I think it'll be fine I came level

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
and I think it'll be fine I came level
with<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> stone<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.890> force<00:01:56.130> comes<00:01:56.340> to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
with the stone so if force comes to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.490 
with the stone so if force comes to
worse<00:01:56.780> one<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> footings<00:01:58.259> will<00:01:58.380> be

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
worse one of the footings will be

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.160 
worse one of the footings will be
actually<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.369> under<00:01:59.880> stone<00:02:00.119> now<00:02:00.899> we're

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
actually on the under stone now we're

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.630 
actually on the under stone now we're
going<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.380> notice<00:02:01.530> here

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640

and then I've got two and a half yards
of<00:03:07.820> what<00:03:08.820> they<00:03:08.970> call<00:03:09.209> bricks<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.959> now<00:03:10.860> I'm

going to bring in and I'll be camping
that<00:03:13.260> down<00:03:13.500> laying<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.370> down<00:03:14.430> layer<00:03:14.790> by

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
that down laying that down layer by

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.400 
that down laying that down layer by
layer<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.360> then<00:03:15.450> tamping<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.930> down<00:03:15.989> and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
layer and then tamping it down and

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.039 
layer and then tamping it down and
taking<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.130> up<00:03:17.220> level<00:03:17.910> with<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.269> boards<00:03:18.840> and

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
taking it up level with the boards and

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.259 
taking it up level with the boards and
hopefully<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.070> will<00:03:20.130> give<00:03:20.280> me<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.640> level

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
hopefully that will give me the level

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.539 
hopefully that will give me the level
space<00:03:21.600> that<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.870> need<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:26.100> pool<00:03:26.340> goes

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
space that I need so that the pool goes

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.300 
space that I need so that the pool goes
up<00:03:26.730> on<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:26.940> completely<00:03:27.420> level<00:03:27.870> surface

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
up on a completely level surface

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.819 
up on a completely level surface
otherwise<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.670> think<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.780> pool<00:03:31.260> holds<00:03:31.590> about

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
otherwise I think the pool holds about

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.569 
otherwise I think the pool holds about
4,500<00:03:32.820> gallons<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.570> water<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.079> that's<00:03:34.890> 4,500

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
4,500 gallons of water and that's 4,500

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.880 
4,500 gallons of water and that's 4,500
gallons<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:36.030> water<00:03:36.209> that's<00:03:36.510> going<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.780> go<00:03:36.930> very

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
gallons of water that's going to go very

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.100 
gallons of water that's going to go very
close<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.459> house<00:03:38.810> it's<00:03:39.810> got<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.049> go

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
close to the house it's got to go

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.600 
close to the house it's got to go
somewhere<00:03:40.350> now<00:03:40.950> here's<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.250> other<00:03:41.280> thing

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610

to<00:04:19.930> get<00:04:20.280> as<00:04:21.280> much<00:04:21.459> sand<00:04:21.790> in<00:04:22.000> here<00:04:22.210> you<00:04:22.330> can<00:04:22.480> see

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
to get as much sand in here you can see

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.640 
to get as much sand in here you can see
from<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:24.010> edges<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:24.550> they're<00:04:24.700> still<00:04:25.650> still

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
from the edges that they're still still

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.920 
from the edges that they're still still
quite<00:04:26.920> a<00:04:26.950> bit<00:04:27.130> but<00:04:27.250> I've<00:04:27.370> got<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.610> come<00:04:27.730> up<00:04:27.930> in

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
quite a bit but I've got to come up in

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.480 
quite a bit but I've got to come up in
some<00:04:29.200> spots<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.860> little<00:04:30.760> more<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:33.100> you<00:04:33.130> can<00:04:33.310> see

some spots a little more so you can see

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.210 
some spots a little more so you can see
this<00:04:33.670> is<00:04:33.850> certainly<00:04:34.600> back-breaking<00:04:35.050> work<00:04:35.290> so

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
this is certainly back-breaking work so

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.970 
this is certainly back-breaking work so

long<00:06:25.060> enough<00:06:25.300> I<00:06:25.450> had<00:06:25.570> a<00:06:25.600> 10<00:06:25.840> foot<00:06:27.030> what<00:06:28.030> is<00:06:28.120> that

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
long enough I had a 10 foot what is that

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.620 
long enough I had a 10 foot what is that
that's<00:06:28.600> a<00:06:28.900> 12<00:06:29.440> by<00:06:31.230> was<00:06:32.230> that<00:06:32.700> 12<00:06:33.700> inches<00:06:34.150> yeah

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
that's a 12 by was that 12 inches yeah

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.480 
that's a 12 by was that 12 inches yeah
10<00:06:34.990> 10<00:06:35.380> by<00:06:35.530> 2<00:06:35.590> okay

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
10 10 by 2 okay

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.650 
10 10 by 2 okay
they're<00:06:36.790> boats<00:06:37.030> and<00:06:37.240> you<00:06:38.050> take<00:06:38.200> your<00:06:38.230> level

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
they're boats and you take your level

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.900 
they're boats and you take your level
better<00:06:40.660> to<00:06:40.840> use<00:06:41.020> a<00:06:41.050> fairly<00:06:41.830> long<00:06:42.040> level<00:06:42.370> the

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
better to use a fairly long level the

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.880 
better to use a fairly long level the
reason<00:06:43.240> being<00:06:43.420> is<00:06:43.720> you<00:06:44.110> get<00:06:44.260> a<00:06:44.290> shorter<00:06:44.620> level

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
reason being is you get a shorter level

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.500 
reason being is you get a shorter level
you're<00:06:45.040> not<00:06:45.070> going<00:06:45.280> to<00:06:45.340> get<00:06:45.460> as<00:06:45.580> accurate<00:06:45.760> of<00:06:46.120> a

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.510 
you're not going to get as accurate of a

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.660 
you're not going to get as accurate of a
read<00:06:46.870> on<00:06:47.110> the<00:06:47.380> level<00:06:47.680> that's<00:06:47.950> just<00:06:48.190> my<00:06:48.310> take<00:06:48.490> on

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:48.670 
read on the level that's just my take on

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.000 
read on the level that's just my take on
it<00:06:49.350> no<00:06:50.350> science<00:06:50.680> behind<00:06:50.740> that<00:06:51.130> of<00:06:51.160> course<00:06:51.400> and

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
it no science behind that of course and

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.830 
it no science behind that of course and
what<00:06:54.010> I've<00:06:54.130> done<00:06:54.340> as<00:06:54.550> you'll<00:06:54.850> see<00:06:55.030> here<00:06:55.300> is<00:06:55.480> I

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
what I've done as you'll see here is I

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.480 
what I've done as you'll see here is I
have<00:06:56.140> drilled<00:06:58.020> wood<00:06:59.020> and<00:06:59.290> attached<00:06:59.980> it<00:07:00.250> with

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
have drilled wood and attached it with

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.260 
have drilled wood and attached it with
twist<00:07:00.970> ties<00:07:01.120> or<00:07:01.810> speed<00:07:02.170> ties<00:07:02.760> or<00:07:03.760> zip<00:07:04.060> ties

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
twist ties or speed ties or zip ties

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.290 
twist ties or speed ties or zip ties
whatever<00:07:04.630> you<00:07:04.690> want<00:07:04.840> to<00:07:04.900> call<00:07:05.020> them<00:07:05.140> okay
