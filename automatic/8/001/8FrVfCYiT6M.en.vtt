non-ferrous surfaces we've built a robot

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.240 
non-ferrous surfaces we've built a robot
called<00:01:24.729> vortex<00:01:25.240> which<00:01:26.020> is<00:01:26.350> like<00:01:26.560> your<00:01:26.770> vacuum

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
called vortex which is like your vacuum

cleaner<00:01:27.520> there<00:01:28.210> is<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:28.390> spinning<00:01:28.780> motor<00:01:29.170> it

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
cleaner there is a spinning motor it

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.460 
cleaner there is a spinning motor it
creates<00:01:30.009> a<00:01:30.310> negative<00:01:31.060> pressure<00:01:31.330> and<00:01:31.720> this

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
creates a negative pressure and this

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.330 
creates a negative pressure and this
robot<00:01:32.979> can<00:01:33.460> climb<00:01:34.390> on<00:01:34.660> big<00:01:35.380> surfaces<00:01:36.070> on

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.270 

the<00:02:22.750> vortex<00:02:22.959> robot<00:02:23.530> can<00:02:23.739> be<00:02:23.769> used<00:02:24.070> for

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
the vortex robot can be used for

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.620 
the vortex robot can be used for
surveillance<00:02:24.489> because<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.239> can<00:02:25.390> climb

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
surveillance because you can climb

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.539 
surveillance because you can climb
buildings<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.500> will<00:02:26.680> be<00:02:26.799> very<00:02:27.040> helpful<00:02:27.400> to

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
buildings so it will be very helpful to

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.120 
buildings so it will be very helpful to
security<00:02:28.299> services<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.640> look<00:02:30.640> at<00:02:31.049> situations

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130

blades while they're out there the only

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.920

way<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.530> inspect<00:03:21.950> them<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:23.150> remove<00:03:23.690> the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
way to inspect them is to remove the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.840 
way to inspect them is to remove the
blade<00:03:24.170> bring<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.709> to<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:24.950> mainland<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:25.640> then

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
blade bring it to the mainland and then

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.509 
blade bring it to the mainland and then
to<00:03:26.060> carry<00:03:26.299> out<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.690> inspection<00:03:27.010> that's<00:03:28.010> very

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
to carry out the inspection that's very

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.000 
to carry out the inspection that's very
expensive<00:03:28.840> if<00:03:29.840> it<00:03:30.080> could<00:03:30.230> build<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.590> robot<00:03:30.980> that

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
expensive if it could build a robot that

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.550 
expensive if it could build a robot that
can<00:03:31.459> climb<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:32.180> wind<00:03:32.360> tower<00:03:32.600> reach<00:03:33.200> that

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
can climb the wind tower reach that

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.270 
can climb the wind tower reach that
blade<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.190> then<00:03:34.850> use<00:03:35.120> x-rays<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:36.170> look<00:03:36.799> at<00:03:37.099> the

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
blade and then use x-rays to look at the

blade and then use x-rays to look at the
blade<00:03:37.489> completely<00:03:38.150> then<00:03:39.019> you<00:03:39.410> would<00:03:39.560> save<00:03:39.980> a

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
blade completely then you would save a

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.240 
blade completely then you would save a
huge<00:03:40.430> amount<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:41.060> expense<00:03:41.690> so<00:03:42.680> that's<00:03:42.950> what<00:03:43.130> we

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
huge amount of expense so that's what we

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.220 
huge amount of expense so that's what we
have<00:03:43.370> done<00:03:43.400> we've<00:03:43.849> built<00:03:44.120> this<00:03:44.330> robot<00:03:44.810> called

ways to carry product things like gas
oil<00:04:16.910> is<00:04:17.269> by<00:04:17.870> using<00:04:18.560> pipelines<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:19.519> there<00:04:20.329> are

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
oil is by using pipelines and there are

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.600 
oil is by using pipelines and there are
hundreds<00:04:21.109> of<00:04:21.229> kilometres<00:04:21.889> of<00:04:21.919> pipeline

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
hundreds of kilometres of pipeline

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.659 
hundreds of kilometres of pipeline
around<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.210> world<00:04:23.419> in<00:04:23.720> Europe<00:04:24.280> which<00:04:25.280> need<00:04:25.520> to

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
around the world in Europe which need to

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.060 
around the world in Europe which need to
be<00:04:25.789> inspected<00:04:26.150> these<00:04:26.660> pipelines<00:04:27.440> are<00:04:27.710> buried

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
be inspected these pipelines are buried

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.760 
be inspected these pipelines are buried
so<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.970> only<00:04:29.120> way<00:04:29.330> to<00:04:29.389> inspect<00:04:29.990> them<00:04:30.169> is<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.590> go

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
so the only way to inspect them is to go

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.950 
so the only way to inspect them is to go
inside<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.460> pipeline<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.120> then<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.510> look<00:04:32.690> to

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
inside the pipeline and then to look to

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.260 
inside the pipeline and then to look to
see<00:04:33.200> if<00:04:33.440> there<00:04:34.160> any<00:04:34.220> cracks<00:04:34.669> in<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.030> pipeline

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
see if there any cracks in the pipeline

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.700 
see if there any cracks in the pipeline
or<00:04:35.810> if<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.169> some<00:04:36.680> part<00:04:36.889> has<00:04:37.160> collapsed<00:04:38.710> the
