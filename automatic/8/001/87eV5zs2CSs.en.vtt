with with my team from Germany with
Hamburg<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.190> think<00:00:41.700> now<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.719> few<00:00:42.870> years

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
Hamburg but I think now it's a few years

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.459 
Hamburg but I think now it's a few years
ago<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:44.570> it's<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.750> first<00:00:46.050> time<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:59.869 
professional and playing against an MLS
club<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.559> honest<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> MLS<00:00:59.250> now<00:00:59.550> it's

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
club to be honest the MLS now it's

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.319 
club to be honest the MLS now it's
getting<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.660> getting<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.559> name<00:01:02.329> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
getting it's getting to get a name the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.509 
getting it's getting to get a name the
people<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.809> Europe<00:01:04.170> know<00:01:04.439> what<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> MLS<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
people in Europe know what the MLS is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.210 
people in Europe know what the MLS is
with<00:01:05.790> what<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.510> American<00:01:06.950> American<00:01:07.950> soccer

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
with what the American American soccer

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.350 
with what the American American soccer
is<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.979> think<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
is and I think that it's going to be a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.020 
is and I think that it's going to be a
good<00:01:12.630> match<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.950> good<00:01:14.250> team<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.850> players

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
good match with a good team with players

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.890 
good match with a good team with players
that<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.770> their<00:01:16.770> standard<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.640> is

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
that now the their standard here is is

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.870 
that now the their standard here is is
higher<00:01:18.900> than<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.710> few<00:01:20.159> years<00:01:20.189> ago<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
higher than it was a few years ago and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.330 
higher than it was a few years ago and
so<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.780> think<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> nice<00:01:23.130> match

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
so I think it's going to be a nice match

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.530 
so I think it's going to be a nice match
to<00:01:23.520> play

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.140

I think we just want to go out there and

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.840 
I think we just want to go out there and
enjoy<00:01:32.210> ourselves<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:33.110> play<00:01:33.740> against<00:01:34.130> against
