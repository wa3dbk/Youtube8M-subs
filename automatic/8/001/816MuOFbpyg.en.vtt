00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
father who has two sons so the two sons

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.730 
father who has two sons so the two sons
were<00:00:41.670> brothers<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.930> father<00:00:43.200> gives<00:00:43.560> the

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
were brothers and the father gives the

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.740 
were brothers and the father gives the
two<00:00:43.920> sons<00:00:44.220> an<00:00:44.400> instruction<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
two sons an instruction and the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.900 
two sons an instruction and the
instruction<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.100> he<00:00:47.190> wants<00:00:47.430> them<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> go

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
instruction is that he wants them to go

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.900 
instruction is that he wants them to go
out<00:00:48.150> and<00:00:48.480> work<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> vineyard<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:50.400> think<00:00:50.790> it

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
out and work in the vineyard I think it

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.190 
out and work in the vineyard I think it
was<00:00:51.000> right<00:00:51.180> at<00:00:51.330> the<00:00:51.390> beginning<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> day

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
was right at the beginning of the day

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.780 
was right at the beginning of the day
that<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> father<00:00:52.890> gives<00:00:53.430> them<00:00:53.640> this

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
that the father gives them this

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.660 
that the father gives them this
instruction<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.990> think<00:00:55.170> maybe<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.430> two

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
instruction so I think maybe the two

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.570 
instruction so I think maybe the two
sons<00:00:57.000> were<00:00:57.690> there<00:00:57.750> lying<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.830> one<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.430> has

dad I shouldn't have done that

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.370 
dad I shouldn't have done that
maybe<00:03:07.910> he<00:03:08.180> thinks<00:03:08.360> I'm<00:03:08.630> being<00:03:08.840> selfish<00:03:09.200> here

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
maybe he thinks I'm being selfish here

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.200 
maybe he thinks I'm being selfish here
because<00:03:09.710> the<00:03:09.830> other<00:03:09.980> brother<00:03:10.310> he's<00:03:10.760> out<00:03:11.000> there

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
because the other brother he's out there

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
doing all the work and maybe I should be

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.250 
doing all the work and maybe I should be
helping<00:03:13.460> him<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.300> he<00:03:14.480> decides<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:15.110> himself

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
helping him and so he decides to himself

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.589 
helping him and so he decides to himself
you<00:03:15.740> know<00:03:16.190> I<00:03:16.490> better<00:03:16.970> go<00:03:17.210> as<00:03:17.450> well

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.289 

so<00:03:24.109> there<00:03:24.260> he<00:03:24.319> goes<00:03:24.530> through<00:03:25.249> the<00:03:25.730> door<00:03:25.939> as

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
so there he goes through the door as
