in this episode of the Russell Brown
show<00:00:06.120> I'm<00:00:06.480> going<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.750> be<00:00:06.839> talking<00:00:06.990> about<00:00:07.200> long

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
show I'm going to be talking about long

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.240 
show I'm going to be talking about long
exposure<00:00:08.550> night<00:00:08.970> photography<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:10.250> stacking

exposure night photography and stacking

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.060 
exposure night photography and stacking
images<00:00:12.179> because<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.049> project<00:00:13.530> involves

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
images because this project involves

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.189 
images because this project involves
several<00:00:14.400> different<00:00:15.030> images<00:00:15.509> several

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
several different images several

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.710 
several different images several
exposures<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:17.279> are<00:00:17.460> merging<00:00:17.760> together<00:00:18.090> into

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
exposures that are merging together into

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.260 
exposures that are merging together into
one<00:00:18.990> shot<00:00:19.470> it's<00:00:20.250> almost<00:00:20.490> impossible<00:00:20.880> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
one shot it's almost impossible to

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.220 
one shot it's almost impossible to
photograph<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.350> image<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.519> shot<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.930> I'm

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
photograph this image in one shot so I'm

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.500 
photograph this image in one shot so I'm
creating<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.859> from<00:00:26.130> multiple<00:00:26.789> photos<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
creating it from multiple photos and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.870 
creating it from multiple photos and
merging<00:00:28.289> them<00:00:28.320> together<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.640> called

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
merging them together and it's called

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.089 
merging them together and it's called
stacking<00:00:30.510> here<00:00:31.109> inside<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.439> Adobe<00:00:31.920> Photoshop

here this first image now this is a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.850 
here this first image now this is a
single<00:01:17.759> exposure<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.840> set<00:01:19.140> where<00:01:19.740> I've

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
single exposure in this set where I've

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.429 
single exposure in this set where I've
used<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.310> strobe<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.060> light<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.570> rock<00:01:21.869> from

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
used the strobe to light this rock from

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.370 
used the strobe to light this rock from
the<00:01:22.500> side<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.250> see<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:24.049> this<00:01:25.049> was<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the side as you see here this was the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.770 
the side as you see here this was the
first<00:01:25.619> exposure<00:01:26.009> here's<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.150> second<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
first exposure here's the second and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.890 
first exposure here's the second and
here's<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.799> third<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.670> rock<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.600> great

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
here's the third of the rock the great

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.960 
here's the third of the rock the great
thing<00:01:31.140> about<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.579> then<00:01:32.729> isolate

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
thing about this is you can then isolate

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.020 
thing about this is you can then isolate
particular<00:01:33.869> areas<00:01:34.590> within<00:01:35.070> your<00:01:35.250> scene<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
particular areas within your scene and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.140 
particular areas within your scene and
light<00:01:36.780> them<00:01:37.049> separately<00:01:37.939> let's<00:01:38.939> check

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
light them separately let's check

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.270 
light them separately let's check
something<00:01:39.390> out<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.710> first<00:01:40.950> image

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
something out here in this first image

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.990 
something out here in this first image
notice<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.939> my<00:01:42.150> ISO<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.229> set<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.740> 100<00:01:44.430> I'm

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
notice that my ISO is set to 100 I'm

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.719 
notice that my ISO is set to 100 I'm
shooting<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.110> an<00:01:46.229> exposure<00:01:46.590> time<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.130> 25

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
shooting for an exposure time of 25

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.560 
shooting for an exposure time of 25
seconds<00:01:48.360> at<00:01:48.540> f9<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:50.189> exposure<00:01:50.700> time<00:01:51.119> gives

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
seconds at f9 this exposure time gives

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.340 
seconds at f9 this exposure time gives
me<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.170> ability<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.680> move<00:01:53.040> into<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.579> scene

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
me the ability to move into the scene

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.670 
me the ability to move into the scene
flash<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.740> strobe<00:01:56.130> onto<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> rocks<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.750> then

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
flash the strobe onto the rocks and then

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.899 
flash the strobe onto the rocks and then
the<00:01:59.159> exposure<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.759> done<00:01:59.840> each<00:02:00.840> time<00:02:01.290> then<00:02:01.590> I

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
the exposure is done each time then I

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.060 
the exposure is done each time then I
can<00:02:02.909> achieve<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.630> different<00:02:04.140> exposure<00:02:04.770> or

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
can achieve a different exposure or

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.449 
can achieve a different exposure or
flash<00:02:05.969> within<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> image<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.950> all<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.340> these

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
flash within the image so all of these

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.580 
flash within the image so all of these
were<00:02:08.759> photographed<00:02:09.330> at<00:02:09.509> these<00:02:09.869> settings<00:02:10.410> in

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
were photographed at these settings in

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.550 
were photographed at these settings in
my<00:02:10.649> metadata<00:02:11.480> now<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.540> want<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.959> combine<00:02:13.140> that

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
my metadata now I want to combine that

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.030 
my metadata now I want to combine that
with

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
with

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.819 
with
the<00:02:14.099> rotation<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.909> stars<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:16.319> turn<00:02:16.650> off

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
the rotation of the stars so I turn off

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.130 
the rotation of the stars so I turn off
all<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.219> lights<00:02:17.250> I'm<00:02:18.030> not<00:02:18.359> using<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.810> strobe

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
all the lights I'm not using a strobe

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.319 
all the lights I'm not using a strobe
and<00:02:19.469> in<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.189> case<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:20.909> see<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.239> the

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
and in this case you can see in the

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.399 
and in this case you can see in the
metadata<00:02:21.689> I'm<00:02:22.170> using<00:02:22.859> a<00:02:23.540> 240<00:02:24.540> second<00:02:25.019> exposure

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
metadata I'm using a 240 second exposure

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.899 
metadata I'm using a 240 second exposure
for<00:02:26.040> minutes<00:02:26.489> at<00:02:26.670> an<00:02:27.269> ISO<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:28.140> 200<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.459> increase

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
for minutes at an ISO of 200 so increase

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.869 
for minutes at an ISO of 200 so increase
your<00:02:30.180> ISO<00:02:30.390> for<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.290> particular<00:02:31.829> project<00:02:32.069> to

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
your ISO for this particular project to

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.649 
your ISO for this particular project to
draw<00:02:33.569> in<00:02:33.900> more<00:02:34.530> stars<00:02:35.099> within<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.090> rotation

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
draw in more stars within the rotation

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.670 
draw in more stars within the rotation
and<00:02:36.950> my<00:02:37.950> f-stop<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.609> at<00:02:38.909> f/8<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.079> see<00:02:40.319> here

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
and my f-stop is at f/8 as you see here

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.179 
and my f-stop is at f/8 as you see here
so<00:02:41.519> this<00:02:41.730> long<00:02:42.090> exposure<00:02:42.659> then<00:02:43.260> captures<00:02:43.829> the

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
so this long exposure then captures the

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.879 
so this long exposure then captures the
motion<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:45.090> stars<00:02:45.389> I'm<00:02:45.719> going<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.709> take<00:02:46.859> a

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
motion of the stars I'm going to take a

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.720 
motion of the stars I'm going to take a
series<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.459> these<00:02:47.730> with<00:02:48.389> my<00:02:48.629> intervalometer

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
series of these with my intervalometer

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.869 
series of these with my intervalometer
to<00:02:50.730> get<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.269> movement<00:02:51.659> of<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.169> stars<00:02:52.470> in

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
to get the movement of the stars in

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.979 
to get the movement of the stars in
segments<00:02:53.879> of<00:02:54.000> 4<00:02:54.510> minutes<00:02:54.930> as<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.709> see<00:02:56.069> here<00:02:56.430> I

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
segments of 4 minutes as you see here I

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.929 
segments of 4 minutes as you see here I
then<00:02:57.989> can<00:02:58.319> combine<00:02:58.799> these<00:02:59.010> all<00:02:59.220> back<00:02:59.700> together

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
then can combine these all back together

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.360 
then can combine these all back together

here<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:09.989> Photoshop<00:04:10.199> cs6<00:04:10.829> now<00:04:11.579> here's<00:04:11.819> some

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
here in Photoshop cs6 now here's some

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.390 
here in Photoshop cs6 now here's some
other<00:04:12.150> ideas<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.599> can<00:04:12.870> use<00:04:13.079> in<00:04:13.349> your<00:04:13.769> projects

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
other ideas you can use in your projects

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.670 
other ideas you can use in your projects
remember<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:15.299> can<00:04:15.449> turn<00:04:15.659> the<00:04:15.870> visibility<00:04:16.169> on

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
remember you can turn the visibility on

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.330 
remember you can turn the visibility on
or<00:04:17.310> off<00:04:17.489> for<00:04:18.299> each<00:04:18.479> of<00:04:18.659> these<00:04:18.750> layers<00:04:19.019> so<00:04:19.349> the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
or off for each of these layers so the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.029 
or off for each of these layers so the
great<00:04:21.030> thing<00:04:21.060> again<00:04:21.539> about<00:04:21.959> taking<00:04:22.380> multiple

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
great thing again about taking multiple

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.969 
great thing again about taking multiple
flash<00:04:23.909> images<00:04:24.659> is<00:04:24.810> that<00:04:24.870> you<00:04:25.409> can<00:04:25.560> turn<00:04:25.770> the

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
flash images is that you can turn the

to<00:04:28.120> see<00:04:28.300> what<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.540> results<00:04:28.930> would<00:04:29.080> look<00:04:29.290> like

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
to see what the results would look like

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.430 
to see what the results would look like
without<00:04:29.680> that<00:04:30.100> particular<00:04:30.430> light<00:04:30.880> source

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
without that particular light source

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.400 
without that particular light source
also<00:04:32.440> you<00:04:33.340> can<00:04:33.550> target<00:04:33.850> one<00:04:34.150> of<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.360> layers<00:04:34.570> go

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
also you can target one of the layers go

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.670 
also you can target one of the layers go
to<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.680> base<00:04:35.920> here<00:04:36.960> click<00:04:37.960> on<00:04:38.080> this<00:04:38.230> icon<00:04:38.650> to

to the base here click on this icon to

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.970 
to the base here click on this icon to
add<00:04:38.950> layer<00:04:39.400> mask<00:04:39.930> yes<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.140> can<00:04:41.320> add<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.560> layer

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
add layer mask yes you can add a layer

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.610 
add layer mask yes you can add a layer
mask<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.760> individual<00:04:43.390> layers<00:04:43.630> then<00:04:44.170> go<00:04:44.410> in

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
mask to the individual layers then go in

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.750 
mask to the individual layers then go in
and<00:04:44.770> brush<00:04:45.370> out<00:04:45.730> or<00:04:46.290> hide<00:04:47.290> particular<00:04:48.040> areas

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
and brush out or hide particular areas

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.300 
and brush out or hide particular areas
for<00:04:49.690> example<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.230> you<00:04:50.410> might<00:04:50.650> have<00:04:50.860> strobed

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
for example that you might have strobed

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.000 
for example that you might have strobed
with<00:04:51.700> the<00:04:51.850> flash<00:04:52.120> and<00:04:52.480> then<00:04:53.140> start<00:04:53.500> to<00:04:53.680> paint

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
with the flash and then start to paint

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.360 
with the flash and then start to paint
with<00:04:54.310> light<00:04:54.670> in<00:04:55.000> this<00:04:55.720> process<00:04:56.260> so<00:04:57.220> the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
with light in this process so the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.840 
with light in this process so the
combination<00:04:58.150> of<00:04:58.270> layer<00:04:59.260> masks<00:04:59.890> turning<00:05:00.790> the

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
combination of layer masks turning the

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.030 
combination of layer masks turning the
layers<00:05:01.060> on<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.510> off<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:01.960> of<00:05:02.170> course<00:05:02.410> blending

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
layers on and off and of course blending

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.580 
layers on and off and of course blending
these<00:05:03.190> all<00:05:03.430> together<00:05:03.790> with<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.780> lighten<00:05:05.260> mode

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
these all together with the lighten mode

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.540 
these all together with the lighten mode
here<00:05:06.190> then<00:05:07.120> gives<00:05:07.540> you<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:07.660> results<00:05:08.230> you<00:05:08.350> see

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
here then gives you the results you see

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.430 
here then gives you the results you see
so<00:05:09.550> this<00:05:09.730> is<00:05:09.910> a<00:05:09.940> great<00:05:10.330> way<00:05:10.570> to<00:05:10.600> bring<00:05:11.050> multiple

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
so this is a great way to bring multiple

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.790 
so this is a great way to bring multiple
images<00:05:12.220> together<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.640> stack<00:05:13.390> them<00:05:13.690> into<00:05:14.440> one

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
images together and stack them into one

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.550 
images together and stack them into one
final<00:05:15.400> result<00:05:16.000> don't<00:05:16.660> forget<00:05:16.930> you'll<00:05:17.380> need

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
final result don't forget you'll need

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.530 
final result don't forget you'll need
the<00:05:17.710> intervalometer<00:05:18.220> and<00:05:18.670> a<00:05:18.760> really<00:05:19.180> sturdy
