00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.130
 when chopin put his hands on the 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.160
 keyboard immediately made a silence of 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.160
 tomb 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.079
 large grand piano was open on 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.719
 people stage 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.339
 and huddled around everyone 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.079
 they wanted the closest places not 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:03.359
 not even one agreement had to be lost 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:08.070
 notes an intention and they were right of 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.700
 be so av yes so 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.180
 religiously moved because he who 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:22.549
 they waited it was not just an artist 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.549
 of no big name he was chopin 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.190
 if a woman could on earth 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.540
 inspire me with the most absolute confidence 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:51.240
 that was me but he never did 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:57.090
 I realized that I certainly don't have the nature of 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.660
 a saint came to martyrdom 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.610
 the sky is inexorable against me 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.210
 I almost had some great crimes 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.210
 to be expiated 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.250
 who followed me looking 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.500
 only at the surface will it have seemed 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:30.330
 hypocritical fool for those who have me 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.560
 followed by reading me in the background are 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.560
 you seem to what they really are 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.910
 excited about the beauty here is my life 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.410
 dear friend you see well that it is not worthy 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.920
 of note 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.420
 there is nothing to admire and much to 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.510
 pity nothing to condemn from whom 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.560
 have a good heart 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.340
 I'm sure those who accuse me 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.560
 to have been evil they lied 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.870
 amy it would be easy to find him if i wanted 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:11.710
 give you the trouble to remember 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:14.410
 and to tell but this would bore me 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.550
 and I have no more memory 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.550
 that resentment 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:42.390
 name si chopin please don't stop you 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.740
 please keep playing you were a 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.740
 half of a miracle 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.860
 no soul was nobler anymore 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.010
 delicate the most faithful and loyal 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.480
 in friendship 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:07.910
 no spirit was brighter 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:10.850
 in joy but no character was 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.240
 no more unstable imagination anymore 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.450
 suspicious delusional none 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.760
 susceptibility easier to irritate 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.820
 no sentimental need is more 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:30.200
 impossible to satisfy 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:31.810
 I'm still able to love if I were 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.710
 more than ever 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.110
 because this is the essence of life and 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:43.210
 because I live with intensity only 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:45.360
 in pain if I could no longer love not 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:53.040
 I could suffer more 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:53.040
 I suffer, therefore I love and there
