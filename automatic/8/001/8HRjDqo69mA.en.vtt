the day goes on oh if you find some like
straight<00:04:30.980> ends<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.580> you<00:04:31.669> could<00:04:31.820> cut<00:04:32.000> them

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
straight ends and you could cut them

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
pull them out one by one and just maybe

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.700 
pull them out one by one and just maybe
take<00:06:18.999> you<00:06:19.120> 20<00:06:19.449> minutes<00:06:19.569> to<00:06:19.839> do<00:06:20.050> it<00:06:20.080> half<00:06:20.559> an

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
take you 20 minutes to do it half an

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.129 
take you 20 minutes to do it half an
hour<00:06:20.860> but<00:06:21.669> you'll<00:06:22.240> see<00:06:22.479> the<00:06:22.599> difference<00:06:22.629> by

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
hour but you'll see the difference by

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:25.769 
hour but you'll see the difference by
the<00:06:23.199> end<00:06:23.460> not<00:06:24.460> too<00:06:24.639> much<00:06:24.789> oil<00:06:25.029> shane<00:06:25.419> and<00:06:25.599> stuff

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:25.779 
the end not too much oil shane and stuff

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:26.969 
the end not too much oil shane and stuff
because<00:06:25.930> that<00:06:26.169> weighs<00:06:26.319> it<00:06:26.469> down<00:06:26.499> makes<00:06:26.889> it

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
because that weighs it down makes it

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.230 
because that weighs it down makes it
really<00:06:27.099> sticky<00:06:27.400> and<00:06:27.639> since<00:06:27.789> you<00:06:27.879> can't<00:06:27.909> really

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
really sticky and since you can't really

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.360 
really sticky and since you can't really
wash<00:06:28.539> the<00:06:28.779> hair<00:06:28.960> you<00:06:29.830> don't<00:06:29.979> really<00:06:30.069> want<00:06:30.309> to

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
wash the hair you don't really want to

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.899 
wash the hair you don't really want to
do<00:06:30.460> that<00:06:30.639> um<00:06:31.229> so<00:06:32.229> I<00:06:32.680> think<00:06:33.189> that's<00:06:33.550> pretty<00:06:33.699> much

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:33.909 
do that um so I think that's pretty much

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:35.549 
do that um so I think that's pretty much
it<00:06:33.969> it's<00:06:34.360> really<00:06:34.539> low<00:06:34.839> maintenance<00:06:35.199> to<00:06:35.379> really

00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:35.559 
it it's really low maintenance to really

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:37.019 
it it's really low maintenance to really
get<00:06:35.680> up<00:06:35.800> and<00:06:35.949> want<00:06:36.099> and<00:06:36.189> Shake<00:06:36.339> ahead<00:06:36.639> if<00:06:36.969> you

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:37.029 
get up and want and Shake ahead if you

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:39.570 
get up and want and Shake ahead if you
want<00:06:37.089> a<00:06:37.270> little<00:06:37.419> ocean<00:06:37.629> a<00:06:38.139> little<00:06:39.069> bit<00:06:39.219> don't
