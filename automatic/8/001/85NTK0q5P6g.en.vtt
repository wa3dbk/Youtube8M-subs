00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
and I love it and I'm gonna see how well

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.670 
and I love it and I'm gonna see how well
it<00:00:15.210> works<00:00:15.360> out<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:15.719> have<00:00:15.870> very<00:00:16.109> limited<00:00:16.529> range

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
it works out we have very limited range

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.130 
it works out we have very limited range
with<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.270> guess<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> melee<00:00:19.080> weapon

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
with this it's I guess a melee weapon

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.870 
with this it's I guess a melee weapon
but<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.650> can<00:00:19.770> also<00:00:19.890> use<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.220> as<00:00:20.250> an<00:00:20.340> axe<00:00:20.640> so

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
but you can also use it as an axe so

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.150 
but you can also use it as an axe so
seems<00:00:21.810> pretty<00:00:21.960> cool<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.619> we're<00:00:22.800> gonna<00:00:22.920> kill

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
seems pretty cool and we're gonna kill

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.800 
seems pretty cool and we're gonna kill
all<00:00:23.340> them<00:00:23.430> with<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.699> hopefully<00:00:23.880> I'll<00:00:24.480> see<00:00:24.630> you
