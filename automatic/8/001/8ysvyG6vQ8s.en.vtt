 me and my mother 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:06:01.710
 What is it that's just that I went wrong 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:07.830
 13/8 I'm almost a professional who 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:12.240
 This getting good on this part I released 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:18.480
 muffler and holographic site until change 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:21.000
 already holographic here with prefer 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.150
 holographic than the red dot because 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.890
 I remember seeing a video of 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.430
 funk black cats if you did not see go 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:32.040
 leave the link in the description that he 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.800
 showed here with holographic and some 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.210
 guns is better than with the red dot 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.230
 so just in case it's the same 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.450
 being better has no place 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.040
 holographic 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.590
 the agent then there is a part of the 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.840
 I'll cook you another episode. 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.830
 of caufield how they came about I'm not so 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.180
 good like this 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:54.690
 but until I got well I could stay 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:56.160
 positive is that this will play more 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.120
 some rounds here to record some more 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.560
 videos 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.000
 So you keep an eye out there 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.520

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.530

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.910
