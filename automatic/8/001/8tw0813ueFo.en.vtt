I'm getting there it is tricky you have
to<00:00:40.680> learn<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> bends<00:00:41.640> your<00:00:41.790> toes<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.450> when

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
to learn in the bends your toes and when

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.540 
to learn in the bends your toes and when
to<00:00:42.719> lock<00:00:42.899> your<00:00:43.110> knee<00:00:43.290> if<00:00:43.680> you're<00:00:43.860> walking<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
to lock your knee if you're walking and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.880 
to lock your knee if you're walking and
it's<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.809> everybody<00:00:46.170> thinks<00:00:46.350> which<00:00:46.680> I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it's not like everybody thinks which I

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.459 
it's not like everybody thinks which I
kind<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.190> thought<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.230> put<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.379> on

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
kind of thought to you just put it on

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.319 
kind of thought to you just put it on
and<00:00:49.860> take<00:00:50.160> off<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.940> that

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and take off you don't do that

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.209 
and take off you don't do that
so<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> lot<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.199> respect<00:00:52.829> for

great<00:01:03.690> learning<00:01:06.860> actually<00:01:07.860> got<00:01:08.280> at<00:01:08.460> March<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
great learning actually got at March the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.140 
great learning actually got at March the
30th<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.600> had<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> few<00:01:10.080> problems<00:01:10.320> had<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.150> leg

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
30th but I had a few problems had a leg

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.300 
30th but I had a few problems had a leg
injury<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.869> had<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.200> take<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.950> off<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
injury and I had to take it off for a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.609 
injury and I had to take it off for a
few<00:01:14.520> weeks<00:01:14.729> let<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.150> heal<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.840> we're<00:01:16.350> still

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
few weeks let it heal up but we're still

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.350 
few weeks let it heal up but we're still
adjusted<00:01:17.220> making<00:01:17.490> adjustments<00:01:18.060> that's<00:01:18.210> why

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
adjusted making adjustments that's why

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.940 
adjusted making adjustments that's why
they<00:01:18.479> don't<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> cover<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> leg<00:01:19.650> yet

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
they don't have the cover on the leg yet

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.789 
they don't have the cover on the leg yet
because<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:21.000> still<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.110> adjust<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.680> I

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
because we still have to adjust as I

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.570 
because we still have to adjust as I

hyperbaric<00:01:44.430> chamber<00:01:44.820> healed<00:01:45.299> about<00:01:46.070> 85%<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
hyperbaric chamber healed about 85% of

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.179 
hyperbaric chamber healed about 85% of
my<00:01:47.280> leg<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.729> had<00:01:47.939> one<00:01:48.210> little<00:01:48.479> one<00:01:49.380> small<00:01:49.799> little

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
my leg I had one little one small little

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.130 
my leg I had one little one small little
area<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.790> would<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.329> heal<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
area that just would not heal have a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.580 
area that just would not heal have a
stubborn<00:01:52.500> body<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:54.590> circulation

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
stubborn body that this the circulation

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.700 
stubborn body that this the circulation
still<00:01:55.860> wasn't<00:01:56.210> good<00:01:57.210> enough<00:01:57.380> below<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> knee

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
still wasn't good enough below the knee

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.800 
still wasn't good enough below the knee
so<00:01:59.159> we<00:01:59.399> ended<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.790> having<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.210> amputate<00:02:00.630> but

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
so we ended up having to amputate but

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.830 
so we ended up having to amputate but
above<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.290> knee<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:03.030> was<00:02:03.149> January<00:02:03.659> this

nothing

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.040 

it<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:33.210> hard<00:04:33.509> it's<00:04:33.810> not<00:04:34.020> easy<00:04:35.479> it's<00:04:36.479> when<00:04:36.960> I

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
it is hard it's not easy it's when I

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.409 
it is hard it's not easy it's when I
first<00:04:37.260> put<00:04:37.470> my<00:04:37.590> leg<00:04:37.800> on<00:04:37.979> it<00:04:38.370> took<00:04:38.940> me<00:04:39.030> like<00:04:39.180> 30

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
first put my leg on it took me like 30

first put my leg on it took me like 30
minutes<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:39.960> get<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.229> leg<00:04:40.380> on<00:04:40.620> now<00:04:41.250> I<00:04:41.280> can<00:04:41.580> get

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
minutes to get the leg on now I can get

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.490 
minutes to get the leg on now I can get
it<00:04:41.789> on<00:04:41.910> in<00:04:42.120> like<00:04:42.300> less<00:04:42.570> than<00:04:42.720> two<00:04:42.900> minutes<00:04:43.080> and

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
it on in like less than two minutes and

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.860 
it on in like less than two minutes and
but<00:04:44.010> it's<00:04:44.400> learning<00:04:44.669> to<00:04:44.910> use<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:45.479> and<00:04:45.630> walk

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
but it's learning to use it and walk

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.230 
but it's learning to use it and walk
with<00:04:46.110> it<00:04:46.289> because<00:04:46.440> we<00:04:46.830> take<00:04:47.070> for<00:04:47.250> granted<00:04:47.280> our

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
with it because we take for granted our

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.170 
with it because we take for granted our
good<00:04:48.570> leg<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.139> you<00:04:49.710> have<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.010> learn<00:04:50.310> with<00:04:51.150> the

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
good leg and you have to learn with the

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.689 
good leg and you have to learn with the
prosthetic<00:04:51.690> leg<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.860> that's<00:04:53.130> been<00:04:53.400> probably

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
prosthetic leg and that's been probably

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.460 
prosthetic leg and that's been probably
one<00:04:53.940> of<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.300> hardest<00:04:54.630> things<00:04:54.960> you<00:04:55.139> have<00:04:55.320> to

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
learn like when you start to take a step

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.990 
learn like when you start to take a step
forward<00:04:58.289> you<00:04:58.590> have<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.889> bend<00:04:59.099> your<00:04:59.310> toes<00:04:59.580> to
