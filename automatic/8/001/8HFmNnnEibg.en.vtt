is from my coach card cuz i usually run
aaron<00:02:31.079> rodgers<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.709> short<00:02:31.950> accuracy<00:02:32.370> is

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
aaron rodgers so short accuracy is

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.399 
aaron rodgers so short accuracy is
already<00:02:32.670> out<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.879> 99<00:02:33.359> 98<00:02:33.719> so<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.109> doesn't

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
already out like a 99 98 so that doesn't

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.420

a<00:04:19.259> pretty<00:04:19.590> electrifying<00:04:20.220> receiver<00:04:20.639> so

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
a pretty electrifying receiver so

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.320 
a pretty electrifying receiver so
there's<00:04:21.690> that<00:04:21.989> rig<00:04:22.229> there<00:04:22.789> his<00:04:23.789> rookie<00:04:24.300> year
