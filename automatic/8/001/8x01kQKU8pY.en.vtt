00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.260
 hello that such welcome to 29 the day of 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.550
 today I bring you the jailbreak tutorial 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.350
 untethered for ios 7 17 11 17 12 that 's right 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.170
 this powerful jailbreak is also going to 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.910
 serve for 712 this jailbreak is going 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.770
 to serve for all devices that 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.050
 have any of the ones I'm just finishing 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.670
 to mention and good first of all 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.770
 recommendations so that they do not have 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.899
 problems with your number 1 jailbreak 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.730
 sure to have the latest version of 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.950
 itunes check the updates of your 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.590
 iTunes number 2 make a backup of your 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.550
 devices via itunes number 3 is one 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.230
 very important 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.660
 make sure that the update of a and b 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.700
 is that they have done it via itunes 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.350
 and not by wifi directly in the 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.150
 device because if they did it like that 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.640
 via wifi they will give you a lot 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.829
 problems the jailbreak and if the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.680
 updated via wifi so make a 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.149
 restoration from itunes number 4 if 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.800
 is in the lock code and now 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.989
 I also recommend this series of 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.689
 steps wires zeroes so they have a 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.880
 successful jailbreak the number one they are going to 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.189
 backup your device sends to itunes 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.930
 number 2 they are going to restore their there device 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.370
 so that it is as well as new obviously 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.320
 via itunes number 3 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.330
 they will pass their support they did in 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.130
 the computer now to its air and vice 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.780
 so that it is almost as always they have 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.150
 used with this we will achieve a 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.860
 pseudo clean installation and number 4 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.900
 let's do the jailbreak but good 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.090
 let's start since he made sure that 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.580
 they followed all my recommendations go 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.770
 to go to this site go gogh point and or the 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.840
 lic is that low in the description here 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.690
 I know where we are going to download the jailbreak 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.490
 if we are not going to click on the system 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.500
 operative that we have in this case is 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.150
 a kill we click here to start 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.980
 download the jailbreak as I already have it 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.720
 I 'm going to download it in windows is a 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.510
 executable is what they open doing double 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.630
 click but here on mac we double click 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.640

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.550
 internet made sure to open it we give 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.260
 that if at home that for some reason 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.020
 I said I'll open the application here in 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.240

 removed we put it increased opened and it's going 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.610
 to leave this program now we're going 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.860
 to ensure that we connect our ai 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.680
 device to the computer and let's do 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.390
 something new here with this jailbreak like 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.150
 destiny is a little different 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.810
 let's go here to settings or settings in 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.690
 English then let's gender something 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.730
 general and here we are going to look for date and 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.430
 time we have to modify the date and 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.830
 time for this jailbreak here where 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.040
 says put automatically we're going to 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.720
 remove this option and let's put it 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.340
 now I say the date on June 2 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.170
 the 2014 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.790
 and the time put the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.790
 at 8 o'clock at night 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.730
 it's the perfect night we come back here in 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.580
 general are secured here in the 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.210
 calendar that says June 2 is super 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.910
 important to say 112 June 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.530
 and they block since everything is ready 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.030
 have the time that is in your connected 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.880
 your upstairs is the computer going to 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.150
 click on the break and this is going to 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.860
 take a little bit so be patient 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.720

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.629
 super important that they are not going to get away 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.209
