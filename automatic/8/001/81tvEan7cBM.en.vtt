00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:21.600
I bought half a hectare, and during the first two years when I started with the help of others and by self-teaching, I became so infected that it was impossible to turn back.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:34.500
It was obvious afterwards that there would be no stopping, and currently I’m working on 12 hectares.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:46.400
The reason why I chose to do it this way is that I went to Burgundy in 2005 where we visited the top wineries.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.300
And I thought I should consider what they’d said since they are creating great value there.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.000
When I returned to Hungary, I tried to make wines that way with drastic yield control and in a natural way.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.300
I bought old books at auctions, which were written in the 1880s or earlier.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.600
In these books I read about varieties I’d never heard about, which were classified as first class by the experts back then.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.000
I thought that when there were 360,000 hectares of vineyard in the country, then there must have been good experts as well.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.800
The most important thing is the date of harvest. It has to be set within 48 hours.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.000
In Burgundy, people have Pinot Noir and Chardonnay or only one of them. So it’s significantly easier to set the harvest date.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:55.200
It can only be carried out according to experience. Books can’t define when the grapes are ripe. With these numerous varieties, it may take me 20-30 years to establish the harvest date.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:07.900
Of these old varieties the whites are Vörösdinka, Piros Bakator, Hamvas, Lisztes, Kovácsi Kolontár, Szerémi Zöld, Balafánt, Sárfehér, Fehér Gohér…

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:19.000
The reds are: Csókaszőlő, Fekete Muskotály, Tihanyi Kék, Tarcali Kék, Kékbajor, Laska, Kékszilváni…

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:32.200
One can reach 100 per cent here. Or if we take what I’ve achieved in the vineyard as 100 per cent, then the aim is to protect it in the cellar.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:41.800
In the cellar I cannot improve on what I’ve realised here in the vineyard. That’s why I love being here. I keep an eye on it.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.000
Here, in the vineyard, one cannot press the “enter” key, you have to be here all the time.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:02.100
The ancient Greek poet Hesiod wrote the following, which I read when I was 20 so I don’t remember it exactly. It went something like: after work start working again.
