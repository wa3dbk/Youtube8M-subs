what to do with carbohydrates

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.050 
what to do with carbohydrates
carbohydrates<00:01:32.229> are<00:01:32.829> important<00:01:33.340> because<00:01:33.729> they

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
carbohydrates are important because they

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.029 
carbohydrates are important because they
help<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.450> muscle<00:01:34.869> glycogen<00:01:34.959> makes<00:01:35.920> the

help the muscle glycogen makes the

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.719
