 that come out to break the vice those 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.219
 pilots who do not reach tourism 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.679
 road with the addition of that 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.540
 they make in earth circuits us 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.400
 that we have to accompany them on a date and 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.270
 that's why we went to the circuit of san 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.270
 André we say 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.619
 we continue with in the auto test 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.170
 Life does not want to draw bands 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.320
 air but you move the floor hung 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.880
 to have a cameraman and we continue 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.280
 testing vehicles behind you 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.280
 you focus and this time it was the turn of the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.110
 remembered iker and gtx gap for that not 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.949
 there's nothing better than he did that's why 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.949
 will be where are you going 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.339
 let's hear him the owner of the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.839
 people who were a little afraid 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.109
 He started to sweat when I grab the car 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:01.720
 Luis shock but in the end live in this and 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.680
 all happy as the riverside branch 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.680
 do not 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.660
 today we are going to present to you one of the 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.120
 sports of the 70s more 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.010
 representative it's about the coupé 27 x 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.060
 the only one in the Argentine market that came 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.060
 with 8 motor 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.970
 kindly louis levita has lent us 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.920
 his unit a coupé of 27 x 1973 that 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.630
 is in really immaculate state with 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.670
 We are going to do a test similar to the 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.670
 that was done in the 70s 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.320
 this car will perhaps be the best in its 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.430
 category far exceeded the chassis 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.560
 the engine to all its competitors 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.860
 after finishing its production in 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.510
 1909 began to participate intensely in 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.730
 road tourism so practically 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.620
 how come he meets very good 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.270
 sports performance its aerodynamics 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.080
 It is also very good compared to the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.080
 the competitors 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.000
 we are talking about a car that starts 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.739
 to manufacture in Argentina in 1969 the 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.280
 first units came equipped with 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.379
 six known customers engine launched 355 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.769
 horses from 70 we started to 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.959
 count on the plant 8 had 212 hp 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:33.870
 back in the year 73 the power of the engine 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.870
 it rose to 230 hp 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.200
 it is a very noble power plant the test 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.540
 is that until last year was the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.040
 grand cherokee basically the blog and the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.230
 cylinder caps with the same 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.180
 states x another of the things that 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.790
 It identified the coupé doreste x is 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.740
 this beautiful lateral without parante already 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.720
 through him we can observe the 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.430
 instrumental is quite complete watch 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.500
 of temperature of oil presented 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.090
 fuel level counts turns and a 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.280
 speedometer that was pretty accurate 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.200
 also for the focus the seats were 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.900
 reclining another novelty for those 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.730
 years and optional they brought head restraints and 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.710
 safety belts the selector of 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.360
 marches is an American type with 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.250
 trigger when stain after some elektra 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.570
 very precise could not throw changes or 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.750
 can throw changes with absolute 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.750

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.739
 to brake at 120 kilometers per hour 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.810
 justifies 48 meters regarding handling 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.760
 This unit has a hydraulic direction and 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.829
 makes handling much easier in any 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.150
 circuit work like this this boat is 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.150
 move with a barbarian agility 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.230
