00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.610
 some and some this tweets that already the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.010
 you know they 're saying they were dead 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.470
 and you are but alive and kicking 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:09.700
 live kicking the winds and still 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:14.830
 how is it worth roberto health badly but oh 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.830
 I go because I can not walk then that 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.980
 it's my big problem and I thought 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.390
 Well, you gave me some equipment that I had 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.340
 a lot a movement a lot of skill to 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.590
 move 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.590
 and now sure of that but 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:39.250
 let's not miss now now 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:45.250
 They have killed me like 20 times of omar is 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:47.740
 that sparked us hears roberto that 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.080
 I know you watch television you can still 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.650
 write what you're doing in general 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.650
 at this stage of your life good 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:01.600
 I see very few in sight I have a 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:04.270
 very big limitation that is the ear 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.470
 I hear almost nothing now I'm hearing you 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.200
 to you because the phone is very direct 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.990
 but if they could talk prohibited not 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.620
 I would say nothing then 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:23.720
 that prevents me a lot because I'm not going to a cinema 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:27.470
 I'm not a theater not give me much pain 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.060
 to go to a theater because I roberto 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.510
 Even though you're the last judge 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.820
 I ask about his chespirito characters the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.330
 chavo del ocho 'the chmpiraras all these 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.130
 you which one you like most good 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.730
 look, I have a very special love 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.060
 to the guy why 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.530
 He has made me known throughout America 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:54.459
 auto and everyone 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.459
 it sounds like presumption but it's the truth 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.170
 the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.160
 the chapulin 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.860
 is more original I think but I 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:12.490
 acting I was happy with the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:17.380
 I was happy with life, hey 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.390
 this and the truth roberto stopped you from 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.010
 hands when the america was crowned as 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.409
 three weeks 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.510
 and 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.910
 sorry 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.640
 I liked it 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.430
 I liked it, but it happens to me 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.040
 also something curious with football you 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.130
 I see the results 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.610
 how are the pictures of the in this 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.760
 I'm worried about the moment 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.010
 bothers how is Mexico going in the 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.370
 eliminator of the world cup but what 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.110
 I wanted to say before this 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.330
 what 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.940
 that we do not like the current football 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.700
 Roberto and he sometimes goes out to the street 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.120
 or not and there I do not go out here 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:08.880
 live inside the house that in cancún 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.500
 I have a very pretty view with the lagoon 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.810
 the policy follows that does not follow 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.350
 above all, almost nothing, almost nothing 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.040
 I did not lose you, you told me about josefina monte 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.770
 by water I saw nothing 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.550
 I still think they were the best though 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.900
 having won is evidently rock 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:34.020
 grandson you have to support him we do not like it 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.740
 the pri I do not like the bread either how 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.310
 is now neither the pr d 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.310
 but 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.090
 but there are worse than the worst 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.060
 good roberto is a pleasure to hear you 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.729
 I offer an apology because it came out in 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.680
 some tweets what we already talked about but 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.199
 what better than having tea and there we will see 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.979

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:06.669
 it's very nice I thank you very much javier 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:10.780
 because he is a very important person not 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:13.409
 it would have helped the interview to anyone 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.659
 or very little 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.899
