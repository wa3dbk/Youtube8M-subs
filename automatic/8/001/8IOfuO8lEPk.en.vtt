00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.350
 and youtube 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.290
 and this time we are in a video of 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.560
 the cop all and as the title says 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:29.210
 that hernandez a in 94 the gold then 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.210
 simply this previous 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.989
 it is simply and simply speaking 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.989
 on how to get them out 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:59.230
 at any time anything you have 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.070
 what do you always do with any weapon 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.070
 why 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:10.020
 for that fact 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.690
 to one you have to know data 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.340
 but if you're jones of the gun do not be without 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.049
 muffler of my red dot ticket without 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.049
 absolutely none 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:48.700
 but this 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.510
 which is challenge 'would like to double 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.030
 because the double program wins again 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.580
 without naphthas jones and without pecs so that in 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.670
 instead of having to make 300 kits 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:10.850
 you just talk 150 did that 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:14.480
 it's a pro projection because not like that 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.230
 do 315 but it simply makes 150 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.230
 and you have your 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.110
 3 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.540
 apparently 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.459
 but you have to kill everyone in a row 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.330
 at the most 20 seconds 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.530
 until I started playing 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.590
 in 10 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.409
 do 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:44.099
 a range a little bit away from your weapon 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:47.420
 for medium distances you have to 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.420
 kill from a long distance 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.140
 and it 's like that 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.689
 because here and from here more or less 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:09.019
 they can kill the snipers that 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:16.359
 they are there there singing 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:16.359
 where they come out 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.039
 and good completing what are your 108 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.039
 55 the 150 without plants 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:44.040
 that's why in the magazine 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:46.650
 because the price is not the usual gold 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.350
 the video just does not right now for 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.490
 get to the truth seems greater 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:55.100
 previously previously it seemed 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.100
 cartoon but good 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.240
 in which 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.680
 I did not kill much 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:32.670
 but good at half the truth 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.740
 Easy orders to get gold are 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.740
 snipers and shotguns 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:53.360
 this golden dakar are the 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.520
 snipers and shotguns why 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:02.800
 I say this 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:05.780
 easy at the beginning to take photos 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.030
 winkels and with a sniper the truth 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.760
 is that it is very easy to make guanche when 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.820
 they stick them on top of the chest itself in the 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.370
 head the truth is pretty easy to do 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.169
 all the chalets 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:28.320
 the following come out of sniper 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:31.740
 would want to do on a 5 to 10 streak 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.960
 Sometimes something is so difficult to be nothing 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.050
 an accomplishment 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.050
 Y 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:42.210
 for chÃ¡vez 5 the truth is that it is not 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:42.210
 nothing difficult is complicated 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:47.949
 laborious and good to the same chaves 

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:57.889
 that is the border and well here I say 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:01.309
 but why do I want to be here for 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:03.939
 that with a football player the super happy 

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:03.939
 with the road 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:11.090
 in 494 English and Ivo codes nervous I open 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.890
 We already have the gold, this has 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.300
 I liked to have been serums and fossils to 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.640
 author and is with his critics in 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:21.370
 when we see each other, see you 

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.370
 if more care and up to the bar
