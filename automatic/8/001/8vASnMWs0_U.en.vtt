00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.400
 Kirill the first match for you in season 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.610
 tell me how it turned out she herself 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.110
 easy to debut oh well i'm good 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.630
 still played there four matches in 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.719
 Krasnoyarsk would this so long 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.970
 term without hockey then by what measure it 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.400
 very hard and and recover 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.710
 it's hard and wait for you to get into shape 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.660
 when can you help the team there 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.449
 I am very glad to get there 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.830
 finally come to the games but still 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.560
 Of course a lot of work to be 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 because literally everything is there 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.550
 remember each shift but in each 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.770
 all feelings are sure of change but by no means 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.500
 less you first went on the ice and already have 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.270
 your link as it were a game to pass on 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.430
 a good level everyone understood each other 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.750
 passed the transfer were meaningful 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.379
 attack that's where it came from 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.440
 we all have more high level guys 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.710
 how would coaches train their circuit 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.350
 we act on it plus we speak as 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.170
 got dirty when you had a moment and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.229
 crawled onto the center and threw nothing there 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.299
 enough for 1, a little puck left 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.840
 far well, probably all the same practice is not 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.380
 wanted i lowered my head then raised already 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.180
 and time like this split second they decide 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.420
 if you seemed to me to be better 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.280
 about as much as asking for time comes in 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.659
 work 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.030
 you got today and not so much 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.640
 playing time on what evil said 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.050
 coaching staff at that game but not 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.330
 let out probably when considered necessary 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.570
 tried every shift to the maximum 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.480
 I am very satisfied with this job 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.890
 it was to start and feel what it was I 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.470
 glad to go there today 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.960
 such a style from the game tell us this 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.930
 the observer today Nikolay was anyone 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.120
 very so intense match and to the bottom 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.370
 held fight 1 no what was there 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.920
 between them between the fleas between the burdenko 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.080
 well there was just a massacre there 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.590
 first moment when the fight started there 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.930
 we wanted to pick up the puck I throw out 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.840
 I never have a little back to the moment 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.480
 there was a flash itself did not see well for 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.780
 fought guys got into a fight started teams 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.500
 If well done you helped then after this 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.750
 moment of play 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.950
 turned over we already controlled 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.930
 puck it says about overtime 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.880
 quirks Kohl very cool I think 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.550
 played because there was no point fighting 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:30.760
 how did he want to be fooled 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:34.209
 say when such here before the series this one 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.150
 match at home three more away they are on rhythm 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.950
 affect the game but I'm still hard for me 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.720
 to tell 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.060
 half a year did not play figuratively speaking to me 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.090
 right now any match at least every day 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.400
 plays all in favor well and also guys yes 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.800
 tired tomorrow we fly away another city 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.810
 play and the tampon 437 wrong see 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.540
 We will work for each player to walk 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.150

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.150
