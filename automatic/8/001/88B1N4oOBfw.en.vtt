00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.430 

shooter<00:02:29.019> correct<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:31.019> wasn't<00:02:32.019> ever<00:02:32.110> turning

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
shooter correct it wasn't ever turning

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:48.330 
shooter correct it wasn't ever turning
it<00:02:32.500> now<00:02:35.069> let's<00:02:36.069> just<00:02:46.860> shoot<00:02:47.860> that's<00:02:48.040> not<00:02:48.190> going

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
it now let's just shoot that's not going

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.020 
it now let's just shoot that's not going
anywhere

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.880 

it<00:02:53.630> turned<00:02:53.870> out<00:02:53.930> pretty<00:02:54.050> good<00:02:54.290> it's<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.860> little

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
it turned out pretty good it's a little

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.020 
it turned out pretty good it's a little
tall<00:02:55.630> but<00:02:56.630> I<00:02:56.660> mean<00:02:57.520> this<00:02:58.520> thing<00:02:58.730> would<00:02:58.910> have

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
tall but I mean this thing would have

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.240 
tall but I mean this thing would have
been<00:02:59.410> you<00:03:00.410> know<00:03:00.440> at<00:03:00.620> least<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:00.950> same<00:03:01.130> way

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
been you know at least the same way

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.570 
been you know at least the same way
probably<00:03:01.580> taller<00:03:03.160> that's<00:03:04.160> an<00:03:04.310> improvement

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
probably taller that's an improvement

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.610 
probably taller that's an improvement
feels<00:03:05.330> really<00:03:05.600> good<00:03:05.750> it's<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.230> good<00:03:06.350> weight<00:03:06.500> to

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
feels really good it's a good weight to

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.880 
feels really good it's a good weight to
it

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
it

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.660 
it
I<00:03:06.920> have<00:03:07.730> no<00:03:07.850> idea<00:03:08.120> why<00:03:08.330> it<00:03:08.390> would<00:03:08.600> be<00:03:08.630> illegal

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
I have no idea why it would be illegal

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.000 
I have no idea why it would be illegal
but<00:03:10.670> then<00:03:10.910> again<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:12.730> guess<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:15.010> company

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
but then again I guess so that a company
