right at the end just like that now I've

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.999 
right at the end just like that now I've
got<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> shorter<00:01:18.929> rope<00:01:19.110> here<00:01:19.440> that's<00:01:19.679> already

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009

got a shorter rope here that's already
has<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.220> loop<00:01:21.000> braided<00:01:21.509> back<00:01:21.660> into<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> end<00:01:22.229> of

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
has a loop braided back into the end of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.310 
has a loop braided back into the end of
it<00:01:22.530> I'm<00:01:22.649> just<00:01:22.800> gonna<00:01:22.979> make<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:24.020> loop<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.289> this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
it I'm just gonna make a loop like this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.469 
it I'm just gonna make a loop like this
if<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.280> don't<00:01:26.399> have<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.119> rope<00:01:27.300> you

if you don't have that in your rope you

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.080 
if you don't have that in your rope you
can<00:01:27.509> tie<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> bowline<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.679> is<00:01:28.950> my<00:01:29.429> go-to<00:01:29.700> knot

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
can tie a bowline which is my go-to knot

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.249 
can tie a bowline which is my go-to knot
and<00:01:30.270> let's<00:01:30.420> show<00:01:30.539> you<00:01:30.630> how<00:01:30.690> to<00:01:30.780> tie<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.140> in

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and let's show you how to tie that in

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.010 
and let's show you how to tie that in
just<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.500> minute

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
just a minute

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.480 
just a minute
loop<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.259> over<00:01:36.920> now<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.070> we're<00:01:38.189> gonna<00:01:38.280> do

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
loop that over now what we're gonna do

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.520 
loop that over now what we're gonna do
is<00:01:38.610> attach<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:40.409> tree<00:01:40.649> right<00:01:40.829> here

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.140 

I<00:01:46.619> must<00:01:47.340> start<00:01:47.549> with<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.790> bowline<00:01:48.180> knot<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
I must start with a bowline knot so you

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.740 
I must start with a bowline knot so you
make<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> loop<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:53.150> put<00:01:54.150> your<00:01:54.299> tag<00:01:54.510> in

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
make a loop like that put your tag in

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:04.960 
make a loop like that put your tag in
through<00:01:58.729> make<00:01:59.729> sure<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.060> doesn't<00:02:00.360> slip<00:02:00.600> down

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.750 

come<00:02:05.970> around<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.479> through<00:02:09.020> pull<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.760> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
come around and through pull on that the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.010 
come around and through pull on that the
the<00:02:12.330> great<00:02:13.140> thing<00:02:13.170> about<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.680> bowline<00:02:14.190> knot<00:02:14.220> is

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
the great thing about a bowline knot is

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.270 
the great thing about a bowline knot is
you<00:02:16.020> can<00:02:16.170> put<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.500> doesn't<00:02:16.739> matter<00:02:16.860> how<00:02:17.100> much

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
you can put it doesn't matter how much

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.940 
you can put it doesn't matter how much
pressure<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.880> put<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.480> thing<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:19.500> can

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
pressure you put on this thing you can

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.830 
pressure you put on this thing you can
pull<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> truck<00:02:20.459> out<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.760> mud<00:02:20.820> or<00:02:21.239> tie<00:02:21.810> a

bowline knot all right so on this side

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.180 
bowline knot all right so on this side
we're<00:02:32.010> going<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.190> do<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> same<00:02:32.580> thing<00:02:34.190> we're

gonna bunch up half the tart but in on
this<00:02:42.330> side<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.750> attach<00:02:43.019> this<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.319> this<00:02:43.530> tree

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
this side to attach this to this tree

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.500 
this side to attach this to this tree
instead<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.550> using<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.850> bowline<00:02:45.239> I'm<00:02:45.330> going<00:02:45.450> to

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
instead of using a bowline I'm going to

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.020 
instead of using a bowline I'm going to
use<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.660> trucker's<00:02:46.110> hitch<00:02:46.319> now<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.610> want<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:47.910> do

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
use a trucker's hitch now I want to do

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.340 
use a trucker's hitch now I want to do
that<00:02:48.209> because<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.510> need<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:48.930> thing<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.200> be

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
that because I need this thing to be

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.319 
that because I need this thing to be
very<00:02:49.380> very<00:02:49.800> tight<00:02:50.100> so<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.519> doesn't<00:02:50.640> sag<00:02:51.030> so

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
very very tight so it doesn't sag so

00:02:51.329 --> 00:03:02.339 
very very tight so it doesn't sag so
much<00:02:51.480> when<00:02:51.660> I'm<00:02:51.750> laying<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.140> it

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
trucker's hitch you make a loop and you

is the way to do it finish that off with
a<00:03:51.590> little<00:03:51.799> half<00:03:52.010> hitch<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:56.299> she<00:03:56.720> ain't<00:03:56.870> going

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
a little half hitch and she ain't going

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.720 
a little half hitch and she ain't going
nowhere

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
nowhere

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.000 
nowhere
so<00:03:58.730> we've<00:03:59.660> got<00:03:59.840> blue<00:04:00.049> skies<00:04:00.200> right<00:04:00.560> now<00:04:00.620> but

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
so we've got blue skies right now but

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.170 
so we've got blue skies right now but
just<00:04:01.040> for<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.340> heck<00:04:01.489> of<00:04:01.610> it<00:04:01.760> I'm<00:04:01.880> gonna<00:04:01.970> take

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
just for the heck of it I'm gonna take

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.670 
just for the heck of it I'm gonna take
some<00:04:02.420> of<00:04:02.480> this<00:04:02.540> excess<00:04:02.989> rope<00:04:03.230> here

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
some of this excess rope here

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.580 
some of this excess rope here
and<00:04:04.180> run<00:04:05.180> us<00:04:05.299> a<00:04:05.420> line<00:04:05.630> up<00:04:05.840> here<00:04:05.870> so<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:06.350> I<00:04:06.380> can

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
and run us a line up here so that I can

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.840 
and run us a line up here so that I can
throw<00:04:06.739> this<00:04:07.040> up<00:04:07.250> over<00:04:07.549> it

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
throw this up over it

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.370 
throw this up over it
just<00:04:08.239> in<00:04:08.329> case<00:04:08.450> we<00:04:08.630> do<00:04:08.750> get<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:09.019> rain<00:04:09.170> it'll

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
just in case we do get it rain it'll

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.229 
just in case we do get it rain it'll
shed<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.739> rain<00:04:09.769> a<00:04:09.920> little<00:04:10.190> bit<00:04:10.280> better<00:04:10.459> now

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
shed the rain a little bit better now

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.630 
shed the rain a little bit better now
we've<00:04:11.810> got<00:04:12.019> this<00:04:12.260> loop<00:04:12.859> right<00:04:13.130> here<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.459> if<00:04:13.519> we

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
we've got this loop right here and if we

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.910 
we've got this loop right here and if we
pull<00:04:13.850> on<00:04:14.060> that<00:04:14.269> this<00:04:15.170> is<00:04:15.320> going<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.500> come<00:04:15.709> loose

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
pull on that this is going to come loose

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.349 
pull on that this is going to come loose
so<00:04:15.980> what<00:04:16.220> I'm<00:04:16.310> going<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.459> do<00:04:16.609> is<00:04:16.760> take<00:04:16.910> a<00:04:16.970> stick

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
so what I'm going to do is take a stick

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.240 
so what I'm going to do is take a stick
and<00:04:17.570> put<00:04:17.720> in<00:04:17.840> here<00:04:18.079> put<00:04:18.829> a<00:04:18.859> little<00:04:19.039> bit<00:04:19.160> of

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
and put in here put a little bit of

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.460 
and put in here put a little bit of
pressure<00:04:19.459> on<00:04:19.579> that<00:04:19.940> so<00:04:20.900> that<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.109> doesn't<00:04:21.380> come

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
pressure on that so that it doesn't come

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.770 
pressure on that so that it doesn't come
loose<00:04:21.550> when<00:04:22.550> we<00:04:22.669> do<00:04:22.850> get<00:04:23.030> ready<00:04:23.240> to<00:04:23.390> take<00:04:23.600> this

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
loose when we do get ready to take this

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.850 
loose when we do get ready to take this
loose<00:04:24.050> all<00:04:24.229> we<00:04:24.320> got<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.500> do<00:04:24.560> is<00:04:24.650> break<00:04:24.800> that

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
loose all we got to do is break that

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.650 
loose all we got to do is break that
stick<00:04:25.310> and<00:04:25.490> get<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.669> out<00:04:25.789> of<00:04:25.910> there<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.240> then

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
stick and get it out of there and then

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.620 
stick and get it out of there and then
we<00:04:26.750> can<00:04:26.780> pull<00:04:27.080> it

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.630 

alright<00:04:31.320> so<00:04:31.500> I'm<00:04:31.710> gonna<00:04:31.830> take<00:04:31.980> this<00:04:32.220> over<00:04:32.430> here

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
alright so I'm gonna take this over here

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:47.110 
alright so I'm gonna take this over here
I'm<00:04:32.790> gonna<00:04:32.910> tie<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.150> clove<00:04:33.480> hitch

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.770 

so<00:04:48.120> overlap<00:04:48.960> your<00:04:49.170> rope<00:04:49.410> right<00:04:49.650> there<00:04:50.780> bring

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
so overlap your rope right there bring

00:04:51.780 --> 00:05:00.860 
so overlap your rope right there bring
this<00:04:51.930> around<00:04:56.210> and<00:04:57.210> then<00:04:57.470> back<00:04:58.470> under<00:04:59.870> this

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
this around and then back under this

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.470 
this around and then back under this
rope<00:05:01.650> here<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.870> that's<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.970> nice<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.000> secure

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
rope here and that's it nice and secure

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.690 
rope here and that's it nice and secure
so<00:05:07.430> what<00:05:08.430> now<00:05:08.580> we<00:05:08.610> can<00:05:08.820> just<00:05:08.970> take<00:05:09.120> this<00:05:09.330> excess

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
so what now we can just take this excess

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.080 
so what now we can just take this excess
flip<00:05:11.700> it<00:05:11.850> right<00:05:12.000> over<00:05:12.360> here<00:05:13.610> if<00:05:14.610> you<00:05:14.700> want<00:05:15.000> to

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
flip it right over here if you want to
