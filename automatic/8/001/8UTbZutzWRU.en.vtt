00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
my first g1 pony I received as a child

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.639 
my first g1 pony I received as a child
was<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.270> one<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.870> her<00:00:34.829> name<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.340> moonstone

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
was this one and her name is moonstone

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.610 
was this one and her name is moonstone
um<00:00:37.879> her<00:00:38.879> hair<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.480> don't<00:00:40.050> know<00:00:40.140> what<00:00:40.290> happened

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
um her hair I don't know what happened

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.959 
um her hair I don't know what happened
to<00:00:40.739> her<00:00:40.860> hair<00:00:41.690> um<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.620> did<00:00:44.160> wash<00:00:44.430> them<00:00:44.760> all

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
to her hair um but I did wash them all

to her hair um but I did wash them all
and<00:00:45.360> brush<00:00:46.260> their<00:00:46.530> hair<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.160> guess<00:00:47.370> their

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579
