we're into precision 8 and that's a

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.930 
we're into precision 8 and that's a

us where we can plant more coming in the
bottom<00:01:20.030> versus<00:01:20.630> less<00:01:20.840> on<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.140> heels<00:01:21.470> we're

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.840 
bottom versus less on the heels we're
looking<00:01:22.070> at<00:01:22.190> 15s<00:01:22.729> corn<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:23.810> ever<00:01:24.140> change<00:01:24.470> and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
looking at 15s corn this ever change and

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.559 
looking at 15s corn this ever change and
that<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:26.090> what's<00:01:26.420> pushing<00:01:26.929> the<00:01:27.860> envelope

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
that is what's pushing the envelope

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.359 
that is what's pushing the envelope
Bogart<00:01:29.569> to<00:01:29.840> one<00:01:30.259> of<00:01:30.410> the<00:01:30.500> traits<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:31.009> has

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
Bogart to one of the traits that has

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.029 
Bogart to one of the traits that has
actually<00:01:31.849> helped<00:01:32.149> a<00:01:32.240> lot<00:01:32.420> in<00:01:33.140> us<00:01:33.380> in<00:01:33.619> raising

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
actually helped a lot in us in raising

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.070 
actually helped a lot in us in raising
cotton<00:01:34.220> because<00:01:34.729> it<00:01:34.970> has<00:01:35.090> alleviated<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.899> lot

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
cotton because it has alleviated a lot

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.900 
cotton because it has alleviated a lot
of<00:01:36.229> spraying<00:01:36.560> that<00:01:36.860> we<00:01:37.039> would<00:01:37.250> normally<00:01:37.399> do

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
of spraying that we would normally do

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.260 
of spraying that we would normally do
with<00:01:38.660> soybeans<00:01:39.229> of<00:01:40.160> course<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.759> Roundup

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
Ready trait I mean when it first come

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.760 
Ready trait I mean when it first come
out<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.250> was<00:01:43.369> almost<00:01:43.580> like<00:01:43.970> gold<00:01:44.649> when<00:01:45.649> you

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
out it was almost like gold when you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.710 
out it was almost like gold when you
talk<00:01:45.950> about<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.160> seed<00:01:46.429> that<00:01:46.819> you<00:01:46.880> can<00:01:47.149> put<00:01:47.599> in

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
talk about a seed that you can put in
