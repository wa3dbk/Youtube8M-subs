00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello today i will cook without and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.410
 according to an unusual recipe 2 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.059
 well sampled and disinfected 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.059
 tits separate squirrels from yolks 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.150
 I squirrels to large bubbles one 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.680
 I'll pour out a lot 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.619
 three tablespoons of ice water add 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.510
 60 grams of granulated sugar 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.510
 salt to steady peaks 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:38.210
 add 3 volts of stator powder and 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.520
 Sob Douglas who brilliant state 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.129
 well beaten whites should not fall out 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.890
 from the bowl the total whipping time is approximately 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.800
 5-6 minutes with two spoons 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.539
 we spread the whipped mass on paper for 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.840
 baking in small portions on 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.219
 distance from each other i don't like 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.550
 without laid out with 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.210
 pastry bag because squirrels when 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.000
 this was much better settled by two 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.049
 spoons can me so beautiful but 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.360
 taste and texture are excellent when 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:21.240
 this way warmed up to 120 degrees 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.540
 put the oven bezheski 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.659
 on average and I'll bake them 40 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.240
 minutes further reduce the temperature to 100 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.220
 degrees and bake for another hour 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.600
 turn off the oven open the door and 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.600
 leave without and until cool 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:02:01.909
 That kind of sound should be finished without 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:07.190
 Sasha dry and rustling inside should 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:09.289
 be porous and absolutely steps out 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.200
 without them you can make a cake with 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.860
 butter cream or just eat in tea 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.870
