things must come to an end and even

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:23.870 
things must come to an end and even
though<00:00:22.349> I'm<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:22.529> sure<00:00:22.919> if<00:00:23.040> this<00:00:23.160> arc<00:00:23.430> was<00:00:23.610> good

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
though I'm not sure if this arc was good

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.630 
though I'm not sure if this arc was good
or<00:00:23.970> not<00:00:24.029> quite<00:00:24.539> yet<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.259> have<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.279> say<00:00:26.460> they

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
or not quite yet I have to say they

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.950 
or not quite yet I have to say they
certainly<00:00:27.090> ended<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.779> pretty

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
certainly ended it in a pretty

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.889 
certainly ended it in a pretty
interesting<00:00:28.380> way<00:00:28.860> um<00:00:29.700> this<00:00:30.119> chapter<00:00:30.419> itself

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:30.899 
interesting way um this chapter itself

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.690 
interesting way um this chapter itself
was<00:00:31.110> another<00:00:31.470> padding<00:00:31.919> out<00:00:32.040> chapter<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.610> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
was another padding out chapter in a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.100 
was another padding out chapter in a
sense<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.270> gave<00:00:33.390> us<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.600> little<00:00:33.719> bit<00:00:33.899> more

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
sense and it gave us a little bit more

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.780 
sense and it gave us a little bit more
resolution<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> end<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.340> fullbring

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
resolution to the end of this fullbring

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.020 
resolution to the end of this fullbring
art<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.899> overall<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.860> was<00:00:37.980> again<00:00:38.430> kind<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
art but overall it was again kind of a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.209 
art but overall it was again kind of a
disappointment<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.290> chapter<00:00:40.620> itself<00:00:40.890> opens

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219

awesome in his robes and everything and
I'm<00:01:27.749> curious<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.200> know<00:01:28.319> if<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.469> actually<00:01:28.590> can

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
I'm curious to know if they actually can

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.529 
I'm curious to know if they actually can
still<00:01:29.189> use<00:01:29.310> their<00:01:29.490> visored<00:01:29.850> powers<00:01:30.149> and<00:01:30.329> you

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
still use their visored powers and you

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.020 
still use their visored powers and you
know<00:01:30.689> they<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.829> guess<00:01:31.979> uh<00:01:32.219> visoreds<00:01:32.939> are

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
know they can so I guess uh visoreds are

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.239 
know they can so I guess uh visoreds are
cool<00:01:33.209> now<00:01:33.389> so<00:01:33.719> that's<00:01:33.899> awesome<00:01:34.139> but<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.130> whole

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
cool now so that's awesome but the whole

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:36.440 
cool now so that's awesome but the whole
point<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.639> chapter<00:01:35.939> was<00:01:36.090> each<00:01:36.270> goes

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
point of the chapter was each goes

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.090 
point of the chapter was each goes
actually<00:01:36.810> come<00:01:37.020> back<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.350> soul<00:01:37.560> society

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
actually come back to soul society

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.849

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
because apparently Renji brought ging

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.489 
because apparently Renji brought ging
Joe's<00:01:41.069> body<00:01:41.399> to<00:01:41.789> soul<00:01:42.029> society<00:01:42.539> and<00:01:42.719> I<00:01:43.289> guess

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:46.160 
Joe's body to soul society and I guess
they're<00:01:43.709> just<00:01:43.950> keeping<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.869> but<00:01:45.869> each<00:01:46.049> of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
they're just keeping it but each of

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.209 
they're just keeping it but each of
those<00:01:46.259> come<00:01:46.499> back<00:01:46.649> because<00:01:46.859> he<00:01:47.100> actually

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
those come back because he actually

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:48.649 
those come back because he actually
wants<00:01:47.609> to<00:01:47.670> take<00:01:47.850> his<00:01:47.939> body<00:01:48.179> back<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
wants to take his body back to the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.379 
wants to take his body back to the
material<00:01:49.590> world<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.579> he<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.880> give<00:01:51.029> him<00:01:51.209> a

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:51.389 
material world so that he can give him a

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:53.629 
material world so that he can give him a
proper<00:01:51.689> burial<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.709> I<00:01:52.979> guess<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:53.340> pretty

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639 
proper burial and I guess that's pretty

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:54.919 
proper burial and I guess that's pretty
cool<00:01:53.849> because<00:01:54.060> even<00:01:54.479> though<00:01:54.569> he<00:01:54.719> was<00:01:54.899> a

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
cool because even though he was a

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.569 
cool because even though he was a
villain<00:01:55.319> he<00:01:55.469> did<00:01:55.619> sort<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.979> teach<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.279> lot<00:01:56.399> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
villain he did sort of teach a lot to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.609 
villain he did sort of teach a lot to
Ichigo<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.420> kind<00:01:57.569> of<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.779> big<00:01:57.959> deal<00:01:57.990> so

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
Ichigo so that is kind of a big deal so

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.949 
Ichigo so that is kind of a big deal so
that<00:01:58.799> he<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.130> give<00:01:59.279> him<00:01:59.429> a<00:01:59.639> proper<00:01:59.939> burial<00:02:00.270> and

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
that he can give him a proper burial and

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:02.690 
that he can give him a proper burial and
I<00:02:01.200> guess<00:02:01.439> that's<00:02:01.649> pretty<00:02:01.829> cool<00:02:02.099> because<00:02:02.310> even

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
I guess that's pretty cool because even

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.160 
I guess that's pretty cool because even
though<00:02:02.789> he<00:02:02.969> was<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.179> villain<00:02:03.569> he<00:02:03.689> did<00:02:03.869> sort<00:02:04.109> of

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
though he was a villain he did sort of

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.899 
though he was a villain he did sort of
teach<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.499> lot<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.829> Ichigo<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.669> kind<00:02:05.819> of

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
teach a lot to Ichigo so that is kind of

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.789 
teach a lot to Ichigo so that is kind of
a<00:02:06.029> big<00:02:06.179> deal<00:02:06.209> into<00:02:06.959> the<00:02:07.049> chapter<00:02:07.409> gave<00:02:07.619> us<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
a big deal into the chapter gave us a

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.870 
a big deal into the chapter gave us a
little<00:02:07.919> more<00:02:08.009> interesting<00:02:08.399> thing<00:02:08.729> with

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
little more interesting thing with

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.370 
little more interesting thing with
Arouca<00:02:09.300> we<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.569> see<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.810> she's<00:02:09.990> standing<00:02:10.259> at

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
Arouca we can see that she's standing at

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.510 
Arouca we can see that she's standing at
the<00:02:10.470> top<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.860> building<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.370> she's

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
the top of the building and she's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.040 
the top of the building and she's
basically<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:12.150> her<00:02:12.240> head<00:02:12.450> having<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.840> little

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
basically in her head having a little

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.480 
basically in her head having a little
monologue<00:02:13.319> thanking<00:02:13.860> all<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.099> people<00:02:14.400> who

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
monologue thanking all the people who

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.430 
monologue thanking all the people who
helped<00:02:14.790> her<00:02:14.849> out<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.660> guess<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.990> shortest

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
helped her out and I guess the shortest

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.860 
helped her out and I guess the shortest
shows<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.950> she<00:02:17.370> has<00:02:17.549> developed<00:02:18.060> into<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.599> very

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
shows that she has developed into a very

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.270 
shows that she has developed into a very
nice<00:02:19.079> character<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.829> a<00:02:19.950> little

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
nice character and a little

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.980 
nice character and a little
us<00:02:20.340> soon<00:02:20.640> dear<00:02:20.970> but<00:02:21.420> that's<00:02:21.720> pretty<00:02:21.870> much

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
us soon dear but that's pretty much

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.480 
us soon dear but that's pretty much
where<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.319> chapter<00:02:22.620> comes<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:22.980> close<00:02:23.130> it's

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
where the chapter comes to a close it's

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.980 
where the chapter comes to a close it's
kind<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.819> nice<00:02:24.000> but<00:02:24.360> at<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.510> end<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.810> day<00:02:24.959> I

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
kind of nice but at the end of the day I

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.480 
kind of nice but at the end of the day I
really<00:02:25.440> wish<00:02:25.590> there<00:02:25.740> was<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> lot<00:02:26.100> more<00:02:26.130> things

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
really wish there was a lot more things

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.740 
really wish there was a lot more things
they<00:02:26.640> could<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:26.880> told<00:02:27.060> us<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.420> fill<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
they could have told us to fill in the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.500 
they could have told us to fill in the
gaps<00:02:28.020> this<00:02:28.740> was<00:02:28.980> just<00:02:29.310> another<00:02:29.510> interesting

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
gaps this was just another interesting

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.860 
gaps this was just another interesting
way<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.690> end<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.200> arc<00:02:31.410> again<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.459> feel<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.330> I'm

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
way to end the arc again I feel that I'm

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.930 
way to end the arc again I feel that I'm
just<00:02:34.170> stressing<00:02:35.010> what<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.280> was<00:02:35.490> saying<00:02:35.700> last

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
just stressing what I was saying last

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.800 
just stressing what I was saying last
week<00:02:36.240> which<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.440> kubo<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.670> he<00:02:39.090> isn't<00:02:39.450> filling

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
week which is kubo just he isn't filling

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.920 
week which is kubo just he isn't filling
in<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.290> lot<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.800> gaps<00:02:41.040> here<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.660> maybe<00:02:42.660> he's

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
in a lot of the gaps here and maybe he's

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.330 
in a lot of the gaps here and maybe he's
just<00:02:43.080> doing<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.530> keep<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.950> world<00:02:44.130> as

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
just doing that to keep the world as

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.760 
just doing that to keep the world as
mysterious<00:02:44.880> as<00:02:45.060> possible<00:02:45.569> but<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.470> more<00:02:46.709> I

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
mysterious as possible but the more I

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.590 
mysterious as possible but the more I
keep<00:02:47.160> reading<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.670> more<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:47.880> keep<00:02:48.150> seeing<00:02:48.330> all

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
keep reading the more I keep seeing all

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.650 
keep reading the more I keep seeing all
of<00:02:48.630> these<00:02:48.840> really<00:02:49.230> missed<00:02:49.500> opportunities<00:02:50.280> and

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
of these really missed opportunities and

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.449 
of these really missed opportunities and
you<00:02:51.660> know<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:52.050> guess<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.470> full<00:02:52.709> bring<00:02:52.920> arc<00:02:53.130> in<00:02:53.340> a

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
you know I guess the full bring arc in a

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.750 
you know I guess the full bring arc in a
sense<00:02:53.700> was<00:02:53.880> okay<00:02:54.360> but<00:02:55.260> it's<00:02:55.560> easily<00:02:56.220> my<00:02:56.370> least

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
sense was okay but it's easily my least

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.699 
sense was okay but it's easily my least
favorite<00:02:57.120> art<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:57.570> far<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.110> know<00:02:58.230> at

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
favorite art so far and you know at

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.470 
favorite art so far and you know at
first<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.070> didn't<00:02:59.280> like<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.459> Arrancar<00:03:00.150> stuff

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
first I didn't like the Arrancar stuff

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.850 
first I didn't like the Arrancar stuff
because<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.870> felt<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.350> was<00:03:01.440> going<00:03:01.590> on<00:03:01.800> for

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
because I felt that it was going on for

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.820 
because I felt that it was going on for
too<00:03:02.190> long<00:03:02.420> but<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.540> retrospect<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.380> liked<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.800> a

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
too long but in retrospect I liked it a

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.490 
too long but in retrospect I liked it a
lot<00:03:05.010> more<00:03:05.069> because<00:03:05.730> even<00:03:06.180> though<00:03:06.330> kubo<00:03:07.200> had

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
lot more because even though kubo had

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.229 
lot more because even though kubo had
nothing<00:03:07.830> but<00:03:07.920> pretty<00:03:08.340> much<00:03:08.400> fights<00:03:08.760> going<00:03:09.000> on

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
nothing but pretty much fights going on

that's<00:03:49.380> based<00:03:49.620> mostly<00:03:50.010> around<00:03:50.609> swordplay<00:03:51.180> in

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
that's based mostly around swordplay in

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.830 
that's based mostly around swordplay in
sword<00:03:52.109> battles<00:03:52.519> but<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:54.180> fact<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.660> just

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
sword battles but the fact that it just

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.110 
sword battles but the fact that it just
ended<00:03:55.170> so<00:03:55.230> simply<00:03:56.100> just<00:03:56.310> kind<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.579> disappoints

me a lot if there's one thing I can say

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.380 
me a lot if there's one thing I can say
about<00:03:58.769> this<00:03:59.100> art<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.549> I<00:03:59.579> think<00:03:59.820> is<00:03:59.910> good<00:04:00.150> i

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
about this art that I think is good i

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.240 
about this art that I think is good i
think<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.170> anime<00:04:01.560> is<00:04:01.620> doing<00:04:01.890> a<00:04:01.980> much

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
think that the anime is doing a much

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.039 
think that the anime is doing a much
better<00:04:02.280> version<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.239> i<00:04:03.390> recently<00:04:03.810> just

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
better version of it i recently just

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.259 
better version of it i recently just
watched<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.530> episode<00:04:04.560> where<00:04:05.190> sue<00:04:05.850> kashima

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
watched the episode where sue kashima

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.180 
watched the episode where sue kashima
and<00:04:06.570> ichigo<00:04:06.989> fight<00:04:07.230> for<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.500> first<00:04:07.709> time<00:04:07.890> and

and ichigo fight for the first time and

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.039 
and ichigo fight for the first time and
i<00:04:08.579> thought<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:08.850> looked<00:04:08.940> really<00:04:09.239> good<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.870> can

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049
