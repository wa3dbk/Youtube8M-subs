00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hi girls I hope you go 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.750
 Well, I'm happy to see you in the lobby 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.250
 to make a new video 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.350
 so today I'm coming back to talk 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.790
 of the year kendrick number 2 I think 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.200
 as they have heard, and the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.210
 nike is anyway every time we 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.889
 hears a lot of talk and I'm afraid 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.049
 always because i love naked me 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.970
 I totally changed my style since 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.050
 I'm sorry if you hear the noise 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.060
 it is the machine that is in the process of 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.650
 turn me since I'm on 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.760
 youtube I changed a lot I think 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.750
 I really spent mostly all 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.220
 that is to say that before I had 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.689
 always lipstick very very 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.220
 pale who fall has totally agreed 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.710
 of skin even something of lilith 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.450
 white in fact and on my eyes I had 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.100
 many colors colors 13 the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.809
 fishing you will not see these videos there 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.030
 because I've removed a lot of them 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.730
 Videos will please me more and I 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.840
 did not support actually unrolled so that 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.370
 now I only put in another 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.780
 on my eyes it really is really 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.190
 that I prefer and color on them 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.870
 lips a plan it's really really 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.890
 what can I do so I crack 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.059
 always for the year worry because 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.350
 that for me the colors are never 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.260
 the same even if it's colors 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.079
 rather close that for me it's 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.820
 always different relaxation and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.620
 this one i'll finally good me them 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.730
 have nothing to do he used the 2nd and for 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.989
 me they have nothing to do so in 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.090
 this video there I will make you a 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.560
 review so on this little palette there 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.520
 and after I make you the comparison this 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.110
 that it's still nice that the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.630
 compare to find out if actually 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.860
 it is also felt on the contrary they 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.479
 have nothing to do with anything that 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.390
 it's the perfect pallets to bring back 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.360
 on weekends or on vacation or traveling 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.560
 no matter I think it's really ideal 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.180
 in fact because it's small 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.909
 does not contain a lot of time but this 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.159
 it takes for a vacation or for a 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.119
 weekend not me personally I 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.470
 finds that these palettes are really 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.820
 perfect so what I actually do in 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.590
 this palette is that there are tones 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.720
 clear to darker tone 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.640
 so we can do a lot of 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.409
 makeup had done a lot of 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.939
 makeup always staying neutral 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.049
 of course, but if we want something 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.299
 very natural thing we can use 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.229
 it's anti they're something of a 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.759
 a little darker we can use 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.869
 this one is what I like is that we have 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.729
 always do a little bit more 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.470
 dark to actually apply in into 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.540
 kind of liner a little bit smoked or in 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.070
 outer corner when we 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.060
 intensity a little bit of makeup and 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.710
 for me it's not classes are 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.940
 hyper practice actually it not practical 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.650
 to go on a weekend or a trip 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.090
 but in any case it's not to be that I 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.410
 would take but obviously I 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.210
 also use when I'm at home 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.590
 of course so we will start 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.420
 with the roofs starting with the 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.020
 first which is the script that is the one 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.400
 this one jack this is a Belgian one 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.890
 with bunkers or a little bit 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.280
 orange and he is super nice I like 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.800
 a lot 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.710
 ltd eyebrow to illuminate or any 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.630
 simply to unify the eyelid 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.340
 he is very nice I think that on the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.420
 skin it tends to be a little bit 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.790
 more Belgians it does a little bit 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.200
 less will have g and is really 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.310
 great for eyebrows and that's the 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.840
 kind of woman for me who is 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.730
 therefore essential that it is launched 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.770
 by splinters I find it perfect then 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.600
 we have the starck who presents himself as 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.920
 those ci who is a little bit more 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.510
 dark and I find he has sub 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.530
 are a little bit more pink and then I 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.520
 finds that this one with respect to 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.170
 the other to August 10 a little bit more 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.209
 dew and that's what I like it 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.610
 super light but I think his sovan 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.090
 not bad and this one I find hyper 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.340
 hyper ro that's how they present themselves 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.660
 the lighthouses of this palette like the 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.550
 palettes ena something like this 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.230
 have passed powdery years the families 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.940
 still funny claims and so 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.350
 he presents himself as those he send 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.430
 a little darker but at the same 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.400
 time it was a little bit more 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.720
 pink and work I really like this 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.040
 kind of hues when I do not want 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.320
 to do too much on my eyes or 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.810
 jean-louis to use for example at this 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.130
 level there to fade actually used 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.110
 finally a clearer thing to blur 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.590
 I find it perfect then we have the egg 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.430
 risk which is this one this one again 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.780
 once a little darker 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.610
 necessarily they are all a little bit 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.940
 darker than the others each time 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.590
 and here it is it is a light brown 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.269
 that's moncler that's just too much 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.040
 beautiful this one is the same I have a lot 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.750
 actually use it at that level for 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.010
 fade when I have a lighthouse a little 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.900
 a little darker to blend 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.310
 in fact between the dark lighthouse and the 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.049
 belgian lighthouse like to use to make one 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.610
 little bit clearer and it's just 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.100
 robot i love this lighthouse the hole really 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.320
 beautiful I love this kind of tone 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.000
 then we have the cover that presents itself 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.920
 like those who is super nice so 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.680
 this is this one again he still 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.900
 a little darker I love it 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.549
 I love these colors I find them 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.810
 just beautiful honestly honestly 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.280
 if I have to know 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.030
 they are nothing extraordinary is 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.700
 classic banal relaxation 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.020
 but I love to use and I find 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.910
 that with all these buffers really does 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.540
 super nice makeup loves this 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.810
 palette 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.490
 then we have the primal this one that 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.120
 I use very very very often on the 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.530
 mobile eyelid 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.940
 he introduces himself as these is a 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.630
 soft brown with bunkers a little 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.560
 little mole 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.450
 he is really very very very pretty 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.710
 just to be honest I was 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.820
 asked to make this video I'm doing it 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.520
 I do not know what to say 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.070
 because the headlights are super pretty 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.180
 but have nothing transcendent so 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.050
 you are absolutely not obliged 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.400
 to buy this pallet 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.810
 I personally find it just 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.030
 super belgians love this kind of tone 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.080
 I do not have that kind of trick in the 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.210
 collection because for me they are 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.380
 all a little different but this 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.960
 pallet there is nothing extraordinary what 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.850
 there is nothing transcendent in 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.890
 this palette is very beautiful but 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.840
 that's all, and lastly we have 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.600
 had a deal that looks like those 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.190
 here and this one it's a pretty gray one 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.990
 dark actually I just find it 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.240
 beautiful I do not know why 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.560
 I love doing it there and these kinds of iron 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.669
 that I will use very often done 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.950
 and I'm going to use it actually as a 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.210
 eyeliner but that I 'm going to let that 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.830
 deceive to make it a little bit more 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.690
 smoke and I love doing that 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.790
 I love doing that and it makes a rendering a 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.110
 little more natural than with a clasp 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.660
 done it's just less 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.680
 pigmented - less marked in fact and 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.720
 when I want something 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.950
 Well, that's it when I talked to myself 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.030
 break the head to make up makeup I 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.140
 want to wear makeup but I 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.520
 frankly not want to spend three 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.680
 hours am I going to take a black dot or 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.970
 a parent like that I do how she 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.039
 is a dead icon then he 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.960
 I hope something to smoke I 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.490
 do this up and down are made up 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.120
 I did not break my head and I do 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.880
 in three minutes 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.810
 that's it and that's it's top it's top and 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.800
 blow these people do not be that I 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.460
 used when I do not want to 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.990
 break the head 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.100
 when I want to be fast it's not 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.419
 kind of pallets actually I'm going 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.050
 watch for two hours saying 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.729
 that she is lighthouse I will use 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.770
 today the tour was fast enough 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.120
 Actually there are six a shadow and 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.260
 I love this palette because 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.820
 precisely when I do not want to be 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.229
 too much makeup when I do not want to 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.789
 to make crates where I want a 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.810
 makeup pretty fast I like 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.070
 point that it's not to be there so 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.470
 now I compare you one and the 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:03.870
 two so one looks like those 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.890
 it gives you this way 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.090
 can really say a lot to me 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.830
 it's not the ben I do not know I 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.169
 think you can see what it is 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.150
 not himself tin are much more 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.980
 different than this tale 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.600
 what do you see here it's more of 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.970
 beige hues it was a little bit 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.410
 more orange and pink and the cedh is a 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.650
 a little darker there a little more 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.900
 clear and there we have a nice bat no there we have 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.160
 a Belgian maths and there is black matte for 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.770
 me it is the indispensable all the cases 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.280
 and there we have no normal and we have not 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.780
 big mat 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.980
 after the douars mater of the pages puts in 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.180
 world a little bit in a lot of 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.710
 shuffles so we quickly went around 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.100
 I personally prefer the two 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.480
 I prefer both now if I have to 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.040
 you advise one if you do not have 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.060
 palace if ever you search 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.000
 really invest in a small 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.350
 pallet not too expensive did not have you 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.400
 the Belgian is not black matte I you 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.290
 advise one because for me 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.000
 it's really essential 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.680
 in addition we were scared came who is a 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.580
 super nice tan later so here in 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.490
 you 're really going a pretty palette 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.390
 complete for not too expensive and if it's 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.800
 your first panic she will be 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.150
 really great after if you ever 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.410
 had I advise you to 2 because 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.570
 personally it's more the 2 that I 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.770
 simply prefer after the air 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.700
 obviously the tastes the colors one is 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.110
 all different kinds and who have 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.270
 preferred the 2nd in a who preferred the 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.310
 a me I prefer the 2 because that's it 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.190
 I prefer it is have a little bit 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.500
 more pink and but I love lan - laminated 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.030
 before having both while one day 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.350
 I was going to use one every day 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.640
 and I made myself almost every 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.560
 kinds of makeup a little smoky 

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.240
 all that I liked a lot but after 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.860
 I use both very often hungry 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.160
 it's really two palettes that I like 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.720
 a lot 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.310
 so here's for the review on appendix ii 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.810
 and with the comparison with the year 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.250
 leave pure I think you have 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.870
 understood a little bit my opinion I find 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.440
 that the two is really very very beautiful 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.970
 but I love Norman one is for me 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.200
 the best is to have both actually 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:42.050
 is to be able to mix the headlights 

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.950
 to use this one with this one for 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.600
 me it's top 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.070
 these two are really two vestiges 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.180
 must go on a one way trip but I 

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.680
 take both it does not take a lot of 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.450
 place and it's great 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.860
 so that's a challenge for this little girl 

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.240
 video I hope you liked it 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.800
 so was not very very long since 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.940
 was not big do not know that 

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.110
 it's a permanent edition so you 

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.370
 can find her today as 

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.230
 you can find it in six months 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.490
 and no worries though in six months we 

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.530
 may have a basic number effect 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.940
 3 who knows I do not know so this challenge 

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:08.290
