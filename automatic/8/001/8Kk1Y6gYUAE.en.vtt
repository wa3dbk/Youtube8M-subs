their disease I encourage my patients to

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.380 
their disease I encourage my patients to
participate<00:00:37.489> because<00:00:38.489> really<00:00:38.850> that's<00:00:39.149> how<00:00:39.270> we

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
participate because really that's how we

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.410 
participate because really that's how we
we<00:00:40.020> learn<00:00:40.610> what<00:00:41.610> works<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.180> doesn't

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
we learn what works and what doesn't

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.740 
we learn what works and what doesn't
work<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.930> medicine<00:00:44.239> ALS<00:00:45.239> patients<00:00:45.270> ask<00:00:45.840> me

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
work in medicine ALS patients ask me

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.720 
work in medicine ALS patients ask me
what<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.140> disease<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.890> what<00:00:50.039> causes<00:00:50.340> it

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
what is this disease and what causes it

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.860 
what is this disease and what causes it
and<00:00:51.680> I<00:00:52.680> don't<00:00:52.980> think<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.820> had<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and I don't think we have had the the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.410 
and I don't think we have had the the
breakthrough<00:00:55.440> discovery<00:00:56.340> yet<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> basic

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
breakthrough discovery yet in the basic

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.740 
breakthrough discovery yet in the basic
science<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> lot<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.160> clues

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
science of that we have a lot of clues

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.619 
science of that we have a lot of clues
clues<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.989> come<00:01:01.170> from<00:01:01.379> looking<00:01:02.309> at

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
clues that come from looking at

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.600 
clues that come from looking at
pathology<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.080> specimens<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.860> clues<00:01:05.309> that

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
pathology the specimens and clues that

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.870 
pathology the specimens and clues that
come<00:01:05.880> from<00:01:06.590> learning<00:01:07.590> about<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.430> genetics

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
come from learning about the genetics

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.859 
come from learning about the genetics
that<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.720> be<00:01:09.810> related<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.439> ALS<00:01:11.540> but<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.570> don't

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
that can be related to ALS but I don't

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.469 
that can be related to ALS but I don't
think<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.710> made<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.220> major<00:01:14.520> discovery

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
think we have made the major discovery

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.910 
think we have made the major discovery
that<00:01:15.780> makes<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:16.950> clear<00:01:17.369> yet<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.360> ALS<00:01:18.950> and

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
that makes it all clear yet for ALS and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.670 
that makes it all clear yet for ALS and
patients<00:01:22.920> keep<00:01:23.100> asking<00:01:23.759> us<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:25.470> keep

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
patients keep asking us that and we keep

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.840 
patients keep asking us that and we keep
asking<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.159> question<00:01:26.460> as<00:01:26.970> well<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.750> our<00:01:28.850> our

asking that question as well of our our
scientific<00:01:30.509> studies<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:30.900> I'm<00:01:31.590> hopeful<00:01:32.070> I'm

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
scientific studies and I'm hopeful I'm

scientific studies and I'm hopeful I'm
hopeful<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.810> we<00:01:33.810> will<00:01:34.049> make<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
hopeful that we will make the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
samples and to harvest cells from them

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.690 
samples and to harvest cells from them
and<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.479> turn<00:02:00.689> them<00:02:00.840> into<00:02:01.219> sort<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.340> stem

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
and to turn them into sort of like stem

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.459 
and to turn them into sort of like stem
cells<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.590> this<00:02:04.590> these<00:02:05.219> cells<00:02:05.520> can<00:02:05.790> be<00:02:06.469> turned

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
cells and this these cells can be turned

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.219 
cells and this these cells can be turned
into<00:02:07.680> motor<00:02:08.280> neuron<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.970> cells<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.110> be

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
into motor neuron like cells that can be

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.230 
into motor neuron like cells that can be
studied<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.860> his<00:02:11.190> laboratory

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
studied in his laboratory

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.590 
studied in his laboratory
and<00:02:12.530> efforts<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:13.710> that<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:14.840> think<00:02:15.840> are<00:02:17.600> going

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
and efforts like that I think are going

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.720 
and efforts like that I think are going
to<00:02:18.720> help<00:02:19.290> us<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.740> future<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.100> understand

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
to help us in the future to understand

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.670 
to help us in the future to understand
this<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.390> disease<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.260> way<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.590> we

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
this this disease and the way that we

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.070 
this this disease and the way that we
need<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.040> understand<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.760> in<00:02:24.030> order<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.750> design

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
need to understand it in order to design

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.650 
need to understand it in order to design
the<00:02:25.260> therapies<00:02:25.710> they're<00:02:25.920> going<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.100> work<00:02:26.310> and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
the therapies they're going to work and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.580 
the therapies they're going to work and
they're<00:02:27.660> going<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.870> cure<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.380> disease

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
they're going to cure this disease

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.250 
they're going to cure this disease
someday
