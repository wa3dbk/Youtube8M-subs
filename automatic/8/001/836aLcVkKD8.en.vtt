00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello everyone and everyone welcome to a 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.819
 new road video with andrew I'm going to 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.500
 present the products that I have gone 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.200
 ending and I always end up with 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.210
 too many for a video so I guess 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.039
 that I will distribute it along the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.840
 next months and I have this bag full 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.939
 so I do not linger anymore and we're going to 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.550
 start the product that is more 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.390
 up is this one here and they are 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.849
 exfoliating socks for the feet and 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.279
 it's very funny because there was never 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.559
 tested this type of product and we 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.610
 some youtubers were given that we went to a 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.550
 clark event which is a store of 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.410
 the group drugstores of the same group 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.370
 that the supermarkets diaz to that 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.260
 You can also use this product 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.289
 find us then mark the days the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.629
 Mark is Monterrey and they are like a 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.579
 kind of plastic bags that are 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.399
 full or that have a lot of product 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.289
 inside a liquid inside that leads 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.360
 glycolic lactic acid or acid 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.580
 salicylic then you put them in 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.700
 I think you have to be about 90 minutes 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.400
 with the feet with that on and then what 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.990
 you retire and the moment like that does not seem 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.240
 that the fact prologue effect during the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.450
 next 7 days or the next seven 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.720
 days all the skin is released 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.640
 dead of the feet is a tad more than 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.920
 theirs in the sense that they are going 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.350
 clearing the feet as if we were a 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.270
 snake but it 's true that when 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.970
 all that process ends the feet are left 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.770
 impeccable I suppose that if we use 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.140
 this type of product with certain 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.170
 frequency maybe once every two 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.330
 months or once a month the effect is not 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.530
 so dramatic but the 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.780
 super soft feet and it will not be so so 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.790
 unpleasant that feeling of is not that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.350
 is unpleasant but it is very rare that 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.170
 go skinning the feet is also 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.750
 that can approach the skin as a 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.030
 strips then it 's kind of weird that but 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.190
 it's true that super-tasty when 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.140
 At the end, the feet are very soft and 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.700
 perfect I recommend it and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.430
 I will probably do that to buy 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.110
 two or three envelopes 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.090
 of these to use it with certain 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.399
 often because the result is 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.440
 incredible the next product that you 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.140
 I'm going to show you is this protective spray 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.570
 Heat is called heat or keratin and is 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.640
 laboratory or phyto and I liked it 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.010
 quite because it moisturizes hair 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.590
 or at least prevent him from getting dehydrated 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.959
 too much hair when we use 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.760
 dryer irons or tongs is 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.250
 pretty good the bad is the price that 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.680
 it is quite high but it is a product 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.720
 that 's pretty good that's very good 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.120
 yes I do not cheat the spray system 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.920
 of the spray because it comes out as very jet 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.290
 the next product that I'm going to 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.950
 teach is this oil cleanser of 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.410
 damn it's called nectar tubes and it's a 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.510
 cleaning oil that removes all the 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.850
 makeup removes it pretty well is 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.530
 bio cosmetic so those that 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.230
 feel is this kind of products os 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.000
 will like and it is true that the aromas of 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.680
 damn and the textures of Merida are 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.739
 very well, I do not think I'll return it to 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.630
 buy short-term of the moment because 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.900
 I have a lot of make-up removers 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.489
 pending to try 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.560
 want to try them and tell you how 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.510
 it seems, but it seems like a 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.329
 new product the next one is this 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.110
 hand cream cause 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:24.239
 it's called cause lips ucn hands clean and 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.739
 contains sweet orange and mint I liked it 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.299
 very much use it I like that 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.799
 feeling of freshness that leaves in the 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.980
 menthol products especially in the 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.049
 hands and the aroma is magnificent orange 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.480
 and mint I just used the last drop 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.090
 that was and is very well is a cream 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.980
 of hands that came to me with the beats box no 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.650
 I know exactly where you can buy 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.389
 cause but surely there will be stores 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.450
 online you simply have to search 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:51.269
 cause online in google and surely 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.400
 I found and I think it's a good 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.409
 Hand cream is very good and I do not think 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.000
 that the price is the super high the 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.700
 next product that I will teach 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.739
 is a black eyeliner and it is this that 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.930
 flame super line air mag matic 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.860
 l'oreal the rest is that it's like a pencil 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.900
 Retractable no longer has anything so 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.510
 the bad the only thing that we liked 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.520
 a lot of this eyeliner is that the 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.190
 mine was drying too fast and 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.450
 final I did not paint then I'm going to throw it 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.850
 because the truth that I did not like 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.410
 too much I believed at the beginning when I 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.230
 I bought it I loved it I liked it a lot 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.080
 how it was but it is true that if 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.320
 spoils or dries out too quickly 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.540
 so I do not know I'll have to try other 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.060
 options to see if with the same 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.310
 pigmentation I get one more texture 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.080
 creamy the next product that I 'm going 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.480
 to teach is an eye contour of phil 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.640
 honda that is this one here is called time 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.700
 filler eyes is an outline of those that 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.770
 They are very good with anti-aging treatment 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.720
 It is not a product that tells you to go 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.280
 running to buy it but it's a 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.080
 product that is good that has quality 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.360
 and what works if you like the signature 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.190
 philologist or if you want to try a product 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.620
 philologist may be a good option 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.390
 to start and I think it's a 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.800
 product that works that is not going to 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.610
 remove the wrinkles but it does leave the 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.469
 hydrated area 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.419
 and work if we work it well 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.280
 It works also for dark circles and other 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.189
 so it's an eye contour that's 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.340
 pretty good I have a nail polish and 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:19.409
 is the name you are from rimmel london is a 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.930
 'base coat and he has a tad 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.900
 problem is that I'm going to throw it away because 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.090
 although he has a little bit like 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.729
 brush is a bit short you can not 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.650
 take advantage so once I've 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.919
 applied on a nail if I put it 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.259
 again I do not get to the product so what 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.879
 I'm going to shoot already because it's a roll but 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.680
 it's a product that has worked well for me 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:42.509
 has prevented my nails from getting on 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.449
 yellow with the nail polish that 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:48.090
 yes, that happened to me and I have not noticed 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.879
 that strengthened my nails because I 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.219
 he had strong but definitely 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.469
 It helps the nails do not look so 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:57.629
 affected by the nail polish that 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:59.520
 let's apply over and finally I'll 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:03.090
 speak of a range of flow and that is the 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.610
 polyphenol range c-15 this is a 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.590
 miniature of 0 is a mini size but 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.390
 I have used it in several trips and 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.410
 also being at home 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.090
 and it's a serum that I liked 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.970
 very much I think it has very good 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.470
 value for money and I think it's 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.350
 pretty good for those you want 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.900
 start treating the first signs of 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.720
 I do not think age is a very 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:28.950
 powerful but I think it works well for 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:31.260
 skins between 25 or 45 years I think that 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.270
 it's pretty good and relationship 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.890
 price-quality I think it's great and 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.750
 nothing more here until the last 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.940
 finished products I hope you have 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.680
 liked this video we are going visit very 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.050
 strong tell me if you have tried any 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.940
 of the products that ends here and 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.200
 nothing else we see each other in the next 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.200
 I kiss very strong and see you later
