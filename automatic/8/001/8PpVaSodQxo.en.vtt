00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.250
 hi guys today we will show you one 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.310
 guide that allows you to start the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.070
 computer from usb even if the bios of 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.230
 motherboard does not allow it 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.140
 the program is called flop boot 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.140
 managers and can be downloaded from the website 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.019
 www.aci.it went to the download section e 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.820
 then boot manager from the north from which 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:53.160
 we can download the latest version of 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.420
 schedule and once not to the roof of 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.870
 download 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.719
 we have ours 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.940
 we open our archive and extract 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.940
 the content for example on the desktop 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.830
 within this folder are 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:16.800
 present various files practically this 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:20.490
 software allows you to create a disc of 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.420
 start and then start the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.200
 computer via this cd the br started up 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.789
 let's say a sort of distribution 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.420
 particular of linux that has been made 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:36.330
 just to make the distribution 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.380
 eg starting an installation 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.470
 of a linux distribution or of 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:49.259
 windows windows seven installation 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.209
 the last windows 8 via usb over the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.830
 chance to start like it though 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:02:00.479
 comes to an even simpler than that 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:03.720
 allows adding boot 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.539
 system also that of this program 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.110
 same in the same one between the boot of 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.349
 windows 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.420
 that way we don't even have to 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.459
 burn to with cd to do this 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.020
 we need only not easy tullo 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.310
 present a windows folder 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.620
 this is called instant book menu is 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.160
 practically in the start menu and to 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.160
 windows a new entry is added 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.320
 so if you are the system 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.780
 operating is windows seven 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.310
 you must follow up 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.760
 otherwise administrator 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:44.270
 simply start it then this 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.709
 tool is really very simple because there 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.500
 simply click on y ie 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.920
 confirm to add the boot prof 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.030
 manager at the boot menu then windows 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:03.410
 we keep on are therefore created 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:08.140
 file in c and installation comes 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:12.739
 completed after adding let's say 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.569
 this new item on the boot menu 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.939
 let's try a key to continue 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.590
 once the system has restarted ci 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.090
 then a screen will appear 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.700
 gender 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.210
 at this point we select the put 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.190
 manager and click the send button 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.320
 you know that you used in centers 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.400
 start or you used the procedure 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:39.340
 by modifying the boot of the menu of 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.230
 boot windows you'll end up there 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.170
 in front of the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.230
 the interface of the kind from which with 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.540
 want to see you can select 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:54.370
 usb and then boot via usb ad 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.520
 example the installation files of a 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:01.890
 distribution of linux or of a st 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.960
 operating windows server and windows 8 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.850
 and with this our guide is finished 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.180
