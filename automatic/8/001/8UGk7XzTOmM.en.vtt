and you play pretty loose also a thing

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.360 
and you play pretty loose also a thing
that<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.570> got<00:00:45.720> to<00:00:45.810> take<00:00:45.960> into<00:00:46.140> consideration

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
that you got to take into consideration

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.940 
that you got to take into consideration
is<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.610> ante<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.060> the<00:00:48.180> blinds<00:00:48.630> as<00:00:48.900> the<00:00:49.650> ante

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
is the ante and the blinds as the ante

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.300 
is the ante and the blinds as the ante
and<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.550> blinds<00:00:51.060> progress<00:00:51.890> you<00:00:52.890> must<00:00:53.130> start

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
and the blinds progress you must start

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.620 
and the blinds progress you must start
playing<00:00:53.550> more<00:00:53.670> aggressively<00:00:54.240> because<00:00:54.330> you

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
playing more aggressively because you

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.720 
playing more aggressively because you
can't<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:55.080> sit<00:00:55.230> back<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.500> wait<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.550> wait

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
can't just sit back and wait and wait

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.370 
can't just sit back and wait and wait
and<00:00:56.760> wait<00:00:56.970> when<00:00:57.570> your<00:00:57.720> ante<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.080> all<00:00:58.200> your

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
and wait when your ante and all your

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.740 
and wait when your ante and all your
money<00:00:58.470> on<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.400> that's<00:00:59.880> the<00:01:00.030> way<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.240> play<00:01:00.480> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
money on so that's the way you play you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.600 
money on so that's the way you play you
don't<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.350> don't<00:01:01.470> have<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.710> set<00:01:02.040> way<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.310> play

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
don't you don't have a set way you play

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.719 
don't you don't have a set way you play
you<00:01:03.330> take<00:01:03.540> all<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.900> factors<00:01:04.259> that<00:01:04.769> surround

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you take all the factors that surround

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.450 
you take all the factors that surround
you<00:01:05.970> into<00:01:06.720> consideration<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.220> play

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you into consideration and then you play

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.149 
you into consideration and then you play
accordingly<00:01:09.259> so<00:01:10.259> there<00:01:10.409> are<00:01:10.530> no<00:01:10.770> real

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
accordingly so there are no real

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.100 
accordingly so there are no real
guidelines<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:12.240> poker<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.930> were<00:01:13.079> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
guidelines for poker if that were the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.480 
guidelines for poker if that were the
case<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.619> could<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:13.979> take<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.340> those

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
case you could just take one of those

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.580 
case you could just take one of those
blackjack<00:01:15.119> cards<00:01:15.509> put<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> table<00:01:16.439> and

blackjack cards put it on the table and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.980 
blackjack cards put it on the table and
in<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:17.880> would<00:01:17.999> be<00:01:18.030> nothing<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.810> there

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
in it there would be nothing to it there

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.779 
in it there would be nothing to it there
wouldn't<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.289> all<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.679> investigation<00:01:20.609> and

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
wouldn't be all this investigation and

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.459 
wouldn't be all this investigation and
what<00:01:20.909> you're<00:01:21.270> learning<00:01:21.479> from<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.229> that's

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
what you're learning from it and that's

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.690 
what you're learning from it and that's
what<00:01:22.770> most<00:01:23.039> people<00:01:23.369> try<00:01:23.609> to<00:01:24.770> imply<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.340> there

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
what most people try to imply then there

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.660 
what most people try to imply then there
is<00:01:26.969> a<00:01:27.240> way<00:01:27.569> to<00:01:27.630> win<00:01:28.109> by<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.829> following<00:01:29.399> a<00:01:29.460> set

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
is a way to win by just following a set

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.510 
is a way to win by just following a set
rules<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.990> there's<00:01:31.200> not<00:01:31.380> because<00:01:32.069> there's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
rules and there's not because there's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.830 
rules and there's not because there's
too<00:01:32.670> many<00:01:32.819> variables<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:34.109> poker<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.389> have

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
too many variables in poker so you have

they were mostly winning if they won at

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
profit and yet there were arguments

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.390

there<00:04:47.699> about<00:04:48.180> whether<00:04:48.620> science<00:04:49.620> or<00:04:49.860> intuition

there about whether science or intuition

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.269 
there about whether science or intuition
was<00:04:50.729> the<00:04:50.940> way<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.240> win<00:04:51.750> at<00:04:52.050> poker<00:04:52.289> dwell<00:04:53.099> what

was the way to win at poker dwell what

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:54.529 
was the way to win at poker dwell what
do<00:04:53.339> you<00:04:53.430> think<00:04:53.760> about<00:04:53.909> them

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
do you think about them

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.209 
do you think about them
well<00:04:54.779> I<00:04:54.810> think<00:04:55.110> back<00:04:55.289> in<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.469> old<00:04:55.710> days<00:04:55.949> Mac

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
well I think back in the old days Mac

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.430 
well I think back in the old days Mac
the<00:04:56.610> players<00:04:56.880> came<00:04:57.240> from<00:04:57.449> poverty<00:04:57.870> you<00:04:58.409> know

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
the players came from poverty you know

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.189 
the players came from poverty you know
it<00:04:58.800> was<00:04:58.919> the<00:04:59.070> lower<00:04:59.250> class<00:05:00.120> people<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:00.750> went

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
it was the lower class people that went

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.589 
it was the lower class people that went
into<00:05:01.320> professional<00:05:01.830> gambling<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.570> so<00:05:03.570> I

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
into professional gambling and so I

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.659 
into professional gambling and so I
think<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:04.080> those<00:05:04.409> players<00:05:04.710> were<00:05:05.039> more

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
think that those players were more

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.820 
think that those players were more
intuitive<00:05:06.330> because<00:05:06.990> they<00:05:07.320> didn't<00:05:07.560> have<00:05:07.680> the

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
intuitive because they didn't have the

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.740 
intuitive because they didn't have the
knowledge<00:05:07.979> I<00:05:08.400> mean<00:05:08.639> nowadays<00:05:08.880> you<00:05:09.240> see<00:05:09.270> kids

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
knowledge I mean nowadays you see kids

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.839 
knowledge I mean nowadays you see kids
that<00:05:09.960> coming<00:05:10.620> out<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.830> Dartmouth<00:05:11.279> Harvard<00:05:11.699> and

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
that coming out of Dartmouth Harvard and

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.399 
that coming out of Dartmouth Harvard and
they're<00:05:12.210> all<00:05:12.330> professional<00:05:12.900> poker<00:05:13.050> players

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
they're all professional poker players

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.589 
they're all professional poker players
well<00:05:14.339> they've<00:05:14.490> got<00:05:14.699> the<00:05:14.729> knowledge<00:05:15.210> because

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
well they've got the knowledge because

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.510 
well they've got the knowledge because
they've<00:05:16.080> read<00:05:16.320> all<00:05:16.500> of<00:05:16.529> the<00:05:16.740> books<00:05:16.770> they've

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
they've read all of the books they've

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.920 
they've read all of the books they've
played<00:05:18.089> on<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.389> Internet

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
played on the Internet

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.860 
played on the Internet
and<00:05:19.159> so<00:05:20.159> they<00:05:20.310> do<00:05:20.370> have<00:05:20.550> a<00:05:20.870> fundamental

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
and so they do have a fundamental

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.810 
and so they do have a fundamental
scientific<00:05:22.529> way<00:05:22.949> of<00:05:22.979> playing<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:25.380> older

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
scientific way of playing the older

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.519 
scientific way of playing the older
players<00:05:26.820> which<00:05:27.510> I<00:05:27.630> consider<00:05:27.990> myself<00:05:28.169> to<00:05:28.440> be

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:28.529 
players which I consider myself to be

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.829 
players which I consider myself to be
one<00:05:28.770> of<00:05:28.949> them<00:05:29.099> I<00:05:29.279> play<00:05:29.849> the<00:05:30.000> way<00:05:30.120> I<00:05:30.150> feel<00:05:30.539> I

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:30.839 
one of them I play the way I feel I

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:33.050 
one of them I play the way I feel I
don't<00:05:31.650> know<00:05:31.889> what<00:05:32.190> I'm<00:05:32.279> going<00:05:32.490> to<00:05:32.520> do<00:05:32.669> until<00:05:32.969> I

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
don't know what I'm going to do until I

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.200 
don't know what I'm going to do until I
do<00:05:33.120> it<00:05:33.770> poor<00:05:34.770> is<00:05:34.889> a<00:05:35.159> lot<00:05:35.729> of<00:05:35.820> these<00:05:35.909> kids

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
do it poor is a lot of these kids

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.290 
do it poor is a lot of these kids
they've<00:05:36.810> got<00:05:37.020> everything<00:05:37.320> programmed<00:05:38.010> out

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
they've got everything programmed out

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.370 
they've got everything programmed out
exactly<00:05:39.300> what<00:05:39.510> they're<00:05:39.690> going<00:05:39.839> to<00:05:39.900> do<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.229> how

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
exactly what they're going to do and how

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.709 
exactly what they're going to do and how
they're<00:05:40.560> going<00:05:40.620> to<00:05:40.800> play<00:05:40.919> I<00:05:41.250> don't<00:05:42.089> in<00:05:42.330> it<00:05:42.539> but

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:42.719 
they're going to play I don't in it but

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.079 
they're going to play I don't in it but
I<00:05:42.779> think<00:05:43.020> he<00:05:43.139> goes<00:05:43.320> back<00:05:43.529> to<00:05:43.860> knowing<00:05:44.520> people<00:05:44.909> I

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:45.089 
I think he goes back to knowing people I

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:48.469 
I think he goes back to knowing people I
think<00:05:45.539> if<00:05:45.690> you<00:05:46.639> scientific<00:05:47.639> knowledge<00:05:48.120> is

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
think if you scientific knowledge is

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.240 
think if you scientific knowledge is
good<00:05:48.719> but<00:05:49.139> I<00:05:49.289> still<00:05:49.320> think<00:05:49.800> you<00:05:49.889> have<00:05:50.099> to<00:05:50.219> have

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
good but I still think you have to have

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.579 
good but I still think you have to have
a<00:05:50.690> knowledge<00:05:51.690> of<00:05:51.810> the<00:05:51.870> people<00:05:52.110> that<00:05:52.409> you're

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:52.589 
a knowledge of the people that you're

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:54.620 
a knowledge of the people that you're
playing<00:05:52.710> and<00:05:53.070> you<00:05:53.159> have<00:05:53.339> to<00:05:53.490> be<00:05:53.669> able<00:05:53.760> to<00:05:54.060> do

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
playing and you have to be able to do

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.689 
playing and you have to be able to do
what<00:05:54.810> your<00:05:54.990> gut<00:05:55.229> reaction<00:05:55.889> is<00:05:56.010> now<00:05:56.250> I<00:05:56.639> think

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
what your gut reaction is now I think

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.909 
what your gut reaction is now I think
you<00:05:57.000> have<00:05:57.029> to<00:05:57.300> follow<00:05:57.479> your<00:05:57.750> good<00:05:58.320> I<00:05:58.560> think

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
you have to follow your good I think

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.829 
you have to follow your good I think
what<00:05:59.250> you<00:05:59.400> do<00:05:59.639> though<00:05:59.880> and<00:06:00.150> I<00:06:00.300> watched<00:06:00.599> you

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:00.839 
what you do though and I watched you

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.410 
what you do though and I watched you
play<00:06:01.080> so<00:06:01.380> often

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
play so often

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.120 
play so often
and<00:06:02.510> I've<00:06:02.630> had<00:06:02.990> you<00:06:03.170> answer<00:06:03.860> questions<00:06:04.100> and

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
and I've had you answer questions and

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.700 
and I've had you answer questions and
make<00:06:07.130> estimates<00:06:07.910> on<00:06:08.180> odds<00:06:08.600> that<00:06:09.020> I<00:06:09.050> then<00:06:09.440> went

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
make estimates on odds that I then went

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.530 
make estimates on odds that I then went
and<00:06:09.830> calculated<00:06:10.520> and<00:06:10.640> you<00:06:10.730> turned<00:06:10.970> out<00:06:11.180> to<00:06:11.210> be

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
and calculated and you turned out to be

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.750 
and calculated and you turned out to be
so<00:06:11.750> close<00:06:12.080> to<00:06:12.410> the<00:06:12.500> answers<00:06:12.920> it's<00:06:13.130> phenomenal

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
so close to the answers it's phenomenal

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.130 
so close to the answers it's phenomenal
I<00:06:13.970> think<00:06:14.840> all<00:06:15.050> of<00:06:15.080> this<00:06:15.350> is<00:06:15.590> science<00:06:16.190> that<00:06:16.790> when

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
I think all of this is science that when

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.980 
I think all of this is science that when
people<00:06:18.140> have<00:06:18.500> natural<00:06:18.910> knacks<00:06:19.910> for<00:06:20.420> reading

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
people have natural knacks for reading

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.950 
people have natural knacks for reading
people<00:06:21.020> I<00:06:21.620> hope<00:06:21.950> I<00:06:22.190> do<00:06:22.250> I<00:06:22.460> know<00:06:22.670> you<00:06:22.880> do<00:06:23.390> that

you<00:07:08.960> can<00:07:09.110> learn<00:07:09.290> all<00:07:09.530> that<00:07:09.770> and<00:07:10.360> so<00:07:11.360> so<00:07:12.350> it's

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
you can learn all that and so so it's

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.800 
you can learn all that and so so it's
changed<00:07:13.130> just<00:07:13.400> changed<00:07:13.730> immensely<00:07:14.030> but<00:07:14.660> you

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810 
changed just changed immensely but you

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.410 
changed just changed immensely but you
still<00:07:15.080> have<00:07:15.290> to<00:07:15.440> have<00:07:15.880> what<00:07:16.880> you're<00:07:17.090> calling

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:17.420 
still have to have what you're calling

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.290 
still have to have what you're calling
intuition<00:07:18.350> to<00:07:18.800> get<00:07:19.010> that<00:07:19.190> extra<00:07:19.580> edge<00:07:19.730> and

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
intuition to get that extra edge and

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.570 
intuition to get that extra edge and
that<00:07:20.690> is<00:07:20.840> just<00:07:21.050> the<00:07:21.380> perception<00:07:21.860> that<00:07:22.310> you

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580 
that is just the perception that you

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.910 
that is just the perception that you
know<00:07:23.360> in<00:07:23.600> your<00:07:23.630> heart<00:07:23.990> and<00:07:24.290> your<00:07:24.410> gut<00:07:24.650> what

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:24.920 
know in your heart and your gut what

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.490 
know in your heart and your gut what
your<00:07:25.130> opponent<00:07:25.670> is<00:07:25.790> doing<00:07:26.210> I<00:07:26.300> think<00:07:26.600> there<00:07:26.840> you

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500 
your opponent is doing I think there you

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.590 
your opponent is doing I think there you
have<00:07:27.650> to<00:07:27.770> have<00:07:27.950> a<00:07:27.980> combination<00:07:28.550> of<00:07:29.060> the<00:07:29.210> two<00:07:29.420> I

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:29.600 
have to have a combination of the two I

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.380 
have to have a combination of the two I
know<00:07:29.810> my<00:07:30.080> son<00:07:30.380> is<00:07:30.860> very<00:07:31.400> fundamentally<00:07:32.150> sound

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:32.390 
know my son is very fundamentally sound

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.140 
know my son is very fundamentally sound
and<00:07:32.750> I've<00:07:33.560> considered<00:07:33.920> myself<00:07:34.130> to<00:07:34.490> be<00:07:34.640> more

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150 
and I've considered myself to be more

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.990 
and I've considered myself to be more
intuitive<00:07:35.800> but<00:07:36.800> there<00:07:37.160> has<00:07:37.370> to<00:07:37.400> be<00:07:37.520> a<00:07:37.610> happy

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 
intuitive but there has to be a happy

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.200 
intuitive but there has to be a happy
medium<00:07:38.150> you<00:07:38.810> think<00:07:39.290> you<00:07:39.380> need<00:07:39.590> to<00:07:40.090> bring<00:07:41.090> them

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210 
medium you think you need to bring them

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.240 
medium you think you need to bring them
together<00:07:41.360> as<00:07:41.750> much<00:07:41.930> as<00:07:41.990> you<00:07:42.230> can<00:07:42.470> and<00:07:43.070> I<00:07:43.190> think

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.250 
together as much as you can and I think

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.220 
together as much as you can and I think
when<00:07:43.580> you<00:07:43.700> can<00:07:43.820> do<00:07:43.940> that<00:07:44.120> I<00:07:44.150> think<00:07:44.300> then<00:07:44.810> you

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:45.230 
when you can do that I think then you

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:53.240 
when you can do that I think then you
can<00:07:45.410> become<00:07:45.680> a<00:07:45.740> complete<00:07:46.370> poker<00:07:46.610> player
