00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.990
 how do I make spare ribs on the barbecue 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.480
 that is of course possible on different 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.790
 manners but I like all the best 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.049
 if you make them tasty yourself 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.639
 and then of course you have to do with 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.830
 raw spare ribs 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.710
 well the raw spare ribs always make sure 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.390
 that the film on the back 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.850
 say on this blunt side that the film 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.199
 is off and then I put them in a rib rack 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.550
 but you can do it on the barbecue 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.400
 but I have an easy one here 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.040
 utility to deploy them there 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.570
 so and then I put them here au 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.730
 without having done anything with it 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.160
 I put them on the barbecue again 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.160
 indirectly next to the fire in the hot 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.629
 air let me cook them now and on one 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.579
 temperature of around 200 degrees 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.829
 I think about 20 minutes and then go 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.840
 let's take a look 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.320
 and in the meantime I'm already going one 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.949
 I make marinade 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.149
 little beer kicks in one 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.870
 dish 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.520
 always delicious mustard french mustard 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.080
 this case 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.390
 well that may be quite something in one 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.610
 large tablespoon is also good that we mix 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.119
 just mixed up and then we do it 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.990
 a honey little by little 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.520
 flower honey 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.140
 that makes it does not have some fun 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.549
 too much a taste of its own 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.409
 hear it all is not so measured 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.390
 we mix that up again 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.310
 and what I can still find good in a moment 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.420
 to the very last bit of lemon 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.830
 over it 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.479
 well let's just withdraw 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.200
 we leave it that way and then we lubricate 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.820
 a nice spare ribs in 200 degrees 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.460
 20 minutes further we have a look 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.250
 what we made of it 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.360
 oh this looks very good look they are 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.009
 nicely cooked 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.020
 in principle you could just eat like that 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.130
 I 'm still going to make them tasty 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.040
 in the meantime I have a marinade 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.270
 made from whose honey and mustard 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.979
 and then I go on top of the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.079
 lubricate sparerib 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.950
 nice and thick that is allowed and then I fold 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.200
 close it so that it doesn't come out 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.439
 so I make a kind of container and then lay 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.540
 I put it on his back and you on the barbecue 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.469
 back and I actually do that with all 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.469
 celebrate the ribs 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.380
 so now also above the fire 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.790
 upper deck above the code does not matter 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.560
 because he needs fifteen minutes 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.580
 I think going 10 minutes per ten 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.830
 Cook 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.410
 nice little 15 minutes 20 minutes further 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.330
 go and see what has become of it anyway 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.550
 smelling the already through the film 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.620
 well i have refractory hands i would anyway 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.020
 recommend putting on gloves 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.910
 film was cooled rapidly oh look 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.440
 guys I'm cut but Davy 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.239
 This goes that it is easy to explain what 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.849
 it is always easy on his back 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.650
 cut and look with a plate and then 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.930
 just cut it along the sign 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.580
 and we have tasty spare ribs 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.680
 these look really good 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.560
 crispy on the outside and tender on the inside 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.430
 I'd have some herbs and chives on it 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.390
 laid the sign 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.489
 so we do just a little bit 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.360
 lemon over it 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.610
 Hommerts million viewers are really good 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.160
 piece of meat 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.620
 a little bit of rosemary maybe I am 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.260
 all delicious with herbs fresh herbs 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.870

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.269
 just a little bit of lemon not too much 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.620
 a few drops for taste then 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.760
 we also want to damage the predominant 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.040
 Of course we don't do the games 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.959
 keep adding and a red pepper 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.959
 make things spicier 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.560
 don't look too much of course because then 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.049
 He will again have to be tough 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.250
 the color a little bit as a decoration 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.269
 use for those who like spicy 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.730
