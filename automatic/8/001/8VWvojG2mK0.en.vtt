00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
is 36 by 45 and what's great about this

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.410 
is 36 by 45 and what's great about this
size<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:16.170> your<00:00:16.350> fabrics<00:00:16.920> normally<00:00:17.430> 45<00:00:17.970> inches

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
size is your fabrics normally 45 inches

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.689 
size is your fabrics normally 45 inches
so<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.109> will<00:00:19.199> fit<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.619> width<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.039> fabric<00:00:20.310> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
so it will fit the width of a fabric and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.279 
so it will fit the width of a fabric and
you<00:00:20.789> don't<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.420> worry<00:00:21.600> about<00:00:21.660> piecing

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
you don't have to worry about piecing

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.439 
you don't have to worry about piecing
the<00:00:22.380> back<00:00:22.560> makes<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.400> quick<00:00:23.609> little<00:00:23.880> project

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449

but<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.500> need<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.039> base<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.640> together<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.390> I

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510

sure there's no lint or anything hanging
over<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> edge<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.719> you're<00:02:03.719> able<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.140> lay<00:02:05.040> out

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
over the edge and you're able to lay out

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.899 
over the edge and you're able to lay out
your<00:02:06.049> backing

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
your backing

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.510

and pick out any of the bring calls and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.979 
and pick out any of the bring calls and

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
make sure there's no threads and then

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.240 
make sure there's no threads and then
you're<00:02:15.200> going<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.500> be<00:02:15.620> able<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.770> put<00:02:15.950> your<00:02:16.069> body

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
right over top of this so I know that my

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.440 
right over top of this so I know that my
back<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.390> going<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.750> fit<00:02:21.019> my<00:02:21.500> quilt<00:02:22.310> because<00:02:23.030> I

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
back is going to fit my quilt because I

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.910 
back is going to fit my quilt because I
have<00:02:23.690> already<00:02:23.870> measured<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.530> make<00:02:24.709> sure

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
have already measured it to make sure

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.100 
have already measured it to make sure
and<00:02:25.370> did<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.060> know<00:02:26.239> you<00:02:26.300> should<00:02:26.720> have<00:02:26.750> your

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
and did you know you should have your

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.280 
and did you know you should have your
body<00:02:27.349> lay<00:02:27.890> flat<00:02:28.280> for<00:02:28.700> about<00:02:28.910> 24<00:02:29.720> hours<00:02:29.780> before

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
body lay flat for about 24 hours before

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.650 
body lay flat for about 24 hours before
you<00:02:30.530> use<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.099> because<00:02:31.519> it<00:02:31.730> helps<00:02:31.970> relax<00:02:32.330> the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
you use it because it helps relax the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.600 
you use it because it helps relax the
fibrous<00:02:33.200> after<00:02:33.590> they've<00:02:33.769> been<00:02:33.950> shoved<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.489> the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
fibrous after they've been shoved in the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.370 
fibrous after they've been shoved in the
bag<00:02:34.790> too<00:02:35.060> much<00:02:35.239> sometimes<00:02:35.900> we're<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.260> little

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
bag too much sometimes we're a little

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.080 
bag too much sometimes we're a little
bit<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.680> patient<00:02:37.069> we<00:02:37.250> won't<00:02:37.430> don't<00:02:37.640> want<00:02:37.849> to<00:02:37.970> do

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
bit of patient we won't don't want to do

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.820 
bit of patient we won't don't want to do
that<00:02:38.269> so<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.720> might<00:02:38.989> hit<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.290> with<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.440> little<00:02:39.620> bit

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
that so I might hit it with a little bit

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.710 
that so I might hit it with a little bit
of<00:02:39.950> steam<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.610> relax<00:02:41.209> some<00:02:41.510> of<00:02:41.540> those

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
of steam and relax some of those

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.530 
of steam and relax some of those
wrinkles<00:02:42.489> so<00:02:43.489> what<00:02:43.670> I'll<00:02:43.790> do<00:02:43.970> is<00:02:44.000> I'll<00:02:44.269> take<00:02:44.299> my

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540

of my back and I'm going to follow the
directions<00:03:53.540> because<00:03:54.109> each<00:03:54.670> spray<00:03:55.670> is

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
directions because each spray is

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.240 
directions because each spray is
somewhat<00:03:56.480> different<00:03:56.810> you're<00:03:57.620> going<00:03:57.829> to<00:03:57.950> spray

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
somewhat different you're going to spray

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.030 
somewhat different you're going to spray
it<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.639> then<00:03:59.239> you're<00:03:59.450> going<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.750> put<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.109> on<00:04:00.260> so

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
it and then you're going to put it on so

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.879 
it and then you're going to put it on so
let's<00:04:01.400> go<00:04:01.780> now<00:04:02.780> when<00:04:03.019> you<00:04:03.139> go<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.410> spray

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
let's go now when you go to spray

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.420 
let's go now when you go to spray
there's<00:04:04.489> a<00:04:04.579> little<00:04:05.000> mark<00:04:05.599> on<00:04:05.870> your<00:04:06.260> can<00:04:06.920> and

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
there's a little mark on your can and

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.569 
there's a little mark on your can and
that<00:04:08.239> mark<00:04:08.780> is<00:04:09.019> where<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.709> spray<00:04:10.040> nozzle

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
that mark is where the spray nozzle

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.729 
that mark is where the spray nozzle
should<00:04:10.819> be<00:04:10.970> pointing<00:04:11.569> it<00:04:11.989> will<00:04:12.200> work<00:04:12.440> wherever

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
should be pointing it will work wherever

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.430 
should be pointing it will work wherever
it<00:04:13.160> is<00:04:13.340> but<00:04:13.970> it's<00:04:14.150> really<00:04:14.480> good<00:04:14.900> if<00:04:15.049> you<00:04:15.200> use

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
it is but it's really good if you use

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.860 
it is but it's really good if you use
that<00:04:15.709> mark<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.400> just<00:04:16.699> makes<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.359> spray

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
that mark it just makes the spray

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.050 
that mark it just makes the spray
come<00:04:18.019> out<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.590> way<00:04:18.709> it's<00:04:18.949> designed<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.609> do

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
come out to the way it's designed to do

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.300 
come out to the way it's designed to do
so<00:04:20.479> I've<00:04:20.630> given<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.049> can<00:04:21.290> a<00:04:21.530> good<00:04:21.769> shake<00:04:22.100> and

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
so I've given the can a good shake and

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.689 
so I've given the can a good shake and
now<00:04:22.940> I<00:04:22.970> am<00:04:23.419> just<00:04:23.449> going<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.260> lightly<00:04:24.620> spray<00:04:25.340> the

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699
