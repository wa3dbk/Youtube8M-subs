team of the new coaching staff um you
know<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.570> think<00:02:06.810> our<00:02:06.899> team<00:02:07.080> has<00:02:07.200> been<00:02:07.320> really

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
know I think our team has been really

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.130 
know I think our team has been really
good<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:07.800> adapting<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.520> change<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.239> through

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
good with adapting to change so through

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.010 
good with adapting to change so through
the<00:02:10.530> process<00:02:11.009> we've<00:02:11.280> kept<00:02:11.940> high<00:02:12.300> energy<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
the process we've kept high energy and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.890 
the process we've kept high energy and
the<00:02:13.590> positive<00:02:13.770> attitude<00:02:14.459> so<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:15.060> think<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:15.750> just

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
the positive attitude so I think we just

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.229 
the positive attitude so I think we just
continue<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.410> do<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.940> your<00:02:17.940> number<00:02:18.180> is

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
continue to do that your number is

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.280 
continue to do that your number is

second half of the season was me

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.470 
second half of the season was me
