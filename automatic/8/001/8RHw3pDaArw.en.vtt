00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
access those easily they just figure it

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.869

protects<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.920> little<00:01:02.219> more<00:01:02.399> which<00:01:02.609> otterbox

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
protects a little more which otterbox

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.260 
protects a little more which otterbox
prides<00:01:03.510> itself<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:04.049> doing<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> let's<00:01:06.090> throw

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
prides itself in doing so let's throw

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.320 
prides itself in doing so let's throw
this<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.930> found<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.590> easier<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.159> put<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
this on I found it easier to put the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.620 
this on I found it easier to put the
case<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.780> by<00:01:10.110> first<00:01:10.470> putting<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:11.010> rubber<00:01:11.630> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
case on by first putting this rubber the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.710 
case on by first putting this rubber the
interior<00:01:13.260> part<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:15.270> kind<00:01:15.570> of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
interior part on and then kind of

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.679 
interior part on and then kind of
snapping<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.700> over<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> top<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.360> felt<00:01:18.570> what

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
snapping this over the top I felt what

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.050 
snapping this over the top I felt what
like<00:01:18.840> was<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> easiest<00:01:19.439> way<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.700> easiest

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
like was the easiest way not the easiest

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.899 
like was the easiest way not the easiest
case<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.780> get<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.700> see<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
case to get on but like you can see that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.719 
case to get on but like you can see that
wasn't<00:01:24.210> too<00:01:24.360> bad<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.400> kind<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.670> have

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
wasn't too bad and you just kind of have

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.640 
wasn't too bad and you just kind of have
to<00:01:27.030> secure<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.720> different<00:01:28.080> hard<00:01:28.350> shells

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
to secure the different hard shells

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.700 
to secure the different hard shells
around<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.280> rubber<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.680> go

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
around the rubber and and there you go

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.319 
around the rubber and and there you go
you're<00:01:32.009> set<00:01:32.640> like<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.030> say<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.299> has<00:01:33.450> those<00:01:33.689> flaps

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
you're set like I say it has those flaps

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.179 
you're set like I say it has those flaps
as<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:37.320> flaps<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.880> access<00:01:39.090> those<00:01:40.189> as

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
as the flaps so you can access those as

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.710 
as the flaps so you can access those as
the<00:01:41.340> flap<00:01:41.579> there<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.329> still<00:01:42.540> access

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the flap there so you can still access

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.499 
the flap there so you can still access
them<00:01:43.049> without<00:01:43.290> having<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.680> take<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.009> case<00:01:44.189> off

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
them without having to take the case off

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.789 
them without having to take the case off
but<00:01:45.509> they<00:01:45.659> might<00:01:45.840> get<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.200> way<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.500> little

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
but they might get in the way a little

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.639 
but they might get in the way a little
bit<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.430> bad<00:01:47.780> but<00:01:48.780> definitely<00:01:49.439> going<00:01:49.560> to

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
bit but not bad but definitely going to
