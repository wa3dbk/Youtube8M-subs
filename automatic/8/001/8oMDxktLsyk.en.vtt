00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
isn't it but what you can do also is it

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.419 
isn't it but what you can do also is it
you<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> double<00:00:28.289> tap<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
you can do a double tap and on the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.400 
you can do a double tap and on the
second<00:00:29.820> tab<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.660> double<00:00:30.960> tap<00:00:31.140> you

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
second tab of that double tap you

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.260 
second tab of that double tap you
actually<00:00:31.710> hold<00:00:31.890> down<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.790> I'm<00:00:32.910> going<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.149> do

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
actually hold down so I'm going to do

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.920 
actually hold down so I'm going to do
that<00:00:33.450> now<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:35.160> I've<00:00:35.489> hold<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.820> down<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.270> just

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
that now and I've hold it down and just

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.990 
that now and I've hold it down and just
move<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.380> along<00:00:37.440> them<00:00:37.739> select<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.219> go<00:00:38.399> it

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
move it along them select as you go it

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000 
move it along them select as you go it
kind<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.210> works<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.570> before<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.590> bit

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
kind of works as before but it's a bit

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.220 
kind of works as before but it's a bit
smoother<00:00:41.370> action<00:00:41.670> that's<00:00:41.790> all<00:00:41.969> really<00:00:42.230> so

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
smoother action that's all really so

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.350 
smoother action that's all really so
that's<00:00:43.350> another<00:00:43.590> way<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.860> selecting<00:00:44.100> text<00:00:44.610> in

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that's another way of selecting text in

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.790 
that's another way of selecting text in
some<00:00:45.629> applications<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> triple

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
some applications you can do a triple

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.650 
some applications you can do a triple
tap<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.460> it's<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.149> one

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
tap and it's not this one

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.470 
tap and it's not this one
okay<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.680> let's<00:00:50.070> go<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> another<00:00:50.520> application

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
okay so let's go to another application

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.260 
okay so let's go to another application
so<00:00:52.230> when<00:00:52.379> pages<00:00:52.829> for<00:00:53.039> instance<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:53.489> okay<00:00:54.239> so

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
so when pages for instance here okay so

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.150 
so when pages for instance here okay so
that<00:00:54.420> was<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> triple<00:00:54.809> tap<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.770> selected

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
that was a triple tap and that selected

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
that was a triple tap and that selected
the<00:00:56.219> whole<00:00:56.340> paragraph<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:56.940> me<00:00:57.090> that's<00:00:57.719> again

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
the whole paragraph for me that's again

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.959 
the whole paragraph for me that's again
quite<00:00:58.500> useful<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.550> there<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.879> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
quite useful this one there you have to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.299 
quite useful this one there you have to
move<00:01:00.149> across<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.989> tool<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:02.070> able<00:01:02.129> to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
move across this tool here to be able to

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.740 
move across this tool here to be able to
get<00:01:02.460> into<00:01:02.670> where<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.180> occur<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.539> copy

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
get into where you can do occur to copy

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.539 
get into where you can do occur to copy
or<00:01:03.899> whatever<00:01:04.140> else<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.379> want<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.680> let's<00:01:05.430> do

or whatever else you want to do let's do
a<00:01:05.580> copy<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.060> there's<00:01:06.360> notice<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.840> might

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
a copy on that there's notice it might

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.480 
a copy on that there's notice it might
clipboard<00:01:07.680> ready<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> paste<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.340> somewhere

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.260 
else
or<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.430> use<00:01:11.640> another<00:01:11.820> application

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
or you can use another application
