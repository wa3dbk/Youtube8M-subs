for<00:00:00.329> years<00:00:00.480> I've<00:00:00.690> been<00:00:00.719> making<00:00:00.960> new<00:00:01.230> year's

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
for years I've been making new year's

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.059 
for years I've been making new year's
resolutions<00:00:02.010> and<00:00:03.080> forgetting<00:00:04.080> them<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.410> think

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
resolutions and forgetting them I think

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.920 
resolutions and forgetting them I think
last<00:00:05.279> year<00:00:05.400> was<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.790> make<00:00:05.940> major<00:00:06.270> progress

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
last year was to make major progress

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.410 
last year was to make major progress
towards<00:00:08.599> some<00:00:09.599> kind<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.870> life-altering<00:00:10.559> thing

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
towards some kind of life-altering thing

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.730 
towards some kind of life-altering thing
they<00:00:12.420> say<00:00:12.570> your<00:00:12.719> memory<00:00:12.960> goes<00:00:13.110> first<00:00:13.440> but<00:00:13.710> I

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
they say your memory goes first but I

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.410 
they say your memory goes first but I
think<00:00:14.040> your<00:00:14.190> new<00:00:14.340> year's<00:00:14.549> resolutions<00:00:15.210> go

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
suspiciously like a fitness book yeah

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.789 
suspiciously like a fitness book yeah
actually<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> fitness<00:01:24.450> book<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.990> I've

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
actually it is a fitness book and I've

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.190 
actually it is a fitness book and I've
never<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.250> read<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.909> mean<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:27.930> cover

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
never actually read it I mean not cover

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.719 
never actually read it I mean not cover
to<00:01:28.350> cover<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.680> mean<00:01:28.829> I've<00:01:28.920> read<00:01:29.040> parts<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> I

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
to cover I mean I've read parts of it I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.340 
to cover I mean I've read parts of it I
guess<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.570> should<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.810> my<00:01:30.960> new<00:01:30.990> year's

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
guess it should be my new year's

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.679 
guess it should be my new year's
resolution<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.460> mean<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.299> listen<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
resolution to I mean I listen to the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.289 
resolution to I mean I listen to the
book<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.020> tape<00:01:34.460> because<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.210> was

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
book on tape because you know it was

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.850 
book on tape because you know it was
easier<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.689> find<00:01:36.900> time<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.560> kind<00:01:37.740> of

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
easier to find time for that kind of

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.280 
easier to find time for that kind of
thing<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.939> begins<00:01:39.299> unlike<00:01:39.689> other<00:01:39.869> fitness

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
thing it begins unlike other fitness

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.810 
thing it begins unlike other fitness
books<00:01:40.500> with<00:01:40.680> an<00:01:40.770> in-depth<00:01:41.159> discussion<00:01:41.700> of
