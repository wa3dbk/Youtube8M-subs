00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.540
 very good explorers like me and today 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.340
 we are in an organization that never 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.160
 it came to never came to be used 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.960
 I already think it's the third urbanization 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.080
 abandoned that visited that I do not get to 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.750
 to use is pretty regrettable that up to date 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.300
 today there are so many inhabitants 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.800
 unemployed and who have never reached 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.540
 premiere and also that they are houses are 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.550
 almost finished so they have 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.239
 all have walls have windows 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.780
 they have doors but for some reason 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.850
 that I can already assume is economical 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.460
 they were totally abandoned today 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.320
 we are in one of these organizations 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.270
 everything is put up has a pool 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.590
 all houses have windows 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.030
 electrical installations 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.160
 but they never came to be used 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.500
 Obviously, because there are all the houses 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.600
 they are plundered because by the same people 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:11.450
 always but the environment is quite 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.940
 shocking that is, everything is like 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.950
 it's all totally new without using but 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.490
 totally abandoned quite 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.490
 shocking 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.170
 but that in the middle of the staircase and everything 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.360
 of pieces because it would not be the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.040
 cable coverage 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.500
 only that of coverage in what 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.060
 would come from kobryn or be this 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.160
 finds a lot in places that has 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.310
 gone past these junkyards that have 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.680
 taken because all the interior copper 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.680
 of the cables and then sell it by weight 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.210
 i 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.210
 good 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.370
 well as you can see there are a lot of houses 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.470
 right in this fair in which we are 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.760
 there's everything about cement and bricks that 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.250
 we assume they were the pallets they kept 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.010
 because the leftover materials 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.690
 but it's all very dusty and it has 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.280
 I do not understand 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.400
 the truth is that these things irritate a 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.380
 I do not know how an agent can leave 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.910
 spoil these things and that is that neither 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.910
 have been used is that they explain t 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.370
 let's continue come 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.360
 good and this has been everything as you see no 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.120
 there is much more to teach all 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.430
 houses are the same but it impacts quite a lot 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.920
 see such a big place 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.630
 where so much money was invested 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.330
 totally forgotten and in the 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.330
 disuse is quite quite shocking 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.110
 and nothing else I hope you liked it and 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.560
 until next time 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.560
 goodbye 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.419
 to
