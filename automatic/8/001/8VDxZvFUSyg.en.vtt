00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 gopro recently presented its new one 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.470
 hero series of cameras namely the hero 4 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.610
 black and the hero 4 silver and go today 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.130
 I show you the difference between 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.389
 these two cameras and because I don't 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.740
 so be good at saving mine 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.839
 balance I have arranged two segways 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.310
 via sec weather Rotterdam 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.750
 and with that we will drive through the city 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.859
 one for myself one for the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.150
 cameraman 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.609
 but just the gopro tjes 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.970
 mount one on the handlebar 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.220
 with the gopro jaws and another one around it 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.220
 head say 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.100
 First of all we see the hero 4 silver here 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.210
 if a turn around falls on that directly 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.680
 he has received a touchscreen 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.960
 which makes it very easy for you to club 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.370
 frame and frame cells 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.350
 when swiping up you end up in the 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.450
 video settings right there and see it 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.740
 we that you give me 1080 p to 60 frames per 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.290
 second can go 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.940
 4k is going to commit 15 frames per second 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.520
 that is nothing but the men's 3 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.280
 black but you go to 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.740
 720 p and if I put it on it then see 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.940
 you know that you have one frames per reach 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.760
 second that you happen to be vin de france 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.100
 Pressing his emotion can go far 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.869
 of course the protune mode that gives you 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.729
 have more options with afterwards 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.110
 process image in terms of color but you 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.910
 can also be set very easily 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.990
 on the gopro color and then it is already right 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.880
 useful 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.500
 the camera itself can limit iso 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.380
 for example, the sharpness set that 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.880
 kind of stuff so you have more options 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.890
 have afterwards 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.710
 you swipe the standard menu to that 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.649
 lace up and then you end up in the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.820
 video mode or the photo mode and the set of 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.649
 the camera itself 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.750
 forget you obviously still have wifi 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.759
 which makes it very easy for you 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.679
 connect with your smartphone there too 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.640
 still be able to frame if you are not 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.640
 can reach the camera 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.410
 here the hero have 4 black and like us 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.360
 Turn that over then we see no hold 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.069
 display is therefore on the camera itself 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.390
 has not changed you so much of course 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.830
 just stop operating the modes 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.959
 in the small display with which you put it 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.370
 can operate 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.680
 therefore I am about anything after my 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.090
 smartphone there so that your vision of the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.550
 settings are when I go to the first 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.650
 now go then we have 1080 p but here 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.400
 go up to 120 frames per second 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.590
 I go back then we see that you with the 4k 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.780
 up to 30 frames per second can go as 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.580
 finally a usable 4k function 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.959
 him gopro so that place that does have 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.840

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.459
 more in marssum we have the silver far 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.709

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.890

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.890
