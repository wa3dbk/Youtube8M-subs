00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.830
 re seventima is a remembered accord 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:11.100
 formed by the fundamental third major 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.800
 fifth just and seventh minor for 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.349
 build the chord we will place finger 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.519
 heart on third string second fret 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:24.509
 note ring finger on first string 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:26.849
 second fret note f sharp and the 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.940
 index finger on second rope closeup 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.430
 fret note 2 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.900
 the fourth string is played the air is not 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.810
 re is the fundamental bass of the chord 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.320
 the fifth and the sixth string should not 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.870
 touch 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.360
 in a front view just like the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.579
 I remembered from re major we see as the finger 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.020
 thumb peeks slightly on the part 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.020
 upper back of the mast 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.949
 in this agreement we must also avoid 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.899
 low positions of the thumb that do not 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.790
 will raise the wrist and will generate us 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.070
 instability 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.750
 we also pay attention so that 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.770
 the thumb does not take a position 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.380
 too high 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.390
 in any case it will be the size of your hand 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.409
 the one that takes you to find the position 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.329
 more natural 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.850
 in a rear view we see the 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:24.509
 comparative thumb placement in 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.509
 the chords of d minor re seventh and re 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.480
 re minor 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.920
 re 7a 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.400
 higher 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.990
 re 7a 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.480
 re 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.380
 re 7a 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.380
 re minor 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.300
 re 7a 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.040
 re 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.270
 re 7a 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.640
 re 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.570
 re 7a 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.570
 re minor 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.360
 to quickly fix the footprint of the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.300
 chord places the fingers in the order that 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.640
 we put you practice several times the 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.740
 construction of the chord and shortly the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.950
 hand will build the footprint in block 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.950
 before stepping remember to step on and relax 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.409
 he plays the arpeggio three times 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.720
 that we raised in the video with the 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:33.250
 fingerings that we propose you the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:37.030
 first thumb index medium middle 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:41.980
 index and strum the second thumb 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.849
 index and half annular mean index 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.849
 index 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.819
 Y 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.060
 Y 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.200
