00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
the very front and I'm just going to

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:06.149 
the very front and I'm just going to
twist<00:00:55.569> them<00:00:55.839> around

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.280 

twistys<00:01:07.159> around<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.450> then<00:01:08.780> I'm<00:01:08.930> going<00:01:09.170> to

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.140 
take a rubber band and just put it on
the<00:01:16.610> end<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:17.810> just<00:01:17.869> let<00:01:18.290> that<00:01:18.440> be<00:01:19.150> so

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
the end and just let that be so

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.520 
the end and just let that be so
basically<00:01:20.540> I'm<00:01:20.600> just<00:01:20.659> going<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:20.960> do<00:01:21.110> that<00:01:21.320> all

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
basically I'm just going to do that all

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.899 
basically I'm just going to do that all
the<00:01:21.560> way<00:01:21.710> around<00:01:21.970> just<00:01:22.970> taking<00:01:23.270> a<00:01:23.360> few<00:01:23.390> grades

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:35.820 

and

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.280 

and<00:01:36.430> twisting<00:01:36.970> them<00:01:37.150> up

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.380 

this<00:01:43.890> style<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.310> going<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.550> be<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.760> a<00:01:44.820> crown

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
this style is going to be like a crown

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.760 
this style is going to be like a crown
type<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.200> thing<00:01:46.410> or<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.430> pinup<00:01:48.620> type<00:01:49.620> of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
type of thing or like a pinup type of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:02:11.340 
type of thing or like a pinup type of
thing<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:51.090> back<00:01:51.390> down

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.870 

so<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.040> will<00:02:12.100> probably<00:02:12.310> end<00:02:12.490> up<00:02:12.610> being<00:02:12.790> about

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
so it will probably end up being about

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.790 
so it will probably end up being about
six<00:02:13.420> because<00:02:13.870> there's<00:02:14.020> three<00:02:14.290> on<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.530> sides

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
six because there's three on the sides

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.700 
six because there's three on the sides
will<00:02:15.040> be<00:02:15.220> three<00:02:15.700> on<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.910> side<00:02:16.120> as<00:02:16.300> well<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.650> I'm

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
will be three on the side as well so I'm

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.380 
will be three on the side as well so I'm
going<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.920> do<00:02:18.070> three<00:02:18.550> on<00:02:18.970> each<00:02:19.150> side<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:22.120> it's

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
going to do three on each side and it's

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.530 
going to do three on each side and it's
only<00:02:22.690> about<00:02:23.250> four<00:02:24.250> or<00:02:24.280> five<00:02:24.430> braids<00:02:25.090> in<00:02:25.390> each

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
only about four or five braids in each

00:02:25.540 --> 00:03:00.010 
only about four or five braids in each
of<00:02:25.720> these

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:04:03.210 

all<00:03:00.590> right<00:03:00.770> that's<00:03:01.010> not<00:03:01.250> working

something like this something like that

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.850 
something like this something like that
it<00:05:26.150> just<00:05:26.180> makes<00:05:26.539> it's<00:05:27.020> like<00:05:27.139> a<00:05:27.320> half<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:27.740> half

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
it just makes it's like a half and half

do but it just makes it look a little
bit<00:05:30.020> different<00:05:30.410> gives<00:05:30.590> it<00:05:30.710> something<00:05:31.010> else<00:05:31.130> to

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
bit different gives it something else to

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.170 
bit different gives it something else to
look<00:05:31.400> like<00:05:31.729> so<00:05:32.830> i<00:05:33.830> think<00:05:34.100> what<00:05:34.610> i'm<00:05:34.729> going<00:05:34.970> to

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
look like so i think what i'm going to

going to go the opposite way we kind of
cover-up<00:06:27.529> that<00:06:32.619> but<00:06:33.619> you<00:06:33.740> can<00:06:33.860> kind<00:06:34.069> of<00:06:34.129> pin

00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:34.309

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.150 

so<00:06:44.990> this<00:06:45.170> is<00:06:45.290> it

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.990 

that's<00:06:48.910> it<00:06:49.180> you<00:06:50.190> just<00:06:51.190> can<00:06:51.460> wear<00:06:51.640> the<00:06:51.760> rest

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
that's it you just can wear the rest

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000 
that's it you just can wear the rest
back<00:06:52.270> or<00:06:52.720> I<00:06:52.750> guess<00:06:53.170> you<00:06:53.320> can<00:06:53.470> pull<00:06:53.650> it<00:06:53.740> up<00:06:53.860> if

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
back or I guess you can pull it up if

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.380 
back or I guess you can pull it up if
you<00:06:54.160> want<00:06:54.400> or<00:06:54.730> do<00:06:54.850> some<00:06:55.030> type<00:06:55.180> of<00:06:55.210> pinup<00:06:56.310> but

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390 
you want or do some type of pinup but

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:03.900 
you want or do some type of pinup but
just<00:06:58.390> a<00:06:58.510> quick<00:06:58.690> style<00:07:00.390> fairly<00:07:01.390> click<00:07:01.710> cute<00:07:02.910> and

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910 
just a quick style fairly click cute and

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.470 
just a quick style fairly click cute and
this<00:07:04.150> isn't<00:07:04.270> it<00:07:04.450> so<00:07:04.930> you<00:07:05.380> show<00:07:05.650> you<00:07:05.710> the<00:07:05.830> front

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 
this isn't it so you show you the front

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.980 
this isn't it so you show you the front
so<00:07:07.480> I<00:07:07.540> lift<00:07:07.900> it<00:07:08.080> up<00:07:08.170> and<00:07:09.450> then<00:07:10.450> back<00:07:10.630> is<00:07:10.810> just

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
so I lift it up and then back is just

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:16.650 
so I lift it up and then back is just
down<00:07:13.230> and<00:07:14.230> that's<00:07:14.410> it
