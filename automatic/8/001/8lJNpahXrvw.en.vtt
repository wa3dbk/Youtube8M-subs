00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.090
 well as I said I am a chemist and mine 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.830
 job that i chemical that of 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.930
 build molecules new molecules that 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.550
 they do not exist 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.870
 of which I speak to you today are those who 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.890
 you see represented by this equation 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.660
 chemistry 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.820
 the nucleus in blue is called pd di 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.310
 limido zolo and are the molecules on which I 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.990
 I've been focusing on it for years, I've built it 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.390
 a whole series you see some here 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.160
 highlighted in a colorful way and there 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.080
 we immediately realized that theirs 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.700
 main property is luminescence 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.550
 which is represented by this one 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.050
 photograph of molecules in solution 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.940
 this graph represents capacity 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.800
 of molecules to absorb light 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.900
 this ability therefore makes them e 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.190
 color our eyes but the most 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.690
 important that said before 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.880
 luminescence is represented by 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.980
 second part of the graph ie le 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.899
 molecules absorb light and re -emit it 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.550
 and this makes our eyes appear 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.470
 like light bulbs, that is 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.989
 luminescent as you see in the second one 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.000
 part of the photograph 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.350
 what is the most immediate application of 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.170
 these molecules and the new technology 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.729
 which is called oled ie insert the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.350
 molecules as you see here in the center 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.540
 inside an electrical circuit 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.729
 when the electric current flows in 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.440
 this electrical circuit supplies the 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.840
 our molecules that emit light like 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.820
 we know well by luminescence and 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.500
 we thus obtain technological products 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.180
 like the ones you see here and are 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.920
 simply electric circuits in 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.680
 which very specific points can 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.659
 emit light colored the color that we 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.030
 obviously we want and this will allow 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.040
 in the future to build a whole new one 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.810
 type of technology to replace 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.210
 example the screens we see today is 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.760
 create ultra-thin and flexible screens 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.810
 transparent when turned off 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.580
 there is another application very much 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.880
 important of the molecules of which I am 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.830
 speaking that serves to help the cells 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.420
 silicon what are the cells to 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.159
 silicon are photovoltaic panels 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.780
 that allow us to transform the 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.880
 ie light radiation from the sun 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.439
 the energy contained in the light in 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.360
 electricity that energy that 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.439
 it is for us to work or for purposes 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.970
 everyday 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.290
 silicon panels use a 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.820
 effect which is called photoelectric e 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.659
 therefore they transform light into energy 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.119
 power 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.250
 we know very well that the sunlight 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.200
 that we consider white light in 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.760
 reality is composed of many rays 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.680
 different we can with an experiment 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.720
 very simple to divide the white light 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.200
 with a prism and get the rays of various 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.209
 colors 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.340
 know and it is very important that a 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.130
 each color corresponds to a lot of energy 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.600
 different that the light carries is another 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.460
 important thing the sun that floods us 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.590
 light and put in with a different intensity 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.790
 the rays with different colors 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.170
 then what you see in this 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.540
 graph is represented with the different ones 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.490
 colors of the rainbow and all that i 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.230
 photovoltaic panels they are able 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.450
 to transform into electricity 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.190
 but there is and you must know a part of it a 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.260
 left which is called light 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.150
 ultraviolet that we do not perceive that 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.040
 between which carries from the sun a huge 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.180
 amount of energy but the panels 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.160
 silicon are not able to 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.350
 transforming not only does not transform it 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.880
 but this ultra truth light damages them 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.960
 then we decided to insert the 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.260
 our molecules in a material 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.150
 polymer in a plastic and what 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.070
 it happens that ours is our molecules 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.750
 they perform ultraviolet and leave 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.430
 pass all the colored component 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.590
 doing so we protect the panel 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.060
 photovoltaic but not just ours 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.010
 molecules are able to absorb 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.630
 the ultra driveway and being luminescent 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.290
 as we have seen before they emit light 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.970
 colored 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.380
 doing so we got two 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.000
 results have protected you the panel 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.290
 silicon and we have increased its 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.240
 yield because all the ultraviolet light 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.830
 has been transformed into colored light that 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.570
 the panel able to exploit as 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.910
 we know what we got 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.590
 these are plastic slips 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.510
 which as you see are transparent when 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.890
 they are illuminated by normal light and when 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.510
 they are irradiated by ultraviolet light 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.490
 they literally light up like gods 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.230
 bulbs these plastic sheets 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.400
 protect the silicon panels e 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.320
 that light that you also see 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.670
 light up and the light that the panels to the 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.730
 silicon exploit to increase theirs 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.080
 yield not double result then being a 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.550
 chemist my job precisely and 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.110
 create molecules so I have modified 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.790
 a little bit the structures you saw 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.890
 before I entered these two atoms of 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.380
 red nitrogen underline and to what 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.690
 it serves to create molecules 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.310
 higher than larger order than 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.990
 symmetry and see in this case ad 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.520
 example of the complexes here with an atom 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.230
 metallic scheme that yesterday of a metal 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.820
 very rare and very precious 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.770
 and in this other case an atom that is 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.480
 he calls renio ie we have worked as 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.610
 with the lego we have joined some small pieces 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.320
 you may wonder what it is for 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.359
 let's see right away using a computer 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.430
 we have studied these molecules more 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.560
 complicated and we immediately realized 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.240
 that we can quantify levels 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.370
 that is called energy levels ie 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.200
 simply to know exactly which one 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.000
 it was the energy that the molecule absorbed 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.680
 and are the levels at the bottom and the energy 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.420
 that the mole with the puts that is the 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.100
 luminescence we have said before and 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.320
 we realized that these complexes 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.210
 these larger molecules were 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.680
 perfectly applicable 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.750
 ecology that is emerging lately 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.490
 always photovoltaic type that not 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.560
 it uses silicon which are called cells 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.599
 of gratel are so colorful 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.009
 transparent and flexible and allow for 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.539
 build windows for example 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.770
 colored the ones you see here as 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.020
 windows are actually panels 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.030
 photovoltaic systems that transform light 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.280
 filtering into electricity 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.169
 they work so light enters the 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.060
 molecule is absorbed and electrons 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.080
 which are cited are injected into 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.120
 an electrical circuit 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.470
 meanwhile the electrons are a network circuit 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.150
 how we created electricity 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.270
 which for example will drop light bulb o 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.889
 for our domestic purposes 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.870
 you see that the levels in green and 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.220
 levels in purple that are those of the 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.960
 our molecule that has shown before 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.820
 on the computer are precisely those from which 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.440
 electrons depart and arrive for 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.060
 be injected into the electrical circuit 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.860
 that is, our molecules contained in 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.930
 this red rectangle and does all the 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.570
 work of exploitation of the sun without 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.009
 use silicon however we have 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.570
 still modified the molecules because 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.800
 precisely my job is not to use them 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.330
 never create new ones 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.979
 we have increased the symmetry of these 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.199
 le barese molecules capable of wrapping 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.580
 completely like a cloak for a moment 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.320
 of a metal represented here in 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.419
 gray and we got products 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.340
 even more complicated and guarantors we say 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.080
 in this case you see my molecule up 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.030
 a plan that tied an atom 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.620
 metallic in fuchsia and to this we have 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.870
 tied a toxic carrier there is a 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.909
 toxin a poison and we injected the 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.949
 all that however does not react in a 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.479
 mouse is sick the mouse but lippi the 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.099
 sick mouse and then he was enlightened 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.409
 but as you can see only in a well point 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.000
 particular and is for example the point in 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.580
 where the mouse can present a mass 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.889
 tumor and here's what happens that we the 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.180
 raja very polino the light reaches the 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:14.490
 we know our molecule 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.289
 marco absorbs it transfers energy 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.419
 to metal and metal it detaches the 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.520
 poisonous vector ie we free one 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.349
 toxin and that toxin kills 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.060
 cells for example cancer because 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.130
 we lit the little mouse alone 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.570
 where he had the tumor and so this 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.139
 poison capable of killing it all 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.870
 what we want 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.550
 in the case of diseased cells this is the 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.320
 possible application on humans and in 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.060
 part partly being studied is one 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.650
 photon capture therapy e 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.360
 you simply see the human body in
