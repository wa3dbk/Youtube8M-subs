 4 Apple will withdraw Samsung parts from the iPad this year 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:14.610
 If you look ahead 19 days ago , Apple will be able to see the 5th generation iPad 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.500
 This display shoulder for quotation book for iPad mini-passer 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.760
 I sent it to the vendors. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.630
 Both the lg display and Japan's Sharp and Japan displays require a quotation 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:29.910
 Who received but did not receive a toxic Samsung display 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:35.309
 4 Actually there was a move to reduce the ratio of Samsung parts. 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:39.600
 Apple is not it writing or 30 years came to Samsung parts from the 1980s 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.690
 Persistent business relationships seem to distance themselves due to 2 patent litigation 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.129
 It's been a move since late last year. 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.420
 From the iPhone 5s that was released last September, Samsung's memory semiconductors were subtracted 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.800
 In fact , I guess at the end of October , 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.760
 It was greatly reduces the amount of bad except for the supply of parts from a gradual Samsung 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.350
 There is. 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.460
 4 As patent lawsuits intensify, Apple is perceived as an active response 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.090
 There is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.990
 In fact Samsung's display pattern of Apple's supply pattern does not quite understand 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.520
 Many know that there are other parts to reduce out again a little later this 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:19.049
 According to this market research company Display Search 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.189
 Samsung Display's 12.8% of the total demand for Apple in the second quarter of last year 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.250
 Supply and writes 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.360
 However, 3.2% in 3Q09 and 0.9% in 4Q09 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.560
 There is a trend 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:35.880
 In this year's launch, the MacBook also has a smaller portion of Samsung's parts 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.829
 Showed that eggs and put another part of Samsung in addition to other products 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.520
 Yes, he is required to punish seems to shrink, Apple and Samsung next June 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:49.409
 The mobile application processor is about to expire. 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:55.049
 Current was known to be in contact with Intel Taiwan Taiwan tsmc it 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:59.670
 Related media is tsmc this month, the next generation of the iPhone to be mounted on the a7 chip 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:03.600
 It is reported that the design will be finished and will be put into pilot production in May or June. 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.250
 Scrapping of sudden infant enters the parts replacement, Apple, Samsung also no way 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.050
 I think I'll finish it. 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.640
 Eunikka played 4 because somehow the parts replacement, any decline in the safety of products 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.080
 It is a situation that is concerned. 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.760
 We just showed up at this briefing a while ago . 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.150
 Problem 2 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.230
 Any heat sink fan noise problem on MacBook Pro 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.940
 And then there was this, and it happened when I used this SanDisk product. 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.390
 We introduced him. 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.800
 This Samsung had Apple as its biggest customer 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.580
 Apple is worried about a drop in sales as it reduces the supply of certain parts from Samsung 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.540
 There is a situation. 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.950
 Yes, it is. 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.950
 3 4 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.369
