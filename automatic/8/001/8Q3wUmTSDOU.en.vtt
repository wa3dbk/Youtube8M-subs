where<00:02:47.989> everything<00:02:48.739> is<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.069> control<00:02:49.430> because

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
where everything is in control because

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.530 
where everything is in control because
it<00:02:50.060> generated<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.689> CGI<00:02:51.519> what<00:02:52.519> we<00:02:52.670> will<00:02:52.819> do<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.269> to

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
it generated a CGI what we will do is to

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.750 
it generated a CGI what we will do is to
get<00:02:53.750> as<00:02:53.989> much<00:02:54.170> as<00:02:54.349> possible<00:02:54.500> in<00:02:54.890> camera<00:02:55.220> to

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
kind of you know more danger than they

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.479 
kind of you know more danger than they
need<00:03:11.269> to<00:03:11.299> be<00:03:11.500> my<00:03:12.500> job<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.769> try<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.069> keep<00:03:13.250> things

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
need to be my job to try and keep things

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.580 
need to be my job to try and keep things
safe<00:03:13.760> but<00:03:14.090> also<00:03:14.629> to<00:03:14.840> make<00:03:15.079> sure<00:03:15.109> that<00:03:15.379> we<00:03:15.470> get

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
safe but also to make sure that we get

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.470 
safe but also to make sure that we get
something<00:03:15.950> that<00:03:16.040> looks<00:03:16.099> great<00:03:16.400> in<00:03:16.549> film<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:20.269> we

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
something that looks great in film so we

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.410 
something that looks great in film so we
did<00:03:20.629> a<00:03:20.659> 3d<00:03:21.019> pre-visit<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.950> entire<00:03:22.280> move<00:03:22.579> so

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
did a 3d pre-visit the entire move so

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.000 
did a 3d pre-visit the entire move so
that<00:03:23.569> the<00:03:23.659> camera<00:03:23.810> are<00:03:24.079> almost<00:03:24.319> kind<00:03:24.620> of<00:03:24.739> and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
that the camera are almost kind of and

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.679 
that the camera are almost kind of and
follows<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.459> action<00:03:25.939> that<00:03:25.970> happens<00:03:26.209> on<00:03:26.540> the

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:26.689 
follows the action that happens on the

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:28.960 
follows the action that happens on the
boat<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.139> that<00:03:27.889> seemed<00:03:28.189> to<00:03:28.250> make<00:03:28.310> sense<00:03:28.459> that

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
boat and that seemed to make sense that

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.839 
boat and that seemed to make sense that
we<00:03:29.329> would<00:03:29.480> then<00:03:29.689> cut<00:03:30.680> from<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.129> stage<00:03:31.459> and

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
we would then cut from this stage and

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.800 
we would then cut from this stage and
then<00:03:32.629> the<00:03:32.750> camera<00:03:32.959> rises<00:03:33.530> up<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.370> next

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
then the camera rises up to the next

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.140 
then the camera rises up to the next
cannon<00:03:35.810> back<00:03:36.019> and<00:03:36.290> then<00:03:36.949> finally<00:03:37.549> to<00:03:37.760> build

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
cannon back and then finally to build

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.780 
cannon back and then finally to build
the<00:03:38.269> top<00:03:38.480> deck<00:03:38.780> is<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:38.959> composite<00:03:39.379> the<00:03:39.829> first

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
the top deck is a composite the first

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.979 
the top deck is a composite the first
set<00:03:41.090> with<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.389> pool<00:03:41.629> is<00:03:42.669> 3,000<00:03:43.989> cubic

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
set with the pool is 3,000 cubic

set with the pool is 3,000 cubic
kilometers<00:03:45.680> of<00:03:45.709> water<00:03:46.159> which<00:03:46.669> is<00:03:46.699> very<00:03:47.299> big

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.350

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
the brightness but at the same time what

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.160 
the brightness but at the same time what
we<00:03:58.820> really<00:03:59.030> like<00:03:59.180> is<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.390> play<00:03:59.630> with<00:03:59.780> contrast

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
we really like is to play with contrast

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.570 
we really like is to play with contrast

so how do you appreciate the light if

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.640 
so how do you appreciate the light if
you<00:04:01.670> don't<00:04:01.820> have<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.060> darkness<00:04:02.480> so<00:04:03.170> this

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
you don't have the darkness so this

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.950 
you don't have the darkness so this
reflects<00:04:04.190> more<00:04:04.400> this<00:04:05.030> kind<00:04:05.210> of<00:04:05.270> dark<00:04:05.540> moments

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
reflects more this kind of dark moments

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.120 
reflects more this kind of dark moments
we<00:04:06.080> have<00:04:06.230> in<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.410> game<00:04:06.560> this<00:04:06.710> kind<00:04:06.890> of<00:04:06.920> very

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
we have in the game this kind of very

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.680 
we have in the game this kind of very
dramatic<00:04:07.520> moment<00:04:07.640> we<00:04:07.910> have<00:04:08.060> when<00:04:08.270> we<00:04:08.300> are<00:04:08.480> in

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
dramatic moment we have when we are in

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.640 
dramatic moment we have when we are in
the<00:04:08.810> novel<00:04:09.080> warfare<00:04:09.500> in<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.040> night

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.110 

and<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.769> was<00:04:16.889> a<00:04:16.919> brutal<00:04:17.190> time<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.820> know<00:04:17.940> these

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
and it was a brutal time you know these

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.330 
and it was a brutal time you know these
guys<00:04:18.299> didn't<00:04:18.660> take<00:04:18.870> hostages<00:04:19.650> they<00:04:20.280> were

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
guys didn't take hostages they were

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.300 
guys didn't take hostages they were
there<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.639> plunder<00:04:21.239> ships<00:04:21.660> steal<00:04:22.169> gold<00:04:22.500> and

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
there to plunder ships steal gold and

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.830 
there to plunder ships steal gold and
kill<00:04:23.550> their<00:04:23.729> enemies<00:04:23.759> and<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.360> think<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.660> game

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
kill their enemies and I think the game

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.779 
kill their enemies and I think the game
Black<00:04:25.289> Flag<00:04:25.470> really<00:04:26.039> wanted<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.430> capture<00:04:26.639> that

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
Black Flag really wanted to capture that

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.779 
Black Flag really wanted to capture that
and<00:04:27.120> we<00:04:27.570> wanted<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.080> same<00:04:28.110> essence<00:04:28.800> in<00:04:29.070> our<00:04:29.190> TV

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
and we wanted the same essence in our TV

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.730 
and we wanted the same essence in our TV
commercial<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.720> film<00:04:31.020> resonates<00:04:31.500> in<00:04:31.620> the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
commercial the film resonates in the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.950 
commercial the film resonates in the
game<00:04:31.919> in<00:04:32.100> a<00:04:32.190> sense<00:04:32.430> that<00:04:32.490> it's<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.300> metaphor<00:04:33.509> to

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
game in a sense that it's a metaphor to

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.450 
game in a sense that it's a metaphor to
show<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.410> evolution<00:04:34.770> of<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.919> main<00:04:35.070> character

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
show the evolution of the main character

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.439 
show the evolution of the main character
evils<00:04:36.360> a<00:04:36.539> from<00:04:37.320> a<00:04:37.350> selfish<00:04:38.100> reckless<00:04:38.550> Pirates

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
evils a from a selfish reckless Pirates

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.350 
evils a from a selfish reckless Pirates
to<00:04:40.320> a<00:04:40.350> more<00:04:40.620> like<00:04:40.979> a<00:04:41.009> Master<00:04:41.400> Assassin<00:04:41.430> to

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
to a more like a Master Assassin to

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.870
