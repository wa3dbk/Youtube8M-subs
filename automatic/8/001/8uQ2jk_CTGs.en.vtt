00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.720 
this as is so I thought that was
something<00:04:45.800> that<00:04:45.950> really<00:04:46.070> needed<00:04:46.460> a<00:04:46.490> little

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
something that really needed a little

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.790 
something that really needed a little
bit<00:04:46.850> of<00:04:46.940> touching<00:04:47.300> up<00:04:47.420> as<00:04:48.140> far<00:04:48.410> as<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:48.620> waist

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
bit of touching up as far as the waist

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.530 
bit of touching up as far as the waist
section<00:04:49.160> goes<00:04:49.340> here<00:04:49.700> you've<00:04:49.910> got<00:04:50.120> psycrow

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
section goes here you've got psycrow

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.690 
section goes here you've got psycrow
frame<00:04:50.810> that's<00:04:51.020> always<00:04:51.530> exposed<00:04:51.980> here<00:04:52.220> so<00:04:52.430> even

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
frame that's always exposed here so even

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.950 
frame that's always exposed here so even
if<00:04:52.790> you've<00:04:52.910> got<00:04:53.030> it<00:04:53.120> in<00:04:53.210> unicorn<00:04:53.630> mode<00:04:53.810> you

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
if you've got it in unicorn mode you

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.470 
if you've got it in unicorn mode you
cannot<00:04:54.260> close<00:04:54.590> these<00:04:54.860> flaps<00:04:55.190> but<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:56.240> can

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
cannot close these flaps but you can

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.690 
cannot close these flaps but you can
close<00:04:56.780> this<00:04:57.140> part<00:04:57.500> so<00:04:57.890> that<00:04:57.920> will<00:04:58.370> look<00:04:58.610> a

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
close this part so that will look a

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.040 
close this part so that will look a
little<00:04:58.820> bit<00:04:59.030> better<00:04:59.150> one<00:04:59.360> inch<00:04:59.480> in<00:04:59.600> unicorn

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
little bit better one inch in unicorn

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.650 
little bit better one inch in unicorn
mode<00:05:00.260> as<00:05:00.440> well<00:05:01.130> on<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.430> sides<00:05:01.670> this<00:05:01.970> is<00:05:02.030> always

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
mode as well on the sides this is always

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.570 
mode as well on the sides this is always
open<00:05:02.990> so<00:05:03.410> again<00:05:03.710> nothing<00:05:03.950> you<00:05:04.220> can<00:05:04.370> do<00:05:04.460> about

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
open so again nothing you can do about

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.910 
open so again nothing you can do about
that<00:05:04.730> and<00:05:05.090> on<00:05:05.540> the<00:05:05.630> back<00:05:05.810> you<00:05:05.840> have<00:05:06.290> thrusters

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
that and on the back you have thrusters

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.830 
that and on the back you have thrusters
that<00:05:07.070> just<00:05:07.400> have<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.640> surprising<00:05:08.330> bit<00:05:08.510> of<00:05:08.630> color

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
that just have a surprising bit of color

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.330 
that just have a surprising bit of color
in<00:05:09.020> it<00:05:09.140> well<00:05:09.350> mostly<00:05:09.620> just<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.920> fact<00:05:10.160> that<00:05:10.190> it

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
in it well mostly just the fact that it

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.790 
in it well mostly just the fact that it
has<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.610> grey<00:05:10.820> here<00:05:11.180> and<00:05:11.590> compared<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.680> the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
has the grey here and compared to the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.500 
has the grey here and compared to the
master<00:05:13.160> grade<00:05:13.340> one<00:05:13.520> which<00:05:13.700> is<00:05:13.850> horrible<00:05:14.270> to

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
master grade one which is horrible to

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.480 
master grade one which is horrible to
transform<00:05:15.050> this<00:05:15.350> one<00:05:15.560> is<00:05:15.680> great<00:05:16.010> you<00:05:16.280> just

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
transform this one is great you just

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.640 
transform this one is great you just
flip<00:05:16.760> these<00:05:16.910> grills<00:05:17.300> up<00:05:17.480> and<00:05:17.660> pinch<00:05:18.470> it

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
flip these grills up and pinch it

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.910 
flip these grills up and pinch it
together<00:05:18.800> no<00:05:19.610> problems<00:05:20.090> going<00:05:20.390> in<00:05:20.840> or<00:05:21.110> out<00:05:21.470> so

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
together no problems going in or out so

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.800 
together no problems going in or out so
this<00:05:22.040> is<00:05:22.100> a<00:05:22.280> huge<00:05:22.640> step<00:05:23.000> up<00:05:23.150> on<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:23.450> master

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
this is a huge step up on the master

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.170 
this is a huge step up on the master
grade<00:05:24.020> in<00:05:24.200> terms<00:05:24.890> of<00:05:25.100> ease<00:05:25.250> of<00:05:25.280> transformation

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
grade in terms of ease of transformation

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.640 
grade in terms of ease of transformation
for<00:05:26.750> the<00:05:26.840> rest<00:05:27.020> you're<00:05:27.170> just<00:05:27.320> going<00:05:27.440> to<00:05:27.500> put

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
for the rest you're just going to put

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.380 
for the rest you're just going to put
the<00:05:27.740> arms<00:05:27.770> in<00:05:28.160> here<00:05:28.460> you<00:05:28.610> can<00:05:28.790> see<00:05:28.820> some<00:05:29.210> of<00:05:29.240> the

the arms in here you can see some of the

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.660 
the arms in here you can see some of the
cycle<00:05:29.750> frame<00:05:29.960> inside<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:30.590> I<00:05:31.160> put<00:05:31.370> in<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.520> little

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
cycle frame inside and I put in a little

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.970 
cycle frame inside and I put in a little
bit<00:05:31.850> of<00:05:31.940> gray<00:05:32.180> marking<00:05:32.600> around<00:05:32.870> the<00:05:32.960> neck<00:05:33.140> with

SD Gundams ton tons you get really small

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.080 
SD Gundams ton tons you get really small
arms<00:05:36.680> and<00:05:36.860> sometimes<00:05:37.220> you<00:05:37.340> get<00:05:37.430> big<00:05:37.670> ones<00:05:37.880> and

the unicorn one really has the big
shoulders<00:05:40.250> which<00:05:41.120> goes<00:05:41.330> really<00:05:41.510> well<00:05:41.630> because

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
shoulders which goes really well because

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
it's got a big chunk of cycle frame in

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.190 
it's got a big chunk of cycle frame in
there<00:05:43.700> that's<00:05:43.880> being<00:05:44.060> showed<00:05:44.330> off<00:05:44.510> a<00:05:44.690> little

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
there that's being showed off a little

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.510 
there that's being showed off a little
bit<00:05:45.380> of<00:05:45.470> gray<00:05:45.620> lining<00:05:45.890> in<00:05:46.070> there<00:05:46.250> when<00:05:46.430> you

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
bit of gray lining in there when you

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.040 
bit of gray lining in there when you
transform<00:05:47.090> this<00:05:47.300> you're<00:05:47.540> just<00:05:47.720> basically

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
transform this you're just basically

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.080 
transform this you're just basically
going<00:05:48.230> to<00:05:48.530> detach<00:05:48.980> this<00:05:49.250> move<00:05:49.550> it<00:05:49.700> in<00:05:49.820> and<00:05:49.970> then

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
going to detach this move it in and then

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.670 
going to detach this move it in and then
plug<00:05:50.360> it<00:05:50.480> in<00:05:50.600> and<00:05:50.810> then<00:05:51.230> you<00:05:51.260> can<00:05:51.440> seal

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
plug it in and then you can seal

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.980 
plug it in and then you can seal
everything<00:05:51.950> up<00:05:52.220> and<00:05:52.400> down<00:05:53.210> below<00:05:53.390> this<00:05:53.780> is

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
everything up and down below this is

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.260 
everything up and down below this is
going<00:05:54.170> to<00:05:54.290> be<00:05:54.380> all<00:05:54.590> white<00:05:55.040> unless<00:05:55.430> you<00:05:55.880> use<00:05:56.090> the

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
going to be all white unless you use the

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.180 
going to be all white unless you use the
real<00:05:56.450> touch<00:05:56.720> marker<00:05:57.110> in<00:05:57.230> there<00:05:57.350> and<00:05:57.590> I<00:05:57.980> think

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
real touch marker in there and I think

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.440 
real touch marker in there and I think
that<00:05:58.310> the<00:05:58.370> real<00:05:58.520> touch<00:05:58.700> marker<00:05:58.910> really<00:05:59.240> worked

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
that the real touch marker really worked

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.670 
that the real touch marker really worked
well<00:05:59.600> and<00:05:59.690> you<00:05:59.780> don't<00:05:59.960> have<00:06:00.110> to<00:06:00.200> be<00:06:00.320> careful

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
well and you don't have to be careful

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.870 
well and you don't have to be careful
because<00:06:00.800> you're<00:06:01.010> going<00:06:01.130> to<00:06:01.190> cover<00:06:01.370> it<00:06:01.580> up<00:06:01.640> with

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
because you're going to cover it up with

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.720 
because you're going to cover it up with
this<00:06:02.600> side<00:06:02.870> mount<00:06:03.140> anyway<00:06:03.770> and<00:06:04.010> you're<00:06:04.580> going

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
this side mount anyway and you're going

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.180 
this side mount anyway and you're going
to<00:06:04.790> have<00:06:04.910> a<00:06:04.940> hand<00:06:05.240> down<00:06:05.450> here<00:06:05.780> very<00:06:06.410> standard

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
to have a hand down here very standard

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.130 
to have a hand down here very standard
for<00:06:07.400> an<00:06:07.460> SD<00:06:07.760> gundam<00:06:08.120> and<00:06:08.390> no<00:06:08.570> real<00:06:08.810> mobility

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.050 
for an SD gundam and no real mobility
besides<00:06:09.740> rotation<00:06:10.370> you're<00:06:10.760> going<00:06:10.880> to<00:06:10.940> have

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
besides rotation you're going to have

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.330 
besides rotation you're going to have
beam<00:06:11.240> sabers<00:06:11.690> with<00:06:12.230> big<00:06:12.500> ugly<00:06:12.830> holes<00:06:13.040> in<00:06:13.250> the

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
beam sabers with big ugly holes in the

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.830 
beam sabers with big ugly holes in the
back<00:06:13.520> but<00:06:13.730> it<00:06:13.790> doesn't<00:06:14.150> matter<00:06:14.300> because<00:06:14.510> they

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
back but it doesn't matter because they

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.960 
back but it doesn't matter because they
made<00:06:14.990> the<00:06:15.140> front<00:06:15.410> to<00:06:15.530> look<00:06:15.650> good<00:06:15.980> so<00:06:16.550> Bandai<00:06:16.940> a

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
made the front to look good so Bandai a

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.880 
made the front to look good so Bandai a
good<00:06:17.210> job<00:06:17.420> for<00:06:17.600> that<00:06:17.780> the<00:06:18.380> shield<00:06:18.680> looks

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
good job for that the shield looks

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.410 
good job for that the shield looks
better<00:06:19.190> than<00:06:19.340> I<00:06:19.430> expected<00:06:19.580> although<00:06:20.090> you'll

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 
better than I expected although you'll

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.120 
better than I expected although you'll
notice<00:06:20.750> from<00:06:20.870> the<00:06:21.080> side<00:06:21.290> that<00:06:21.560> these<00:06:21.770> little

white<00:06:22.370> strips<00:06:22.700> here<00:06:22.910> are<00:06:23.090> just<00:06:23.300> stickers<00:06:23.690> and

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
white strips here are just stickers and

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.570 
white strips here are just stickers and
it<00:06:24.230> looks<00:06:24.380> a<00:06:24.470> lot<00:06:24.590> better<00:06:24.740> with<00:06:24.890> them<00:06:25.250> than<00:06:25.280> not

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
it looks a lot better with them than not

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.670 
it looks a lot better with them than not
from<00:06:25.970> the<00:06:26.090> front<00:06:26.360> but<00:06:26.900> if<00:06:27.020> you<00:06:27.140> see<00:06:27.290> it<00:06:27.350> off<00:06:27.470> to

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
from the front but if you see it off to

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.960 
from the front but if you see it off to
the<00:06:27.770> side<00:06:27.980> it<00:06:28.160> does<00:06:28.310> look<00:06:28.520> a<00:06:28.610> little<00:06:28.730> bit

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970

looks<00:06:45.770> really<00:06:45.860> really<00:06:46.370> good<00:06:46.520> for<00:06:46.670> an<00:06:46.760> SD

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
looks really really good for an SD

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.720 
looks really really good for an SD
weapon<00:06:47.450> but<00:06:48.080> it<00:06:48.290> is<00:06:48.440> huge<00:06:48.800> although<00:06:49.580> it

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:49.730 
weapon but it is huge although it

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.950 
weapon but it is huge although it
doesn't<00:06:49.880> look<00:06:50.060> out<00:06:50.270> of<00:06:50.360> place<00:06:50.570> when<00:06:50.840> you<00:06:50.930> put

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
doesn't look out of place when you put

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.760 
doesn't look out of place when you put
it<00:06:51.200> all<00:06:51.260> together

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
it all together

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.650 
it all together
finally<00:06:52.310> for<00:06:52.520> weapons<00:06:52.820> the<00:06:52.970> beam<00:06:53.150> saber<00:06:53.450> is

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
finally for weapons the beam saber is

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.900 
finally for weapons the beam saber is
always<00:06:54.260> bent<00:06:54.680> like<00:06:54.950> this<00:06:54.980> and<00:06:55.460> so<00:06:55.610> I<00:06:55.640> would

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
always bent like this and so I would

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.400 
always bent like this and so I would
have<00:06:56.000> preferred<00:06:56.330> if<00:06:56.480> they<00:06:56.570> had<00:06:56.720> given<00:06:56.900> you<00:06:57.080> two

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410 
have preferred if they had given you two

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.500 
have preferred if they had given you two
a<00:06:57.680> straight<00:06:58.040> one<00:06:58.250> and<00:06:58.550> a<00:06:58.670> bent<00:06:58.910> one<00:06:59.120> because<00:06:59.390> if

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.510 
a straight one and a bent one because if

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.330 
a straight one and a bent one because if
he's<00:06:59.660> not<00:06:59.780> doing<00:06:59.900> the<00:07:00.080> slashing<00:07:00.500> motion<00:07:00.650> this

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
he's not doing the slashing motion this

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.700 
he's not doing the slashing motion this
sort<00:07:01.610> of<00:07:01.670> looks<00:07:01.850> a<00:07:01.910> little<00:07:02.120> bit<00:07:02.240> out<00:07:02.330> of<00:07:02.360> place

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710 
sort of looks a little bit out of place

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.140 
sort of looks a little bit out of place
the<00:07:03.710> head<00:07:03.920> of<00:07:04.040> the<00:07:04.130> unicorn<00:07:04.520> Gundam<00:07:04.820> however

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150 
the head of the unicorn Gundam however

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.020 
the head of the unicorn Gundam however
is<00:07:05.480> really<00:07:06.050> really<00:07:06.320> cool<00:07:06.650> and<00:07:06.920> of<00:07:07.010> course<00:07:07.040> for

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
is really really cool and of course for

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.580 
is really really cool and of course for
an<00:07:08.090> SD<00:07:08.390> Gundam<00:07:08.690> the<00:07:08.720> head<00:07:09.020> has<00:07:09.260> to<00:07:09.290> be<00:07:09.500> the

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
an SD Gundam the head has to be the

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:10.930 
an SD Gundam the head has to be the
focal<00:07:09.950> point<00:07:09.980> and<00:07:10.310> I<00:07:10.340> think<00:07:10.400> they<00:07:10.610> did<00:07:10.700> a<00:07:10.760> great

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
focal point and I think they did a great

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.910 
focal point and I think they did a great
job<00:07:11.090> with<00:07:11.480> it<00:07:11.510> mostly<00:07:12.470> because<00:07:12.620> of<00:07:12.770> the<00:07:12.890> fact

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:12.920 
job with it mostly because of the fact

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.410 
job with it mostly because of the fact
that<00:07:13.280> again<00:07:13.640> they<00:07:13.820> went<00:07:13.940> with<00:07:14.120> the<00:07:14.210> clear

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.420 
that again they went with the clear

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.840 
that again they went with the clear
cycle<00:07:14.840> frame<00:07:15.080> here<00:07:15.350> you<00:07:15.800> can<00:07:15.980> see<00:07:16.250> it<00:07:16.370> also
