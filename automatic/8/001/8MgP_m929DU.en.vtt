00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.770
 our sweater is roughly divided by three 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:11.900
 plot color that's what already 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:16.800
 got the darkest below 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.250
 lighter top lightest top right 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.260
 here it's about three lines in 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.650
 me on the pattern to them 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.980
 to navigate the detail it seemed to be 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:34.680
 Pattern that you can see that well 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.010
 fit tuck side brush here it is 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:45.539
 we have a side tuck and the details are good 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:47.460
 lay a corner laid down if we 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.430
 go to this side we see the same 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:56.190
 picture here is a side volt. our 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:01:00.260
 and it fits well with it here 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.140
 not yet proven but I have a lot 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.450
 blanks here on all colors since 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.260
 there will be more sleeves 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.430
 forward I knit in the mood where it was 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.340
 time in the shuttle bus in the trolley sometimes 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.799
 at work when dinner fell out 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.560
 break and now i have plenty to choose from 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:28.619
 and so the dark section you passed this one 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.570
 light cycle too and the brightest 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:36.829
 stayed with us here here 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:41.360
 openings to and close these here all 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:45.090
 open parts that don't fit as much as 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.060
 a whole circle like here 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.270
 will enter it 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.600
 Here is the little corner close here so 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.180
 wings as we have done here 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.119
 such wings close well 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.820
 corners here wanted to draw attention 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.849
 knitters at such a moment here we 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.580
 there is a little space here 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.310
 Crimea 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.170
 step I will check the hall right and want to accommodate 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.530
 here the item fits well you spring 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.330
 corners remain 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.870
 if we take a little bit more diameter 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.750
 corners still remain in such 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.930
 In some cases, I do this 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.110
 we have n't done this yet 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.360
 suppose we insert again there is here 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.600
 these holes 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.700
 I began to lick another close and here 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:48.640
 look how interesting and good 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:55.170
 becomes this element we add up to 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:58.020
 here and we have a very nice picture i 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:03.209
 I turn on the wrong side 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:06.160
 I stack this element and I was asked 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:10.270
 why i sew 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.570
 they all tie in some points 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.769
 better still sew on like this 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.160
 moment like this some kind of small 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:24.160
 the inconsistency still remains 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.730
 needle she will tighten well and if 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.640
 to pull in a hook here it will be rougher and 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.070
 rougher not exactly 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.800
 that's how I do it but not fixing 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:39.910
 I will show you in a hurry so as not to 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.370
 to bore those who watch it here 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.900
 can 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.620
 a little suspender do all the same 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:52.390
 knitted canvas is elastic and the wound gives 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.959
 more opportunities than sewing sewing 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:01.209
 tougher and you can probably say more 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:03.269
 exacting to the performer and so here 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.130
 went send 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:10.370
 here is a little bit you can trim 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.830
 due to the fact that the thread will tighten 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.870
 knitwear 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.850
 well, then I will not bore you 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.090
 see for yourself what goes very well 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.600
 We look at this side perfectly 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:28.160
 fits this detail perfectly 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.160
 And the details are tied in this case 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.420
 when does a new element begin and it does not 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:39.200
 But to complete this pods can be here 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.690
 here you can start a little here 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.530
 here in the middle but i love from the corner 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.350
 fit little semicircles and then she 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:54.800
 crochet increases 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:57.640
 but such moments I make a needle but 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.530
 here I have not finished this element 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.870
 Now you will understand why you are so we 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.440
 continue to impose it so I already 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.020
 continued a little bit like u beautifully 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:14.350
 put the columns in this 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:17.780
 we knit corners with ordinary columns 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:21.220
 right here here if we go next 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.880
 a knit column as usual will be with us 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.440
 mismatch means we do so 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:32.260
 the last but one column is incomplete until 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:35.300
 the end of another one this will be the last 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:39.530
 do not make out until the end 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:43.280
 and now we connect them with a common peak 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:46.250
 she aligns this moment a little 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:52.270
 look how well we did 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:54.950
 now we turn and sew 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.750
 we will need to sew up so 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.980
 the material that we just 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:06.400
 proved with what we just did 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:09.800
 already said that knitwear elastic 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:14.930
 convenient why they love him because in 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.500
 wearing it is easy to stretch 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.590
 the figure 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:24.440
 Well, in the work of knitwear is generally 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:29.370
 some kind of miracle i love to create 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:31.550
 all my life and here we come to this 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.550
 of the moment 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:38.460
 turn and look here we are now 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.610
 fasten the loop and see how 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:45.860
 nice here we are all connected 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.130
 again thanks to elasticity 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.220
 knitwear 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:58.010
 Well, that ends the last moment with 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:07:01.530
 this element is a blind loop 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:04.160
 we cut the tails must be hidden immediately 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:10.500
 because there are a lot of them and 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:13.950
 then there will be a terry inside look 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.740
 how well further what would i recommend 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.620
 from here 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:23.460
 one wing from him 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:27.510
 the second wing here and the next 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:30.110
 let's see what we get what we 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.110
 will prompt
