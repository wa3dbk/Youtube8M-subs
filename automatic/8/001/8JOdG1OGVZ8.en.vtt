right<00:01:35.700> now<00:01:35.909> also<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.659> even<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.110> simulator<00:01:37.680> in

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
right now also can even a simulator in

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.319 
right now also can even a simulator in
order<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.520> gas<00:01:38.700> up<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.000> running

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
order to get that gas up and running

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450 
order to get that gas up and running
meanwhile<00:01:39.869> maka<00:01:40.170> getting<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.710> refinery<00:01:41.250> as

meanwhile maka getting up a refinery as

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.550 
meanwhile maka getting up a refinery as
well<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.880> pretty<00:01:42.540> much<00:01:42.750> standard<00:01:43.200> play<00:01:43.380> we'll

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
well so pretty much standard play we'll

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.600 
well so pretty much standard play we'll
see<00:01:43.680> how<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:43.979> all<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> work<00:01:44.549> out

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610

supply lock we will be able to finish a
supply<00:03:54.090> depot<00:03:54.150> start<00:03:54.600> turning<00:03:54.810> up<00:03:54.900> more<00:03:55.200> units

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
supply depot start turning up more units

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.220 
supply depot start turning up more units
as<00:03:55.739> well<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.280> now<00:03:56.760> getting<00:03:57.000> stimpack<00:03:57.750> as<00:03:57.959> well

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
as well and now getting stimpack as well
