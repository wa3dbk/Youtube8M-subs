00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
okay so I'm doing this the unboxing of

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.070 
okay so I'm doing this the unboxing of
this<00:00:03.330> logitech<00:00:05.299> universal<00:00:06.299> windshield<00:00:06.750> mount

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080

and i really am interested in one and

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.730 
and i really am interested in one and
using<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.370> because<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:12.540> uses<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.929> magnet<00:00:13.469> so

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
using this because it uses a magnet so

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.490 
using this because it uses a magnet so
all<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.190> do<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.700> put<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.420> magnet<00:00:16.320> on

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
all you do is you put the the magnet on

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.410 
all you do is you put the the magnet on
the<00:00:16.560> back<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.520> phone<00:00:17.699> here's<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> actual

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
the back of the phone here's the actual

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.410 
the back of the phone here's the actual
magnet<00:00:18.960> itself<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:20.520> did<00:00:20.880> kind<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.119> already

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
magnet itself and I did kind of already

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.849 
magnet itself and I did kind of already
take<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.660> apart<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.260> but<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.560> can<00:00:22.680> see

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
take this apart but it but you can see

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.810 
take this apart but it but you can see
basically<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.810> actually<00:00:25.260> goes

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
basically so this this actually goes

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.750 
basically so this this actually goes
inside<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.930> case<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.529> your<00:00:28.650> phone<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.340> it

then what happens is is the phone and
I'm<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.750> taking<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:32.220> there

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
I'm just taking this out here is there

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.899 
I'm just taking this out here is there
you<00:01:33.240> go<00:01:33.799> okay<00:01:34.799> well<00:01:34.979> I'm<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.759> just

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you go okay well I'm just there you just

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.090 
you go okay well I'm just there you just
pop<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.240> out<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> cool<00:01:37.350> thing<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.979> that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
pop it out so the cool thing is is that

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.039 
pop it out so the cool thing is is that
it<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.460> either<00:01:38.640> sit<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.720> and

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
it you can either sit it like that and

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.260 
it you can either sit it like that and
so<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> phone<00:01:41.369> would<00:01:41.579> sit<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.030> on

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so the phone would sit like right on

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.030 
so the phone would sit like right on
here<00:01:42.600> basically<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.320> back<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.829> phone

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
here basically the back of the phone

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.550 
here basically the back of the phone
would<00:01:44.399> sit<00:01:44.670> right<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.090> here<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:46.350> so

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
would sit right on this here and then so

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.440 
would sit right on this here and then so
if<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.430> your<00:01:47.460> windshield<00:01:48.119> you
