00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
personally I think it was necessary for

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.360 
personally I think it was necessary for
them<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.480> put<00:02:19.600> one<00:02:19.750> in<00:02:19.900> but<00:02:20.500> some<00:02:20.980> people<00:02:21.220> may

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
them to put one in but some people may

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.700 
them to put one in but some people may
be<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.820> bit<00:02:22.270> disappointed<00:02:22.420> in<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:22.840> not<00:02:23.560> me

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
be a bit disappointed in that not me

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.010 
be a bit disappointed in that not me
being<00:02:24.280> one<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.430> them<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:25.360> will<00:02:25.540> put<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.870> on

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
being one of them so I will put it on

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.370 
being one of them so I will put it on
but<00:02:26.290> just<00:02:26.560> wanted<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:26.830> say<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:28.540> case<00:02:28.750> is

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
but just wanted to say that this case is

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.870 
but just wanted to say that this case is
actually<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.770> little<00:02:29.980> thicker<00:02:30.250> than<00:02:30.490> you<00:02:30.730> might

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
actually a little thicker than you might

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.590 
actually a little thicker than you might
think

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
think

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.050 
think
sorry<00:02:32.170> j-just<00:02:32.410> not<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.650> camera<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.060> you

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
sorry j-just not the camera that you

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.460 
sorry j-just not the camera that you
think<00:02:34.360> is<00:02:34.450> supposed<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.720> be<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> slimline<00:02:35.110> case

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
think is supposed to be a slimline case

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.320 
think is supposed to be a slimline case
and<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.710> is<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.160> very<00:02:36.370> slim<00:02:36.640> but<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.210> is

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
and it is it is very slim but it is

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.590 
and it is it is very slim but it is
actually<00:02:37.510> thicker<00:02:37.960> than<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.500> think

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
actually thicker than you think

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.150 
actually thicker than you think
so<00:02:40.600> just<00:02:40.870> macros<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.290> up<00:02:41.440> for<00:02:41.740> you<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.950> see<00:02:41.980> as

so just macros it up for you to see as
you<00:02:42.310> can<00:02:42.400> see<00:02:42.490> you<00:02:42.610> can<00:02:42.730> see<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.940> buttons<00:02:43.180> more

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
you can see you can see the buttons more

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.910 
you can see you can see the buttons more
clearly<00:02:43.600> there<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.020> there<00:02:44.560> they<00:02:44.680> have<00:02:44.770> got<00:02:44.890> a

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
clearly there and there they have got a

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.530 
clearly there and there they have got a
plus<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.310> minus<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:45.790> they<00:02:45.850> really<00:02:46.090> are<00:02:46.210> super

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
plus and minus and they really are super

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.700 
plus and minus and they really are super
easy<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.750> press<00:02:47.020> but<00:02:47.230> we'll<00:02:47.320> get<00:02:47.470> onto<00:02:47.590> that

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
easy to press but we'll get onto that

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.140 
easy to press but we'll get onto that
when<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.040> put<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.340> on<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.520> phone

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
when I put it on the phone

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.270 
when I put it on the phone
I<00:02:49.180> found<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:50.050> ringer<00:02:50.590> switch<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:51.010> easiest

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
I found the ringer switch the easiest

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.060 
I found the ringer switch the easiest
place<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.550> see<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.750> actual<00:02:52.900> thickness<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
place to see the actual thickness of the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.130 
place to see the actual thickness of the
bumper<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.610> can<00:02:55.120> see<00:02:55.210> you<00:02:55.270> can<00:02:55.390> see<00:02:55.510> there<00:02:55.720> the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
bumper you can see you can see there the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.530 
bumper you can see you can see there the
thickness<00:02:56.560> but<00:02:56.830> also<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.400> found<00:02:58.240> this<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.510> the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
thickness but also I found this is the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.700 
thickness but also I found this is the
best<00:02:58.630> place<00:02:58.960> there's<00:02:59.230> actually<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> lot<00:02:59.680> of

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
best place there's actually a lot of

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.160 
best place there's actually a lot of
thicker<00:02:59.950> than<00:03:00.100> I<00:03:00.160> expected<00:03:00.810> nothing<00:03:01.810> that's

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
thicker than I expected nothing that's

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.350 
thicker than I expected nothing that's
gonna<00:03:02.320> worry<00:03:02.680> me<00:03:02.920> at<00:03:03.010> all<00:03:03.160> but<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.970> do<00:03:04.150> notice

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.520 
feather I know that's sort of a
different<00:03:21.760> style<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.270> case<00:03:22.510> but<00:03:22.870> it's<00:03:23.020> you

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
different style of case but it's you

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.490 
different style of case but it's you
know<00:03:23.650> sort<00:03:23.770> of<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:23.950> more<00:03:24.100> slim<00:03:24.310> line<00:03:24.490> one<00:03:24.730> but

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
know sort of a more slim line one but

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.570 
know sort of a more slim line one but
that's<00:03:26.500> just<00:03:26.709> want<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:26.980> point<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.190> out<00:03:27.280> as

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580

sort<00:03:30.100> of<00:03:30.160> weak<00:03:30.310> point<00:03:30.550> I<00:03:30.640> can<00:03:30.790> find<00:03:30.970> here<00:03:31.150> and

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
sort of weak point I can find here and

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.860 
sort of weak point I can find here and
I'll<00:03:31.330> talk<00:03:31.480> about<00:03:31.600> this<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.959> minute<00:03:32.050> is<00:03:33.870> just

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
so one macro and put it on to a better

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.530 
so one macro and put it on to a better
setting<00:03:39.070> alright<00:03:39.910> so<00:03:40.090> we're<00:03:40.209> back<00:03:40.240> on<00:03:40.510> a

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
better macro setting now so we'll put it

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.820 
better macro setting now so we'll put it
in<00:03:43.570> I<00:03:43.690> like<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.870> put<00:03:44.020> in<00:03:44.110> buttons<00:03:44.380> first<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.770> know

over the side of the iPhone another way
you<00:04:30.960> can<00:04:31.199> see<00:04:31.349> the<00:04:31.470> sort<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.710> thickness<00:04:32.009> it

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
you can see the sort of the thickness it

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.350 
you can see the sort of the thickness it
adds<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.729> just<00:04:33.360> by<00:04:33.479> looking<00:04:33.509> through<00:04:34.050> the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
speaker grills as well so macro that up

you you know would be interested to the

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.330 
you you know would be interested to the
tour<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.199> the<00:04:49.319> case<00:04:49.500> as<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:49.889> can<00:04:50.009> see<00:04:50.190> you've

there's<00:05:22.800> only<00:05:22.889> one<00:05:23.069> little<00:05:23.310> problem

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
there's only one little problem

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.459 
there's only one little problem
what<00:05:24.449> I<00:05:24.479> would<00:05:24.659> call<00:05:24.750> it<00:05:24.900> problems<00:05:25.229> that's

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
what I would call it problems that's

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.230 
what I would call it problems that's
just<00:05:25.680> something<00:05:25.860> that<00:05:26.009> to<00:05:26.250> note<00:05:26.520> is<00:05:26.789> that<00:05:26.849> this

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
just something that to note is that this

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.820 
just something that to note is that this
bit<00:05:27.449> here<00:05:27.630> is<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.960> weakest<00:05:28.289> part<00:05:28.469> of<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.590> case

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
bit here is the weakest part of the case

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.189 
bit here is the weakest part of the case
I<00:05:29.130> don't<00:05:30.060> know<00:05:30.120> if<00:05:30.180> you<00:05:30.240> can<00:05:30.360> see<00:05:30.539> that<00:05:30.750> but<00:05:31.110> it

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
I don't know if you can see that but it

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.189 
I don't know if you can see that but it
sort<00:05:31.349> of<00:05:31.409> just<00:05:31.560> pulls<00:05:31.860> up<00:05:32.750> so<00:05:33.750> what<00:05:33.900> I<00:05:33.930> have<00:05:34.080> to

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
sort of just pulls up so what I have to

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.129 
sort of just pulls up so what I have to
do<00:05:34.319> every<00:05:34.530> time<00:05:34.560> is<00:05:34.979> just<00:05:35.780> as<00:05:36.780> you<00:05:36.900> can<00:05:37.020> see

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
that here that click just make sure it's

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.589 
that here that click just make sure it's
pushed<00:05:38.580> in<00:05:38.819> and<00:05:39.029> then<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.360> case<00:05:39.569> is

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
pushed in and then the case is

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.230 
pushed in and then the case is
completely<00:05:40.169> form<00:05:40.800> just<00:05:41.460> an<00:05:41.669> overview<00:05:41.940> of<00:05:42.120> the

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
I thought I was gonna hate it I thought

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.629 
I thought I was gonna hate it I thought
you<00:06:16.080> know<00:06:16.469> it's<00:06:16.770> not<00:06:17.069> gonna<00:06:17.190> provide<00:06:17.460> any

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
you know it's not gonna provide any

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.490 
you know it's not gonna provide any
protection<00:06:17.759> it's<00:06:18.389> really<00:06:18.719> gonna<00:06:18.870> be<00:06:18.960> minimal

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
protection it's really gonna be minimal

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.680 
protection it's really gonna be minimal
yeah<00:06:20.069> it<00:06:20.310> does<00:06:20.520> provide<00:06:20.880> minimal<00:06:21.509> protection

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
yeah it does provide minimal protection

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.149 
yeah it does provide minimal protection
but<00:06:22.409> actually<00:06:23.360> it<00:06:24.360> is<00:06:24.539> a<00:06:24.569> lot<00:06:24.990> more<00:06:25.229> protective

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:26.159 
but actually it is a lot more protective

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.159 
but actually it is a lot more protective
than<00:06:26.190> I<00:06:26.460> thought<00:06:26.669> it<00:06:26.789> covers<00:06:27.150> there<00:06:27.389> the<00:06:27.870> sides

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
than I thought it covers there the sides

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.290 
than I thought it covers there the sides
of<00:06:28.380> the<00:06:28.469> case<00:06:28.680> really<00:06:29.009> well<00:06:29.250> it<00:06:29.639> covers<00:06:29.849> you

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
of the case really well it covers you

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.579 
of the case really well it covers you
know<00:06:30.330> you've<00:06:30.599> got<00:06:30.690> a<00:06:30.719> slight<00:06:31.169> lay<00:06:31.349> on<00:06:31.469> the

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:31.589 
know you've got a slight lay on the

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:13.659 
bumper is that I really like it is a

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:15.209 
bumper is that I really like it is a
great<00:07:13.899> case<00:07:14.139> it<00:07:14.349> does<00:07:14.439> exactly<00:07:14.800> what<00:07:15.009> it's

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:15.219 
great case it does exactly what it's

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:17.159 
great case it does exactly what it's
supposed<00:07:15.519> to<00:07:15.639> it<00:07:15.939> is<00:07:16.179> quality<00:07:16.689> whether<00:07:16.929> or<00:07:17.110> not

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:17.169 
supposed to it is quality whether or not

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:18.540 
supposed to it is quality whether or not
it's<00:07:17.319> worth<00:07:17.529> the<00:07:17.649> money<00:07:17.829> you<00:07:17.949> pay<00:07:17.979> for<00:07:18.369> it<00:07:18.429> is<00:07:18.519> a

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550 
it's worth the money you pay for it is a

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.299 
it's worth the money you pay for it is a
different<00:07:19.029> story<00:07:19.739> would<00:07:20.739> I<00:07:20.769> recommend<00:07:21.039> it

00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:21.309 
different story would I recommend it

00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:23.850 
different story would I recommend it
yeah<00:07:21.610> I<00:07:21.639> would<00:07:21.819> recommend<00:07:22.269> it<00:07:22.769> will<00:07:23.769> it

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
yeah I would recommend it will it

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.319 
yeah I would recommend it will it
provide<00:07:24.159> ultimate<00:07:24.909> shock<00:07:25.089> and<00:07:25.269> drop

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:25.329 
provide ultimate shock and drop

00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:27.029 
provide ultimate shock and drop
protection<00:07:25.509> probably<00:07:26.289> not<00:07:26.469> it's<00:07:26.739> probably<00:07:26.800> a

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 
protection probably not it's probably a

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:29.850 
protection probably not it's probably a
Midway<00:07:27.429> it<00:07:27.849> wouldn't<00:07:28.149> be<00:07:28.239> as<00:07:28.869> badly<00:07:29.229> sort<00:07:29.800> of

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:29.860 
Midway it wouldn't be as badly sort of

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.169 
Midway it wouldn't be as badly sort of
like<00:07:30.009> protected<00:07:30.489> as<00:07:30.610> the<00:07:30.789> featherweight

00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:33.369 
cases but it wouldn't be as such as the

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.279
