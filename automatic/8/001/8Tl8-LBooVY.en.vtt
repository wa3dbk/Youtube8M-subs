00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.950
 Distribute mesh and add the needle to match 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.470
 close round when going with the new one 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.679
 play strictly then strictly first 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.860
 with a needle the stitches on this 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.929
 If already happened that is 40 meshes 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.260
 and then spread these stitches over four 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.609
 needles and with the free fifth needle 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.150
 then you close the needle game 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.609
 round 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.439
 let's start with the stitches 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.480
 to distribute 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.119
 for that we shove off this needle 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.740
 look down about ten stitches 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.930
 on the left side, there are threads here 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.520
 out on the right are none 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.920
 threads and exactly on this side 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.360
 pushed the stitches down the allowed 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.660
 be about ten 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.660
 take a free needle and push 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:56.340
 the machine is on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:00.570
 and the actual ten we protect the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.489
 next 10 stitches down third free 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.119
 needle or respectively second free 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:11.720
 needle and push the stitches on it 1 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.720
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.960
 we decided again from the mesh 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.420
 Get the third one free 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:29.850
 Needle and push because the mesh on it 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:33.910
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 4 to 38 910 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.480
 now we have the 40 stitches on four 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.830
 Needles are distributed , we are in 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.330
 we'll have to get the needle right 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.480
 yes still close to round 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.550
 best the two open ends 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.410
 so up 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.410
 we see that I have nothing representative 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.350
 just put a little bad 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.980
 so now that the right end as 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.770
 the threads come out left no end 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.130
 but we need peace from the two 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.649
 threads that take you to the knoll 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.310
 this is the one we put in or too 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.070
 two times around the left index finger 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.850
 take the replay up and the 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:22.390
 right needle is on the left 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:26.050
 middle finger off the left end above 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.520
 over it take the fifth free nobility and 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.190
 Now let's close it with a game 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.310
 a right stitch to round 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.550
 we are stuck with the tip of 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.430
 front to back through the last 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.970
 mesh of the left needle from the front to 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.739
 behind here so consistently the top 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.360
 behind the thread the work schedule of 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.640
 thread the over the left index finger 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.900
 leads that one can quiet times in 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.040
 Vienna still take a finger to help 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.100
 You do not see these questions 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.820
 worked that always makes you from scratch 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.489
 So stick with the needle from the front 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.550
 back through the last stitch of the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.489
 go regional 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.480
 behind the working thread with the tip 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.480
 and then pull that thread 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.909
 through the last stitch by because of it 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.989
 everything is safe by this one can 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.030
 also a bit on the thread 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.459
 Pull so that everything is not so easy 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.150
 is one the last stitch then so 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.760
 slowly from the left needle down 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.510
 let slip 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.980
 and then we already have that 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.760
 copying with a right stitch too 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.760
 closed round
