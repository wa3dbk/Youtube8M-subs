here at Oklahoma gardening studio we've
had<00:00:10.740> real<00:00:11.040> good<00:00:11.070> success<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.940> year<00:00:12.210> with<00:00:12.360> our

black raspberries this variety is
Bristol<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:16.379> think<00:00:16.619> one<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.920> keys<00:00:17.190> to

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
success is of course choosing a variety

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
go ahead and do some tip layering then I

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.360 
go ahead and do some tip layering then I
would<00:03:09.689> suggest<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.290> may<00:03:10.469> want<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.799> fill<00:03:11.159> a

when the fruits have formed and the new
shoots<00:03:55.379> begin<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.829> grow<00:03:56.069> you'll<00:03:56.969> have<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.239> plant

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
shoots begin to grow you'll have a plant

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.479 
shoots begin to grow you'll have a plant
that<00:03:57.749> has<00:03:57.840> already<00:03:58.049> been<00:03:58.260> containerized<00:03:59.099> and

that has already been containerized and
you<00:04:00.299> can<00:04:00.540> then<00:04:00.750> clip<00:04:01.049> it<00:04:01.079> off<00:04:01.379> and<00:04:01.709> keep<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.549> in

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
you can then clip it off and keep it in

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.660 
you can then clip it off and keep it in
the<00:04:02.730> container<00:04:03.150> for<00:04:03.480> several<00:04:03.959> weeks<00:04:04.260> or<00:04:04.670> as

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
garden such things as simple layering

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.719 
garden such things as simple layering
which<00:05:00.599> simply<00:05:00.990> means<00:05:01.020> taking<00:05:01.979> a<00:05:02.099> branch<00:05:02.460> of

the ground and then burying it with soil
in<00:05:14.539> various<00:05:15.539> spots<00:05:19.190> so<00:05:20.190> so<00:05:20.729> that<00:05:20.940> roots<00:05:21.210> may

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
in various spots so so that roots may

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.290 
in various spots so so that roots may
form<00:05:21.750> along<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.320> node<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.949> then<00:05:23.550> where<00:05:23.849> roots

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
form along the node and then where roots

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.270 
form along the node and then where roots
have<00:05:24.539> formed<00:05:24.960> you<00:05:25.320> can<00:05:25.349> cut<00:05:25.710> these<00:05:25.860> off<00:05:26.099> and

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
have formed you can cut these off and

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.890 
have formed you can cut these off and
have<00:05:26.400> several<00:05:26.789> plants<00:05:27.150> in<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:27.449> manner
