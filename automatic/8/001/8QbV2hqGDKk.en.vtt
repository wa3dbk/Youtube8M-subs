00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
hitting drill now this is a replay of a

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.049 
hitting drill now this is a replay of a
game<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:10.950> played<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:12.110> basically<00:00:13.190> what<00:00:14.190> happens

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
game I played and basically what happens

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.950 
game I played and basically what happens
in<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.480> game<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.760> pick<00:00:17.760> SF<00:00:18.180> because<00:00:18.720> he

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
in this game is you pick SF because he

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.929 
in this game is you pick SF because he
is<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.289> hero<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.010> lowest<00:00:20.310> starting

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
plus items well here I got some region

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.659 
plus items well here I got some region
in<00:00:30.660> case<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.080> wanted<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.830> tank<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.250> creep<00:00:32.460> wave

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
in case I wanted to tank the creep wave

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.880 
in case I wanted to tank the creep wave
to<00:00:33.200> maintain<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> creep<00:00:34.559> equilibrium<00:00:34.920> um

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
to maintain the creep equilibrium um

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.889 
to maintain the creep equilibrium um
basically<00:00:38.180> without<00:00:39.180> getting<00:00:39.510> any<00:00:39.629> plus

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
damaged items you start to last-hit and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.260 
damaged items you start to last-hit and
you<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.370> ten<00:00:44.640> minutes<00:00:44.820> without

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
you do this for ten minutes without

you do this for ten minutes without
letting<00:00:45.960> any<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.530> levelling<00:00:47.190> up<00:00:47.340> any<00:00:47.579> skills

or whatnot and you try to hit a target
mark<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.469> around<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.219> hundred<00:00:54.410> what<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.590> helps

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
mark of around a hundred what this helps

mark of around a hundred what this helps
you<00:00:56.430> practice<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.449> basically<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.890> ability<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
you practice is basically the ability to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.240 
you practice is basically the ability to
maintain<00:00:59.730> creep<00:01:00.329> equilibrium<00:01:01.250> without

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
maintain creep equilibrium without

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.539 
maintain creep equilibrium without
having<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.120> lot<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.359> damage<00:01:03.840> ability<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.040> catch

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549

I<00:01:09.990> almost<00:01:10.680> never<00:01:11.070> play<00:01:11.520> SF<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.860> quite

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
I almost never play SF so this was quite

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.469 
I almost never play SF so this was quite
hard<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:15.509> me<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:16.170> um<00:01:17.150> apparently<00:01:18.150> this

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
hard but for me but um apparently this

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.440 
hard but for me but um apparently this
is<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> pretty<00:01:18.960> common<00:01:19.320> drill<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:20.450> players

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
is a pretty common drill for players

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.260 
is a pretty common drill for players
that<00:01:21.810> play<00:01:22.020> competitively<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.270> practice

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that play competitively to practice

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.810 
that play competitively to practice
their<00:01:24.630> timing<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:27.470> practice<00:01:28.470> free<00:01:29.369> from<00:01:29.579> to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
their timing to practice free from to

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.700 
their timing to practice free from to
make<00:01:29.939> sure<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.360> when<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.049> no<00:01:31.470> pressure

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
make sure that when you have no pressure

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.480 
make sure that when you have no pressure
to<00:01:31.920> firm<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> hero<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.409> has<00:01:34.890> decent

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
to firm that with a hero that has decent

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.730 
to firm that with a hero that has decent
damage<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.390> wouldn't<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.780> missing<00:01:37.049> any<00:01:37.439> last

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
damage you wouldn't be missing any last

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.330 
damage you wouldn't be missing any last
hits<00:01:38.040> now<00:01:39.259> I'm<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.530> speed<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
hits now I'm going to speed up the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.550 
hits now I'm going to speed up the
replay<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.970> little<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.540> because<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.140> ten

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
replay a little bit because it is ten

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.190 
replay a little bit because it is ten
minutes<00:01:43.860> long<00:01:44.210> I'm<00:01:45.210> gonna<00:01:45.479> play<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.780> four

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
minutes long I'm gonna play it four

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.160 
minutes long I'm gonna play it four
times<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.829> guys<00:01:47.220> see<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.909> actually<00:01:48.360> missed

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
times and you guys see I actually missed

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.429 
times and you guys see I actually missed
quite<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> few<00:01:50.040> um<00:01:50.720> regardless<00:01:51.720> though<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.229> think

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
quite a few um regardless though I think

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.469 
quite a few um regardless though I think
in<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> end<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.070> still<00:01:53.340> hit<00:01:53.520> around<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:54.060> 100

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
in the end I still hit around that 100

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.700 
in the end I still hit around that 100
mark<00:01:54.630> um<00:01:56.600> but<00:01:57.600> basically<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.320> guys<00:01:58.500> see

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
mark um but basically as you guys see

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.530 
mark um but basically as you guys see
you<00:01:58.979> want<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.280> maintain<00:01:59.460> this<00:02:00.030> creep<00:02:00.329> wave

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you want to maintain this creep wave

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.889 
you want to maintain this creep wave
right<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> middle<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:03.810> know

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
right here in the middle you know

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.530 
right here in the middle you know
without<00:02:04.560> even<00:02:04.950> shifting<00:02:05.610> my<00:02:05.729> screen<00:02:06.149> just

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
without even shifting my screen just

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.270 
without even shifting my screen just
walking<00:02:06.930> around<00:02:07.200> during<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.770> last<00:02:07.950> hitting

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
walking around during the last hitting

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.180 
walking around during the last hitting
now<00:02:10.179> here<00:02:10.750> things<00:02:11.200> become<00:02:11.530> interesting

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
now here things become interesting

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.420 
now here things become interesting
because<00:02:12.430> there<00:02:12.910> are<00:02:13.030> two<00:02:13.270> cards<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.950> means

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
because there are two cards this means

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.510 
because there are two cards this means
that<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.390> damage<00:02:16.810> output<00:02:17.050> from<00:02:17.560> each<00:02:17.830> wave<00:02:18.220> is

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
that the damage output from each wave is

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
that the damage output from each wave is
a<00:02:18.970> little<00:02:19.720> bit<00:02:19.870> higher<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:22.030> cards

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
a little bit higher and the cards

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.110 
a little bit higher and the cards
actually<00:02:23.110> do<00:02:23.320> decent<00:02:24.100> damage<00:02:24.430> if<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.730> pop<00:02:24.940> out

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
actually do decent damage if I pop out

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.300 
actually do decent damage if I pop out
of<00:02:25.330> my<00:02:25.570> player<00:02:25.990> perspective<00:02:26.290> for<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.740> second<00:02:27.190> it

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
of my player perspective for a second it

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.760 
of my player perspective for a second it
does<00:02:27.640> 40<00:02:28.030> damage<00:02:28.060> while<00:02:28.720> your<00:02:28.900> hero<00:02:29.230> only<00:02:29.470> does

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
does 40 damage while your hero only does

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.170 
does 40 damage while your hero only does
49<00:02:30.310> damage<00:02:30.820> so<00:02:31.690> this<00:02:32.260> once<00:02:32.590> again<00:02:33.180> challenges

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
49 damage so this once again challenges

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.940 
49 damage so this once again challenges
you<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.959> maintain<00:02:35.380> creep<00:02:35.920> equilibrium<00:02:36.280> and

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
you to maintain creep equilibrium and

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.380 
you to maintain creep equilibrium and
play<00:02:38.950> around<00:02:39.070> once<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.790> cards<00:02:40.120> are<00:02:40.270> here<00:02:41.190> so

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
play around once the cards are here so

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.820 
play around once the cards are here so
once<00:02:43.390> again<00:02:43.510> back<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.900> four<00:02:44.230> times<00:02:44.410> speed<00:02:44.680> as

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
once again back to four times speed as

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.270 
once again back to four times speed as
you<00:02:44.890> will<00:02:45.459> see<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.959> let<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.140> card<00:02:47.440> take<00:02:47.980> some

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
you will see I let the card take some

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.940 
you will see I let the card take some
damage<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:49.000> then<00:02:49.270> later<00:02:49.630> deny<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.290> card<00:02:50.770> and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
damage and then later deny the card and

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.320 
damage and then later deny the card and
keep<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.820> enemy<00:02:52.000> card<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:53.910> think<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.060> comes

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
keep the enemy card I think that comes

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.800 
keep the enemy card I think that comes
loved<00:02:55.600> in<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.320> second<00:02:59.400> yes<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.510> car

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
loved in a in a second yes so that car

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.660 
loved in a in a second yes so that car
is<00:03:02.020> less<00:03:02.290> than<00:03:02.470> half<00:03:02.650> health<00:03:02.920> now<00:03:03.160> now<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.400> can

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
is less than half health now now I can

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.690 
is less than half health now now I can
deny<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:04.810> way<00:03:05.020> I<00:03:05.230> can<00:03:05.260> maintain<00:03:06.010> a

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
deny it and this way I can maintain a

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.640 
deny it and this way I can maintain a
liquid<00:03:07.300> Librium<00:03:07.630> by<00:03:07.750> tanking<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.320> creep<00:03:08.500> rate

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
liquid Librium by tanking the creep rate

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.320 
liquid Librium by tanking the creep rate
even<00:03:08.920> though<00:03:09.070> they<00:03:09.370> are<00:03:09.610> pushing<00:03:09.940> through

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
even though they are pushing through

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.449 
even though they are pushing through
however<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:11.020> think<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.380> was<00:03:11.500> somewhat<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:12.370> a

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
however I think it was somewhat of a

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.170 
however I think it was somewhat of a
mistake<00:03:12.940> because<00:03:13.600> later<00:03:14.380> two<00:03:15.370> cards<00:03:15.700> pop<00:03:15.940> up

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
mistake because later two cards pop up

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.820 
mistake because later two cards pop up
and<00:03:17.190> actually<00:03:18.190> messes<00:03:19.090> up<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.989> momentum<00:03:20.530> and

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
and actually messes up the momentum and

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.420 
and actually messes up the momentum and
the<00:03:21.810> creeps<00:03:22.810> actually<00:03:23.290> push<00:03:23.530> under<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.220> power

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
the creeps actually push under the power

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.800 
the creeps actually push under the power
and<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.940> missed<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:26.110> few<00:03:26.320> creeps

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
and I missed a few creeps

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.690 
and I missed a few creeps
therefore<00:03:28.810> my<00:03:28.930> CS<00:03:29.230> went<00:03:29.620> under<00:03:30.220> 100

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
therefore my CS went under 100

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.199 
therefore my CS went under 100
um<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.870> yeah<00:03:34.080> I<00:03:34.349> hope<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.610> guys<00:03:35.730> find<00:03:36.000> this

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
um so yeah I hope you guys find this

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.740 
um so yeah I hope you guys find this
drill<00:03:36.569> useful<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.709> definitely<00:03:38.489> helps<00:03:38.970> with<00:03:39.360> my

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
drill useful it definitely helps with my

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.290 
drill useful it definitely helps with my
timing<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.849> maintaining<00:03:41.849> creepy

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
timing and maintaining creepy

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.949 
timing and maintaining creepy
equilibrium<00:03:42.959> actually<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:44.060> not<00:03:45.060> something<00:03:45.810> as

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
equilibrium actually is not something as

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.470 
equilibrium actually is not something as
simple<00:03:46.170> as<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.650> would<00:03:46.800> think<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:48.120> drill

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
simple as you would think and this drill

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.780 
simple as you would think and this drill
is<00:03:48.690> actually<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.470> lot<00:03:49.709> harder<00:03:50.040> than<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.760> would

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
is actually a lot harder than you would

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.559 
is actually a lot harder than you would
expect

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
expect

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.460 
expect
um<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:52.620> encourage<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.519> try<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.090> if<00:03:55.050> you're

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
um I encourage you to try and if you're

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.610 
um I encourage you to try and if you're
well<00:03:55.739> my<00:03:56.780> subscribers<00:03:57.780> let<00:03:58.170> me<00:03:58.260> know<00:03:58.380> how<00:03:58.560> you

well my subscribers let me know how you
do<00:03:58.890> I'm<00:03:59.580> actually<00:03:59.910> quite<00:04:00.269> interested<00:04:00.480> how<00:04:01.140> my

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
do I'm actually quite interested how my

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.870 
do I'm actually quite interested how my
subscribers<00:04:01.980> do<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:03.500> in<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:04.769> drill<00:04:05.130> and<00:04:05.459> uh

yeah<00:04:06.299> as<00:04:06.599> I<00:04:06.959> was<00:04:07.170> speeding<00:04:07.620> forward

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
yeah as I was speeding forward

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.509 
yeah as I was speeding forward
I<00:04:08.250> actually<00:04:08.489> went<00:04:08.970> past<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.510> point<00:04:09.720> where

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
I actually went past that point where

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.069 
I actually went past that point where
there<00:04:11.519> were<00:04:11.610> two<00:04:11.819> cards<00:04:12.180> but<00:04:12.390> yeah<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.810> creeps

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
there were two cards but yeah the creeps

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.740 
there were two cards but yeah the creeps
plundered<00:04:13.650> my<00:04:13.799> tower<00:04:14.069> and<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.849> actually<00:04:15.239> missed

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
plundered my tower and I actually missed

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.620 
plundered my tower and I actually missed
a<00:04:15.870> few<00:04:16.070> so<00:04:17.070> anyways<00:04:17.430> guys<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.940> hope<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.329> find

this<00:04:18.900> helpful<00:04:18.959> on<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.850> last<00:04:21.090> 10<00:04:21.959> 20<00:04:22.169> seconds

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
this helpful on the last 10 20 seconds

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.320 
this helpful on the last 10 20 seconds
as<00:04:22.860> you<00:04:22.889> see<00:04:23.130> my<00:04:23.310> damage<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:23.760> actually<00:04:24.120> quite

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
as you see my damage is actually quite

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.930 
as you see my damage is actually quite
high<00:04:24.570> now<00:04:24.810> because<00:04:25.320> as<00:04:25.710> time<00:04:26.190> progressed<00:04:26.669> you

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
high now because as time progressed you

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.870 
high now because as time progressed you
level<00:04:27.270> up<00:04:27.450> but<00:04:27.930> I'm<00:04:28.650> getting<00:04:29.010> lazy<00:04:29.250> here<00:04:29.760> and

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
level up but I'm getting lazy here and

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.360 
level up but I'm getting lazy here and
there<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.300> I<00:04:30.389> actually<00:04:30.570> missed<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.139> few<00:04:31.370> it's

there and I actually missed a few it's
950<00:04:33.210> I'm<00:04:33.540> at<00:04:33.720> 49<00:04:34.320> 47<00:04:35.180> around<00:04:36.180> that<00:04:36.360> 100<00:04:36.750> mark<00:04:36.960> I

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
950 I'm at 49 47 around that 100 mark I

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.150 
950 I'm at 49 47 around that 100 mark I
made<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.830> quite<00:04:38.070> a<00:04:38.130> few<00:04:38.220> mistakes<00:04:38.639> though<00:04:39.530> so<00:04:40.530> um

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
made a quite a few mistakes though so um

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.400 
made a quite a few mistakes though so um
you<00:04:41.460> know<00:04:41.580> it<00:04:41.880> could<00:04:42.300> actually<00:04:42.600> be<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:43.050> lot

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
you know it could actually be a lot

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.969 
you know it could actually be a lot
better<00:04:44.090> what<00:04:45.090> this<00:04:45.300> what<00:04:46.139> you're<00:04:46.320> mostly

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
better what this what you're mostly
