00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.966
- WE'RE BACK WITH THE 44TH
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.266
BARACK OBAMA, WHO'S JOINING US
FROM THE ELLEN BLUE ROOM

00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.500
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.566
[cheers and applause]

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.533
MR. PRESIDENT, IT HAS BEEN
AWHILE SINCE WE'VE SPOKEN.

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.600
YOU LOOK GREAT.
HOW ARE YOU?

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.733
- I AM DOING GREAT.
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL ALSO.

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.100
- WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SAYING THAT.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.966
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO JUST BECAUSE
I SAID YOU LOOK GOOD,

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.133
BUT THAT WAS NICE OF YOU.

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.133
- IT IS TRUE.

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.400
- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.566
BUT I WAS AIMING TO BREAK
YOUR RECORD OF RETWEETS,

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.466
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR DOING IT,

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.533
BUT I BROKE YOUR RETWEET RECORD.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:37.266
[cheers and applause]

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.500
- I HEARD ABOUT THAT.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.200
I THOUGHT IT WAS A PRETTY CHEAP
STUNT MYSELF,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.800
GETTING A BUNCH OF CELEBRITIES
IN THE BACKGROUND.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.933
- THAT'S THE ONLY THING--

00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.633
- YOU FEEDING THEM PIZZA.
- YEAH.

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:50.066
SO THE FIRST LADY'S IN CHINA.

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.366
HOW IS SHE DOING?

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.466
- YOU KNOW,
SHE HASN'T LANDED YET,

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.033
BUT THE HOUSE IS ABANDONED.

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:58.533
I'M STUCK WITH TWO DOGS,

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.000
AND...

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.900
I'M EXPECTED TO WALK THEM

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.166
AND DO WHAT YOU DO
WHEN YOU WALK DOGS.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.433
BUT I THINK THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME, THOUGH.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:13.100
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TO CHINA
BEFORE,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.766
AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM
TO TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE--

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.933
THEY'VE ACTUALLY MET
WITH STUDENTS

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.400
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES
WHO'VE MADE THESE TRIPS BEFORE

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.766
AND HELPED BRIEF THEM IN TERMS
OF WHAT THEY SHOULD SEE,

00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:29.333
AND IT'S GONNA BE
A WONDERFUL EXCHANGE,

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.733
AND HOPEFULLY BECAUSE
OF THIS TRIP,

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:35.166
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO INVITE
SOME CHINESE STUDENTS

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.966
BACK TO THE UNITED STATES
AS WELL.

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.033
- THAT'S AMAZING.

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:39.866
YOUR DAUGHTERS--
HOW ARE THEY DOING?

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.266
I MEAN, THEY'RE GROWING UP
SO FAST,

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.566
EVERY TIME I SEE A PICTURE
OF THEM,

00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:45.766
AND FIRST OF ALL ANSWER
THAT QUESTION, PLEASE,

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:48.800
AND THEN I HAVE A COMMENT
ABOUT THE TATTOO THING

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.433
THAT YOU TOLD THEM.

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:53.433
- WELL, THEY ARE DOING
WONDERFULLY.

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:56.166
YOU KNOW, MALIA,
SHE TURNS 16 THIS SUMMER,

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:57.233
WHICH IS A LITTLE SCARY.

00:01:57.233 --> 00:02:00.933
- WOW.
- AND SASHA'S GONNA BE 13.

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:03.666
AND THEY'RE DOING GREAT
IN SCHOOL,

00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:05.200
AND THEY'RE SMART,
AND THEY'RE FUNNY,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.400
AND THEY'RE KIND,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.466
AND, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE ATHLETIC,

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.100
AND SO I REALLY HAVE
NO COMPLAINTS,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.166
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
THAT INCREASINGLY

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:16.066
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME
FOR ME.

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.400
YOU KNOW, I AM JUST--

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.733
I AM NOT THAT INTERESTING.

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:21.666
THEY'RE NICE ABOUT IT, THOUGH,
BECAUSE THEY STILL LOVE ME,

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:24.600
SO THEY'LL COME IN AND THEY'LL
PAT ME ON THE HEAD AND KISS ME,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.333
AND THEY'LL SAY, "OH, DADDY,
WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH,"

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.333
AND THEY'LL TALK TO ME
FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES,

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:32.966
AND THEN THEY'LL SAY, "WE'RE
GONNA BE GONE ALL WEEKEND."

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:34.133
- THEY'RE VERY BUSY.

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:35.733
- SO THAT'S MAKING ME
A LITTLE SAD.

00:02:35.733 --> 00:02:37.866
- WELL, AND I BET.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.766
LET ME MENTION THIS.

00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:40.800
I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYONE
HEARD THIS,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.900
BUT YOU MADE THE MOST AMAZING
COMMENT

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.533
ABOUT IF THEY WOULD EVER GET
A TATTOO,

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.433
AND I THINK EVERYONE
SHOULD STICK TO THIS RULE.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.633
IF YOUR DAUGHTERS GOT TATTOOS,

00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:53.333
THAT YOU AND MICHELLE WOULD
ALSO GET THE SAME TATTOO

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:56.333
IN THE SAME PLACE AND YOU'D
ALL TAKE A FAMILY PHOTO

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:57.733
OF ALL THE TATTOOS.

00:02:57.733 --> 00:02:59.800
- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.833
[cheers and applause]

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:09.200
WE WILL REDUCE THE COOL FACTOR
OF ANY TATTOO.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.033
MICHELLE AND I WILL BE
RIGHT THERE,

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:13.266
AND WE'LL POST IT

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:15.433
SO THAT EVERYBODY WILL BE ABLE
TO SEE IT,

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:19.166
AND WE'LL SAY, "WE ALL GOT
MATCHING TATTOOS."

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:22.166
AND I SUSPECT THAT WILL BE
A PRETTY GOOD DETERRENT

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:23.666
FOR BOTH MALIA AND SASHA.

00:03:23.666 --> 00:03:27.600
- I HATE TO SAY, BUT I HOPE
THEY GET TATTOOS.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.066
I REALLY DO.

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:32.266
- ELLEN, YOU SHOULD BE
A PART OF THIS.

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:35.133
YOU SHOULD PLEDGE TO ALSO
GET A TATTOO WITH US.

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:36.200
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.500
IF THAT HAPPENS, I WILL,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.233
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
I'M NOT INTO TATTOOS.

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:41.133
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:43.133
LET'S ALSO TALK ABOUT--
YOU WENT SHOPPING.

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:45.233
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU CAN DO THIS,

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:48.233
BUT YOU WENT TO A MALL AND YOU
SHOPPED AT A GAP RECENTLY,

00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:51.833
BECAUSE YOU WERE PHOTOGRAPHED
SO I KNOW IT'S TRUE.

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:53.300
- IT HAPPENED.
- IT HAPPENED.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.933
YOU WENT TO THE GAP,
AND YOU WENT SHOPPING.

00:03:55.933 --> 00:03:57.100
HOW DO YOU HAVE TIME--

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.000
- WELL, HERE--
HERE'S THE THING.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.766
WE WERE ON A TRIP TO NEW YORK,

00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:04.766
AND THE GAP ANNOUNCED THAT
THEY WERE GONNA MAKE SURE

00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:11.000
THAT ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES
AT LEAST GOT PAID $10 AN HOUR,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.566
SO THEY'RE INCREASING
THEIR WAGES

00:04:13.566 --> 00:04:16.466
FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:19.900
AND SINCE WE'VE BEEN SAYING
THAT AMERICA DESERVES A RAISE,

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.433
AND WE SHOULD PROVIDE A MINIMUM
WAGE OF AT LEAST $10.10 AN HOUR,

00:04:24.433 --> 00:04:26.233
I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT FOR ME

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:28.566
TO BE ABLE TO GO
FREQUENT A STORE

00:04:28.566 --> 00:04:30.566
THAT'S DOING RIGHT
BY THEIR EMPLOYEES.

00:04:30.566 --> 00:04:31.733
- GOOD FOR YOU.

00:04:31.733 --> 00:04:33.166
- I THOUGHT THAT WAS
REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:34.366
[cheers and applause]

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:36.466
- GOOD FOR YOU.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:38.166
THEY SOLD A LOT OF THOSE
SWEATERS THAT YOU BOUGHT.

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:40.566
I UNDERSTAND THOSE SWEATERS
THAT YOU BOUGHT SOLD OUT,

00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:42.266
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTED
TO WEAR THE SAME SWEATERS

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:44.700
THAT YOUR DAUGHTERS ARE WEARING.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.433
- WELL, I THOUGHT THEY WERE
PRETTY NICE SWEATERS,

00:04:47.433 --> 00:04:50.600
AND MALIA AND SASHA,
THEY DID NOT SCOWL

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.200
WHEN I BROUGHT THEM IN,
WHICH WAS A GOOD SIGN.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.966
I MEAN, THEY DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY
SAY, "EWW, THAT'S TERRIBLE."

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:00.433
- WELL, YOU HAVE A FAMILY
OF GOOD TASTE.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.400
- I HAVE NOT YET SEEN THEM
WEAR THEM,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.433
BUT I'M HOPING
THAT I MAKE THE CUT.

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:07.666
- WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM
WEAR THEM ALSO.
