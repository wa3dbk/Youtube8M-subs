00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello and today I bring you a video that 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.519
 I wanted to do for a long time and it's the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.360
 video that I carry in my bag and this is 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.000
 the bag that I am using 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.610
 currently I think they saw it in a 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.760
 video and if it did not come out it's going to come out 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.220
 which it is where I tell them where I bought 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.830
 this bag that has me fascinated and I 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.460
 love I love this bag and I 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.970
 I show you this teddy bear and bag 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.679
 it comes like this in the back it does not have 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.340
 nothing any pocket here 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.860
 does not bring his pieces to hook 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.899
 shot if you do not want to use it as it 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.149
 so in the part here brings an appointment and 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.550
 I show you everything I have in my 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.489
 bag if you want to stay until the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.160
 end of the video and let's start first 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.899
 is that I have here this part here where 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.270
 I can save the cell phone and that's 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.739
 division and another part here below 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.890
 then let's start with the first 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.700
 division that is where I have my 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.190
 cosmetics 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.090
 although the video hall saw that this 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.160
 bag brought this here I keep pieces of 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.310
 coins right now I do not have any 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.680
 because I always take it out here when 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.240
 unbuttoned this part I have a bit of 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.180
 cosmetics that are what I am 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.180
 using some that I left because I do not know 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.000
 they clean the bag and I have this 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.620
 blog that I like because sometimes 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.810
 I do not like to use lipstick only 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.930
 like to wear like a blog that's why 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.170
 I have this here in the bag I have 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.430
 also this blogs from milan which is the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.000
 romantic crowd 01 is this that I have it 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 in the bag because I was using it 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.140
 I also have my mix powder that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.270
 love to bring a powder to the wallet 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.300
 because if it's hot and that's why I 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.330
 I apply and as well as that took out that little glitter 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.380
 of the skin and I wear this lipstick too 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.439
 which is the one I'm wearing right now 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.829
 is this color is a beautiful used and it is 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.090
 the 90 7 c of wet and white why of 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.590
 if you want to play I love it 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.620
 take her to see what I'm using in the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.200
 moment in my bag then I bring a 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.880
 lip moisturizer in my bag never 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.940
 you can never miss a moisturizer 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.790
 lips and I wear this baby leaf that is not 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.040
 It has a name but it's football if I do not 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.910
 I'm wrong this rosita so I just 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.790
 It has what color 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.110
 It is quite natural if I join 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.460
 little on the lips when I tell you 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.360
 you apply but that stays pretty 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.060
 natural and I suffer from dry lips like that 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.100
 that I always have to have a gloss in 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.950
 the bag and the next one that carries the 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.290
 same that is this splash and victory's 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.940
 secret and I usually do not that something with 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.310
 this kind of thing because it seems like a 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.140
 little big but this I bought it as not 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.270
 I have no other splash that is small 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.880
 Well, what's in my bag and so far 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.770
 I have not gotten it smells super super good 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.740
 soft when I want to like that 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:07.490
 refresh me and that's why he applied this 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.320
 I also have a label that is the 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.110
 bag tag that I have not even 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.950
 taken out I also have my glasses that 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.620
 I always carry here are these and not only 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.040
 they are not brand lenses as well as that 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.890
 nothing buy them 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.719
 here and I like it when I do not when 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.060
 I have any type of makeup I like 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:29.069
 wear this type of glasses because I feel 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.189
 that you can wear a lipstick 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.930
 big lens and you do not need anything of 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.810
 eye makeup more for use well 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.599
 like that on Sunday another thing that I have 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.420
 in my bag is this this and what 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.430
 I bought here where where are you the process 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.829
 of cedulaciÃ³n were changing the 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.109
 cells this year and outside were watching 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.450
 this seems super practical to me 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.870
 like a year that did not use a wallet like that 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.889
 I put this where I put all my 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.049
 identifications card 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:01.019
 credit you fit two of each side two 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.310
 I have driver 's license card and the 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.859
 cedula blah blah 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.750
 another thing that I have to really in me 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.450
 this is like typical you can not miss 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.079
 and they are receipts as well as deposit 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.229
 of the bank is that I will always have many 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:19.440
 deposits in me in my cante thanks as 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.150
 that normal of me and now I have few 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.460
 because usually I really have a 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.729
 heap or recently that we take 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.350
 I have also the bag shot that this 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.539
 I never use but always leave the 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.569
 portfolio just in case I also have the 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:36.030
 keys of the house that I have from the 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:38.639
 car but now I do not have it because I do not 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.560
 my car boyfriend has it too 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.210
 I have these hearing aids that I can not 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.120
 leave without these headphones because when 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.789
 I want to listen to music or watch some video 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.729
 on my ipad or on my cell phone because I'm taking 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.039
 these hearing aids and finally I have 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.780
 this cover that can here I have the 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.349
 tail is like a bunny is 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.840
 pretty nice but as is the tail 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.449
 it bothers me sometimes what I do is that 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.110
 I have another one and I forgot to take out 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:09.300
 this one from my bag and I have the cell phone that 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.610
 this is the cover that I have that seems 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.270
 which has water droplets, but 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.449
 is the cover that is like this I have an iphone 5 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.340
 and that's the last thing I have in my bag 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.449
 and as I told you I do not have a purse 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.460
 for a while the money 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.690
 I usually throw it out like that 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.040
 portfolio of almost always I walk with 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.960
 cards I do not walk with 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.479
 cash 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.000
 before and when you do not finish vehicles for 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.500
 now this has not been all for the 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.199
