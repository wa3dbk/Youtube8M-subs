something that I needed to help to
realize<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.529> ambition<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.580> fact<00:00:17.850> it's

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
and so development began with this as

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.000 
and so development began with this as

many<00:00:55.829> isolated<00:00:56.699> islands<00:00:57.649> but<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:58.859> very

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
many isolated islands but it was very

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.639 
many isolated islands but it was very
hard<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> create<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.300> large<00:01:00.719> world<00:01:01.199> where

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
hard to create one large world where

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.359 
hard to create one large world where
everything<00:01:02.550> felt<00:01:02.760> connected<00:01:03.920> we<00:01:04.920> had<00:01:05.189> to

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
everything felt connected we had to

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.940 
everything felt connected we had to
design<00:01:05.549> small<00:01:06.270> bounded<00:01:07.020> areas<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:07.770> a

defined entrance and exit and putting
them<00:01:12.240> all<00:01:12.420> together<00:01:12.570> made<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.260> feel<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.740> you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
them all together made it feel like you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.130 
them all together made it feel like you
were<00:01:14.040> playing<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.670> large<00:01:14.939> world<00:01:15.240> well<00:01:15.689> he'd

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
were playing in a large world well he'd

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.660 
were playing in a large world well he'd
always<00:01:16.259> think<00:01:16.500> I'd<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.920> gonna<00:01:17.040> meet<00:01:17.189> anaconda

always think I'd I'm gonna meet anaconda

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.670 
always think I'd I'm gonna meet anaconda
but<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.210> still<00:01:18.600> couldn't<00:01:18.990> cut<00:01:19.259> through<00:01:19.290> the

such a vast field to explore as soon as
those<00:01:57.750> boundaries<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.350> removed<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:59.460> means

game begins the moment the player starts
to<00:02:08.069> think<00:02:08.280> about<00:02:08.550> where<00:02:08.819> they<00:02:08.970> want<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.270> go<00:02:09.330> how

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
to think about where they want to go how

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.130 
to think about where they want to go how
they<00:02:10.170> will<00:02:10.560> get

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
they will get

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.140 
they will get
and<00:02:11.470> what<00:02:11.980> they<00:02:12.130> will<00:02:12.310> do<00:02:12.520> when<00:02:12.730> they<00:02:12.850> arrive

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
and what they will do when they arrive

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.210 
and what they will do when they arrive
this<00:02:13.990> is<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.170> clean<00:02:14.590> break<00:02:14.890> from<00:02:14.950> the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
this is a clean break from the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.460 
this is a clean break from the
conventions<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:16.090> past<00:02:16.390> games<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.050> Zelda

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
conventions of past games and Zelda

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.559 
conventions of past games and Zelda
series<00:02:17.650> where<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.370> had<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.670> follow<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.240> set

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
series where you had to follow a set

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.050 
series where you had to follow a set
path<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.230> play<00:02:20.650> through<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.160> scenario<00:02:21.340> in

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
path and play through the scenario in

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.600 
path and play through the scenario in
the<00:02:22.330> right<00:02:22.510> order<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:23.260> believe<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.130> departure

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
the right order I believe this departure

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.580 
the right order I believe this departure
will<00:02:24.970> create<00:02:25.300> opportunities<00:02:26.080> for<00:02:26.110> new

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
will create opportunities for new

will create opportunities for new

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.420 
in previous Zelda games as you can see
and<00:02:31.930> as<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.590> know<00:02:32.770> from<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.100> Zelda<00:02:33.400> series

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
and as you know from the Zelda series

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.520 
and as you know from the Zelda series
the<00:02:34.030> world<00:02:34.300> in<00:02:34.480> these<00:02:34.630> games<00:02:34.930> can<00:02:35.080> be<00:02:35.200> quite

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
the world in these games can be quite

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.800 
the world in these games can be quite
peaceful<00:02:36.010> however<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.239> Zelda<00:02:37.780> game

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
peaceful however it is a Zelda game

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.900 
peaceful however it is a Zelda game
after<00:02:38.320> all<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:38.770> strong<00:02:39.250> enemies<00:02:39.700> will

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
after all so strong enemies will

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.880 
after all so strong enemies will
certainly<00:02:40.330> appear<00:02:40.840> even<00:02:41.350> in<00:02:41.470> this<00:02:41.620> setting

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
certainly appear even in this setting

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.920 
certainly appear even in this setting
powerful<00:02:42.790> enemies<00:02:43.180> appearing<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.720> such<00:02:43.900> a

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
powerful enemies appearing in such a

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.870 
powerful enemies appearing in such a
peaceful<00:02:44.290> world<00:02:44.680> is<00:02:45.040> one<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.489> defining

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
peaceful world is one of the defining

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.330 
peaceful world is one of the defining
features<00:02:46.480> of<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.780> Zelda<00:02:47.080> series<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.620> think

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
features of the Zelda series I think

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.820 
features of the Zelda series I think
that<00:02:48.610> while<00:02:49.360> convention<00:02:50.050> we<00:02:50.530> can<00:02:50.769> keep<00:02:51.010> right
