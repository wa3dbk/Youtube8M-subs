00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.900
 we have a window and it ends more or less 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.120
 Well, great the window and be inside 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.539
 of a bath then the situation with 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.309
 this window is that they are not offered 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.770
 as much privacy as then as 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.589
 need then then I'll 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.610
 I'm going to teach a very simple method very 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.040
 practical to be able 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:29.050
 to make it a little more private and that 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.000
 is that here this material is a frosting 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.420
 and what happens with this is that at 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.780
 apply it on the surface then we 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.990
 creates a relationship to translucent film 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.360
 a translucent layer that gives us good 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.410
 good privacy because all they 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.490
 I recommend that you do with these 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.530
 finishing materials them well 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.380
 obviously use a mask to 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.540
 be able to apply it in the area that is 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.550
 protected and have a good 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.530
 ventilation so the steam of this does not 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.820
 accumulates here what we are going to do 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.130
 very practical way is that we're going to 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.290
 put tape around this frame the 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.540
 framework that is here inside the 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.330
 glass and then we will apply 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.170
 this material once when they already want 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.170
 remove this base remove it with a 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.170
 solvent 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.700
 once you have the area covered 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.340
 what it does is to shake the material well 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.960
 we will apply it uniformly until 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.330
 give it a good finish to edit more or 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.649
 less anything in two layers so that 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.649
 there is a uniform surface 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.850
 or several layers of 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.659
 our material then we are going to give 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.950
 account that 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:04.039
 and it gives us a very texture 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.420
 translucent but opaque in other 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.629
 words forgiveness of that privacy that 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.250
 we need but it does not eliminate the amount 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.400
 of light that enters then I hope that 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.290
 this little video serves them a little 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.299
 to get an idea of ​​how to privatize 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.489
 let's say the herbs in our window 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:23.019
 around the house or in the office 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.019
 be very good and please follow us
