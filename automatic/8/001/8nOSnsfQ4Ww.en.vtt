these are like little domed pieces of

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.969 
these are like little domed pieces of
plastic

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
plastic

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.800 
plastic
and<00:02:11.250> they're<00:02:11.940> going<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.239> used<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.599> actually

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and they're going to be used to actually

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.869 
and they're going to be used to actually
raise<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.800> height<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.489> home<00:02:14.670> button

raise the height of the home button

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.820 
raise the height of the home button
because<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.450> glass<00:02:15.629> is<00:02:15.690> quite<00:02:16.170> sort<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.530> thick

because the glass is quite sort of thick

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.580 
because the glass is quite sort of thick
and<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.480> screen<00:02:18.750> protector<00:02:19.200> itself

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
and this is the screen protector itself

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.979 
and this is the screen protector itself
so<00:02:20.159> a<00:02:20.190> piece<00:02:20.489> of<00:02:20.519> actual<00:02:21.030> glass<00:02:21.269> is<00:02:21.780> going<00:02:21.930> to

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
so a piece of actual glass is going to

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.149 
so a piece of actual glass is going to
go<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.530> front<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.819> Samsung<00:02:24.239> Galaxy<00:02:24.269> s5

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.850 
says number one peeled off this film
before<00:02:30.120> installation<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.379> is<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.680> side

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
before installation so this is the side

before installation so this is the side
that's<00:02:32.040> going<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.280> go<00:02:32.370> face<00:02:32.730> down<00:02:32.760> on<00:02:33.299> the

we're<00:03:06.930> going<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.079> just<00:03:07.230> wait<00:03:07.440> for<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.799> to

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
we're going to just wait for that to

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.069 
we're going to just wait for that to
dissipate<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.430> little<00:03:08.700> bit<00:03:08.849> because<00:03:09.079> sometimes

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
dissipate a little bit because sometimes

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.319 
dissipate a little bit because sometimes
I<00:03:10.290> would<00:03:10.590> rewrite<00:03:11.069> it<00:03:11.280> with<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:12.209> it

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
I would rewrite it with this and it

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.050 
I would rewrite it with this and it
looks<00:03:12.480> like<00:03:12.599> I'm<00:03:12.780> going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.959> have<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.200> but

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
looks like I'm going to have to but

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.270 
looks like I'm going to have to but
wiping<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.150> with<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.480> cloth<00:03:15.750> afterwards<00:03:16.470> sort

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
wiping it with the cloth afterwards sort

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.309 
wiping it with the cloth afterwards sort
of<00:03:17.340> adds<00:03:17.549> dust<00:03:17.880> back<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.359> so<00:03:18.810> hopefully<00:03:19.230> I'm

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
of adds dust back in so hopefully I'm

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.770 
of adds dust back in so hopefully I'm
not<00:03:19.410> going<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.590> get<00:03:19.709> much<00:03:19.859> dust<00:03:20.250> on<00:03:20.579> here<00:03:21.480> it

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
not going to get much dust on here it

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.360 
not going to get much dust on here it
looks<00:03:21.959> pretty<00:03:22.349> good<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.980> looks<00:03:23.160> like<00:03:23.250> it

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
looks pretty good that looks like it

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.099 
looks pretty good that looks like it
hasn't<00:03:23.579> got<00:03:23.760> any<00:03:24.000> dust<00:03:24.389> speckles<00:03:24.780> on<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.019> at

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
hasn't got any dust speckles on it at

and we're going to remove number one and

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.830 
and we're going to remove number one and
then<00:03:31.859> we're<00:03:32.069> going<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.340> line<00:03:32.669> this<00:03:32.880> up<00:03:32.940> we're

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
then we're going to line this up we're

then we're going to line this up we're
going<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.019> turn<00:03:34.230> this<00:03:34.410> round<00:03:34.769> because<00:03:34.950> we<00:03:35.190> had

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
going to turn this round because we had

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.819 
going to turn this round because we had
it<00:03:35.400> upside<00:03:35.519> down<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:36.120> just<00:03:36.180> lay<00:03:36.840> this<00:03:37.109> on<00:03:37.410> top

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
it upside down and just lay this on top

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.530 
it upside down and just lay this on top
of<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.310> smartphones<00:03:38.849> get<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.150> lined<00:03:39.329> up

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
of the smartphones get it lined up

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.780 
of the smartphones get it lined up
properly<00:03:39.750> we're<00:03:40.139> using<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.440> home<00:03:40.739> button<00:03:41.040> to

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
properly we're using the home button to

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.300 
properly we're using the home button to
actually<00:03:42.120> do<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.480> lining<00:03:42.870> up<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.319> then<00:03:44.130> once

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
actually do the lining up and then once

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.530 
actually do the lining up and then once
it's<00:03:44.519> in<00:03:44.639> place<00:03:44.669> we're<00:03:45.060> just<00:03:45.209> going<00:03:45.329> to<00:03:45.389> push

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
it's in place we're just going to push

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.620 
it's in place we're just going to push
it<00:03:45.660> down<00:03:46.069> like<00:03:47.069> so<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:47.790> we're<00:03:47.910> just<00:03:47.940> leaving<00:03:48.329> it

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
it down like so so we're just leaving it

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.449 
it down like so so we're just leaving it
to<00:03:48.870> actually<00:03:49.169> do<00:03:49.620> its<00:03:49.799> business<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.310> as<00:03:50.400> you

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
to actually do its business and as you

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.569 
to actually do its business and as you
can<00:03:50.609> see<00:03:50.639> here<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.900> can<00:03:52.049> see<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:53.400> bubbles

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
can see here you can see the bubbles

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.099 
can see here you can see the bubbles
coming<00:03:54.030> out<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:54.450> it's<00:03:54.569> actually<00:03:54.870> sort<00:03:55.019> of

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
coming out so it's actually sort of

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.619 
coming out so it's actually sort of
adhering<00:03:55.709> itself<00:03:56.129> to<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.669> smartphone<00:03:57.060> screen

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
adhering itself to the smartphone screen

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.569 
adhering itself to the smartphone screen
and<00:03:58.290> look<00:03:58.440> at<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:58.980> has<00:03:59.099> gone<00:03:59.310> in

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
and look at that that has gone in

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.750 
and look at that that has gone in
without<00:04:00.389> any<00:04:00.870> bubbles<00:04:01.470> on<00:04:01.739> at<00:04:01.919> all<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.609> is

fantastic<00:04:03.379> so<00:04:04.379> just<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.680> make<00:04:04.799> sure<00:04:04.829> it's

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
fantastic so just to make sure it's

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.559 
fantastic so just to make sure it's
pushed<00:04:05.340> down<00:04:05.549> properly<00:04:05.879> we're<00:04:06.090> going<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.269> grab

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
pushed down properly we're going to grab

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.240 
pushed down properly we're going to grab

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.920 
off and look at that that is it that's
the<00:04:22.380> installation<00:04:23.039> done<00:04:23.250> very<00:04:24.120> very

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
the installation done very very

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.409 
the installation done very very
that<00:04:25.500> is<00:04:25.620> absolutely<00:04:26.100> superb<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:27.060> let's<00:04:27.210> just

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
that is absolutely superb so let's just

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.900 
that is absolutely superb so let's just
unlock<00:04:28.169> this<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:29.130> we're<00:04:29.250> just<00:04:29.340> going<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.639> use

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
unlock this and we're just going to use

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.480 
unlock this and we're just going to use
the<00:04:29.940> fingerprint<00:04:30.539> sensor<00:04:30.960> no<00:04:31.800> problem<00:04:32.220> at<00:04:32.310> all

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
the fingerprint sensor no problem at all

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.760 
the fingerprint sensor no problem at all
using<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:32.970> fingerprint<00:04:33.389> sensor<00:04:33.810> I<00:04:33.990> don't<00:04:34.410> see

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
using the fingerprint sensor I don't see

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.260 
using the fingerprint sensor I don't see
that<00:04:35.039> you<00:04:35.130> need<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.520> put<00:04:35.669> these<00:04:35.820> little<00:04:35.970> down

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
that you need to put these little down

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.520 
that you need to put these little down
bits<00:04:36.539> on<00:04:36.720> because<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.020> worked<00:04:37.229> absolutely

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
bits on because it worked absolutely

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.340 
bits on because it worked absolutely
fine<00:04:38.070> without<00:04:38.729> that<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:39.389> look<00:04:39.720> at<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:39.990> we

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
fine without that and look at that we

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.370 
fine without that and look at that we
have<00:04:40.590> now<00:04:40.800> got<00:04:41.160> a<00:04:41.430> sheet<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.090> glass<00:04:42.380> protecting

screen protector but it is a nice nice
finish<00:04:52.889> to<00:04:52.919> this<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:53.550> now<00:04:54.090> I've<00:04:54.210> got<00:04:54.330> peace<00:04:54.539> of

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
finish to this and now I've got peace of

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.810 
finish to this and now I've got peace of
mind<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.259> if<00:04:55.710> something<00:04:55.949> hits<00:04:56.190> this<00:04:56.460> hard

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
mind that if something hits this hard

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.240 
mind that if something hits this hard
it's<00:04:57.389> more<00:04:57.660> than<00:04:57.720> likely<00:04:57.900> going<00:04:58.380> to<00:04:58.440> crack<00:04:58.889> the

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
it's more than likely going to crack the

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.879 
it's more than likely going to crack the
anchor<00:04:59.849> glass<00:05:00.389> screen<00:05:00.930> protector<00:05:01.410> instead<00:05:01.800> of

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
anchor glass screen protector instead of

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.219 
anchor glass screen protector instead of
cracking<00:05:02.280> in<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.460> Samsung<00:05:02.849> Galaxy<00:05:02.880> s5<00:05:03.750> screen

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
cracking in the Samsung Galaxy s5 screen

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.100 
cracking in the Samsung Galaxy s5 screen
so<00:05:05.070> now<00:05:05.280> we<00:05:05.340> look<00:05:05.669> at<00:05:05.849> the<00:05:06.150> S<00:05:06.389> view<00:05:06.660> cover<00:05:06.720> this

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
so now we look at the S view cover this

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.249 
so now we look at the S view cover this
is<00:05:07.289> an<00:05:07.380> official<00:05:07.949> case<00:05:08.220> from<00:05:08.729> Samsung<00:05:09.389> and<00:05:09.570> its

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
is an official case from Samsung and its
