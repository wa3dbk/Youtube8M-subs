quite a bit in the wall and at the end
of<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> Second<00:00:40.800> World<00:00:40.860> War<00:00:41.100> they<00:00:41.489> found<00:00:42.170> there

from the scottish english reader and

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.920 
from the scottish english reader and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.049 
yeah so they had to be very careful
about<00:00:55.110> how<00:00:55.320> they<00:00:55.559> kind<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.129> reentered<00:00:56.879> them

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
yeah and so they kind of kind of not

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.930 
yeah and so they kind of kind of not
easy<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.199> come<00:01:01.410> by<00:01:01.440> nowadays<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.309> mean<00:01:02.670> they
