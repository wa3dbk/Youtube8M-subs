 true another one of the functions of windows 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:40.969
 8.1 is that we can go directly to 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.379
 desk when I charge windows we can 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.939
 go directly to the desktop without 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.829
 need to go through the screen of 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.420
 start on this screen those who do not 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.430

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.050
 good windows 8 points brings us this 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.830
 new modality 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.810
 so that windows 8.1 value we undertake 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.700
 the computer directly loads the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.210
 desk so easy we have to 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.960
 go to the taskbar properties 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.280
 this appears 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.280
 the dialog box now 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.420
 we are going to lend navigation and here 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.940
 there is a function that turns the 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.050
 desktop instead of startup when starting 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.210
 balloon session we will be this option 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.460
 we are to apply accept and when 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.750
 you restart automatically 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.400
 windows 8 will go to the screen of and will go 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.240
 directly to the desktop without going through 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.240
 the start screen 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.020
 another of the new functionalities of 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.990
 windows 8 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.260
 is that now we can resize the 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.000
 metro appearance pictures 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.549
 for example if here on the desk 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.110
 we want to mention it as you will see here 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.080
 I have transitions 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.960
 of my images 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.970
 the pictures are resized 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.820
 because we are going to go to the new functions 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.280
 that brings windows 8 1.1 in relation to 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.380
 the images here for example in the 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.780
 metro box in this application the 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.960
 I love want desktop 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.710
 to render 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.570
 let's change the size of our 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.360
 picture we can put it medium not the 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.320
 it gets medium if we want to change the 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.350
 small size as it puts an icon 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.020
 it's practically too small 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.950
 if we want to handle how big it puts us 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.530
 pretty big 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.009
 these are the functions that there are also 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:44.039
 windows windows 8.1 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:44.039
 let's give it more width 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.360
 good another of the new functionalities 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.909
 who have a 28.1 is that now 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.699
 we can edit images directly 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:59.280
 from windows without needing to open 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:01.590
 no other program for example if 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.610
 we want here you can give an example 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.610
 we will enter 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.390
 to 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.960
 folder of images by means of it in 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.270
 this application we are going to photos 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.370
 he sends us here first obviously 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.860
 these are the images that I have 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.569
 installed in my images folder 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:27.599
 As you can see, there are only 368 images 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:31.750
 good but here we can edit the 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:34.490

 Several functions appear with which 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.699
 we can do from working with this 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.800
 image if we want to cut 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:58.240
 this image good since windows 8 without 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.400
 need to edit them with another program 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.289
 we can work we are going to cut this 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.460
 image from windows 8 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.390
 we give you cut 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.510

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.969
 we are going to draw only people 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.969
 from the center 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:36.169
 if we want to apply and 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.169
 obviously 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.409
 we have 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.419
 we give ourselves a copy and we have the 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.639
 new aspect of the image that we edit 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:52.289
 from windows 8 these are some of the 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:52.289
 new features of windows 8.1 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.820
 here we have another image we left 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.370
 we return to the desk 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.710
 we close our image application of 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.710
