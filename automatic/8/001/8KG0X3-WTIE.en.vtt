better a little more naturally looking

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.230 
better a little more naturally looking
like<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.130> minute<00:01:42.490> I<00:01:42.520> think<00:01:42.759> he's<00:01:42.880> got<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.090> help

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
like a minute I think he's got to help

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.699 
like a minute I think he's got to help
you<00:01:43.299> catch<00:01:43.479> more<00:01:43.690> fish<00:01:43.899> exactly<00:01:44.649> exactly

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
you catch more fish exactly exactly

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:46.859 
you catch more fish exactly exactly
exactly<00:01:45.220> right<00:01:45.880> because<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.539> thing<00:01:46.720> is<00:01:46.750> that

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
exactly right because the thing is that

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.789 
exactly right because the thing is that
in<00:01:47.350> Japan<00:01:47.679> you<00:01:47.709> know<00:01:48.100> how<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.869> lake<00:01:50.049> of<00:01:50.080> really

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
in Japan you know how the lake of really

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.510 
in Japan you know how the lake of really
oppression<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.600> they<00:01:52.600> know<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.369> any

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
oppression and they know that so any

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.070 
oppression and they know that so any
kind<00:01:54.700> of<00:01:54.789> bait<00:01:55.030> if<00:01:55.209> it<00:01:55.330> doesn't<00:01:55.630> look<00:01:55.750> real

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
kind of bait if it doesn't look real

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.039 
kind of bait if it doesn't look real
enough<00:01:56.940> you<00:01:57.940> know<00:01:58.060> they<00:01:58.209> won't<00:01:58.390> say<00:01:58.720> what<00:01:58.899> they

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
enough you know they won't say what they

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.080 
enough you know they won't say what they
won't<00:01:59.229> bite<00:01:59.409> at<00:01:59.619> it<00:01:59.709> so<00:02:00.340> we<00:02:00.580> have<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:00.909> basically

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
won't bite at it so we have to basically

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.040 
won't bite at it so we have to basically
design<00:02:01.689> so<00:02:02.350> close<00:02:02.679> to<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:03.369> real<00:02:03.729> fish<00:02:04.179> and<00:02:04.599> you

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
design so close to a real fish and you

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.740 
design so close to a real fish and you
can't<00:02:05.289> get<00:02:05.470> closer<00:02:05.890> than<00:02:06.039> this<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:07.420> can<00:02:07.569> see

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
can't get closer than this you can see

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.960 
can't get closer than this you can see
it<00:02:07.899> with<00:02:08.379> there's<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.739> know<00:02:08.769> trying<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.819> hold

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
it with there's you know trying to hold

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
it with there's you know trying to hold
it<00:02:10.119> steady<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.629> can't<00:02:10.929> convert

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
it steady and can't convert

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.840 
it steady and can't convert
you<00:02:12.110> know<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.350> tail<00:02:12.560> starts<00:02:12.860> wiggling<00:02:13.220> that's

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
you know the tail starts wiggling that's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.580 
you know the tail starts wiggling that's
thing<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.270> know<00:02:14.360> that's<00:02:14.540> me<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.440> whole

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
thing you know that's me the whole
