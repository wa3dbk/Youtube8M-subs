something quite remarkable the heart

something quite remarkable the heart

seems to be connected to a type of

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.450 
seems to be connected to a type of
intuition<00:05:37.080> that<00:05:37.590> is<00:05:37.710> not<00:05:37.889> bound<00:05:38.220> by<00:05:38.370> the

but<00:05:40.740> what<00:05:40.889> is<00:05:41.039> that<00:05:41.070> source<00:05:41.550> of<00:05:41.669> intuition<00:05:42.030> and

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
but what is that source of intuition and

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.050 
but what is that source of intuition and
how<00:05:42.539> can<00:05:42.599> we<00:05:42.870> learn<00:05:43.110> to<00:05:43.349> tap<00:05:43.560> into<00:05:43.800> more

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:58.540 

what<00:05:47.510> is<00:05:47.750> wrong<00:05:47.990> with<00:05:48.230> you<00:05:48.410> you<00:05:48.680> bet
