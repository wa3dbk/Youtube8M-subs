a<00:00:48.450> dime<00:00:48.750> right<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.710> mean<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> may<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:50.610> huge

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
a dime right I mean I may have huge

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.729 
a dime right I mean I may have huge
fingers<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.539> let's<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:51.930> ridiculous<00:00:52.079> these

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
fingers but let's get ridiculous these

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.439 
fingers but let's get ridiculous these
are<00:00:52.860> nuts<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.280> bolts<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.820> stuff<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.390> that

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
are nuts and bolts and stuff like that

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.010 
are nuts and bolts and stuff like that
so<00:00:54.890> I've<00:00:55.890> discovered<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.239> don't<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.570> too

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
so I've discovered that I don't have too

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.189 
so I've discovered that I don't have too
much<00:00:58.289> trouble<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.879> say<00:00:59.910> even<00:01:00.870> with<00:01:00.989> my

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
much trouble that is to say even with my

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.380 
much trouble that is to say even with my
huge<00:01:01.500> fingers<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.100> are<00:01:02.129> slick<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:02.789> plastic

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
huge fingers that are slick with plastic

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.190 
huge fingers that are slick with plastic
glue<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.229> manage<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.860> screw<00:01:05.610> together<00:01:06.200> I'd

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
glue I can manage to screw together I'd

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.490 
glue I can manage to screw together I'd
screw<00:01:07.950> into<00:01:08.310> something<00:01:09.060> by<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.720> doing<00:01:10.170> that

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
screw into something by just doing that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.399 
screw into something by just doing that
that's<00:01:11.340> pretty<00:01:11.610> easy<00:01:11.670> getting<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.720> nut<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.020> here

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
that's pretty easy getting a nut on here

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.880 
that's pretty easy getting a nut on here
is<00:01:13.530> another<00:01:13.830> question<00:01:14.250> all<00:01:14.909> together<00:01:15.330> and

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
is another question all together and

this<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.770> always<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.460> big<00:01:59.640> problem<00:02:00.680> trying<00:02:01.680> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
this is always the big problem trying to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.280 
this is always the big problem trying to
keep<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.310> nut<00:02:02.490> against<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.270> end<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.079> bolt

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
keep the nut against the end of the bolt

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.150 
keep the nut against the end of the bolt
and<00:02:05.750> flat<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.680> get<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> bolt

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
and flat so that you can get the bolt

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160 
and flat so that you can get the bolt
started<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.789> these<00:02:08.970> tiny<00:02:09.270> things

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
started in these tiny things

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.130 
started in these tiny things
and<00:02:10.289> there<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.430> okay<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.569> hooked<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.020> up

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
and there it is okay so you hooked it up

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.800 
and there it is okay so you hooked it up
like<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.770> can<00:02:13.890> use<00:02:14.069> variations<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:15.060> this

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
like that you can use variations of this

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.800 
like that you can use variations of this
thing<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:17.069> hold<00:02:17.370> screws<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.180> all<00:02:18.599> these<00:02:18.750> other

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
thing to hold screws and all these other

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.320 
thing to hold screws and all these other
