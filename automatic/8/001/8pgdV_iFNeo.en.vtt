00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:05.589
 Well 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.350
 Minute and welcome this time to a very special one 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.629
 Video is already on the title 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.879
 and of course now on the picture I have the Pets 2 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.419
 in the many important at Thun 3g variant 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.460
 yes the first model is 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.800
 Practice really expensive now 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.230
 and to allow the iPad to box on the side so below you see that Apple 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.019
 Sign left one page 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.510
 the horse stops 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.670
 No Dr the old writing then again the apple logo and another stalemate 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.700
 on the back looks because here again important contributions ever fell 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.560
 product specifications 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.240
 and the whole thing meets shortly 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.750
 To start right now the whole thing a stalemate is stupid 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.530
 with the plastic together 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.380
 I think you have already other others a stalemate on Boxes Gesine right 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.800
 wanted to show such a simple and mean and iPad are still I saw something 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.330
 special 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.080
 do you have these then 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.840
 You can easily peel off the protective film which is what happens now 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.640
 do 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.290
 Premium installation 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.990
 it really is 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.240
 because I have to describe all in it is iPad 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.290
 what to do but have to 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.980
 for the girls sit upstairs 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.030
 we can from the packaging 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.920
 the internet serves to simplify many of the good ones i need now though 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.290
 Not 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.510
 Insert drum roll 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.020
 Therefore, the iPad in the packaging are beautiful 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.010
 still wrapped in this plastic 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.300
 I just take it all out so easily 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.900
 it's really damn sounding and also damn easy one thinks of 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.470
 sunken as what light it has me imagined 'in it is still the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.890
 beautiful packaging with the serious ones "That can and things in it the numbers per 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.610
 Californians exercise 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.400
 there is still the usb cable that is included but that should not be clear 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.310
 his 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.469
 and precisely of course speculator was off 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.550
 yes from Merkel 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.740
 Pacar 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.020
 that's nonsense all that you can do there then you can add other adapters 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.890
 nice tradition many an evening Macs parts buy 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.380
 There is now relatively difficult to take even the apartment building is again 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.979
 heavy 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:19.360
 give to continue to 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.039
 No, a stalemate 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.169
 Now you just have to lash out this one and plastic one of these 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.379
 pull up 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.819
 that is, for example, with sculptures and were already beautiful 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.589
 Aluminum back and 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.930
 is really nice to touch 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.239
 so the feeling it really would be very expensive 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.949
 to hold the iPad in your hand 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:44.439
 thats always something nice here offers companies on the back more or 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.829
 less due to the focus is down 64 Tiger again 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.389
 In order to compulsory you see then Tobor normal this black bar for that 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.110
 advised them to do so 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.790
 and then just directly into the camera held with the ipad2 so only at most 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.219
 it is much more outside me now 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.219
 there as well as the FaceTime camera on the front 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.980
 yes, a stalemate then what the first 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.029
 but what are so what the train I was there is just the power plug 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:14.879
 the percent too late but he sees it here again 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.670
 the power plug and I would like to show you just now what in 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.889
 this little package there is more in it f 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.729
 so that's pretty easy to use this tool for the ZIM Chancellor 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:26.989
 his micro belongs to Niederrhein 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.279
 and then, of course, these are all 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:30.459
 Standard stuff 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.459
 iPads and then a quick guide 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:36.679
 we are looking forward to it 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:40.389
 then there is another short tutorial in English by year 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.959
 after the game 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.279
 Insurance and the typical Eckels the k 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.649
 they are also known very often here 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:54.459
 now the iPad again I have to go back to this test in Cape Town 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.679
 back this is looking afloat headshot 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:59.019
 he is on the left side of the iPad 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.480
 similar to the iPhone 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.969
 which is on the right side 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.319
 yes and the growth in boxing i really hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.059
 Dr I'm very excited to do something with the iPad 2 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.900
 really great time I can still Alpert lie down for comparison 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.799
 and that it should have been who really cool if the covenant now 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.080
 commented on and I'm out and see you next time
