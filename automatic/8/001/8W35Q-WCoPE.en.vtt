drop shotting in bullet spread so I

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.939 
drop shotting in bullet spread so I
wanted<00:00:19.849> to<00:00:20.029> run<00:00:20.300> some<00:00:20.660> tests<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:21.259> just<00:00:21.740> see

wanted to run some tests and just see

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.759 
wanted to run some tests and just see
you<00:00:22.640> know<00:00:22.789> I<00:00:23.090> guess<00:00:23.810> that<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.259> mention<00:00:24.619> was

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
you know I guess that the mention was

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.259 
you know I guess that the mention was
that<00:00:24.800> hey<00:00:25.310> spider<00:00:25.640> but<00:00:25.789> you<00:00:25.910> know<00:00:26.000> when<00:00:26.150> your

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
that hey spider but you know when your

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.189 
that hey spider but you know when your
drop<00:00:26.480> shotting<00:00:26.810> your<00:00:27.140> bullet<00:00:27.439> spread<00:00:27.679> is

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
drop shotting your bullet spread is

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.450 
drop shotting your bullet spread is
going<00:00:30.199> to<00:00:30.349> be<00:00:30.500> like<00:00:30.740> while<00:00:30.980> your<00:00:31.160> drop

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
going to be like while your drop

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.090 
going to be like while your drop
shotting<00:00:31.759> is<00:00:32.570> going<00:00:32.989> to<00:00:33.080> be<00:00:33.199> similar<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:33.739> what

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
shotting is going to be similar to what

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.979 
shotting is going to be similar to what
your<00:00:34.220> bullet<00:00:34.460> spread<00:00:34.640> would<00:00:34.879> be<00:00:35.059> as<00:00:35.300> if<00:00:35.360> you

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
your bullet spread would be as if you

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.680 
your bullet spread would be as if you
were<00:00:36.470> firing<00:00:36.890> from<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.250> hip<00:00:37.390> so<00:00:38.390> I've<00:00:38.510> never

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
were firing from the hip so I've never

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.689 
were firing from the hip so I've never
actually<00:00:38.960> completed<00:00:39.650> a<00:00:39.710> full<00:00:39.860> analysis<00:00:40.430> of

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
actually completed a full analysis of

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.430 
actually completed a full analysis of
the<00:00:40.940> impact<00:00:40.970> of<00:00:41.479> drop<00:00:41.750> shotting<00:00:41.989> I<00:00:42.170> mean<00:00:42.320> it's

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
the impact of drop shotting I mean it's

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.289 
the impact of drop shotting I mean it's
just<00:00:42.500> something<00:00:42.920> that<00:00:42.949> I<00:00:43.070> started<00:00:43.369> playing

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:44.299 
just something that I started playing

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.299 
just something that I started playing
with<00:00:44.540> or<00:00:44.780> toying<00:00:45.019> with<00:00:45.229> in<00:00:45.470> modern<00:00:46.010> warfare<00:00:46.159> 3

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
with or toying with in modern warfare 3

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.780 
with or toying with in modern warfare 3
and<00:00:46.850> you<00:00:47.479> know<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.750> part<00:00:48.530> of<00:00:48.619> it<00:00:48.739> that<00:00:48.790> makes

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
and you know the part of it that makes

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.369 
and you know the part of it that makes
it<00:00:49.970> effective<00:00:50.360> is<00:00:50.540> you're<00:00:50.750> messing<00:00:51.170> up<00:00:51.260> the

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
it effective is you're messing up the

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.079 
it effective is you're messing up the
other<00:00:51.500> player<00:00:51.739> it's<00:00:51.890> not<00:00:52.040> that<00:00:52.250> you<00:00:52.820> know<00:00:52.879> your

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
other player it's not that you know your

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.079 
other player it's not that you know your
accuracy<00:00:53.510> is<00:00:53.839> great<00:00:54.140> or<00:00:54.409> you<00:00:55.159> know<00:00:55.189> while<00:00:55.850> your

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
accuracy is great or you know while your

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.329 
accuracy is great or you know while your
drop<00:00:56.390> shotting<00:00:56.689> but<00:00:57.559> it's<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.979> fact<00:00:58.189> that

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
drop shotting but it's the fact that

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.729 
drop shotting but it's the fact that
you're<00:00:58.640> creating<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.839> know<00:00:59.869> changing<00:01:00.439> the

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
you're creating you know changing the

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.340 
you're creating you know changing the
target<00:01:01.159> area<00:01:01.369> for<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.210> enemy<00:01:02.570> player<00:01:02.809> as<00:01:03.080> well

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
target area for the enemy player as well

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.590 
target area for the enemy player as well
as<00:01:03.650> moving<00:01:04.280> it<00:01:04.549> and<00:01:04.729> in<00:01:04.879> creating<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.269> smaller

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
as moving it and in creating a smaller

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.200 
as moving it and in creating a smaller
target<00:01:05.900> area<00:01:06.350> for<00:01:06.950> your<00:01:07.100> opponent<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:07.970> here

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
target area for your opponent so here

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.340 
target area for your opponent so here
I'm<00:01:08.360> just<00:01:08.600> running<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.530> 70<00:01:09.950> for<00:01:10.159> you<00:01:10.400> and<00:01:11.350> that

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
I'm just running the 70 for you and that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.810 
I'm just running the 70 for you and that
was<00:01:12.500> just<00:01:12.650> a<00:01:12.800> little<00:01:13.070> demonstration<00:01:13.280> of<00:01:13.670> hip

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
was just a little demonstration of hip

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.730 
was just a little demonstration of hip
fire<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:14.540> now<00:01:14.720> I'm<00:01:14.900> going<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.290> actually<00:01:15.470> do

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
fire and so now I'm going to actually do

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.250 
fire and so now I'm going to actually do
a<00:01:15.770> drop<00:01:16.070> shot<00:01:16.310> from<00:01:17.150> standing<00:01:17.570> position<00:01:18.050> and

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
a drop shot from standing position and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.760 
a drop shot from standing position and
you<00:01:18.560> can<00:01:18.740> see<00:01:19.010> that<00:01:19.310> there<00:01:20.300> is<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.960> bit<00:01:21.530> more

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
you can see that there is a bit more

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.649 
you can see that there is a bit more
bullet<00:01:22.280> spread<00:01:23.740> slightly<00:01:24.740> then<00:01:25.400> when<00:01:26.270> I'm<00:01:26.390> ad

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
bullet spread slightly then when I'm ad

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.980 
bullet spread slightly then when I'm ad
essing<00:01:27.200> as<00:01:27.740> I'm<00:01:28.070> standing<00:01:28.880> up<00:01:29.030> as<00:01:29.300> well<00:01:29.780> as

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
essing as I'm standing up as well as

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.310 
essing as I'm standing up as well as
when<00:01:30.290> I'm<00:01:30.440> prone<00:01:30.770> kind<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.159> failed<00:01:31.340> their<00:01:31.520> Iran

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
when I'm prone kind of failed their Iran

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.620 
when I'm prone kind of failed their Iran
I'm<00:01:33.320> not<00:01:33.500> in<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.740> very<00:01:33.890> good<00:01:34.010> position<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:35.480> do

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
I'm not in a very good position to to do

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.740 
I'm not in a very good position to to do
the<00:01:35.870> the<00:01:36.260> drop<00:01:36.500> shot<00:01:36.710> but<00:01:37.430> there<00:01:38.240> there<00:01:38.600> is<00:01:38.720> a

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
the the drop shot but there there is a

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.490 
the the drop shot but there there is a
slight<00:01:39.170> variation<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.570> bullet<00:01:41.870> spread<00:01:42.140> as

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
slight variation to the bullet spread as

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.830 
slight variation to the bullet spread as
you're<00:01:43.100> actually<00:01:43.370> going<00:01:43.850> from<00:01:44.360> standing

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
you're actually going from standing

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.420 
you're actually going from standing
position<00:01:45.290> to<00:01:45.440> prone<00:01:45.650> position<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.280> would

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
position to prone position and you would

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.040 
position to prone position and you would
expect<00:01:46.760> that<00:01:46.880> right<00:01:47.240> i<00:01:47.390> mean<00:01:47.450> that's<00:01:47.780> that's

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
expect that right i mean that's that's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.050 
expect that right i mean that's that's
kind<00:01:48.620> of<00:01:48.650> an<00:01:48.770> expectation<00:01:49.070> i<00:01:49.520> would<00:01:49.670> have<00:01:49.850> so

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
kind of an expectation i would have so

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.000 
kind of an expectation i would have so
here<00:01:50.270> we<00:01:50.360> go<00:01:50.390> again<00:01:50.600> there's<00:01:51.409> actually<00:01:51.799> not<00:01:51.950> a

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
here we go again there's actually not a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.160 
here we go again there's actually not a
whole<00:01:52.310> lot<00:01:52.490> of<00:01:52.640> time<00:01:52.880> where<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.450> do<00:01:53.630> have<00:01:53.659> that

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
whole lot of time where you do have that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.289 
whole lot of time where you do have that
slight<00:01:54.710> increase<00:01:55.250> in<00:01:55.280> bullet<00:01:55.820> spread<00:01:56.030> as

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
slight increase in bullet spread as

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.640 
slight increase in bullet spread as
you're<00:01:56.960> dropping<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.409> prone<00:01:57.620> position

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
you're dropping to the prone position

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.080 
you're dropping to the prone position
and<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.370> mean<00:01:58.520> depending<00:01:58.790> on<00:01:58.909> what<00:01:59.000> you're

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
and I mean depending on what you're

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.250 
and I mean depending on what you're
running<00:01:59.180> if<00:01:59.390> you're<00:01:59.510> running<00:01:59.600> rapid<00:02:00.049> fire

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
running if you're running rapid fire

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.080 
running if you're running rapid fire
then<00:02:00.830> yes<00:02:01.100> you're<00:02:01.310> going<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.520> see<00:02:01.700> more

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
then yes you're going to see more

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.719 
then yes you're going to see more
bullets<00:02:02.479> in<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:02.750> in<00:02:03.409> that<00:02:03.470> middle<00:02:04.159> area<00:02:04.430> as

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
bullets in that in that middle area as

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.340 
bullets in that in that middle area as
you're<00:02:04.940> dropping<00:02:05.330> down<00:02:05.479> obviously<00:02:06.110> because

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
you're dropping down obviously because

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.859 
you're dropping down obviously because
you're<00:02:06.560> firing<00:02:06.799> more<00:02:07.130> bullets<00:02:07.629> so<00:02:08.629> that's

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
you're firing more bullets so that's

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.839 
you're firing more bullets so that's
that's<00:02:09.170> black<00:02:09.649> ops<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.069> I<00:02:10.099> definitely<00:02:10.489> wanted

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
that's black ops so I definitely wanted

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.750 
that's black ops so I definitely wanted
to<00:02:10.909> go<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.090> black<00:02:11.330> ops<00:02:11.599> and<00:02:12.440> test<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.250> out<00:02:13.280> and

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
to go to black ops and test that out and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.880 
to go to black ops and test that out and
I<00:02:14.030> actually<00:02:14.299> I<00:02:14.569> want<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.319> switch<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.650> up<00:02:15.709> as

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
I actually I want to switch it up as

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.269 
I actually I want to switch it up as
well<00:02:16.069> I'm<00:02:16.370> going<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.879> change<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.629> an<00:02:18.290> ak-47

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:19.279 
well I'm going to change to an ak-47

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.820 
well I'm going to change to an ak-47
here<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.549> second<00:02:19.909> and<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:21.049> is<00:02:21.260> just<00:02:21.290> too

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
here in a second and this is just too

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.560 
here in a second and this is just too
to<00:02:22.280> show<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.490> little<00:02:22.700> bit<00:02:22.850> of<00:02:22.880> variation<00:02:23.180> with

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
to show a little bit of variation with

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.210 
to show a little bit of variation with
it<00:02:23.750> with<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:23.960> weapons<00:02:24.350> some<00:02:24.860> firing<00:02:25.160> a

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
it with the weapons some firing a

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
silenced AK 47 and again you can see

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.950 
silenced AK 47 and again you can see
that<00:02:27.770> there<00:02:28.490> is<00:02:28.520> that<00:02:28.940> slight<00:02:29.300> bullet<00:02:29.630> spread

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
that there is that slight bullet spread

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.370 
that there is that slight bullet spread
again<00:02:30.770> dropping<00:02:31.100> from<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:32.690> standing

position to the prone position and

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.910 
position to the prone position and
you're<00:02:35.180> going<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.330> see<00:02:35.600> I'm<00:02:35.930> going<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.560> switch

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
you're going to see I'm going to switch

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.490 
you're going to see I'm going to switch
over<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.250> modern<00:02:37.880> warfare<00:02:38.030> 3<00:02:38.180> there's<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.990> huge

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
tactical and then we're going to go to

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.610 
tactical and then we're going to go to
the<00:03:06.830> crouched<00:03:07.100> position<00:03:08.260> they're<00:03:09.260> actually<00:03:09.590> i

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
the crouched position they're actually i

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.350 
the crouched position they're actually i
mean<00:03:09.890> for<00:03:10.070> some<00:03:10.220> reason<00:03:10.490> with<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.700> UMP<00:03:11.030> anyway

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
mean for some reason with the UMP anyway

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.330 
mean for some reason with the UMP anyway
it<00:03:11.450> looks<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.690> be<00:03:11.720> more<00:03:11.990> recoil<00:03:12.320> from<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.740> on

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
it looks to be more recoil from the on

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.930 
it looks to be more recoil from the on
the<00:03:13.520> vertical<00:03:14.440> when<00:03:15.440> you're<00:03:15.620> actually

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
the vertical when you're actually

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.840 
the vertical when you're actually
crouched<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.330> even<00:03:18.140> prone<00:03:18.440> versus<00:03:19.070> when

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
crouched and even prone versus when

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.820 
crouched and even prone versus when
you're<00:03:20.030> standing<00:03:20.240> standing<00:03:20.959> still<00:03:21.260> ok

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
you're standing standing still ok

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.900 
you're standing standing still ok
anyways<00:03:22.190> I'm<00:03:22.310> just<00:03:22.459> going<00:03:22.580> to<00:03:22.640> kill<00:03:22.760> myself

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
anyways I'm just going to kill myself

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.170 
anyways I'm just going to kill myself
and<00:03:23.270> then<00:03:23.720> we're<00:03:23.900> going<00:03:23.990> to<00:03:24.050> show<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:25.550> we're

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
and then we're going to show the we're

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.060 
and then we're going to show the we're
going<00:03:26.300> to<00:03:26.360> start<00:03:26.750> with<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.930> hipfire<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:28.010> I'm

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
going to start with the hipfire so I'm

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.560 
going to start with the hipfire so I'm
going<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.250> show<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.430> some<00:03:28.670> hip<00:03:28.820> fire<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.360> just

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
going to show you some hip fire and just

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.250 
going to show you some hip fire and just
the<00:03:29.690> bullet<00:03:29.930> spread<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.410> then<00:03:31.010> how<00:03:31.790> there's

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
the bullet spread and then how there's

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.590 
the bullet spread and then how there's
looks<00:03:33.260> like<00:03:33.590> an<00:03:33.739> extreme<00:03:34.310> difference<00:03:34.790> with

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
looks like an extreme difference with

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.190 
looks like an extreme difference with
the<00:03:36.110> drop<00:03:36.739> shotting<00:03:37.070> in<00:03:37.489> modern<00:03:38.060> warfare<00:03:38.209> 3<00:03:38.390> vs

the drop shotting in modern warfare 3 vs

the drop shotting in modern warfare 3 vs
black<00:03:39.470> ops<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:39.950> you'll<00:03:40.040> see<00:03:40.250> why<00:03:40.400> here<00:03:40.640> in<00:03:40.670> a

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
black ops and you'll see why here in a

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.729 
black ops and you'll see why here in a
second<00:03:41.150> so<00:03:41.600> here's<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.989> hipfire<00:03:42.140> bullet

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
second so here's the hipfire bullet

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.330 
second so here's the hipfire bullet
spread<00:03:42.980> with<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.250> UMP<00:03:44.739> so<00:03:45.739> there<00:03:45.980> is<00:03:46.100> some

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
spread with the UMP so there is some

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.920 
spread with the UMP so there is some
significant<00:03:47.060> bullet<00:03:47.300> spread<00:03:47.480> their<00:03:47.720> right

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.890 
significant bullet spread their right
all<00:03:48.260> right<00:03:48.440> now<00:03:48.620> let's<00:03:49.160> do<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.340> drop<00:03:49.640> shot<00:03:49.910> now

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
a bit of a comparison now the only

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.050 
a bit of a comparison now the only
problem<00:04:37.470> that<00:04:37.919> I<00:04:38.099> have<00:04:38.250> with<00:04:38.280> black<00:04:38.580> ops<00:04:38.759> 2<00:04:38.940> it

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
problem that I have with black ops 2 it

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.480 
problem that I have with black ops 2 it
doesn't<00:04:39.300> actually<00:04:39.389> show<00:04:39.569> the<00:04:40.190> bullet<00:04:41.190> the

environment from those bullets and you
know<00:04:54.720> I<00:04:54.750> haven't<00:04:54.930> really<00:04:55.349> run<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.710> full

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
know I haven't really run a full

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.980 
know I haven't really run a full
analysis<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.580> see<00:04:56.610> on<00:04:56.879> what<00:04:57.270> other<00:04:57.419> materials

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
analysis to see on what other materials

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.930 
analysis to see on what other materials
this<00:04:58.319> may<00:04:58.740> be<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:58.979> same<00:04:59.129> with<00:04:59.340> but<00:04:59.520> you<00:04:59.849> know

this may be the same with but you know
at<00:05:00.000> some<00:05:00.180> point<00:05:00.240> it<00:05:00.690> stops<00:05:01.050> showing<00:05:01.409> the

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
at some point it stops showing the

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.300 
at some point it stops showing the
bullet<00:05:02.250> marks<00:05:02.610> on<00:05:02.789> on<00:05:03.659> this<00:05:04.110> whatever<00:05:05.009> you

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
bullet marks on on this whatever you

bullet marks on on this whatever you
want<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.550> call<00:05:05.639> this<00:05:05.849> this<00:05:06.060> backdrop<00:05:06.419> okay<00:05:07.110> so

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
want to call this this backdrop okay so

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.480 
want to call this this backdrop okay so
now<00:05:07.409> we're<00:05:07.530> going<00:05:07.620> to<00:05:07.680> do<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.889> hipfire<00:05:08.039> and

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
now we're going to do the hipfire and

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.790 
now we're going to do the hipfire and
you<00:05:08.789> can<00:05:08.940> see<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.210> bullet<00:05:09.389> spread<00:05:09.630> right<00:05:09.900> so

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
you can see the bullet spread right so

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.379 
you can see the bullet spread right so
there<00:05:11.069> is<00:05:11.159> significant<00:05:11.699> bullet<00:05:11.909> spread<00:05:12.120> on

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
there is significant bullet spread on

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.559 
there is significant bullet spread on
the<00:05:12.449> hipfire<00:05:12.810> with<00:05:13.139> the<00:05:13.229> pdw-57<00:05:14.389> so<00:05:15.389> now<00:05:15.479> I'm

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.480 
at standing position we're going to
prone<00:05:24.479> and<00:05:24.750> check<00:05:25.560> out<00:05:25.740> that<00:05:25.919> bullet<00:05:26.250> spread

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
prone and check out that bullet spread

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.610 
prone and check out that bullet spread
did<00:05:27.090> you<00:05:27.210> see<00:05:27.389> that<00:05:27.419> bullet<00:05:27.780> spread<00:05:27.990> as<00:05:28.229> we

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
did you see that bullet spread as we

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.070 
did you see that bullet spread as we
dropped<00:05:29.039> from<00:05:29.580> standing<00:05:30.180> too<00:05:30.360> prone<00:05:30.569> position

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
dropped from standing too prone position

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.189 
dropped from standing too prone position
it's<00:05:31.440> actually<00:05:31.710> quite<00:05:32.130> significant<00:05:33.199> again

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
it's actually quite significant again

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.619 
it's actually quite significant again
it's<00:05:34.889> actually<00:05:35.430> you<00:05:36.090> know<00:05:36.210> it's<00:05:36.419> it's

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:36.629 
it's actually you know it's it's

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:39.860 
it's actually you know it's it's
probably<00:05:37.620> even<00:05:37.860> more<00:05:38.039> significant<00:05:39.030> than<00:05:39.479> when

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
probably even more significant than when

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.779 
probably even more significant than when
we<00:05:39.900> were<00:05:40.259> doing<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.680> the<00:05:41.190> hipfire<00:05:41.340> let's<00:05:41.699> go

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
we were doing the the hipfire let's go

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.850 
we were doing the the hipfire let's go
back<00:05:41.969> to<00:05:42.090> the<00:05:42.180> hipfire<00:05:42.349> so<00:05:43.349> with<00:05:43.590> the<00:05:43.710> hip

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
back to the hipfire so with the hip

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.230 
back to the hipfire so with the hip
firing<00:05:44.069> I<00:05:44.370> yes<00:05:44.580> you<00:05:44.610> have<00:05:44.880> a<00:05:44.909> pretty<00:05:45.180> good

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
firing I yes you have a pretty good

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.529 
firing I yes you have a pretty good
degree<00:05:45.719> of<00:05:45.930> bullets<00:05:46.380> separation<00:05:47.099> as<00:05:48.030> your<00:05:48.360> hip

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
degree of bullets separation as your hip

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.269 
degree of bullets separation as your hip
firing<00:05:48.810> and<00:05:49.229> you<00:05:49.349> have<00:05:49.500> those<00:05:49.620> outliers<00:05:50.009> it

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279 
firing and you have those outliers it

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.189 
firing and you have those outliers it
just<00:05:50.430> seemed<00:05:50.669> to<00:05:50.789> me<00:05:50.940> that<00:05:50.969> there<00:05:51.659> were<00:05:51.779> a<00:05:51.810> few

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
just seemed to me that there were a few

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.809 
just seemed to me that there were a few
more<00:05:52.380> outliers<00:05:52.800> versus<00:05:53.430> the<00:05:53.520> number<00:05:53.639> of

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:53.819 
more outliers versus the number of

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.640 
more outliers versus the number of
bullets<00:05:54.090> that<00:05:54.210> you<00:05:54.330> were<00:05:54.389> actually<00:05:54.479> firing<00:05:54.930> as

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
bullets that you were actually firing as

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.980 
bullets that you were actually firing as
your<00:05:55.979> drop<00:05:56.250> shotting<00:05:56.550> versus<00:05:57.180> just<00:05:57.449> standing

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
your drop shotting versus just standing

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.790 
your drop shotting versus just standing
there<00:05:58.219> and<00:05:59.219> hip<00:05:59.639> firing<00:06:00.080> so<00:06:01.080> really<00:06:01.349> what<00:06:01.710> does

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
there and hip firing so really what does

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.010 
there and hip firing so really what does
this<00:06:01.919> mean<00:06:02.130> well<00:06:02.460> I<00:06:02.490> think<00:06:03.180> for<00:06:03.659> people<00:06:03.810> coming

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
this mean well I think for people coming

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.309 
this mean well I think for people coming
from<00:06:04.259> modern<00:06:04.529> warfare<00:06:04.680> 3<00:06:04.830> 2<00:06:05.099> black<00:06:05.310> ops<00:06:05.520> 2<00:06:05.729> that

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
from modern warfare 3 2 black ops 2 that

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:09.920 
from modern warfare 3 2 black ops 2 that
drop<00:06:07.319> shotting<00:06:07.620> may<00:06:07.979> not<00:06:08.159> seem<00:06:08.789> as<00:06:09.090> effective

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
drop shotting may not seem as effective

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.469 
drop shotting may not seem as effective
as<00:06:10.169> it<00:06:10.409> was<00:06:10.650> in<00:06:11.340> modern<00:06:11.759> warfare<00:06:11.909> 3<00:06:12.029> I<00:06:12.180> mean<00:06:12.389> we

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
as it was in modern warfare 3 I mean we

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.059 
as it was in modern warfare 3 I mean we
saw<00:06:12.690> there<00:06:12.870> was<00:06:12.960> absolutely<00:06:13.440> no<00:06:13.740> bullet

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.069 
saw there was absolutely no bullet

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:15.950 
saw there was absolutely no bullet
separation<00:06:14.819> it's<00:06:15.000> as<00:06:15.360> if<00:06:15.539> you're<00:06:15.690> you<00:06:15.930> know

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
separation it's as if you're you know

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.749 
separation it's as if you're you know
again<00:06:16.229> your<00:06:16.409> ad<00:06:16.740> essing<00:06:17.099> the<00:06:17.190> whole<00:06:17.340> time<00:06:17.580> and

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
again your ad essing the whole time and

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.339 
again your ad essing the whole time and
the<00:06:18.330> fact<00:06:18.539> that<00:06:18.630> you're<00:06:18.779> moving<00:06:19.110> from

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
the fact that you're moving from

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:20.930 
the fact that you're moving from
standing<00:06:19.740> too<00:06:19.860> prone<00:06:20.039> position<00:06:20.460> has<00:06:20.610> no

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
standing too prone position has no

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.790 
standing too prone position has no
impact<00:06:21.240> at<00:06:21.449> all<00:06:21.599> on<00:06:21.659> the<00:06:22.380> bullet<00:06:22.620> spread

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
impact at all on the bullet spread

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.040 
impact at all on the bullet spread
whereas<00:06:23.219> and<00:06:23.490> we<00:06:23.849> saw<00:06:24.000> it<00:06:24.060> in<00:06:24.150> black<00:06:24.300> ops<00:06:24.569> I

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
whereas and we saw it in black ops I

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.620 
whereas and we saw it in black ops I
think<00:06:25.710> perhaps<00:06:26.069> it<00:06:26.520> is<00:06:26.669> slightly<00:06:27.419> more

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
think perhaps it is slightly more

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.870 
think perhaps it is slightly more
pronounced<00:06:28.319> in<00:06:28.409> black<00:06:28.680> ops<00:06:28.889> 2<00:06:29.009> the<00:06:29.610> bullet

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
pronounced in black ops 2 the bullet

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.629 
pronounced in black ops 2 the bullet
spread<00:06:30.090> as<00:06:30.330> you're<00:06:30.659> doing<00:06:30.779> the<00:06:30.990> drop<00:06:31.169> shot<00:06:31.639> so

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
spread as you're doing the drop shot so

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.120 
spread as you're doing the drop shot so
I<00:06:32.669> just<00:06:33.060> you<00:06:33.509> know<00:06:33.539> it<00:06:34.259> doesn't<00:06:34.590> make<00:06:34.800> drop

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
I just you know it doesn't make drop

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.200 
I just you know it doesn't make drop
shotting<00:06:35.400> less<00:06:36.210> effective<00:06:36.779> I<00:06:36.960> mean<00:06:37.229> slightly

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
shotting less effective I mean slightly

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.959 
shotting less effective I mean slightly
simply<00:06:39.210> because<00:06:39.539> yes<00:06:39.810> your<00:06:40.110> bullet<00:06:40.440> spread<00:06:40.650> is

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:40.969 
simply because yes your bullet spread is

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.839 
simply because yes your bullet spread is
wider<00:06:41.969> as<00:06:42.300> your<00:06:42.960> drop<00:06:43.199> shotting<00:06:43.469> but<00:06:43.740> I<00:06:43.949> don't

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:44.849 
wider as your drop shotting but I don't

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:46.040 
wider as your drop shotting but I don't
think<00:06:45.000> it's<00:06:45.180> less<00:06:45.330> significant<00:06:45.810> I<00:06:45.899> mean

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
think it's less significant I mean

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.559 
think it's less significant I mean
you're<00:06:46.199> talking<00:06:46.380> like<00:06:46.740> half<00:06:47.399> a<00:06:47.550> second<00:06:48.000> or

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:48.569 
you're talking like half a second or

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:50.089 
you're talking like half a second or
or<00:06:48.599> something<00:06:48.960> like<00:06:49.110> that<00:06:49.169> for<00:06:49.710> when<00:06:49.979> you're

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.099 
or something like that for when you're

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.639 
or something like that for when you're
actually<00:06:50.300> dropping<00:06:51.300> from<00:06:51.869> standing<00:06:52.439> too

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:52.649 
actually dropping from standing too

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:55.989 
actually dropping from standing too
prone<00:06:52.889> position<00:06:53.399> and<00:06:54.229> you<00:06:55.229> know<00:06:55.349> again<00:06:55.679> the

00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:55.999 
prone position and you know again the

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.730 
prone position and you know again the
emphasis<00:06:56.999> on<00:06:57.179> drop<00:06:57.449> shotting<00:06:57.749> is<00:06:58.139> the<00:06:58.499> fact

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
emphasis on drop shotting is the fact

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.919 
emphasis on drop shotting is the fact
that<00:06:58.860> you're<00:06:59.129> creating<00:06:59.729> your<00:06:59.939> changing

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:00.929 
that you're creating your changing

00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:02.389 
that you're creating your changing
targets<00:07:01.169> and<00:07:01.619> you're<00:07:01.770> creating<00:07:02.039> a<00:07:02.099> smaller

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:02.399 
targets and you're creating a smaller

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:04.879 
targets and you're creating a smaller
target<00:07:02.639> for<00:07:02.969> your<00:07:03.089> opponent<00:07:03.619> versus<00:07:04.619> you

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889 
target for your opponent versus you

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:07.249 
target for your opponent versus you
actually<00:07:05.399> improving<00:07:05.969> your<00:07:06.270> shot<00:07:06.569> capability

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 
actually improving your shot capability

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:08.779 
actually improving your shot capability
as<00:07:07.379> you<00:07:07.529> drop<00:07:07.740> shining<00:07:08.069> I<00:07:08.189> mean<00:07:08.369> that's<00:07:08.459> really

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:08.789 
as you drop shining I mean that's really

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:10.760 
as you drop shining I mean that's really
what<00:07:08.939> drop<00:07:09.509> shotting<00:07:09.719> is<00:07:09.899> about<00:07:10.139> is<00:07:10.349> to<00:07:10.499> mess

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
what drop shotting is about is to mess

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.339 
what drop shotting is about is to mess
up<00:07:11.009> your<00:07:11.039> opponent<00:07:11.699> versus<00:07:12.689> giving<00:07:13.050> you<00:07:13.229> an

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:13.349 
up your opponent versus giving you an

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.339 
up your opponent versus giving you an
advantage<00:07:13.679> as<00:07:14.009> far<00:07:14.039> as<00:07:14.369> firing<00:07:14.669> at<00:07:14.969> them<00:07:15.319> so<00:07:16.319> I

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:16.349 
advantage as far as firing at them so I

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:18.139 
advantage as far as firing at them so I
really<00:07:17.129> don't<00:07:17.219> think<00:07:17.339> it<00:07:17.580> has<00:07:17.699> that<00:07:17.879> much<00:07:17.999> of

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:18.149 
really don't think it has that much of

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:19.669 
really don't think it has that much of
an<00:07:18.240> impact<00:07:18.449> but<00:07:18.869> like<00:07:19.020> I<00:07:19.050> said<00:07:19.169> coming<00:07:19.589> from

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:19.679 
an impact but like I said coming from

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:21.439 
an impact but like I said coming from
modern<00:07:19.949> warfare<00:07:20.069> 3<00:07:20.219> or<00:07:20.580> players<00:07:20.999> coming<00:07:21.270> from

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:21.449 
modern warfare 3 or players coming from

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:24.619 
modern warfare 3 or players coming from
modern<00:07:21.689> warfare<00:07:21.839> 3<00:07:21.990> 2<00:07:22.680> black<00:07:22.889> ops<00:07:23.129> 2<00:07:23.629> maybe

00:07:24.619 --> 00:07:24.629 
modern warfare 3 2 black ops 2 maybe

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:25.760 
modern warfare 3 2 black ops 2 maybe
that's<00:07:24.869> just<00:07:25.050> something<00:07:25.289> that<00:07:25.559> they<00:07:25.649> have

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
that's just something that they have

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.589 
that's just something that they have
noticed<00:07:26.129> but<00:07:26.309> yeah<00:07:26.849> do<00:07:27.149> I<00:07:27.209> think<00:07:27.419> it's<00:07:27.539> a

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 
noticed but yeah do I think it's a

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:28.969 
noticed but yeah do I think it's a
really<00:07:27.719> big<00:07:27.930> deal<00:07:27.959> no<00:07:28.379> it's<00:07:28.529> not<00:07:28.619> really<00:07:28.889> going
