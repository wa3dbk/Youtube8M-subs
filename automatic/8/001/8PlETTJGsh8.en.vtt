00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.390 
why I decided to make this video is is
that<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:14.750> know<00:05:14.810> battery<00:05:15.470> power<00:05:15.680> is<00:05:15.950> a<00:05:15.980> big

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
that you know battery power is a big

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.130 
that you know battery power is a big

out you know if you're taping for

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.410 
out you know if you're taping for
majority<00:05:23.240> of<00:05:23.420> the<00:05:23.510> time<00:05:24.280> so<00:05:25.280> what<00:05:26.270> I've<00:05:26.390> been

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
majority of the time so what I've been

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.030 
majority of the time so what I've been
able<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:26.960> do<00:05:27.260> when<00:05:27.440> I<00:05:27.530> found<00:05:27.680> out<00:05:27.830> that<00:05:27.890> you

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
able to do when I found out that you

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.130 
able to do when I found out that you
could<00:05:28.280> do<00:05:28.490> is<00:05:28.730> if<00:05:29.330> you<00:05:29.419> plug<00:05:29.600> the<00:05:29.780> USB<00:05:29.870> cable

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
could do is if you plug the USB cable

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.930 
could do is if you plug the USB cable
and<00:05:30.560> over<00:05:30.830> here<00:05:31.810> power<00:05:32.810> this<00:05:33.050> on<00:05:33.260> I<00:05:33.940> actually

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
and over here power this on I actually

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.240 
and over here power this on I actually
bought<00:05:35.270> a<00:05:35.510> Duracell<00:05:36.140> power<00:05:36.440> source<00:05:36.830> mobile

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
bought a Duracell power source mobile

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.860 
bought a Duracell power source mobile
100<00:05:37.669> knew<00:05:37.790> what<00:05:37.910> it<00:05:38.000> is<00:05:38.120> is<00:05:38.240> a<00:05:38.360> power<00:05:38.630> inverter

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
100 knew what it is is a power inverter

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.500 
100 knew what it is is a power inverter
with<00:05:39.320> two<00:05:39.590> USB<00:05:40.070> outputs<00:05:41.000> and<00:05:41.180> a<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.560> sea<00:05:42.620> output

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.240 
with two USB outputs and a a sea output
charges<00:05:44.510> up<00:05:45.190> to<00:05:46.190> power<00:05:46.400> this<00:05:46.550> on<00:05:46.730> over<00:05:46.940> here

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
charges up to power this on over here

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.560 
charges up to power this on over here
you<00:05:49.250> actually<00:05:49.550> get<00:05:49.669> the<00:05:49.700> charging<00:05:50.180> indicator

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
you actually get the charging indicator

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.440 
you actually get the charging indicator
so<00:05:51.290> you<00:05:51.650> can<00:05:51.800> be<00:05:51.919> completely<00:05:52.070> you<00:05:52.970> know<00:05:53.000> free

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
so you can be completely you know free

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.870 
so you can be completely you know free
of<00:05:53.540> wires<00:05:53.750> other<00:05:54.680> than<00:05:54.890> the<00:05:55.040> USB<00:05:55.400> cable<00:05:55.430> here

to the camera and you could probably

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.710 
to the camera and you could probably
tape<00:05:58.280> for<00:05:58.640> more<00:05:58.820> than<00:05:58.970> your<00:05:59.090> memory<00:05:59.419> cards
