 Hi, my name is Darek Kraśnicki 

00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:11.900
 and welcome to my website at www.psychotestykierowcow.pl 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.641
 and www.badania-na-prawo-jazdy-wroclaw.com. 

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:23.705
 Another interesting question asked by Magda from Wrocław regarding the subject of medical examination of drivers to the driving license category B. 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.847
 And I will read here the question of our Lady Magda. 

00:00:27.248 --> 00:00:33.304
 "Hello, I have to extend my driving license due to the fact that it was previously issued for a definite period, 

00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:35.343
 because of eye defects. 

00:00:35.777 --> 00:00:41.594
 I would like to carry out the necessary medical examinations with you, but I care about 

00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:50.491
 so that this time the driving license would be indefinite, because my vision defect is not changed anymore. 

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:55.238
 Is it necessary to have an extract from the ophthalmologist's card? " 

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:07.611
 If the case concerned some other diseases, eg in addition to this eye condition still diabetes, unconsciousness, 

00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:16.201
 head injuries, etc., rather, such an extract would be obligatory for me, whereas if it concerns only visual defects 

00:01:16.903 --> 00:01:25.934
 I can not say that an extract of this or other medical records would not be useful, but nonetheless for cat. B 

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:33.227
 the doctor has the right to assess the health-related ability to drive vehicles by himself, so you can also come 

00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:35.533
 without this medical documentation. 

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:45.190
 But as I said, there may be two situations that I will not be able to assess exactly this defect of sight, 

00:01:45.193 --> 00:01:57.400
 then I would have requested this documentation, but in most cases my research is enough and then I make a decision. 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.730
 Also in the subject whether this documentation is needed or not, it would be good to have it 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:14.690
 for cat. B the physician authorized to test drivers has the right to assess the health of his patient. 

00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:19.470
 If you have any questions or comments, I invite you here at the bottom, 

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:28.200

 Thank you very much, said your transport medicine doctor, Darek Kraśnicki.
