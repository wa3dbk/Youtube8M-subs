00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.740 
all you get a speed boost at the
beginning<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.729> game<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.390> do<00:01:24.509> hit

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
beginning of the game and if you do hit

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.270 
beginning of the game and if you do hit
someone<00:01:25.020> within<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> speed<00:01:25.590> boost<00:01:25.799> period<00:01:26.189> of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
someone within the speed boost period of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.819 
someone within the speed boost period of
time<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:27.509> will<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.960> will<00:01:27.990> lose<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.619> speed

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
time you will you will lose up speed

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:29.840 
time you will you will lose up speed
boost<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.159> really<00:01:29.400> don't<00:01:29.520> want<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> be

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
boost so you really don't want to be

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.179 
boost so you really don't want to be
doing<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.290> next<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> random<00:01:31.799> point<00:01:32.100> in

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
doing that next up at a random point in

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.679 
doing that next up at a random point in
the<00:01:32.280> game<00:01:32.310> there's<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> Supply<00:01:33.119> Drop<00:01:33.180> which<00:01:33.570> is

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the game there's a Supply Drop which is

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.210 
the game there's a Supply Drop which is
a<00:01:33.810> crate<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:34.350> chest<00:01:34.710> whatever<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.040> want<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
a crate or chest whatever you want to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.520 
a crate or chest whatever you want to
quit<00:01:35.400> which<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.479> dropped<00:01:36.750> into<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> game<00:01:37.350> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
quit which is dropped into the game and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.050 
quit which is dropped into the game and
it<00:01:37.920> will<00:01:38.040> include<00:01:38.310> some<00:01:38.369> really<00:01:38.759> good<00:01:38.850> loot

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
it will include some really good loot

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.749 
it will include some really good loot
for<00:01:39.240> example<00:01:39.799> diamond<00:01:40.799> sword<00:01:41.009> iron<00:01:41.369> saw<00:01:41.549> some

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
for example diamond sword iron saw some

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.370 
for example diamond sword iron saw some
really<00:01:41.820> good<00:01:42.030> armor<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:43.229> just

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
really good armor and it's just

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.840 
really good armor and it's just
generally<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:44.220> want<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.520> looking

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
generally you really want to be looking

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.870 
generally you really want to be looking
out<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.450> when<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.290> drops<00:01:46.729> next<00:01:47.729> up

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
out for that when that drops next up

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.700 
out for that when that drops next up
these<00:01:48.119> maps<00:01:48.600> slowly<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.110> smaller<00:01:49.470> set<00:01:49.680> of

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
these maps slowly get smaller set of

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.200 
these maps slowly get smaller set of
games<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.310> quick<00:01:50.640> which<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:50.970> always<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
games are really quick which is always a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.450 
games are really quick which is always a
good<00:01:51.390> thing<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.720> my<00:01:51.840> opinion<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.920> map<00:01:53.280> gets

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
good thing in my opinion the map gets

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.950 
good thing in my opinion the map gets
smaller<00:01:53.700> because<00:01:53.850> some<00:01:54.090> snow<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.540> ice<00:01:54.659> moves

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
smaller because some snow and ice moves

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.569 
smaller because some snow and ice moves
in<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.350> if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.619> go<00:01:55.799> against<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> snow<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
in and if you go against the snow and

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.639 
in and if you go against the snow and
ice<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.659> will<00:01:57.899> kill<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.290> which<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.439> pretty

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
ice it will kill you which is pretty

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.870 
ice it will kill you which is pretty
awesome<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.189> yeah<00:01:59.219> i'd<00:01:59.549> highly<00:01:59.790> suggest

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
awesome so yeah i'd highly suggest

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.109 
awesome so yeah i'd highly suggest
