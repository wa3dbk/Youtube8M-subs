so diagnosing a misfire on some vehicles

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.100 
so diagnosing a misfire on some vehicles
sometimes<00:00:09.969> you<00:00:10.119> might<00:00:10.299> suspect<00:00:10.690> that<00:00:10.959> it's

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
sometimes you might suspect that it's

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.299 
sometimes you might suspect that it's
the<00:00:11.199> fuel<00:00:11.440> injector<00:00:11.830> that's<00:00:12.010> given<00:00:12.190> your

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
the fuel injector that's given your

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.939 
the fuel injector that's given your
problems<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:14.139> need<00:00:14.320> to<00:00:14.410> check<00:00:14.619> it<00:00:14.770> both

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:14.949 
problems you need to check it both

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.920 
problems you need to check it both
electrically<00:00:15.430> and<00:00:15.699> mechanically<00:00:16.390> to<00:00:16.720> see

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
electrically and mechanically to see

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.480 
electrically and mechanically to see
whether<00:00:17.200> or<00:00:17.350> not<00:00:17.410> it's<00:00:17.620> working<00:00:17.770> properly<00:00:18.220> or

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
whether or not it's working properly or

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.610 
whether or not it's working properly or
maybe<00:00:18.610> you<00:00:18.940> have<00:00:19.090> a<00:00:19.120> stock<00:00:19.450> fuel<00:00:19.720> injector<00:00:20.230> so

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:20.620 
maybe you have a stock fuel injector so

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.690 
maybe you have a stock fuel injector so
we're<00:00:20.710> going<00:00:20.830> to<00:00:20.890> show<00:00:21.070> you<00:00:21.100> a<00:00:21.250> couple<00:00:21.430> quick

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
we're going to show you a couple quick

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.810 
we're going to show you a couple quick
easy<00:00:21.910> ways<00:00:22.240> to<00:00:22.270> do<00:00:22.630> it<00:00:22.810> using<00:00:23.620> a<00:00:23.860> lab<00:00:24.039> scope<00:00:24.370> let

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
easy ways to do it using a lab scope let

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.550 
easy ways to do it using a lab scope let
me<00:00:24.880> go<00:00:25.030> start<00:00:25.360> the<00:00:25.480> car<00:00:25.690> and<00:00:25.720> we'll<00:00:26.170> analyze

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
me go start the car and we'll analyze

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.160 
me go start the car and we'll analyze
the<00:00:26.710> pattern

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.170 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.710 

now<00:00:32.680> pause<00:00:32.950> this<00:00:33.220> real<00:00:33.460> quick<00:00:33.730> and<00:00:33.970> I'll<00:00:34.630> go

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
now pause this real quick and I'll go

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.130 
now pause this real quick and I'll go
shut<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.050> vehicle<00:00:35.170> off<00:00:36.690> all<00:00:37.690> right<00:00:37.810> so<00:00:37.960> let's

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
shut the vehicle off all right so let's

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.350 
shut the vehicle off all right so let's
take<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.350> look<00:00:38.560> at<00:00:38.650> what<00:00:38.770> we<00:00:38.860> captured<00:00:39.310> here<00:00:39.580> the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
take a look at what we captured here the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.390 
take a look at what we captured here the
yellow<00:00:40.630> line<00:00:40.960> is<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.260> voltage<00:00:41.830> going<00:00:42.220> through

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
yellow line is the voltage going through

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.270 
yellow line is the voltage going through
that<00:00:42.580> fuel<00:00:42.850> injector<00:00:43.330> and<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.680> Green<00:00:44.980> Line<00:00:45.250> is

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
that fuel injector and the Green Line is

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.130 
that fuel injector and the Green Line is
the<00:00:45.610> amperage<00:00:46.150> going<00:00:46.540> through<00:00:46.750> this<00:00:46.900> fuel

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
the amperage going through this fuel

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.680 
the amperage going through this fuel
injector<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.640> if<00:00:48.730> I<00:00:48.820> take<00:00:49.030> a<00:00:49.059> measurement<00:00:49.480> at

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
injector so if I take a measurement at

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.570 
injector so if I take a measurement at
cursor<00:00:50.020> one<00:00:50.230> for<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.559> voltage<00:00:50.770> we<00:00:51.190> should<00:00:51.370> see

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
cursor one for the voltage we should see

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.490 
cursor one for the voltage we should see
pretty<00:00:51.880> close<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.300> alternator<00:00:52.809> voltage<00:00:52.900> so

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
pretty close to alternator voltage so

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.320 
pretty close to alternator voltage so
thirteen<00:00:54.010> point<00:00:54.280> five<00:00:54.460> volts<00:00:54.910> that's<00:00:55.030> pretty

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
thirteen point five volts that's pretty

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.970 
thirteen point five volts that's pretty
good

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
good

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.619 
good
then<00:00:56.980> this<00:00:57.129> squared<00:00:57.550> off<00:00:57.760> corner<00:00:58.210> right<00:00:58.390> here

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
then this squared off corner right here

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.479 
then this squared off corner right here
is<00:00:58.720> where<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:59.020> PCM<00:00:59.500> takes<00:00:59.800> and<00:00:59.980> grounds<00:01:00.370> that

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
is where the PCM takes and grounds that

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.820 
is where the PCM takes and grounds that
fuel<00:01:00.760> injector<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.330> turn<00:01:01.540> it<00:01:01.690> on<00:01:01.840> so

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
fuel injector to turn it on so

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.100 
fuel injector to turn it on so
measurement<00:01:03.250> at<00:01:03.489> cursor<00:01:03.820> two<00:01:04.059> yeah<00:01:04.750> roughly

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
measurement at cursor two yeah roughly

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.170 
measurement at cursor two yeah roughly
ground<00:01:05.530> so<00:01:06.220> it's<00:01:06.340> gonna<00:01:06.460> change<00:01:06.550> slightly

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
ground so it's gonna change slightly

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.690 
ground so it's gonna change slightly
from<00:01:07.890> depending<00:01:08.890> on<00:01:08.979> where<00:01:09.130> we<00:01:09.160> put<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:09.580> so

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
from depending on where we put it so

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.050 
from depending on where we put it so
that's<00:01:09.850> pretty<00:01:09.910> darn<00:01:10.300> close<00:01:10.509> to<00:01:10.570> ground<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.970> if

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
that's pretty darn close to ground so if

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.590 
that's pretty darn close to ground so if
I<00:01:13.119> take<00:01:13.330> cursor<00:01:13.840> one<00:01:14.110> put<00:01:14.979> it<00:01:15.070> there<00:01:15.580> cursor<00:01:16.390> to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
I take cursor one put it there cursor to

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.650 
I take cursor one put it there cursor to
put<00:01:16.990> it<00:01:17.080> at<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.259> end<00:01:17.290> of<00:01:17.770> that<00:01:18.000> ground<00:01:19.000> period

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
put it at the end of that ground period

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.590 
put it at the end of that ground period
that's<00:01:20.649> gonna<00:01:20.890> give<00:01:21.190> us<00:01:21.220> our<00:01:21.520> injector<00:01:22.270> pulse

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
that's gonna give us our injector pulse

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.510 
that's gonna give us our injector pulse
width<00:01:22.930> so<00:01:23.710> two<00:01:23.770> point<00:01:24.280> two<00:01:24.490> eight

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
width so two point two eight

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.200 
width so two point two eight
milliseconds<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.570> this<00:01:25.690> case<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.759> alternator

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
milliseconds in this case so alternator

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.660 
milliseconds in this case so alternator
voltage<00:01:28.300> comes<00:01:28.869> in<00:01:29.110> PCM<00:01:29.920> grounds<00:01:30.369> it<00:01:30.460> for<00:01:30.640> a

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
voltage comes in PCM grounds it for a

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.330 
voltage comes in PCM grounds it for a
set<00:01:30.850> amount<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:31.240> time<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.750> pulse<00:01:31.930> width<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:33.250> I

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
set amount of time the pulse width if I

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.999 
set amount of time the pulse width if I
take<00:01:33.580> cursor<00:01:33.970> two<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:34.330> move<00:01:34.479> it<00:01:34.630> over<00:01:35.009> that's

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
take cursor two and move it over that's

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.010 
take cursor two and move it over that's
all<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:36.580> voltage<00:01:36.850> that<00:01:37.270> was<00:01:37.420> just<00:01:37.690> stored

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
all that voltage that was just stored

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.340 
all that voltage that was just stored
inside<00:01:38.470> of<00:01:38.530> that<00:01:38.799> fuel<00:01:39.100> injector<00:01:39.549> and<00:01:39.820> it<00:01:40.479> once

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
inside of that fuel injector and it once

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.750 
inside of that fuel injector and it once
it<00:01:41.500> releases<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.979> ground<00:01:42.220> all<00:01:42.430> that<00:01:42.610> voltage

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
it releases the ground all that voltage

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.700 
it releases the ground all that voltage
goes<00:01:43.180> back<00:01:43.420> into<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.750> line<00:01:43.990> we're<00:01:44.290> looking<00:01:44.320> at

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
goes back into the line we're looking at

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.110 
goes back into the line we're looking at
a<00:01:44.740> hundred<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.159> seventeen<00:01:45.700> point<00:01:46.060> three

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
a hundred and seventeen point three

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.770 
a hundred and seventeen point three
volts<00:01:46.810> in<00:01:46.990> this<00:01:47.619> case<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.430> then<00:01:49.420> over<00:01:49.750> here

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
volts in this case and then over here

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.270 
volts in this case and then over here
we're<00:01:50.110> gonna<00:01:50.200> see<00:01:50.470> another<00:01:50.710> little<00:01:51.040> bump

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
we're gonna see another little bump

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.760 
we're gonna see another little bump
we'll<00:01:51.580> call<00:01:51.790> that<00:01:52.000> coil<00:01:52.330> oscillation<00:01:53.140> that's

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
we'll call that coil oscillation that's

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.830 
we'll call that coil oscillation that's
the<00:01:53.950> voltage<00:01:54.130> just<00:01:54.580> ringing<00:01:54.790> back<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.330> forth

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
the voltage just ringing back and forth

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.530 
the voltage just ringing back and forth
within<00:01:56.619> that<00:01:56.770> coil<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.430> then<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.390> voltage

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
halfway up this ramp right here there's

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.620 
halfway up this ramp right here there's
a<00:02:25.959> little<00:02:26.260> dip<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:27.340> dip<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.000> point<00:02:28.269> where

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
a little dip that dip is the point where

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.630 
a little dip that dip is the point where
the<00:02:29.110> fuel<00:02:29.320> injector<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:29.799> actually<00:02:30.190> opening

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
the fuel injector is actually opening

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
and starting to spray fuel and then this

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.310 
and starting to spray fuel and then this
is<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.519> current<00:02:33.940> limited<00:02:34.269> injector<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:34.989> once<00:02:35.170> it

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
is a current limited injector so once it

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.050 
is a current limited injector so once it
gets<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.650> set<00:02:35.980> current<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.579> PCM

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
gets to a set current that the PCM

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.300 
gets to a set current that the PCM
dictates<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:38.380> just<00:02:38.620> going<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:38.829> level<00:02:39.130> off

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
dictates it's just going to level off

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.330 
dictates it's just going to level off
and<00:02:39.610> then<00:02:40.090> close<00:02:40.569> at<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.080> same<00:02:41.110> time<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
and then close at the same time that the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.610 
and then close at the same time that the
injector<00:02:42.790> closes<00:02:43.330> now<00:02:43.810> if<00:02:43.930> this<00:02:44.080> wasn't<00:02:44.349> a

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
injector closes now if this wasn't a

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
injector closes now if this wasn't a
current<00:02:44.980> limited<00:02:45.310> in<00:02:45.400> jet

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
current limited in jet

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.640 
current limited in jet
there<00:02:45.850> you'd<00:02:46.360> see<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.690> continue<00:02:47.200> up<00:02:47.350> like<00:02:47.620> a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
there you'd see it continue up like a

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.809 
there you'd see it continue up like a
shark<00:02:47.980> fin<00:02:48.040> until<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.660> ground<00:02:50.050> is<00:02:50.290> released

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
shark fin until the ground is released

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.340 
shark fin until the ground is released
so<00:02:51.819> as<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.000> can<00:02:52.120> see<00:02:52.330> just<00:02:52.540> by<00:02:52.720> doing<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:53.080> couple

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
so as you can see just by doing a couple

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.320 
so as you can see just by doing a couple
quick<00:02:53.709> little<00:02:54.010> tests<00:02:54.400> on<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.580> fuel<00:02:54.880> injector

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
quick little tests on a fuel injector

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.610 
quick little tests on a fuel injector
you<00:02:55.540> can<00:02:55.660> see<00:02:55.840> how<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.110> working<00:02:56.470> both

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
you can see how it's working both

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.620 
you can see how it's working both
electrically<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.400> mechanically<00:02:58.300> and

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
electrically and mechanically and

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.480 
electrically and mechanically and
that'll<00:02:59.140> help<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.440> narrow<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.770> down<00:02:59.890> when<00:03:00.370> you

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
that'll help you narrow it down when you

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.310 
that'll help you narrow it down when you
think<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.940> might<00:03:00.970> have<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.360> misfiring<00:03:01.990> fuel

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
think you might have a misfiring fuel
