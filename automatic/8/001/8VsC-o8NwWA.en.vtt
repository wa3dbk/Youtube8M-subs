00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
a little bit of space between it and cup

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.950 
a little bit of space between it and cup
it<00:00:38.520> similar<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.149> how<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.300> would<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> bullet

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
it similar to how you would a bullet

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.500 
it similar to how you would a bullet
microphone<00:00:40.550> unlike<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> bullet<00:00:42.000> microphone

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
microphone unlike a bullet microphone

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.260 
microphone unlike a bullet microphone
you<00:00:43.079> can<00:00:43.290> utilize<00:00:43.579> hand<00:00:44.579> effects<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
you can utilize hand effects like the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:54.170 
you can utilize hand effects like the
wah<00:00:45.420> wah

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.520 

whereas<00:00:55.180> if<00:00:55.329> you<00:00:55.359> have<00:00:55.570> a<00:00:55.600> bullet<00:00:55.930> microphone

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
whereas if you have a bullet microphone

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.650 
whereas if you have a bullet microphone
you're<00:00:57.190> not<00:00:57.370> gonna<00:00:57.519> be<00:00:57.670> able<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.940> utilize<00:00:58.420> the

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
hand motions so this definitely opens up

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:15.990 
hand motions so this definitely opens up
