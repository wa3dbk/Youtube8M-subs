really<00:00:45.220> my<00:00:46.220> honest<00:00:46.610> recommendation<00:00:47.270> about

really my honest recommendation about

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.280 
really my honest recommendation about
Mazur<00:00:47.720> is<00:00:47.840> rath<00:00:48.080> is<00:00:49.360> if<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:50.600> want<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.080> play

this game
French<00:00:52.220> it<00:00:52.430> I<00:00:52.670> don't<00:00:53.180> think<00:00:53.300> anyone<00:00:53.870> should

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
French it I don't think anyone should

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.590 
French it I don't think anyone should
buy<00:00:54.260> this<00:00:54.320> game<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:55.460> if<00:00:55.880> you<00:00:56.000> really<00:00:56.330> want<00:00:56.510> my

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
buy this game and if you really want my

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.680 
buy this game and if you really want my
honest<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:57.670> it's<00:00:58.670> probably<00:00:59.090> better<00:00:59.420> off<00:00:59.480> to

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
honest and it's probably better off to

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.820 
honest and it's probably better off to
just<00:00:59.900> watch<00:01:00.170> a<00:01:00.260> play<00:01:00.410> throughout<00:01:00.739> the
