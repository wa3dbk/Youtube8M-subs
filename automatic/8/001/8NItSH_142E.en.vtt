00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.770 
bigger ones and we use the smaller ones
for<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.950> bottom<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.610> their<00:02:26.790> cage<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.540> their

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
for the bottom of their cage so their

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.600 
for the bottom of their cage so their
head<00:02:28.020> doesn't<00:02:28.260> stick<00:02:28.739> out<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:30.590> then<00:02:31.590> all<00:02:32.040> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
head doesn't stick out and then all the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.509 
head doesn't stick out and then all the
way<00:02:32.849> that<00:02:33.150> we<00:02:33.269> got<00:02:33.450> from<00:02:33.750> Home<00:02:34.019> Depot<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.860> we

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
way that we got from Home Depot and we

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.880 
way that we got from Home Depot and we
made<00:02:35.700> sure<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.540> wood<00:02:36.720> wasn't<00:02:36.959> treated

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
made sure that the wood wasn't treated

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.830 
made sure that the wood wasn't treated
just<00:02:38.550> in<00:02:38.670> case<00:02:38.849> there<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.120> was<00:02:39.300> gonna<00:02:39.420> chew<00:02:39.690> on

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
just in case there I was gonna chew on

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.500 
just in case there I was gonna chew on
it<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:41.150> then<00:02:42.150> further<00:02:42.450> floor

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
it and then further floor

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.400 
it and then further floor
we<00:02:45.510> got<00:02:45.920> linoleum<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.450> it's<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.630> much<00:02:48.840> easier

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
we got linoleum and it's so much easier

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.840 
we got linoleum and it's so much easier
for<00:02:49.440> us<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.739> clean<00:02:50.130> their<00:02:50.310> cage<00:02:50.519> and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
for us to clean their cage and

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.979 
for us to clean their cage and
everything<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.459> this<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.209> what<00:02:54.420> our<00:02:54.450> floor

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
everything so this is what our floor

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.380 
everything so this is what our floor
looks<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.890> underneath<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.640> what<00:02:57.030> to

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
looks like and underneath is what to

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.170 
looks like and underneath is what to
make<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.569> nice<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.080> sturdy<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.970> make<00:03:00.150> sure

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
make it nice and sturdy and to make sure

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.780 
make it nice and sturdy and to make sure
that<00:03:00.330> no<00:03:00.660> water<00:03:01.019> gets<00:03:01.680> onto<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.220> wood<00:03:02.400> we<00:03:02.580> did

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
that no water gets onto the wood we did

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:11.430 
that no water gets onto the wood we did
some<00:03:03.030> caulking<00:03:03.390> right<00:03:04.400> here

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.290 

and<00:03:11.530> then<00:03:12.220> on<00:03:12.550> our<00:03:12.760> levels<00:03:17.400> we<00:03:18.400> use<00:03:18.610> zip<00:03:18.970> ties

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
and then on our levels we use zip ties

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.490 
and then on our levels we use zip ties
to<00:03:19.810> make<00:03:20.050> it<00:03:20.290> sturdy<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.980> then<00:03:21.190> we<00:03:21.340> also

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
to make it sturdy and then we also

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.980 
to make it sturdy and then we also
drilled<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.890> nail<00:03:24.190> into<00:03:24.490> there<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:25.540> make<00:03:25.750> sure

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
drilled a nail into there to make sure

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.690 
drilled a nail into there to make sure
that<00:03:26.230> they're<00:03:26.470> stuck<00:03:26.800> together<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:27.640> it

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
that they're stuck together so it

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.600 
that they're stuck together so it
doesn't<00:03:28.030> move<00:03:28.270> so<00:03:31.770> right<00:03:32.770> here<00:03:33.250> is<00:03:33.430> obviously

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
doesn't move so right here is obviously

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.210 
doesn't move so right here is obviously
plywood<00:03:34.570> but<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.380> rabbits<00:03:35.710> can<00:03:35.890> chew<00:03:36.070> it

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
plywood but the rabbits can chew it

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.760 
plywood but the rabbits can chew it
since<00:03:36.460> we<00:03:36.580> have<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:36.730> fluorine<00:03:37.270> over<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:37.990> bond

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
since we have a fluorine over it bond

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.760 
since we have a fluorine over it bond
here<00:03:39.400> where<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.760> rabbits<00:03:40.090> can<00:03:40.270> chew<00:03:40.660> this<00:03:41.530> is

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
here where the rabbits can chew this is

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.580 
here where the rabbits can chew this is
untreated<00:03:42.370> wood<00:03:42.730> just<00:03:42.970> in<00:03:43.120> case<00:03:43.300> they<00:03:43.600> want<00:03:44.500> to

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
untreated wood just in case they want to

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.500 
untreated wood just in case they want to
chew<00:03:44.800> on<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.250> then<00:03:45.370> down<00:03:45.580> here<00:03:45.610> is<00:03:46.210> also

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
chew on it and then down here is also

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.750 
chew on it and then down here is also
not<00:03:46.960> treated<00:03:47.350> wood<00:03:47.530> which<00:03:48.130> if<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.370> look<00:03:48.580> right

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
not treated wood which if you look right

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.160 
not treated wood which if you look right
here<00:03:49.210> April<00:03:49.660> decided<00:03:50.140> to<00:03:50.290> chew<00:03:50.560> on<00:03:50.800> it<00:03:52.170> but
