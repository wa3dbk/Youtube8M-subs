dedicate a whole video to him the main
reason<00:01:13.950> being<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:15.259> didn't<00:01:16.259> even

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
reason being is that I didn't even

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.590 
reason being is that I didn't even
follow<00:01:16.799> any<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.400> my<00:01:17.580> old<00:01:17.820> settings<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.509> he

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
follow any of my old settings and he

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.480 
follow any of my old settings and he
still<00:01:18.900> turned<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.439> nearly<00:01:19.680> identical<00:01:19.890> which

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
still turned out nearly identical which

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.300 
still turned out nearly identical which
means<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.150> me<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.960> probably<00:01:22.080> can't<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
means to me that I probably can't get it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.490 
means to me that I probably can't get it
no<00:01:23.490> better<00:01:23.700> than<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.229> means

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
no better than I have and that means

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.210 
no better than I have and that means
that<00:01:26.450> either<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.380> limitations<00:01:29.040> are<00:01:29.189> in

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
that either this the limitations are in

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.170 
that either this the limitations are in
my<00:01:29.729> eyes<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.450> can't<00:01:30.960> see<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.350> any<00:01:31.500> better<00:01:31.710> or<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
my eyes I can't see it any better or the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.530 
my eyes I can't see it any better or the
limitations<00:01:33.750> are<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.079> same

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
limitations are in the same
