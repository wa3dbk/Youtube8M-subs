00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello youtube people good the day of 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.410
 today we are going to see the difference between a 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.710
 oled screen and a ips screen that are 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.400
 the two main types of screens 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.060
 that are currently in the range 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.390
 highest 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.010
 well there's also the dgt but that's not 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.230
 I have my hand screaming so we're going to 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:39.470
 compare those that compare more often 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.610
 which is the ips and the super amoled ok 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.050
 to start I'll see if 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.050
 it looks good goes well 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.190
 ok let's start 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:01.100
 here I have a link is 4 and here I have my 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.309
 galaxy nexus although good to start 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.619
 let's say it's an ips screen and 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.710
 which is a good amoled screen in 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.590
 principle in print good by principal 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:18.159
 is that the super amoled is a screen 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:21.470
 that paulette means this diode or 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.979
 organic emitting diodes of editors of 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.860
 editors of light then that's a 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.080
 organic screen has life to 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.570
 comparison of him 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.940
 in the ips that is a simple lcd with this 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.560
 modified and arranged improved for 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.280
 have better viewing angles and 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.100
 also have this best colors ok 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.580
 well again everyone has their 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.440
 advantages and their disadvantages 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.690
 and we're going to see a test to see 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.500
 each 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:04.330
 I have this and menchu ​​marks 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.130
 here I like it ok we can see if not 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.560
 I know if it shows very well on the screen 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.020
 but this one looks colors a bit more 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.770
 dark and brighter colors 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.130
 ok let's be ok we start with the 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.580
 red to the maximum we can see here is not 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.390
 note 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.970
 this is a little more for which 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.340
 more natural and this is more saturated 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.830
 we can see that it shines much more 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.470
 people tell me why this same thing I do not know 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.390
 what do not I do not really know if there is a certain 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.640
 difference in colors 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.630
 bright you have to accept that the oled 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.420
 it looks better than the ips we lower the brightness 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.950
 to the maximum and we can also see a 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.480
 small difference that really does not 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.060
 a lot of it does not feel to be not having 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.660
 really the screens but what if 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.660
 what we see is that the next color 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.500
 it's the green although in this case we're 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.920
 seeing that the green is one more green 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.230
 phosphorus which usually use more 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.260
 phosphorus this one looks more forced to do 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.450
 a green plus this more grass I do not know 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.439
 really if you see them like this the people will 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.780
 attracts more this the ip the super amoled of 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.099
 the ips but to practice it is already 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.930
 another thing 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.909
 we see the blue that there really is not much 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.739
 difference I see it the same but good 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.720
 we can go down to the next one this is a 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.640
 important point to consider that they are the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.459
 whites because the whites because the 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.650
 whites on an ips screen are more 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.409
 natural compared to a screen 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.829
 super amoled that then I the greens 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:46.049
 other jealous people yellow as 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.659
 It depends on every outline of the eye of each 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.519
 who and this one is a little more screen 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.720
 bright so that's kind of like 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.360
 everyone 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.940
 in the following we can see in this is 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.290
 gray in our grays on the screen 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.470
 they do not look very different and that's how it looks 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.620
 note a certain difference this is clearer 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.140
 This is a little darker tones that are 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.730
 totally different from gray is more 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.610
 to the sun bear this one can say that it is 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.600
 more yellow or I do not know the truth here is 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.870
 where he wins above all the game the 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:28.110
 ips ala amoled to see if the brightness is 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.129
 to the maximum we can see that it is 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.110
 is 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.969
 is not in the division is not in the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.729
 division may be off the screen 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:39.399
 and they will not realize it then it's a 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.819
 of the advantages that blacks in the 

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:45.729
 super amoled are this more possible more 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:48.669
 dark or the pixel is turned off by 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.259
 say it this way in this one not in this one has a 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.539
 backlighting that will always be 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.580
 no matter how dark the color is 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:58.839
 there's always a backlight for the 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.869
 back part making more brightness than 

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:04.749
 these blacks on this screen are not 

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:06.309
 very compared are more than one tfc it 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:10.149
 may notice a difference because the 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:15.059
 tdt is brighter then this black 

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:15.059
 shines more or we move on to the next 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.490
 well those are in the matter 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.810
 Well now we can visual 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.810
 increase a little the screen of this and 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:33.020
 increase the screen of this block 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:37.930
 there it is ok now let's see some 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.930
 images that say here 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:49.550
 I'm not going to download you 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:53.820
 100 downloads let's start with this one 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:58.110
 although we can see the images 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:00.060
 ok in this we see here good in this 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.150
 month is 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.630
 picture we can see that the video or 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.930
 itself is more natural in the super amoled 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:13.500
 since the blue ones look very good in 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.720
 this look a little green and like 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.720
 is missing then really in this 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.880
 screen in this part I give it good 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:25.750
 I like more personally the ips 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:28.350
 in this in this we can see here in this 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.350
 act
