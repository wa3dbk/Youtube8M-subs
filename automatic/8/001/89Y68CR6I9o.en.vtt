back<00:00:27.210> into<00:00:27.510> our<00:00:27.630> food<00:00:27.810> after<00:00:28.199> we've<00:00:28.349> been

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
back into our food after we've been

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.650 
back into our food after we've been
eating<00:00:28.859> organic<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.609> cooking<00:00:30.060> healthy<00:00:30.449> meals

eating organic and cooking healthy meals

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.110 
eating organic and cooking healthy meals
I<00:00:30.990> found<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> long-sought<00:00:32.550> solution

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
I found that the long-sought solution

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.410 
I found that the long-sought solution
was<00:00:33.590> titanium<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:35.460> may<00:00:36.000> look<00:00:36.210> like<00:00:36.270> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
was titanium this may look like a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.000 
was titanium this may look like a
chemical<00:00:36.930> coating<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.530> pan<00:00:37.710> but<00:00:37.890> it's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
chemical coating on this pan but it's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.410 
chemical coating on this pan but it's
not<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.340> actually<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.700> layer<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.270> titanium

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
not it's actually a layer of titanium

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.330 
not it's actually a layer of titanium
over<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> thermal<00:00:40.829> aluminum<00:00:41.399> core<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:43.340> that

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
over a thermal aluminum core and that

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.940 
over a thermal aluminum core and that
particular<00:00:45.180> core<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.899> surface<00:00:46.410> provides<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
particular core and surface provides a

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.280 
particular core and surface provides a
really<00:00:47.399> nice<00:00:47.579> even<00:00:48.800> temperature

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.560 

I<00:00:52.380> also<00:00:52.650> point<00:00:53.040> out<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.490> titanium<00:00:54.420> is

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
I also point out to you that titanium is

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.500 
I also point out to you that titanium is
totally<00:00:55.050> inert<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.740> the<00:00:55.830> human<00:00:56.070> body<00:00:56.280> so

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
totally inert in the human body so

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.610 
totally inert in the human body so
there's<00:00:57.510> nothing<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.080> that's<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
there's nothing in here that's going to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.600 
there's nothing in here that's going to
leach<00:00:59.220> into<00:00:59.490> your<00:00:59.730> food<00:01:00.920> this<00:01:01.920> shows<00:01:02.580> that

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
leach into your food this shows that

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.479 
leach into your food this shows that
it's<00:01:03.060> ass<00:01:03.390> hot<00:01:03.840> right<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.370> on

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it's ass hot right here as it is here on

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.460 
it's ass hot right here as it is here on
the<00:01:05.640> edges<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> pan<00:01:06.300> by<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.050> way<00:01:07.230> that<00:01:07.380> it

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the edges of the pan by the way that it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.350 
the edges of the pan by the way that it
reacted<00:01:07.800> to<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.980> pattern<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.520> you'll<00:01:09.240> also

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
reacted to the pattern and you'll also

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.820 
reacted to the pattern and you'll also
notice<00:01:09.660> that<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.900> did<00:01:10.050> not<00:01:10.170> put<00:01:10.350> any<00:01:10.440> grease<00:01:10.710> or

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
notice that I did not put any grease or

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.390 
notice that I did not put any grease or
oil<00:01:10.890> into<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.340> pan<00:01:11.550> and<00:01:11.880> yet<00:01:12.840> no<00:01:13.229> sticking<00:01:13.530> so

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
oil into the pan and yet no sticking so

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.640 
oil into the pan and yet no sticking so
that<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.910> slides<00:01:15.120> right<00:01:15.270> out<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that just slides right out and the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.820 
that just slides right out and the
cleanup<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:17.640> simple<00:01:17.910> as<00:01:18.590> wiping<00:01:19.590> out<00:01:19.710> with

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
cleanup is as simple as wiping out with

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.510 
cleanup is as simple as wiping out with
a<00:01:19.860> paper<00:01:20.040> towel<00:01:21.170> I'm<00:01:22.170> going<00:01:22.440> to<00:01:22.560> put<00:01:22.740> cheese<00:01:23.250> on

that's<00:01:30.869> melting<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.130> hot<00:01:32.340> metal<00:01:32.640> surface

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
that's melting on that hot metal surface

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.859 
that's melting on that hot metal surface
this<00:01:34.380> does<00:01:35.040> not<00:01:35.220> stick<00:01:35.580> it<00:01:36.330> sticks<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.780> the

this does not stick it sticks to the
stainless<00:01:37.140> steel<00:01:37.470> fork<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.860> I'm<00:01:38.009> using<00:01:38.250> but

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
stainless steel fork that I'm using but

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.650 
stainless steel fork that I'm using but
not<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.570> titanium<00:01:40.080> surface<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.360> I'm

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
not the titanium surface and then I'm

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.790 
not the titanium surface and then I'm
going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.810> add<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> little<00:01:43.229> bit<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.410> egg<00:01:44.090> and

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
going to add a little bit of egg and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.280 
going to add a little bit of egg and
show<00:01:46.800> you<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.160> no<00:01:47.759> grease<00:01:48.000> or<00:01:48.150> oil<00:01:48.330> is<00:01:48.720> needed

our pans are hand cast in Germany and
they're<00:01:57.360> poured<00:01:57.630> right<00:01:57.870> into<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> handle<00:01:58.800> so

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
they're poured right into the handle so

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.310 
they're poured right into the handle so
there<00:01:59.790> are<00:01:59.940> no<00:02:00.060> rivets<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.570> screws<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:01.110> so

there are no rivets or screws here so

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.080 
there are no rivets or screws here so
your<00:02:01.470> handles<00:02:01.770> will<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.040> become<00:02:02.430> loose<00:02:02.729> like

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
your handles will not become loose like
