00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.350 

what<00:00:01.170> makes<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.979> formula<00:00:02.639> different<00:00:03.149> from

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
what makes this formula different from

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.390 
what makes this formula different from
other<00:00:03.570> four<00:00:03.870> months<00:00:04.170> this<00:00:04.319> year<00:00:04.380> so<00:00:05.279> what

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
other four months this year so what

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.010 
other four months this year so what
makes<00:00:05.549> this<00:00:05.730> one<00:00:05.790> different<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:06.690> it's

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
makes this one different is that it's

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.600 
makes this one different is that it's
going<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.170> be<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.350> closest<00:00:07.919> full<00:00:08.220> moon<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.429> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
going to be the closest full moon of the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.490 
going to be the closest full moon of the
calendar<00:00:09.090> year<00:00:09.120> as<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.570> all<00:00:09.690> know<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.320> moon's

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
calendar year as we all know the moon's

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.810 
calendar year as we all know the moon's
orbit<00:00:10.800> around<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.160> Earth<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.429> not<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> perfect

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
orbit around the Earth is not a perfect

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.999 
orbit around the Earth is not a perfect
circle<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.660> when<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.019> moon<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.740> going

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
circle so this is when the moon is going

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.019 
circle so this is when the moon is going
to<00:00:14.070> be<00:00:14.250> at<00:00:14.490> its<00:00:14.730> closest<00:00:15.210> approach<00:00:15.379> of<00:00:16.379> course

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
to be at its closest approach of course

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.460 
to be at its closest approach of course
the<00:00:18.029> moon<00:00:18.210> when<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.539> orbits<00:00:19.140> around<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.380> earth

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
the moon when it orbits around the earth

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.769 
the moon when it orbits around the earth
of<00:00:19.770> changes<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.369> apparent<00:00:20.850> size<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.480> viewers

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
of changes in apparent size to viewers

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.109 
of changes in apparent size to viewers
on<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> earth<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.590> over<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> weekend<00:00:24.000> we're

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
on the earth so over the weekend we're

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.790 
on the earth so over the weekend we're
going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> closest<00:00:25.109> full<00:00:25.500> moon<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
going to have the closest full moon the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.460 
going to have the closest full moon the
perigee<00:00:26.279> full<00:00:26.519> moon<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.289> it's<00:00:28.289> going<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
perigee full moon and it's going to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.529 
perigee full moon and it's going to
appear<00:00:28.560> about<00:00:28.890> fourteen<00:00:29.760> percent<00:00:30.000> larger

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
appear about fourteen percent larger

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.540 
appear about fourteen percent larger
thirty<00:00:31.170> percent<00:00:31.500> brighter<00:00:31.859> than<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
thirty percent brighter than the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.880 
thirty percent brighter than the
smallest<00:00:33.030> full<00:00:33.390> moon<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.809> year<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.770> it

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
smallest full moon of the year so it

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.810 
smallest full moon of the year so it
should<00:00:35.010> be<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.130> noticeable<00:00:35.309> noticeable

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
should be a noticeable noticeable

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.250 
should be a noticeable noticeable
difference<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:36.570> people<00:00:36.690> who<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.050> used<00:00:37.200> to

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
difference for people who are used to

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.590 
difference for people who are used to
looking<00:00:37.469> at<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.680> moon<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.239> isn't<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
looking at the moon and this isn't the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.319 
looking at the moon and this isn't the
only<00:00:39.690> super<00:00:40.500> moon<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.129> year<00:00:41.430> right<00:00:42.090> is

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
only super moon of the year right is

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
only super moon of the year right is
this<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.230> closest<00:00:43.770> but<00:00:44.489> it's

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
this is this the closest but it's

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.459 
this is this the closest but it's
because<00:00:45.300> there<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.809> think<00:00:45.870> there's<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.200> super

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
because there is I think there's a super

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.959 
because there is I think there's a super
moon<00:00:46.590> last<00:00:46.860> month<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.610> think<00:00:47.850> they're

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
moon last month and I think they're

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.790 
moon last month and I think they're
supposed<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> point<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.899> coming<00:00:49.350> up<00:00:49.410> next

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
supposed to be a point of coming up next

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.790 
supposed to be a point of coming up next
month<00:00:50.329> yeah<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.539> definition<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.379> super<00:00:52.680> moon

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
month yeah the definition of super moon

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.400 
month yeah the definition of super moon
has<00:00:52.949> gotten<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.250> little<00:00:53.460> muddied<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
has gotten a little muddied this is the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.010 
has gotten a little muddied this is the
super<00:00:55.860> moon<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.250> superest<00:00:56.730> super<00:00:57.300> moon<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
super moon the superest super moon the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.689 
super moon the superest super moon the
two<00:00:58.379> full<00:00:58.590> moons<00:00:58.739> around<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.430> are<00:00:59.579> also

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
two full moons around this one are also

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.910 
two full moons around this one are also
close<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.390> not<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.690> closest<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.379> by<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
close but not the closest so by the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.219 
close but not the closest so by the
strict<00:01:02.340> definition<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.510> super<00:01:03.780> moon<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:04.170> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
strict definition of a super moon or a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.440 
strict definition of a super moon or a
perigee<00:01:04.619> full<00:01:04.979> moon<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.090> weekend

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
perigee full moon this one this weekend

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.940 
perigee full moon this one this weekend
is<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> closest<00:01:07.470> full<00:01:07.680> moon<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
is going to be the closest full moon of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.770 
is going to be the closest full moon of
the<00:01:08.010> year<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> others<00:01:08.490> are<00:01:08.640> spectacular<00:01:08.850> but

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the year the others are spectacular but

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.080 
the year the others are spectacular but
not<00:01:09.930> quite<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.200> close<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.939> so

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
not quite as close as this one and so

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.420 
not quite as close as this one and so
how<00:01:12.210> close<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.720> how<00:01:13.140> many<00:01:13.860> more<00:01:14.130> miles

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
how close is that how many more miles

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.120 
how close is that how many more miles
towards<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.390> Earth<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> very<00:01:16.650> oh

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
towards the Earth is so it's a very oh

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.670 
towards the Earth is so it's a very oh
it's<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.790> very<00:01:17.970> subtle<00:01:18.270> difference<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.500> only

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it's a very subtle difference it's only

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.820 
it's a very subtle difference it's only
on<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> scale<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.850> few<00:01:21.210> actually<00:01:22.080> tens<00:01:22.680> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
on the scale of a few actually tens of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.980 
on the scale of a few actually tens of
kilometers<00:01:23.460> closer<00:01:24.060> than<00:01:24.390> other<00:01:24.540> full<00:01:24.810> moons

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
kilometers closer than other full moons

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.280 
kilometers closer than other full moons
in<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.170> course<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> year<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:27.630> course<00:01:27.900> you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
in the course of the year of course you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.560 
in the course of the year of course you
know<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> moon's<00:01:28.890> orbit<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:29.970> actually<00:01:30.270> pretty

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
know the moon's orbit is actually pretty

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.330 
know the moon's orbit is actually pretty
close<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.020> being<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.320> perfect<00:01:31.710> circle<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.189> it's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
close to being a perfect circle so it's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.730 
close to being a perfect circle so it's
not<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> tremendous<00:01:33.540> difference<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.500> again

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
not a tremendous difference but again

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.990 
not a tremendous difference but again
for<00:01:34.890> people<00:01:35.130> who<00:01:35.220> are<00:01:35.280> trained<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.670> looking<00:01:35.909> at

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
for people who are trained at looking at

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.969 
for people who are trained at looking at
the<00:01:36.060> moon<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.240> look<00:01:36.479> at<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> moon<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.079> lot<00:01:37.500> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the moon and look at the moon a lot you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.170 
the moon and look at the moon a lot you
might<00:01:38.100> actually<00:01:38.250> notice<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.759> difference<00:01:38.909> but

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
might actually notice a difference but

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.429 
might actually notice a difference but
of<00:01:39.299> course<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.600> also<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.020> wonderful

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
of course it's also just a wonderful

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.109 
of course it's also just a wonderful
time<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.250> clear<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.729> out<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.030> look

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
time if it's clear to get out and look

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.660 
time if it's clear to get out and look
at<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.360> moon<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:44.009> kind<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.250> servers<00:01:44.549> on

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
at the moon so what kind of servers on

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.550 
at the moon so what kind of servers on
my<00:01:44.759> dad<00:01:44.909> would<00:01:45.030> expect<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.420> see<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.689> mean<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.049> do

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
my dad would expect to see I mean I do

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.160 
my dad would expect to see I mean I do
you<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.710> any<00:01:46.860> tips<00:01:47.340> or<00:01:47.579> any<00:01:47.909> time<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.990> out

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
you have any tips or any time to go out

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.560 
you have any tips or any time to go out
during<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.590> night<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.040> able<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.310> see<00:01:50.570> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
during the night to be able to see the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.630 
during the night to be able to see the
then<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.020> went<00:01:52.110> at<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.070> very<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
then we went at all in all it's very I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.940 
then we went at all in all it's very I
think<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> best<00:01:54.689> time<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.049> go<00:01:55.140> out<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.439> right

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
think the best time to go out is right

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.100 
think the best time to go out is right
after<00:01:56.100> sunset<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.149> when<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.630> moon<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.810> rising

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
after sunset so when the moon is rising

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.950 
after sunset so when the moon is rising
in<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.439> east<00:01:58.850> if<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> clear<00:02:00.360> horizon

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
in the east if you have a clear horizon

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.530 
in the east if you have a clear horizon
get<00:02:01.290> out<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.799> check<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.369> out<00:02:02.490> should<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.509> a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
get out and check it out should be a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.639 
get out and check it out should be a
great<00:02:03.659> show<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.960> course<00:02:04.049> any<00:02:04.229> time<00:02:04.290> at<00:02:04.530> night

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
great show of course any time at night

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.810 
great show of course any time at night
when<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.829> moon<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.040> high<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> sky<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
when the moon is high in the sky is a

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.990 
when the moon is high in the sky is a
wonderful<00:02:06.240> time<00:02:06.360> as<00:02:06.570> well<00:02:06.750> hey<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
wonderful time as well hey and I so the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.639 
wonderful time as well hey and I so the
moon<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.780> actually<00:02:09.899> kind<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.259> running<00:02:10.560> up

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
moon is actually kind of running up

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.880 
moon is actually kind of running up
against<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.099> perseid

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
against the perseid

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.120 
against the perseid
meteor<00:02:12.100> shower<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.610> year<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:14.050> do<00:02:14.440> when<00:02:14.920> does

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
meteor shower this year so do when does

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.160 
meteor shower this year so do when does
the<00:02:15.280> min<00:02:15.430> set<00:02:15.760> do<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.060> have<00:02:16.150> any<00:02:16.360> tips<00:02:16.540> for<00:02:16.720> for

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
the min set do you have any tips for for

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.320 
the min set do you have any tips for for
people<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.530> can<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.770> want<00:02:18.010> get<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> clear<00:02:19.060> view

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
people that can I want get a clear view

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.050 
people that can I want get a clear view
of<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.569> meteor<00:02:20.530> shower<00:02:20.770> yeah<00:02:21.730> that's<00:02:21.910> going

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
of the meteor shower yeah that's going

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.520 
of the meteor shower yeah that's going
to<00:02:22.120> be<00:02:22.209> tough<00:02:22.390> with<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.720> full<00:02:22.900> moon<00:02:23.050> being<00:02:23.260> so

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
to be tough with the full moon being so

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.960 
to be tough with the full moon being so
bright<00:02:23.740> it's<00:02:23.980> going<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.160> wash<00:02:24.340> out<00:02:24.610> some<00:02:24.850> of

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
bright it's going to wash out some of

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.610 
bright it's going to wash out some of
the<00:02:25.030> meteor<00:02:25.300> shower<00:02:25.569> unfortunately<00:02:26.470> because

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
the meteor shower unfortunately because

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.020 
the meteor shower unfortunately because
it<00:02:26.740> is<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> full<00:02:27.130> moon<00:02:27.160> it's<00:02:27.550> going<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.730> be

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
it is a full moon it's going to be

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.270 
it is a full moon it's going to be
setting<00:02:28.480> just<00:02:28.750> about<00:02:28.930> is<00:02:29.110> when<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.980> earth<00:02:30.100> is

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
setting just about is when the earth is

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.160 
setting just about is when the earth is
of<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.640> Sun<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:30.970> about<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.209> rise<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:31.930> you're

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
of the Sun is about to rise so you're

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.900 
of the Sun is about to rise so you're
not<00:02:32.260> going<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.530> have<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> lot<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:32.920> darkness<00:02:33.430> my

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
not going to have a lot of darkness my

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.980 
not going to have a lot of darkness my
suggestion<00:02:34.360> would<00:02:34.540> be<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.780> wait<00:02:34.959> until

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
suggestion would be the wait until

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.990 
suggestion would be the wait until
potentially<00:02:35.830> early<00:02:36.160> next<00:02:36.400> week<00:02:36.670> as<00:02:36.850> the

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
potentially early next week as the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.960 
potentially early next week as the
perseids<00:02:37.420> start<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> tail<00:02:38.110> off<00:02:38.350> possibly<00:02:39.100> the

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
perseids start to tail off possibly the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.220 
perseids start to tail off possibly the
moon<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.209> going<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.420> be<00:02:40.480> less<00:02:40.690> full<00:02:40.930> less

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
moon is going to be less full less

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.110 
moon is going to be less full less
bright<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.800> there<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.400> might<00:02:42.550> be<00:02:42.700> treated<00:02:42.850> to

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
bright and there you might be treated to

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.210 
bright and there you might be treated to
a<00:02:43.150> better<00:02:43.660> person<00:02:44.140> show<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:45.010> this

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
a better person show it is this

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.979 
a better person show it is this
unfortunate<00:02:45.880> coincidence<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.570> time<00:02:46.750> that

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
unfortunate coincidence in time that

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.740 
unfortunate coincidence in time that
these<00:02:47.080> two<00:02:47.260> things<00:02:47.410> are<00:02:47.560> happening<00:02:47.980> now<00:02:48.100> but

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
these two things are happening now but

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.410 
these two things are happening now but
it's<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.840> good<00:02:50.019> time<00:02:50.170> for<00:02:50.200> sky<00:02:50.500> watchers<00:02:51.420> great

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
it's a good time for sky watchers great

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.240 
it's a good time for sky watchers great
and<00:02:52.660> then<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:53.050> there<00:02:53.290> anything<00:02:53.590> special<00:02:53.950> or

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
and then is there anything special or

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.550 
and then is there anything special or
strange<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.940> happens<00:02:55.630> during<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.930> super<00:02:56.080> hard

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
strange that happens during a super hard

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.910 
strange that happens during a super hard
for<00:02:56.830> tidal<00:02:57.430> forces<00:02:57.820> any<00:02:58.239> any<00:02:58.570> greater<00:02:59.230> is<00:02:59.769> it

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
for tidal forces any any greater is it

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.520 
for tidal forces any any greater is it
all<00:03:00.010> kind<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.820> same<00:03:01.200> yeah<00:03:02.200> but<00:03:02.380> any

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
all kind of the same yeah but any

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.440 
all kind of the same yeah but any
effects<00:03:03.250> on<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.459> earther<00:03:03.730> are<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.180> subtle

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
effects on the earther are so subtle
