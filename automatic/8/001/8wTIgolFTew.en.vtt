 so many things that the baby is new 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.539
 if you have a little brother if we are 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:31.149

 alter your nutrition on the contrary you're going 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.300
 to help is very simple and I 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.820
 I recommend that you take it before the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.770
 breakfast and if necessary also before 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.839
 of food and before dinner there is no 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.000
 No problem with the quantity we are going to 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.880
 use 4 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.620
 of 4 oranges that I already have here just 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.020
 squeezed is much better though it's going to 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.200
 To spare a little is for a glass two 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.570
 glasses more or less an orange one 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.770
 orange an apple and an apple let's go 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:27.340
 to use it in pieces without the heart and not 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.170
 We are going to appeal to take advantage of 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.850
 apple fiber also two 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.080
 spoonfuls of raw oatmeal and a 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.330
 spoonful of wheat bran 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.420
 we already have the juice as I mentioned 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.260
 here and here you see it and the apple we're going 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.450
 to cut into small pieces so that 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.450
 it is easier to liquefy it 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.000
 the center of the apple we do not use it 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.310
 place first in the blender as 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.979
 always the fluids this is going to facilitate 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.069
 the liquefied especially when there are things 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.310
 solid like apples and oats and has 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.560
 saved that we are going to place first 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.560
 always always remember in any 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.740
 liquefied first is liquid 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.520
 two spoons 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.520
 and oats 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.360
 a spoonful of wheat bran 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:42.500
 and finally the apple I recommend 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.500
 that you put half we liquefy 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.180
 and we're going to finally put the other half 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.180
 of the Apple 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.010
 suddenly we heard that oats 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:05.040
 fattening that this is not so good for 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.530
 the diets if it's raw is great and 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.530
 especially if you are nursing if you are 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.170
 oats nursing you 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.430
 it will keep you with more energy because 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.430
 It is a time of much wear 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.360
 and do not worry because the guards 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.720
 and we have our delicious 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.890
 liquefied for quarantine and can also 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.750
 be for quarantine can you 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.750
 share your children and your spouse 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.060
 this liquefied on purpose we are not going to 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.340
 strain to take advantage of all the fiber of 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.340
 the apple the oats and the bran 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.410
 I am and benavidez and remember that we are what 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.410
 what we eat
