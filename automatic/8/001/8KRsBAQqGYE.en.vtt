engine you want that hitting those oil

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.490 
engine you want that hitting those oil
holes<00:02:26.099> so<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.400> pushes<00:02:26.640> oil<00:02:26.939> for<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.329> rod<00:02:27.510> ends

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.850 

they<00:02:31.770> crank<00:02:32.190> out

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
they crank out
