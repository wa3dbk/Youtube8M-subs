due on the intermittent fasting idea the

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.429 
due on the intermittent fasting idea the
first<00:02:35.010> thing<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.250> really<00:02:35.430> put<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.909> into

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
first thing that really put that into

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.500 
first thing that really put that into
perspective<00:02:37.439> on<00:02:37.950> youtube<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.549> my<00:02:39.000> opinion<00:02:39.299> was

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
perspective on youtube in my opinion was

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.330 
perspective on youtube in my opinion was
low<00:02:39.659> carb<00:02:39.930> quarry<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.409> then<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:40.950> was<00:02:41.040> very

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
low carb quarry and then it was very

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.539 
low carb quarry and then it was very
much<00:02:41.730> popularized<00:02:42.359> by<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.689> hodgetwins<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:44.459> I

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
much popularized by the hodgetwins and I

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.740 
much popularized by the hodgetwins and I
believe<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.939> one<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.299> earlier<00:02:45.420> videos

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
believe in one of the earlier videos

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.569 
believe in one of the earlier videos
they<00:02:46.049> did<00:02:46.200> actually<00:02:46.379> credit<00:02:47.010> him<00:02:47.159> with<00:02:47.189> that

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
they did actually credit him with that

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.250 
they did actually credit him with that
