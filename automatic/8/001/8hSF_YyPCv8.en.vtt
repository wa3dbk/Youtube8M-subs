00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.630 
around here somewhere but I never use it
because<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> convenient<00:02:05.430> for<00:02:05.549> my

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
purposes I have trouble hiding it when

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.889 
purposes I have trouble hiding it when
I'm<00:02:08.039> pressing<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.520> button<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.629> photos

capturing the images but when you use
these<00:02:19.290> methods<00:02:19.499> you<00:02:19.769> still<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.159> to<00:02:20.280> go<00:02:20.459> back

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
these methods you still have to go back

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.059 
these methods you still have to go back
to<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.389> camera<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:22.109> see<00:02:22.139> what<00:02:22.319> image<00:02:22.889> you've

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:28.259 
software as well as review the images as

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:30.140 
software as well as review the images as
you<00:03:28.290> take<00:03:28.590> them<00:03:28.739> this<00:03:29.459> also<00:03:29.669> prevents<00:03:30.030> you

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
you take them this also prevents you

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.259 
you take them this also prevents you
from<00:03:30.180> running<00:03:30.509> back<00:03:30.629> and<00:03:30.810> forth<00:03:30.900> all<00:03:31.169> the<00:03:31.199> time

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
from running back and forth all the time

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.490 
from running back and forth all the time
so<00:03:33.269> those<00:03:33.449> are<00:03:33.569> just<00:03:33.599> some<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.109> ways<00:03:34.229> you

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
so those are just some of the ways you

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.809 
so those are just some of the ways you
can<00:03:34.590> make<00:03:34.769> yourself<00:03:34.889> portrait<00:03:35.430> session<00:03:35.729> a

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
can make yourself portrait session a

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.509 
can make yourself portrait session a
little<00:03:35.939> bit<00:03:36.150> easier<00:03:36.449> on<00:03:36.509> yourself<00:03:37.049> now<00:03:37.889> let's

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
little bit easier on yourself now let's

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.059 
little bit easier on yourself now let's
talk<00:03:38.669> about<00:03:38.790> one<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.120> my<00:03:39.209> tricks<00:03:39.739> when<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:40.769> are

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
talk about one of my tricks when you are

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.409 
talk about one of my tricks when you are
the<00:03:41.189> subject<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.729> can<00:03:41.879> be<00:03:41.970> difficult<00:03:42.329> to

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
the subject it can be difficult to

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.149 
the subject it can be difficult to
figure<00:03:42.569> out<00:03:42.720> how<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.109> set<00:03:43.349> your<00:03:43.470> camera<00:03:43.650> and

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
figure out how to set your camera and

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.949 
figure out how to set your camera and
one<00:03:44.639> of<00:03:44.729> the<00:03:44.790> biggest<00:03:45.030> challenges<00:03:45.389> for<00:03:45.449> me<00:03:45.629> is

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
one of the biggest challenges for me is

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.860 
one of the biggest challenges for me is
getting<00:03:46.349> the<00:03:46.650> focus<00:03:47.220> area<00:03:47.759> right<00:03:47.970> especially

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
getting the focus area right especially

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.509 
getting the focus area right especially
if<00:03:49.349> you<00:03:49.530> want<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.739> use<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:49.859> narrow<00:03:50.159> depth<00:03:50.370> of

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
if you want to use a narrow depth of

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.490 
if you want to use a narrow depth of
field<00:03:50.759> how<00:03:51.509> do<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:51.689> make<00:03:51.840> sure<00:03:52.019> you're<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.470> the

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
field how do you make sure you're in the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.159 
field how do you make sure you're in the
crisp<00:03:52.829> area<00:03:53.180> well<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.629> can<00:03:54.780> certainly<00:03:54.930> use

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
crisp area well you can certainly use

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.110 
crisp area well you can certainly use
some<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.680> technology<00:03:56.009> and<00:03:56.459> your<00:03:56.549> DSLR

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
some of the technology and your DSLR

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.199 
some of the technology and your DSLR
like<00:03:57.479> using<00:03:57.810> auto<00:03:58.349> area<00:03:58.829> auto<00:03:59.009> focus<00:03:59.489> where

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
like using auto area auto focus where

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.819 
like using auto area auto focus where
the<00:04:00.479> camera<00:04:00.780> will<00:04:00.930> make<00:04:01.049> an<00:04:01.169> educated<00:04:01.560> guess

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
the camera will make an educated guess

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.909 
the camera will make an educated guess
that<00:04:02.699> helps<00:04:02.819> a<00:04:03.000> lot<00:04:03.199> but<00:04:04.199> one<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.530> my<00:04:04.709> biggest
