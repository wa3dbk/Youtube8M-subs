without<00:00:35.170> hooking<00:00:35.440> trace<00:00:36.420> right<00:00:37.420> now<00:00:37.989> when<00:00:38.500> you

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
without hooking trace right now when you

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:39.660 
without hooking trace right now when you
put<00:00:38.739> your<00:00:38.769> line<00:00:38.980> through<00:00:39.309> the<00:00:39.429> eye<00:00:39.460> of<00:00:39.550> the

you come through the front of the hook

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.340 
you come through the front of the hook
when<00:00:45.429> you<00:00:45.579> pull<00:00:45.879> up<00:00:45.910> it's<00:00:46.480> going<00:00:46.719> to<00:00:46.749> twist<00:00:47.109> us

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
when you pull up it's going to twist us

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
hook it's um it's not doing as an

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.369 
hook it's um it's not doing as an
effective<00:00:57.699> job<00:00:57.760> as<00:00:58.569> if<00:00:58.809> it's<00:00:58.960> coming<00:00:59.019> through

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
effective job as if it's coming through

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:00.540 
effective job as if it's coming through
the<00:00:59.440> front<00:00:59.469> so<00:00:59.829> come<00:01:00.010> through<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.280> front<00:01:00.309> of

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
the front so come through the front of

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.459 
the front so come through the front of
the<00:01:00.640> eye<00:01:00.670> give<00:01:01.539> yourself<00:01:01.839> about<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:02.079> foot<00:01:02.319> and<00:01:02.350> a

the eye give yourself about a foot and a
half<00:01:02.499> to<00:01:02.829> work<00:01:02.949> with<00:01:03.190> make<00:01:03.789> a<00:01:03.969> big<00:01:04.449> loop<00:01:05.190> see

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
half to work with make a big loop see

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.920 
half to work with make a big loop see
that<00:01:06.400> I've<00:01:06.520> got<00:01:06.670> a<00:01:06.700> big<00:01:06.909> loop<00:01:07.090> with<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.750> end

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
that I've got a big loop with the end

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.470 
that I've got a big loop with the end
sticking<00:01:08.229> down<00:01:09.010> past<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.910> year<00:01:10.120> of<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.240> hook

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
sticking down past the year of the hook

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.480 
sticking down past the year of the hook
just<00:01:10.510> like<00:01:10.840> that<00:01:11.050> ok<00:01:11.380> once<00:01:11.620> you've<00:01:11.800> made<00:01:12.430> your

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
just like that ok once you've made your

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.860 
just like that ok once you've made your
big<00:01:12.790> loop<00:01:13.060> you<00:01:13.900> want<00:01:14.050> to<00:01:14.140> punch<00:01:15.570> not<00:01:16.570> doing<00:01:16.810> a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
big loop you want to punch not doing a

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.330 
big loop you want to punch not doing a
very<00:01:16.900> good<00:01:17.110> job<00:01:17.260> of<00:01:17.500> showing<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.130> loop

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
very good job of showing you the loop

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.420 
very good job of showing you the loop
here<00:01:18.520> mi<00:01:18.820> here<00:01:19.240> we<00:01:19.360> go<00:01:19.480> there's<00:01:19.720> our<00:01:19.840> big<00:01:20.050> loop

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
here mi here we go there's our big loop

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.550 
here mi here we go there's our big loop
so<00:01:21.430> it<00:01:21.580> comes<00:01:21.760> through<00:01:22.090> here<00:01:22.390> through<00:01:22.570> the

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
so it comes through here through the

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.100 
so it comes through here through the
hook<00:01:23.710> big<00:01:24.160> loop<00:01:24.370> and<00:01:24.580> then<00:01:24.700> tail<00:01:24.970> okay<00:01:25.540> here's

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
hook big loop and then tail okay here's

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.080 
hook big loop and then tail okay here's
our<00:01:26.350> big<00:01:26.530> loop<00:01:26.710> right<00:01:26.950> there<00:01:27.190> gotta<00:01:27.850> pinch

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
our big loop right there gotta pinch

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.480 
our big loop right there gotta pinch
between<00:01:28.210> my<00:01:28.570> hand<00:01:28.900> okay<00:01:29.860> so<00:01:30.130> I'm<00:01:30.220> just<00:01:30.370> going

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
between my hand okay so I'm just going

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.340 
between my hand okay so I'm just going
to<00:01:30.550> pinch<00:01:30.790> it<00:01:30.850> with<00:01:31.000> that<00:01:31.180> hand<00:01:31.480> now<00:01:32.290> the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
to pinch it with that hand now the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.900 
to pinch it with that hand now the
reason<00:01:32.680> I've<00:01:32.890> got<00:01:33.040> such<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:33.250> big<00:01:33.490> loop<00:01:33.700> is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
reason I've got such a big loop is

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.150 
reason I've got such a big loop is
because<00:01:34.660> it<00:01:34.960> makes<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.350> easier<00:01:35.650> to<00:01:35.680> wind<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:36.040> on

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
because it makes it easier to wind it on

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.290 
because it makes it easier to wind it on
if<00:01:36.280> you've<00:01:36.400> got<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.550> bigger<00:01:36.790> if<00:01:37.030> you've<00:01:37.150> got<00:01:37.270> a

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
if you've got a bigger if you've got a

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.000 
if you've got a bigger if you've got a
smaller<00:01:37.600> that's<00:01:37.870> quite<00:01:38.050> finicky<00:01:38.320> okay<00:01:38.830> this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
smaller that's quite finicky okay this

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.500 
smaller that's quite finicky okay this

okay<00:02:42.720> Snelling<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.260> really<00:02:43.560> good<00:02:43.709> way<00:02:43.890> to

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
okay Snelling is a really good way to

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.790 
okay Snelling is a really good way to
tie<00:02:44.700> hooks<00:02:44.970> onto<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.239> end<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:46.050> bit<00:02:46.319> of<00:02:46.410> trace

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
tie hooks onto the end of a bit of trace

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.130 
tie hooks onto the end of a bit of trace
so<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.580> can<00:02:47.730> set<00:02:47.940> up<00:02:48.030> droplets<00:02:48.600> for<00:02:48.750> long<00:02:48.900> line

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
so you can set up droplets for long line

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.320 
so you can set up droplets for long line
so<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.440> just<00:02:49.680> tie<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.950> swivel<00:02:50.910> on<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.180> other

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
so you just tie a swivel on the other

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.530 
so you just tie a swivel on the other
