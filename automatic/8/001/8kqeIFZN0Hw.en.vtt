great<00:03:06.430> why<00:03:07.430> thing<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:07.849> that<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.330> machine

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
great why thing is that this machine

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.710 
great why thing is that this machine
really<00:03:08.989> works<00:03:09.290> well<00:03:09.620> it's<00:03:10.400> very<00:03:11.000> smooth<00:03:11.390> and

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
really works well it's very smooth and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.800 
really works well it's very smooth and
it's<00:03:11.870> very<00:03:12.140> quiet<00:03:12.470> because<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.540> twin<00:03:14.540> head

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
it's very quiet because of a twin head

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.460 
it's very quiet because of a twin head
it<00:03:15.709> only<00:03:15.920> applies<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:16.670> 116<00:03:17.450> decibels<00:03:17.989> which<00:03:18.260> is

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
it only applies it 116 decibels which is

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.759 
it only applies it 116 decibels which is
very<00:03:18.799> good<00:03:19.069> so<00:03:19.630> machine<00:03:20.630> itself<00:03:20.959> is<00:03:21.110> great<00:03:21.470> and

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
very good so machine itself is great and

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.180 
very good so machine itself is great and
the<00:03:22.430> tools<00:03:22.760> are<00:03:23.030> adequate<00:03:23.930> they're<00:03:24.709> not<00:03:24.860> great

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
the tools are adequate they're not great

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.240 
the tools are adequate they're not great
but<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.580> can<00:03:25.760> upgrade<00:03:25.910> them<00:03:26.330> if<00:03:26.450> you<00:03:26.630> wanted

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
but you can upgrade them if you wanted

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.299 
but you can upgrade them if you wanted
otherwise<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.310> think<00:03:28.549> it's<00:03:28.819> a<00:03:28.849> great<00:03:29.090> machine
