again<00:00:33.870> looks<00:00:34.140> pretty<00:00:34.350> bad<00:00:34.530> at<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.680> moment<00:00:34.710> but

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
again looks pretty bad at the moment but

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.670 
again looks pretty bad at the moment but
it<00:00:35.219> works<00:00:35.840> and<00:00:36.840> I'm<00:00:36.960> probably<00:00:37.290> gonna<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.649> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
it works and I'm probably gonna have to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.170 
it works and I'm probably gonna have to
spend<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.190> couple<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.489> months<00:00:38.640> tweaking<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
spend a couple of months tweaking the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.650 
spend a couple of months tweaking the

noise functions if car progress is any

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.860 
noise functions if car progress is any
indication<00:00:43.820> there's<00:00:44.820> no<00:00:44.969> texturing<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.660> here

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
indication there's no texturing on here

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.190 
indication there's no texturing on here
yet<00:00:46.670> so<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.600> fix<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.870> normal

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
yet so we just have to fix a normal

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.590 
yet so we just have to fix a normal
mapping<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.160> whatever<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.270> scattering

share<00:00:51.840> does<00:00:51.989> today<00:00:52.230> for<00:00:52.440> us<00:00:52.879> alright<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.030> is

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
share does today for us alright this is

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.119 
share does today for us alright this is
pretty<00:00:54.449> standard<00:00:54.719> looking<00:00:54.930> terrain<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.860> we're

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
pretty standard looking terrain so we're

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.720 
pretty standard looking terrain so we're
gonna<00:00:56.219> go<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> look<00:00:57.239> from<00:00:57.420> orbit<00:00:58.730> as

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
gonna go and have a look from orbit as

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.539 
gonna go and have a look from orbit as
you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.059> see<00:01:00.270> here<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> Sun<00:01:01.850> image<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:04.549> purely

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
you can see here the Sun image is purely

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.490 
you can see here the Sun image is purely
a<00:01:05.760> side<00:01:06.030> effect<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.600> massage<00:01:07.020> scattering

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
a side effect of that massage scattering

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.780 
a side effect of that massage scattering
shaders<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.310> come<00:01:08.460> out<00:01:08.610> with

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
shaders and as we come out with

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.580 
shaders and as we come out with
atmosphere<00:01:09.270> you'll<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> Sun<00:01:09.990> itself<00:01:10.320> own

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
atmosphere you'll see the Sun itself own

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.160 
atmosphere you'll see the Sun itself own
business<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.490> sprite<00:01:11.960> but<00:01:12.960> know

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
business that's just a sprite but know

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.289 
business that's just a sprite but know
it<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.890> scale<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.580> realistic<00:01:14.850> distance

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
it is to scale and a realistic distance

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.020 
it is to scale and a realistic distance
from<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.900> planet<00:01:16.200> which<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.070> about<00:01:17.700> an<00:01:17.909> earth

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
from this planet which is about an earth

orbit<00:01:19.670> from<00:01:20.670> orbit<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.689> see<00:01:22.170> some

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
orbit from orbit you can see some

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.920 
orbit from orbit you can see some
artifacts<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.240> water<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.110> that's<00:01:25.320> just

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
artifacts on the water but that's just

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.450 
artifacts on the water but that's just
bad<00:01:27.930> normal<00:01:28.350> calculation<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.159> fix<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
bad normal calculation we can fix that

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.910 
bad normal calculation we can fix that
fairly<00:01:29.790> simply<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.110> atmospheric

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
fairly simply so see the atmospheric

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.530 
fairly simply so see the atmospheric
shaders<00:01:32.310> don't<00:01:32.610> look<00:01:32.790> quite<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.119> good<00:01:33.360> from

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
shaders don't look quite as good from

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.620 
shaders don't look quite as good from
orbit<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.049> they<00:01:34.140> still<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> job<00:01:34.740> done

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630

in<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.600> bit<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.190> see<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.550> detail

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
in a bit and you can see the detail

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.449 
in a bit and you can see the detail
refining<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.870> back<00:02:13.200> out<00:02:13.410> again<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.310> all

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
refining and back out again and it all

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.289 
refining and back out again and it all
disappears<00:02:16.130> all<00:02:17.130> right<00:02:17.310> total<00:02:17.670> off<00:02:17.760> boyfriend

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
disappears all right total off boyfriend

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.509 
disappears all right total off boyfriend
bring<00:02:18.480> back<00:02:18.660> our<00:02:18.810> atmosphere<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.459> now<00:02:20.459> I'm

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
bring back our atmosphere so now I'm

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.910 
bring back our atmosphere so now I'm
gonna<00:02:20.610> demonstrate<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.180> noise<00:02:21.920> parameters

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
gonna demonstrate the noise parameters

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.400 
gonna demonstrate the noise parameters
again<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:23.819> is<00:02:23.970> just<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.239> single<00:02:24.630> rich

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
again this is just a single rich

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.759 
again this is just a single rich
multifractal<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.790> generate<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.390> planet<00:02:27.769> but

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
multifractal is generate the planet but

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.400 
multifractal is generate the planet but
we<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.519> connect<00:02:30.150> up<00:02:30.299> more<00:02:30.480> complex<00:02:30.840> noise<00:02:31.049> I

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
we can connect up more complex noise I

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.900 
we can connect up more complex noise I
flipped<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> parameters<00:02:32.459> up<00:02:32.579> to<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.730> GUI

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
flipped the parameters up to the GUI

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.569 
flipped the parameters up to the GUI
here<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.470> we<00:02:34.650> can't<00:02:34.920> play<00:02:35.160> around<00:02:35.280> a

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
here and so we can't play around a

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.170 
here and so we can't play around a
little<00:02:35.700> bit<00:02:37.549> as<00:02:38.549> you<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.849> see<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.060> whole

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
little bit as you can see the whole

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.059 
little bit as you can see the whole
planet<00:02:39.569> is<00:02:39.780> recalculated<00:02:40.290> with<00:02:40.650> parameters

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
planet is recalculated with parameters

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.610 
planet is recalculated with parameters
change<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.640> being<00:02:42.329> in<00:02:42.450> orbit<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> very<00:02:43.380> good

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
change so being in orbit is a very good

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.800 
change so being in orbit is a very good
thing<00:02:43.920> otherwise<00:02:44.310> it'll<00:02:44.609> take<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:45.420> know<00:02:45.510> 30

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
thing otherwise it'll take you know 30

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.120 
thing otherwise it'll take you know 30
40<00:02:46.170> seconds<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.680> whole<00:02:46.799> planet<00:02:47.100> to

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
40 seconds for the whole planet to

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.819 
40 seconds for the whole planet to
recalculate<00:02:50.510> as<00:02:51.510> with<00:02:51.690> any<00:02:51.840> noise<00:02:52.139> algorithm

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
recalculate as with any noise algorithm

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.360 
recalculate as with any noise algorithm
these<00:02:53.269> parameters<00:02:54.269> are<00:02:54.799> perfectly<00:02:55.799> sensitive

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
these parameters are perfectly sensitive

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.680 
these parameters are perfectly sensitive
and<00:02:56.670> completely<00:02:57.600> non-intuitive<00:02:58.639> so<00:02:59.690> actually

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
and completely non-intuitive so actually

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.840 
and completely non-intuitive so actually
finding<00:03:01.319> pleasant<00:03:03.859> images<00:03:04.859> is<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.100> bit<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:05.700> an

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
finding pleasant images is a bit of an

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:17.450 
finding pleasant images is a bit of an
issue

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.830 

we're<00:03:18.460> gonna<00:03:18.640> just<00:03:18.820> play<00:03:19.270> around<00:03:19.420> with<00:03:19.690> these

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
we're gonna just play around with these

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.690 
we're gonna just play around with these
a<00:03:19.870> little<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:22.860> then<00:03:23.860> we'll<00:03:24.040> go<00:03:24.160> back<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.550> to

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
a little and then we'll go back in to

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.130 
a little and then we'll go back in to
take<00:03:24.850> a<00:03:24.880> look<00:03:25.090> at<00:03:25.240> what<00:03:25.450> we've<00:03:25.660> managed<00:03:25.960> to

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
take a look at what we've managed to

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.130 
take a look at what we've managed to
accomplish<00:03:27.450> all<00:03:28.450> right<00:03:28.600> that<00:03:28.810> looks<00:03:28.870> good

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
accomplish all right that looks good

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.030 
accomplish all right that looks good
let's<00:03:29.410> go<00:03:29.710> in<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.490> this<00:03:31.470> continent<00:03:32.470> thing<00:03:32.710> here

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
let's go in to this continent thing here

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.630 
let's go in to this continent thing here
ah<00:03:34.650> she's<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.770> choppiness<00:03:36.100> at<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.400> frame

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
ah she's the choppiness at the frame

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:45.780 
ah she's the choppiness at the frame
rate<00:03:36.880> that<00:03:37.210> is<00:03:37.650> primarily<00:03:38.650> fraps<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:44.640> as<00:03:45.640> you

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
rate that is primarily fraps and as you

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.470 
rate that is primarily fraps and as you
can<00:03:45.880> see<00:03:45.940> we've<00:03:46.330> caused<00:03:47.790> more<00:03:48.790> features<00:03:49.240> of

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
can see we've caused more features of

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.110 
can see we've caused more features of
the<00:03:49.950> original<00:03:50.950> diffract<00:03:51.250> will<00:03:51.400> show<00:03:51.580> up<00:03:51.790> and

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
the original diffract will show up and

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.270 
the original diffract will show up and
the<00:03:52.570> effect<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:53.200> rule<00:03:53.440> isn't<00:03:53.650> very<00:03:54.040> pleasant

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
the effect of rule isn't very pleasant

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.020 
the effect of rule isn't very pleasant
so<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:56.890> wasn't<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.370> particularly<00:03:57.730> successful

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
so that wasn't a particularly successful

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.710 
so that wasn't a particularly successful
experiment<00:04:02.760> alright<00:04:03.760> folks<00:04:03.970> that's<00:04:04.330> pretty

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
experiment alright folks that's pretty

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.780 
experiment alright folks that's pretty
much<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.960> we've<00:04:05.110> got<00:04:05.230> time<00:04:05.440> for<00:04:05.650> today<00:04:05.920> so<00:04:06.100> I

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
much it we've got time for today so I

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.240 
much it we've got time for today so I
will<00:04:07.030> bid<00:04:07.570> you<00:04:07.600> farewell<00:04:07.720> if<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.980> have<00:04:09.070> any

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
will bid you farewell if you have any

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.800 
will bid you farewell if you have any
questions<00:04:09.580> or<00:04:09.670> comments<00:04:09.850> feel<00:04:10.270> free<00:04:10.300> to<00:04:10.600> post
