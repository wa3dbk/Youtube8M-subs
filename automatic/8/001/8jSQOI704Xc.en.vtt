00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.080
 hello today we are going to learn how to make a 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.260
 bicolor manicure 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.210
 I hope you like it 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.760
 to make our bicolor manicure 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.950
 We are going to need some guides that we 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.430
 help to delimit where you have to 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.070
 paint the nail a file a protector for 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.689
 to avoid that our nail is dyed and 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.860
 colors that you want to use and chosen 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.160
 these two pastel shades 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.330
 first lime we will make the nail 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.030
 until it has the desired shape and now 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.830
 the same first by the sides and then 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.090
 on the top that has a 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.430
 little squared but without any beak 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.340
 then we will throw a base 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.350
 protective to prevent our nail 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.350
 they become yellowish 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.390
 you can use a hardener 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.739
 a 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.090
 base to avoid the fluted according to 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.550
 characteristics of your wave 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.680
 then we will apply the enamel 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.680
 of the color that we want the base to have 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.180
 As you can see we left a blank that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.180
 let's do it in reverse 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.400
 let's paint green 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.580
 and with the tip rolled up once it 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.230
 has dried well make sure they are 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.659
 well very dry because if you do not 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.539
 spoil 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.609
 we can paste the guides leaving a 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.890
 distance according to our tastes to the 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.780
 people who like more chubby and there are 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.409
 people who like a more finite line 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.299
 as you see now has left finite 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.770
 once we have put all the guides 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:53.149
 we will mark the edge that we have left with 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.149
 the other color nail polish 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.850
 when the enamel is completely 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.020
 dry we can proceed to remove the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.020
 guides very carefully 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.329
 as you see, that would be the final result 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.329
 of our bicolor manicure
