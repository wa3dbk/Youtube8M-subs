00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello, my name is Irina Terentieva 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.690
 I am a teacher of the program from the children's studio 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.220
 Eco Club Umnichka today I will tell you 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.070
 how in our classes we draw with children 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.219
 transport aircraft will start probably in 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.820
 the plane will oval body children oval 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.420
 finger draws an oval then we draw 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.939
 plane tail with one finger draw 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.490
 striped tail but naturally 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.170
 aircraft need wings 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:33.540
 Until we draw the attention of the children that the wings have 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.520
 us a little turned side but worth 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:42.270
 draw the cockpit with your finger yes we 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.010
 remove excess sand and windows in the window 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.440
 can be laid out using pebbles 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.289
 for example, in our classes we use 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.640
 here are colorful troughs 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.649
 decorative can be done here right 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.000
 real cat turns glass 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.680
 need to do need to do colored children 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.539
 can choose and decorate their own 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.430
 the plane is sole discretion here 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.600
 so we are in class with the kids 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.320
 we draw planes well and let's perhaps 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.470
 let's draw with you another type of transport 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.530
 so to speak it will be a space rocket 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:25.110
 kids love to draw her first 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.540
 draw the case with two fingers we introduce 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.290
 one point well here too much 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.670
 remove the sand draw it like this 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.670
 make up the bottom step 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.310
 porthole window in our rocket can 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.899
 put with a pebble and whether we 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.210
 predict what let's say here we have 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.630
 astronaut sits can also be done 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.880
 fire our rocket takes off 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.470
 fire can draw with your fingers up to how 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.799
 i drew or can lay out at 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.060
 the help of colored sticks yes here you can 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.310
 invite children to choose 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.350
 matching colors yes that is exactly 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.229
 orange and yellow red what are there y 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.090
 there is such a person 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.890
 we got a great rocket 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.160
 you can add to it 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.160
 rods before stomped our fingers 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.720
 the rocket went into space like this 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.560
 manner in our classes we draw 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.560
 transport
