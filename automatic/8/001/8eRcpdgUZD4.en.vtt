00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 I'm going to show you the images and the 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.900
 codes of the vector letters of the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.550
 invies collection and more hidden challenges 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.340
 you can see the rest of the codes of this 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.340
 collection in a link that I leave in the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.730
 description of the video very well let's 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.730
 start 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:29.570
 vector bite we have fangs of 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.470
 t.rex reflective tooth teeth 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.470
 energy 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:40.150
 invocation of the eagle invoking totem 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.050
 predatory jaw 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:47.030
 burn vector 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.560
 embraced coal and zante fireball 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.520
 circle of fire 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.590
 blinding flash fire of assault this 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.720
 letter you see is metallic and the 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.760
 next also great flare 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.570
 protective 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:09.820
 fire wall vector loading 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.150
 claw evolution energy bubbles 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.150
 Accurate blow 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.730
 epic hammer diamond feathers 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.560
 earthquake 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.560
 toxic vectors 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.649
 dark water millennial ash blowpipe 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.720
 lethal toxic cloud sting venom 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.510
 dragon 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.700
 vector cut 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.560
 to 0 millennial energy cut shield 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.330
 cut 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:57.040
 shield of cut and this letter is metallic 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:59.400
 Skin sharp thorns of spider 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.310
 sharp blizzard 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.620
 and finally the sonic vectors that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.520
 would be sonic shield hurricane 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.520
 Wall 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.120
 cloud of expansive wave insects and 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.390
 ultrasound 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.819
 good and these are all the vectors that 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.849
 has the invizimals collection challenges 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.159
 hidden as discussed at the beginning 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:31.040
 I made a playlist with 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.650
 more videos showing the 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.720
 codes of the entire collection look at the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.950
 link that is in the description of 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.950
 video thank you very much
