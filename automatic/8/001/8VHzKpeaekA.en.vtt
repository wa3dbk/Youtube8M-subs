00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.889
 last moments on space 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:04.730
 stations 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.109
 his annual watch 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:08.279
 completed 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.459
 expedition commander astronaut scott kelly 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.479
 says goodbye to the space house 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.189
 Alexander Halimov 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.640
 Dmitry Kondratyev and others 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.279
 international space station 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.849
 he stays enough 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:23.930
 let's wait 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.930
 it's time to assume that Transbaikalia 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.039
 is it so simple 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.530
 recently 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.760
 they flew over japan 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.010
 another tradition start 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.570
 countries are the main sources of world 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.910
 news today 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.920
 possible therefore increased attention 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.920
 landing astronauts and there was no 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.339
 I think this is a return 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.580
 probably a test ship 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.460
 worked soft landing engines 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.460
 spacecraft descent vehicle 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.460
 union calls she is you 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.560
 oil such difficult train conditions 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.640
 spacecraft real 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.120
 rescue operation 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.030
 12 helicopters two aircraft 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.280
 scorching burned 5 about 30 people 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.490
 it is paid to let who fly 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.670
 lander two thousand degrees 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.540
 cosmonauts d 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.070
 it was hot 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.320
 crew misses 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.550
 under but was to leave ten not just like that 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.850
 are genetic stock 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.020
 until it is inside the device all 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.610
 goes like these interests but the apparatus 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.470
 makes its way inside the apparatus ahead of time 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.470
 hot under that is self landing 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.960
 ed. 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.500
 gets the ship commander alexander 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.440
 kaleri three years is the fifth soft 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.900
 landing 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.870
 each landing is marked 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.870
 they are all 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.460
 on average 50 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.340
 this generational relay to space 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.420
 went a total of 770 days 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.639
 more than two years further goes on record 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.919
 it will start at 12 00 in our country only 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:19.229
 it saves time now 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.379
 Pavel grapes seriously wary of 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.119
 flight control center 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:25.669
 he will soon be launched into orbit 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.569
 today preparing for his third 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.719
 flight means their landing preparation 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.649
 landing there yes and in terms of 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.149
 medicine 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:36.299
 me in terms of training 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.829
 centrifuge circulation 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.699
 necessarily pass but to remember 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:40.889
 according to 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.579
 overload is transferred as 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.239
 turned out to act 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.939
 it was the first flight of digital 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:48.390
 spacecraft 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.980
 new management system 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.939
 modernized Yaroshenko 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.809
 but the digital channel showed itself 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:56.199
 fine the whole program 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.409
 per day two seconds per second for sure 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:02.499
 soon a new one will go into orbit 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:03.320
 crew 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.100
 alexander samokutyaev andrey borisenko 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.359
 and astronaut nasa ronald garan 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.159
 Start of the anniversary of the city of Donetsk ship in 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.769
