00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.000

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.440
 black book on television, can not you? 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.810
 gain on other monitors a monitor 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.039
 a cable that enters the dispute 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.399
 macbook and exit hdmi is a 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.569
 said 'you run today 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.909
 of the time and such 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:30.880
 It's too expensive, it's time it was 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:33.250
 about 130 reais more or less this 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.500
 that I paid seven poles in him and he 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.520
 works perfectly the box does not have 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.620
 nothing to show 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:47.190
 the sale only converts of fear for the sport 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:47.190
 I will open the beauty academy here. 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.100
 this is the path that neither the same and 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.560
 show you how it works 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.290
 first you will connect the tip of the 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.430
 mini displayport in my play size 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:07.509
 your macbook and then with hdmi cable 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:11.140
 two tips connect one end of the 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:15.539
 your monitor or television and the other 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.539
 on the hdmi output of the adapter 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:25.490
 and ready you do not have to look for anything already 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.799
 is working but to configure the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.299
 resolutions on macbook changes resolution 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.509
 according to the monitor 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.810
 you go in system preferences 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:39.740
 monitors and you can choose resolution 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.140
 the monitor and also choose whether the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.159
 monitor will be a mirroring 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.380
 convince an an extension of the screen 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.069
 of the macbook so you can 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.200
 put something on the mac book screen 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.909

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.679
 your monitor your television
