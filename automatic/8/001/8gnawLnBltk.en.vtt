can use as well right at the moment

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.380 
can use as well right at the moment
we're<00:01:56.440> installing<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.979> with<00:01:57.100> spark<00:01:57.399> IV<00:01:57.789> I<00:01:58.000> will

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
we're installing it with spark IV I will

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.969 
we're installing it with spark IV I will
show<00:01:58.569> you<00:01:58.630> how<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.840> install<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.350> with<00:01:59.440> open<00:01:59.560> IV

show you how to install it with open IV

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.190 
show you how to install it with open IV
later<00:02:00.280> on<00:02:00.520> in<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.850> video<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.990> want<00:02:02.080> to

later on in the video you want to
extract<00:02:02.679> it<00:02:02.950> first<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:06.009> that<00:02:06.159> spark<00:02:06.460> iver<00:02:06.640> you

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
extract it first so that spark iver you

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.789 
extract it first so that spark iver you
can<00:02:06.909> see<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.270> files<00:02:07.509> as<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.200> program<00:02:08.560> can't

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
can see the files as the program can't

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.400 
can see the files as the program can't
read<00:02:09.130> archives<00:02:09.820> now<00:02:10.720> this<00:02:10.929> is<00:02:11.049> the<00:02:11.140> model

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
read archives now this is the model

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.430

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
these are the new models now looks to

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.539 
these are the new models now looks to
test<00:02:53.109> that<00:02:53.320> you've<00:02:53.500> installed<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.250> vehicle

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
test that you've installed the vehicle

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.130 
test that you've installed the vehicle
correctly<00:02:54.850> I'm<00:02:55.120> going<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.540> click<00:02:55.690> Edit<00:02:55.870> I'm<00:02:56.079> a

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
correctly I'm going to click Edit I'm a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.360 
correctly I'm going to click Edit I'm a
look<00:02:56.230> at<00:02:56.440> textures<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:56.980> see<00:02:57.100> if<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.280> looks

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
look at textures and see if it looks

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.190 
look at textures and see if it looks
similar<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:57.910> vehicle<00:02:58.299> as<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.870> can<00:02:59.019> see

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
similar to the vehicle as you can see

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.900 
similar to the vehicle as you can see
it's<00:02:59.320> obviously<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.920> Volvo<00:03:00.250> as<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.609> know<00:03:00.730> the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
it's obviously the Volvo as you know the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.020 
it's obviously the Volvo as you know the
ID<00:03:01.359> is<00:03:01.660> BMC<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.470> well<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.459> texture<00:03:03.820> pretty

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
ID is BMC and well that texture pretty

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.490 
ID is BMC and well that texture pretty
much<00:03:04.180> looks<00:03:04.420> like<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.570> texture<00:03:04.810> evolve<00:03:05.140> Volvo

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
much looks like a texture evolve Volvo

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.330 
much looks like a texture evolve Volvo
v40<00:03:05.890> so<00:03:06.190> yeah<00:03:06.519> do<00:03:07.239> not<00:03:07.630> rebuild<00:03:08.440> click<00:03:08.829> Save<00:03:09.130> do

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
v40 so yeah do not rebuild click Save do

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.189 
v40 so yeah do not rebuild click Save do
not<00:03:09.489> click<00:03:09.669> rebuild<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.419> easiest

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:11.199 
not click rebuild that is the easiest

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:19.380 
not click rebuild that is the easiest
way<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.590> make<00:03:12.130> your<00:03:12.340> folder<00:03:12.699> come<00:03:12.850> up

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.750 

but<00:03:20.020> that<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.319> not<00:03:20.440> finished<00:03:20.620> my<00:03:20.980> friends<00:03:21.460> you

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
but that is not finished my friends you

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.940 
but that is not finished my friends you
now<00:03:22.030> need<00:03:22.270> to<00:03:22.300> install<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:23.080> configuration

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
now need to install the configuration

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.680 
now need to install the configuration
files<00:03:24.250> otherwise<00:03:24.730> your<00:03:24.940> vehicle<00:03:25.300> will<00:03:25.390> flip

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
files otherwise your vehicle will flip

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.020 
files otherwise your vehicle will flip
over<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.319> you'll<00:03:27.160> get<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.310> few<00:03:27.490> more<00:03:27.670> bugs<00:03:27.850> in

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
over and you'll get a few more bugs in

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.410 
over and you'll get a few more bugs in
game

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
game

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.059 
game
so<00:03:28.540> while<00:03:28.780> dudes<00:03:28.990> are<00:03:29.080> open<00:03:29.350> up<00:03:29.440> config<00:03:29.830> lines

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
so while dudes are open up config lines

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.710 
so while dudes are open up config lines
other<00:03:30.760> models<00:03:31.180> might<00:03:31.330> put<00:03:31.569> these

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
other models might put these
