pretty<00:03:06.709> good<00:03:07.250> I<00:03:07.549> mean<00:03:07.900> it's<00:03:08.900> not<00:03:09.110> like<00:03:09.170> in<00:03:10.160> the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
pretty good I mean it's not like in the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.270 
pretty good I mean it's not like in the
show<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.299> was<00:03:11.480> doing<00:03:11.780> crazy<00:03:12.110> aerial<00:03:13.010> kicks

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
show it was doing crazy aerial kicks

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.759 
show it was doing crazy aerial kicks
like<00:03:13.549> a<00:03:13.610> charred<00:03:14.299> aku<00:03:14.780> too<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.320> stuff<00:03:15.620> like

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
like a charred aku too and stuff like

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.920 
like a charred aku too and stuff like
that<00:03:15.829> this<00:03:16.579> is<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.760> kind<00:03:17.239> of<00:03:17.390> like<00:03:17.600> cross

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
that this is a kind of like cross

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.590 
that this is a kind of like cross
between<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.950> mobile<00:03:19.579> suit<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:20.000> mobile<00:03:20.299> kind

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
between a mobile suit and a mobile kind

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.199 
between a mobile suit and a mobile kind
of<00:03:20.690> like<00:03:20.810> like<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.320> example<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:22.250> know<00:03:22.280> but

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
of like like the example you know but

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.560 
of like like the example you know but
this<00:03:23.690> one<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:24.109> can<00:03:24.260> obviously<00:03:24.560> move<00:03:25.570> better

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
this one it can obviously move better

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.110 
this one it can obviously move better
and<00:03:27.010> this<00:03:28.010> this<00:03:28.370> mobile<00:03:28.519> suit<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:28.850> actually

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
and this this mobile suit is actually

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.789 
and this this mobile suit is actually
made<00:03:29.269> just<00:03:29.480> for<00:03:29.660> space<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.320> seems<00:03:30.650> because

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
made just for space it seems because

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.979 
made just for space it seems because
there's<00:03:31.070> all<00:03:31.190> these<00:03:31.370> little<00:03:31.780> thrusters<00:03:32.780> all

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
there's all these little thrusters all

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.460 
there's all these little thrusters all
over<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:33.790> see<00:03:34.790> all<00:03:35.600> these<00:03:35.780> little<00:03:35.959> thrusters

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
over it see all these little thrusters

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.370 
over it see all these little thrusters
camera<00:03:38.440> all<00:03:39.440> over<00:03:39.859> it<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.820> can<00:03:41.019> move<00:03:42.019> all

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
camera all over it so it can move all

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.680 
camera all over it so it can move all
the<00:03:42.650> way<00:03:42.680> around<00:03:45.250> let's<00:03:46.250> see<00:03:46.489> you<00:03:47.269> got<00:03:47.450> some

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
the way around let's see you got some

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.670 
the way around let's see you got some
double<00:03:48.109> joints<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:48.500> elbows<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:50.420> arms<00:03:51.260> can<00:03:51.470> go

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
double joints and elbows the arms can go

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.390 
double joints and elbows the arms can go
about<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:52.790> high<00:03:53.030> up<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:53.920> are<00:03:54.920> on<00:03:55.340> a

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
about that high up and are on a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.890 
about that high up and are on a
ball-joint<00:03:57.190> oops<00:03:58.190> there<00:03:58.579> we<00:03:58.609> go<00:03:58.819> these<00:03:59.690> little

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
ball-joint oops there we go these little

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.490 
ball-joint oops there we go these little
shoulder<00:04:01.060> armor<00:04:02.060> dealies<00:04:02.420> can<00:04:02.989> go<00:04:03.140> about<00:04:03.260> that

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
shoulder armor dealies can go about that

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.979 
shoulder armor dealies can go about that
high<00:04:03.680> so<00:04:04.100> you<00:04:04.430> know<00:04:05.209> really<00:04:05.630> you<00:04:05.720> don't<00:04:05.870> have

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
high so you know really you don't have

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.240 
high so you know really you don't have
to<00:04:06.109> stretch<00:04:06.350> it<00:04:06.500> out<00:04:06.560> because<00:04:06.739> it<00:04:06.859> will<00:04:07.010> break

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
to stretch it out because it will break

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.920 
to stretch it out because it will break
off<00:04:09.310> talking<00:04:10.310> about<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.579> arm<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:11.510> head<00:04:12.519> 360

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
off talking about the arm the head 360

off talking about the arm the head 360
all<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.139> way<00:04:15.290> up<00:04:15.799> down<00:04:16.389> this<00:04:17.389> part<00:04:17.690> goes<00:04:17.810> up

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
all the way up down this part goes up
