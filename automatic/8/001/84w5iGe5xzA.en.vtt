00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
Chicago and then if you look that way

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.110 
Chicago and then if you look that way
there<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.770> view<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.430> lake<00:02:35.670> we<00:02:35.850> are<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.090> a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
there is a view of the lake we are on a

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.540 
there is a view of the lake we are on a
28th<00:02:36.630> floor<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:37.020> always<00:02:37.410> request<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:38.070> room<00:02:38.340> on

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
28th floor I always request a room on

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.750 
28th floor I always request a room on
the<00:02:38.670> highest<00:02:38.850> floor<00:02:39.390> because<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.950> prefer<00:02:41.640> the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
the highest floor because I prefer the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.540 
the highest floor because I prefer the
view<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.690> I'm<00:02:42.900> not<00:02:43.050> afraid<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.290> height<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.800> it

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
view and I'm not afraid of height so it

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.460 
view and I'm not afraid of height so it
works<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.180> then<00:02:45.270> if<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.480> look<00:02:45.660> I'm<00:02:46.170> trying

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
works and then if you look I'm trying

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.820 
works and then if you look I'm trying
get<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.800> focus<00:02:47.750> there<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:48.990> maybe<00:02:49.200> Pierce<00:02:49.620> so

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
get it to focus there is maybe Pierce so

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.230 
get it to focus there is maybe Pierce so
that<00:02:50.010> would<00:02:50.190> be<00:02:50.310> really<00:02:50.610> pretty<00:02:50.760> especially

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240
