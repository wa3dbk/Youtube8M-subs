00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
even wondered if it was black at first

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.380 
even wondered if it was black at first
as<00:03:05.530> opposed<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.040> blue<00:03:06.519> but<00:03:06.730> it's<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:06.910> very<00:03:07.090> very

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
as opposed to blue but it's a very very

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.310 
as opposed to blue but it's a very very
deep<00:03:07.690> blue<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.910> gray<00:03:10.150> dd<00:03:10.390> spun<00:03:10.840> they've<00:03:11.140> done

deep blue the gray dd spun they've done
Grey's<00:03:11.590> before<00:03:12.100> it's<00:03:12.820> nice<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.390> have<00:03:13.510> a

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.120 
right now I've got to start weeding them
down<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.220> little<00:03:30.430> bit<00:03:30.910> so<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:32.110> think<00:03:32.380> this<00:03:32.799> year

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
down a little bit so I think this year

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.030 
down a little bit so I think this year
this<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:33.850> it<00:03:34.180> it's<00:03:34.959> possible<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.500> could<00:03:35.560> wind<00:03:35.890> up

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
this is it it's possible I could wind up

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.699 
this is it it's possible I could wind up
with<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.280> DD<00:03:36.519> spawns<00:03:36.880> or<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.329> others<00:03:37.630> as<00:03:37.870> they

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
with the DD spawns or the others as they

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.580 
with the DD spawns or the others as they
hit<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.980> outlets<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.690> believe<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.079> as

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
hit the outlets and I believe that as

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.710 
hit the outlets and I believe that as
much<00:03:42.040> as<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.340> like<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.670> Spitfires<00:03:43.180> just<00:03:43.540> like

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
much as I like the Spitfires just like

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.250 
much as I like the Spitfires just like
last<00:03:43.959> year<00:03:44.380> they<00:03:45.280> hit<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.579> outlets<00:03:46.000> so<00:03:46.299> should

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
last year they hit the outlets so should

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.689 
last year they hit the outlets so should
have<00:03:47.320> doubled<00:03:47.620> up<00:03:47.709> on<00:03:47.889> that<00:03:48.040> red<00:03:48.190> checker<00:03:48.489> but

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
have doubled up on that red checker but

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:49.860 
have doubled up on that red checker but
oh<00:03:48.880> well

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
oh well

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.240
