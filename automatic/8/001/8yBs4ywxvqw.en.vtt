these<00:01:04.680> pieces<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.460> are<00:01:05.640> not<00:01:05.820> supposed<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.420> be

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
these pieces here are not supposed to be

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.280 
these pieces here are not supposed to be
on<00:01:08.119> now<00:01:09.119> am<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.390> suggest<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.840> put<00:01:10.080> them<00:01:10.200> on

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
on now am I suggest you put them on

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.109 
on now am I suggest you put them on
after<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> don't<00:01:11.100> see<00:01:11.310> any<00:01:11.460> reason<00:01:11.549> why<00:01:11.880> they

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
after I don't see any reason why they

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.350 
after I don't see any reason why they
can't<00:01:12.360> be<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.600> right<00:01:12.810> from<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> get-go<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:14.360> I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
can't be on right from the get-go so I I

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.679 
can't be on right from the get-go so I I
threw<00:01:15.810> them<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:16.020> there<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.470> think<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.610> saves<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
threw them on there I think that saves a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.219 
threw them on there I think that saves a
little<00:01:18.900> time<00:01:19.580> how<00:01:20.580> am<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.880> shows<00:01:21.689> how<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> adjust

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
little time how am I shows how to adjust

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.969 
little time how am I shows how to adjust
these<00:01:22.439> things<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.979> don't<00:01:23.100> really<00:01:23.490> get<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.979> I

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
these things I don't really get it but I

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.170 
these things I don't really get it but I
know<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.310> first<00:01:26.580> video<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.970> saw<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:29.180> did

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
know in the first video I saw it did

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.600 
know in the first video I saw it did
give<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.750> little<00:01:30.990> spring<00:01:31.409> back<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
give a little spring back here in the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.999 
give a little spring back here in the
you<00:01:32.850> know<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.869> roll<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.259> roller<00:01:34.650> down<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
you know as you roll the roller down the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.999 
you know as you roll the roller down the
steel<00:01:35.939> slat<00:01:36.270> was<00:01:36.450> coming<00:01:36.780> back<00:01:36.930> forward<00:01:37.890> this

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
steel slat was coming back forward this

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
steel slat was coming back forward this
way<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> suppose<00:01:39.329> you're<00:01:39.509> not<00:01:39.600> supposed<00:01:39.869> to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
way so I suppose you're not supposed to

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.910 
way so I suppose you're not supposed to
make<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.229> too<00:01:40.350> tight<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.920> couldn't<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:42.090> I

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
make it too tight I couldn't really I

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.719 
make it too tight I couldn't really I
couldn't<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> figure<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:44.610> they

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
couldn't have to figure out what they

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.950 
couldn't have to figure out what they
what<00:01:45.060> they<00:01:45.090> want<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:45.869> these

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
what they want you to do with these

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.130 
what they want you to do with these
things<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.939> have<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.890> adjusted<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:51.110> where<00:01:52.110> I

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
things so I have it adjusted to where I

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.200 
things so I have it adjusted to where I
think<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.710> makes<00:01:53.280> makes<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.790> actually<00:01:54.119> that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
think it makes makes it actually that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.319 
think it makes makes it actually that
that<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.540> kind<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.840> loops<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.880> seems<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.240> make

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
that one kind of loops it seems to make

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.420 
that one kind of loops it seems to make
sense<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.719> me<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.110> somewhat<00:01:58.950> tied<00:01:59.159> up

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
sense to me to have it somewhat tied up

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.710 
sense to me to have it somewhat tied up
too<00:01:59.670> tight<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.259> that<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.770> know

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
too tight so that you know

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.930 
too tight so that you know
so<00:02:03.350> let<00:02:03.560> these<00:02:03.740> rollers<00:02:04.130> kind<00:02:04.400> of<00:02:04.490> dirty<00:02:04.730> which

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
so let these rollers kind of dirty which

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.100 
so let these rollers kind of dirty which
is<00:02:05.060> probably<00:02:05.270> better<00:02:06.100> but<00:02:07.100> anyway<00:02:08.020> we're<00:02:09.020> up

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
is probably better but anyway we're up

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.750 
is probably better but anyway we're up

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
rubber they're supposed to probably

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.000 
rubber they're supposed to probably
stick<00:02:30.530> as<00:02:30.740> you<00:02:31.720> roll<00:02:32.720> down<00:02:35.680> he's<00:02:36.680> not<00:02:36.860> going<00:02:36.980> to

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
stick as you roll down he's not going to

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
started to bend before I realized that

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.610 
started to bend before I realized that
needs<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.490> go<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.670> my<00:02:52.850> camera<00:02:53.240> also<00:02:53.480> fired<00:02:54.470> up

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
I don't see any problem vending a waste

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.740 
I don't see any problem vending a waste
of<00:06:03.730> these<00:06:03.940> Roly<00:06:04.450> gems<00:06:04.840> in<00:06:05.490> the<00:06:06.490> already<00:06:07.300> hooked

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
of these Roly gems in the already hooked

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:19.150 
of these Roly gems in the already hooked
up<00:06:07.930> and<00:06:08.140> plus<00:06:08.410> it<00:06:08.560> saves<00:06:08.740> time

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:31.430 

little<00:06:19.850> sizzling<00:06:20.300> going<00:06:20.570> on<00:06:20.720> there

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.810 

well<00:06:32.440> it<00:06:32.590> appears<00:06:32.920> on<00:06:33.070> through<00:06:33.280> the<00:06:33.400> danger

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
well it appears on through the danger

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:47.430 
well it appears on through the danger
zone

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.350 

and<00:06:47.980> that's<00:06:48.160> it

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
and that's it

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.909 
and that's it
I<00:06:50.509> don't<00:06:51.139> know<00:06:51.199> what<00:06:51.319> all<00:06:51.379> the<00:06:51.500> fuss<00:06:51.680> is<00:06:51.740> about

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 
I don't know what all the fuss is about

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.320 
I don't know what all the fuss is about
with<00:06:52.310> bending<00:06:52.610> would<00:06:52.789> that<00:06:52.969> didn't<00:06:53.180> seem<00:06:53.300> very

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
with bending would that didn't seem very

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.610 
with bending would that didn't seem very
difficult<00:06:53.870> but<00:06:55.060> I'm<00:06:56.060> gonna<00:06:56.469> shut<00:06:57.469> off<00:06:57.590> my

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620

unplugged my blanket just to be on the
safe<00:07:05.750> side<00:07:07.870> but<00:07:08.870> that's<00:07:09.080> it<00:07:09.289> that<00:07:09.500> didn't

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
safe side but that's it that didn't

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.140 
safe side but that's it that didn't
really<00:07:09.889> take<00:07:10.159> very<00:07:10.370> long<00:07:10.689> and<00:07:12.789> now<00:07:13.789> I'm<00:07:13.939> kind

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.150 
really take very long and now I'm kind

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.420 
really take very long and now I'm kind
of<00:07:14.210> kind<00:07:14.750> of<00:07:14.870> easy<00:07:14.990> actually<00:07:15.289> didn't<00:07:16.189> expect

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
of kind of easy actually didn't expect

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.059 
of kind of easy actually didn't expect
it<00:07:16.520> to<00:07:16.580> be<00:07:16.639> so<00:07:16.729> easy<00:07:17.680> but<00:07:18.680> there<00:07:18.830> you<00:07:18.889> have<00:07:18.949> it

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:19.069 
it to be so easy but there you have it

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:21.459 
it to be so easy but there you have it
down<00:07:19.280> my<00:07:19.460> bender<00:07:19.849> I<00:07:20.060> think<00:07:20.750> Robbie<00:07:20.990> O'Brien's

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:21.469 
down my bender I think Robbie O'Brien's

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:23.170 
down my bender I think Robbie O'Brien's
video<00:07:21.710> is<00:07:21.860> longer<00:07:22.219> to<00:07:22.310> actually<00:07:22.610> do<00:07:22.759> this<00:07:22.909> than

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 
video is longer to actually do this than

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.580 
video is longer to actually do this than
mine<00:07:25.330> but<00:07:26.330> I<00:07:26.389> did<00:07:26.629> want<00:07:26.840> to<00:07:26.900> see<00:07:27.050> a<00:07:27.080> real<00:07:27.319> time

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.590 
mine but I did want to see a real time

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.080 
mine but I did want to see a real time
thing<00:07:27.860> sorry<00:07:28.159> I<00:07:28.219> cheated<00:07:28.460> you<00:07:28.699> guys<00:07:28.879> out<00:07:29.029> of

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090 
thing sorry I cheated you guys out of

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.100 
thing sorry I cheated you guys out of
about<00:07:29.360> a<00:07:29.389> minute<00:07:29.810> of<00:07:29.990> doing<00:07:30.949> the<00:07:31.069> waist<00:07:31.250> bend

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.110 
about a minute of doing the waist bend

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.839 
about a minute of doing the waist bend
but<00:07:33.110> that's<00:07:33.590> really<00:07:33.889> about<00:07:34.069> as<00:07:34.279> far<00:07:34.460> as<00:07:34.520> I<00:07:34.669> got

but that's really about as far as I got
before<00:07:35.240> I<00:07:35.529> waited<00:07:36.529> for<00:07:36.560> it<00:07:36.680> to<00:07:36.770> cool<00:07:36.949> back<00:07:37.129> down

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:37.159 
before I waited for it to cool back down
