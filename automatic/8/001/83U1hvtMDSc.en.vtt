00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
cart and the washing machine because

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.390 
cart and the washing machine because
those<00:00:26.910> are<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> easiest<00:00:27.539> ones<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:29.070> Trash<00:00:29.369> Can

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400

and the airplane are a little bit more
difficult<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.650> time-consuming<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> can

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
difficult and time-consuming so I can

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.549 
difficult and time-consuming so I can
make<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> separate<00:00:33.480> video<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:33.840> an<00:00:34.170> advanced

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559

my<00:01:31.140> tutorial<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.829> how<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.040> use<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.400> trace

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
my tutorial on how to use the trace

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.219 
my tutorial on how to use the trace
window<00:01:32.970> before<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.390> try<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.200> own

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
window before you try this on your own

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.100 
window before you try this on your own
so<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.369> ahead<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.700> hit<00:01:36.060> trace<00:01:36.450> after<00:01:36.720> you've

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
so go ahead and hit trace after you've

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.539 
so go ahead and hit trace after you've
gotten<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> thickness<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.009> you've<00:01:38.159> wanted

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
gotten the thickness that you've wanted

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.490 
gotten the thickness that you've wanted
and<00:01:38.700> when<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> move<00:01:39.450> your<00:01:39.600> image<00:01:39.810> aside<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and when you move your image aside you

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.800 
and when you move your image aside you
now<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.920> perfect<00:01:41.220> replica<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.390> that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
now have a perfect replica of it that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.609 
now have a perfect replica of it that
you<00:01:42.960> can<00:01:43.970> manipulate<00:01:44.970> how<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.570> want<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.439> go

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
you can manipulate how you want so go

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.440 
you can manipulate how you want so go
ahead<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.369> color<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.909> however<00:01:48.119> you

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
ahead and just color it in however you

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.469 
ahead and just color it in however you
want<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:52.560> now<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.770> an<00:01:53.460> icon<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.240> you

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
want and you now have an icon that you

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.590 
want and you now have an icon that you
can<00:01:54.810> print<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> now<00:01:56.939> I'm<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.390> show<00:01:57.570> you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
can print so now I'm going to show you

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.560 
can print so now I'm going to show you
how<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.280> washing<00:01:59.820> machine<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.180> this

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
how to do the washing machine and this

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.109 
how to do the washing machine and this
one's<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.869> little<00:02:00.990> bit<00:02:01.259> more<00:02:01.680> complicated<00:02:02.119> it

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
one's a little bit more complicated it

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.899 
one's a little bit more complicated it
has<00:02:03.869> all<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.530> these<00:02:04.740> separate<00:02:05.280> parts<00:02:05.700> that

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
has all of these separate parts that

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.340 
has all of these separate parts that
you're<00:02:06.000> gonna<00:02:06.180> want<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.479> color<00:02:06.719> separately

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
you're gonna want to color separately

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.449 
you're gonna want to color separately
instead<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.920> one<00:02:08.220> continuous<00:02:09.920> one<00:02:10.920> continuous

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
instead of one continuous one continuous

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.770 
instead of one continuous one continuous
image<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.480> also<00:02:12.629> has<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.110> background

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
image and it also has this background

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.199 
image and it also has this background
on<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.230> we<00:02:14.319> don't<00:02:14.470> want<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:16.000> I'm<00:02:16.090> just

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
on it that we don't want so I'm just

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.640 
on it that we don't want so I'm just
gonna<00:02:16.300> shrink<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.840> down<00:02:17.020> so<00:02:17.230> it's<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.440> little

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
gonna shrink it down so it's a little

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.940 
gonna shrink it down so it's a little
bit<00:02:17.890> easier<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.340> work<00:02:18.459> with<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:23.500> first<00:02:23.770> what

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
bit easier to work with so first what

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.110 
bit easier to work with so first what
we're<00:02:24.069> gonna<00:02:24.160> want<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.490> do<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.790> get<00:02:24.970> rid<00:02:25.060> of

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
we're gonna want to do is get rid of

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.730 
we're gonna want to do is get rid of
this<00:02:25.330> background<00:02:25.600> this<00:02:25.990> border<00:02:26.440> in<00:02:26.590> this

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
this background this border in this

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.070 
this background this border in this
white<00:02:26.980> area<00:02:27.250> around<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.600> come<00:02:28.780> up<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.990> the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
white area around it so come up to the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.080 
white area around it so come up to the
trace<00:02:29.319> window<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.920> select<00:02:30.190> trace<00:02:30.430> area<00:02:30.790> again

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
trace window and select trace area again

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.670 
trace window and select trace area again
and<00:02:31.420> you're<00:02:31.780> just<00:02:31.930> going<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.170> trace<00:02:32.440> the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
and you're just going to trace the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.080 
and you're just going to trace the
machine<00:02:33.040> because<00:02:33.280> that's<00:02:33.459> all<00:02:33.610> we<00:02:33.730> want<00:02:33.940> we

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
machine because that's all we want we

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.680 
machine because that's all we want we
don't<00:02:34.239> want<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.630> background<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:37.510> want

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
don't want that background and you want

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.030 
don't want that background and you want
to<00:02:37.810> make<00:02:37.900> sure<00:02:38.080> these<00:02:38.260> lines<00:02:38.620> are<00:02:38.860> really

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
to make sure these lines are really

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.590 
to make sure these lines are really
clean<00:02:39.430> because<00:02:39.610> it's<00:02:39.910> gonna<00:02:40.000> cut<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.420> out<00:02:40.540> and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
clean because it's gonna cut it out and

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.870 
clean because it's gonna cut it out and
the<00:02:40.870> more<00:02:41.020> black<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.920> leaves<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.730> the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
the more black that it leaves on the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.660 
the more black that it leaves on the
background<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:44.050> more<00:02:44.950> it's<00:02:45.220> gonna<00:02:45.340> make<00:02:45.550> the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
background the more it's gonna make the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.630 
background the more it's gonna make the
lines<00:02:45.880> curved<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.690> not<00:02:46.810> very<00:02:46.959> straight<00:02:47.440> so<00:02:47.680> go

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
lines curved and not very straight so go

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.130 
lines curved and not very straight so go
ahead<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:48.970> turn<00:02:49.150> your<00:02:49.180> scale<00:02:49.720> all<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.019> way

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
ahead and turn your scale all the way

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.900 
ahead and turn your scale all the way
down<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.800> when<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.250> was<00:02:51.370> playing<00:02:51.640> with<00:02:51.790> this

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
down and when I was playing with this

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.340 
down and when I was playing with this
before<00:02:52.300> I<00:02:52.330> made<00:02:52.510> this<00:02:52.600> video<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.959> found<00:02:53.050> the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
before I made this video I found the

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.199 
before I made this video I found the
settings<00:02:53.680> for<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:53.980> would<00:02:54.160> be<00:02:54.310> or<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.030> best

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
settings for this would be or the best

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.390 
settings for this would be or the best
if<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.630> turn<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.959> scale<00:02:56.260> down<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.860> then<00:02:57.010> turned

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
if I turn the scale down and then turned

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.210 
if I turn the scale down and then turned
my<00:02:57.940> high-pass<00:02:58.870> filter<00:02:59.410> down<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.709> little<00:03:00.069> bit

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
my high-pass filter down a little bit

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.470 
my high-pass filter down a little bit
and<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.519> will<00:03:00.580> make<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.060> edges<00:03:01.360> a<00:03:01.390> little

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
and this will make the edges a little

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.500 
and this will make the edges a little
bit<00:03:01.810> straighter<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:03.100> when<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.370> get<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.700> I

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
bit straighter so when you get the I

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.420 
bit straighter so when you get the I
just<00:03:05.110> perfectly<00:03:05.530> straight<00:03:05.860> how<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.040> want<00:03:06.310> it

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
just perfectly straight how you want it

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.100 
just perfectly straight how you want it
just<00:03:06.640> go<00:03:06.790> ahead<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.150> hit<00:03:07.300> trace<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:07.840> detach

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
just go ahead and hit trace and detach

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.710 
just go ahead and hit trace and detach
what<00:03:09.010> that's<00:03:09.190> gonna<00:03:09.310> do<00:03:09.610> is<00:03:09.640> remove<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.450> and

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
what that's gonna do is remove this and

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.780 
what that's gonna do is remove this and
there's<00:03:11.050> still<00:03:11.319> quite<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.769> bit<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.400> black

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
there's still quite a bit of black

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.910 
there's still quite a bit of black
around<00:03:13.030> these<00:03:13.300> edges<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.410> can<00:03:14.560> play<00:03:14.739> with

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
around these edges and you can play with

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
around these edges and you can play with
it<00:03:15.100> more<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.900> doesn't<00:03:17.290> remove<00:03:17.620> as<00:03:17.769> much<00:03:17.980> so

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
it more so it doesn't remove as much so

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.550 
it more so it doesn't remove as much so
just<00:03:19.150> go<00:03:19.239> ahead<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:19.720> select<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:20.079> and<00:03:20.410> delete

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
just go ahead and select that and delete

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.280 
just go ahead and select that and delete
it<00:03:20.950> we<00:03:21.100> don't<00:03:21.190> need<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.459> anymore

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
it we don't need it anymore

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.960 
it we don't need it anymore
and<00:03:23.370> now<00:03:24.370> we<00:03:25.000> want<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.690> trace<00:03:26.380> this<00:03:26.650> again<00:03:27.640> so

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
and now we want to trace this again so

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.630 
and now we want to trace this again so
select<00:03:28.570> trace<00:03:28.810> area<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.530> highlight<00:03:30.489> the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
select trace area and highlight the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.330 
select trace area and highlight the
entire<00:03:30.910> thing<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:32.170> again<00:03:32.320> I'm<00:03:32.739> gonna<00:03:32.950> turn<00:03:33.160> my

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
entire thing and again I'm gonna turn my

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.770 
entire thing and again I'm gonna turn my
scale<00:03:33.640> all<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.850> way<00:03:33.970> down<00:03:34.239> because<00:03:34.450> we<00:03:34.570> want

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
scale all the way down because we want

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.259 
scale all the way down because we want
these<00:03:34.930> yellow<00:03:35.380> cut<00:03:35.890> lines<00:03:36.130> or<00:03:36.459> trace<00:03:36.820> lines<00:03:37.030> to

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
these yellow cut lines or trace lines to

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.270 
these yellow cut lines or trace lines to
be<00:03:37.390> as<00:03:37.480> thin<00:03:37.780> as<00:03:37.900> we<00:03:37.930> can<00:03:38.140> possibly<00:03:38.380> get<00:03:38.890> them

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.830 

that<00:03:42.280> looks<00:03:42.489> good<00:03:42.850> so<00:03:43.090> when<00:03:43.299> you<00:03:43.420> have<00:03:43.630> the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
that looks good so when you have the

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.680 
that looks good so when you have the
thickness<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.440> want<00:03:44.910> go<00:03:45.910> ahead<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.480> hit

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
thickness that you want go ahead and hit

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.220 
thickness that you want go ahead and hit
trace<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:48.359> when<00:03:49.359> you<00:03:49.480> move<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.840> you'll<00:03:49.989> see

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
trace and when you move it you'll see

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.130 
trace and when you move it you'll see
you<00:03:50.410> now<00:03:50.620> have<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.510> washing<00:03:52.510> machine<00:03:52.540> but<00:03:52.840> we

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
you now have a washing machine but we

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.349 
you now have a washing machine but we
don't<00:03:53.350> want<00:03:53.590> these<00:03:53.739> inside<00:03:54.250> lines<00:03:54.549> here<00:03:54.910> so<00:03:55.180> as

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
don't want these inside lines here so as

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.030 
don't want these inside lines here so as
of<00:03:55.540> right<00:03:55.690> now<00:03:55.750> this<00:03:56.140> is<00:03:56.320> one<00:03:56.530> whole<00:03:56.739> piece<00:03:56.980> and

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
of right now this is one whole piece and

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.740 
of right now this is one whole piece and
I<00:03:57.340> don't<00:03:57.519> want<00:03:57.670> that<00:03:57.880> so<00:03:58.420> I'm<00:03:58.480> going<00:03:58.690> to

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
I don't want that so I'm going to

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.810 
I don't want that so I'm going to
right-click<00:03:59.079> it<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.590> release<00:04:00.100> compound<00:04:00.609> path

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
right-click it and release compound path

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.310 
right-click it and release compound path
and<00:04:01.150> that's<00:04:01.359> going<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.570> make<00:04:01.750> each<00:04:01.989> of<00:04:02.200> these

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
and that's going to make each of these

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.140 
and that's going to make each of these
lines<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.980> separate<00:04:03.400> piece<00:04:03.640> that<00:04:03.850> we<00:04:03.970> can

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
lines a separate piece that we can

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.240 
lines a separate piece that we can
manipulate<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:05.380> I'm<00:04:05.560> gonna<00:04:05.739> get<00:04:05.920> rid<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.070> this

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
manipulate so I'm gonna get rid of this

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.190 
manipulate so I'm gonna get rid of this
inside<00:04:06.700> line<00:04:06.940> because<00:04:07.329> the<00:04:07.450> outside<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:08.170> the

inside line because the outside is the

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.539 
inside line because the outside is the
edge<00:04:08.410> of<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.799> machine<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:09.250> that's<00:04:09.370> what<00:04:09.519> I

edge of the machine and that's what I

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.569 
edge of the machine and that's what I
want<00:04:10.140> I'm<00:04:11.140> gonna<00:04:11.320> get<00:04:11.590> rid<00:04:11.739> of<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:11.950> outside<00:04:12.400> of
