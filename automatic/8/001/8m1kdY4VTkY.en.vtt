00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.549
 ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.000
 Hello, I'll introduce myseld 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.560
 yannick lord I am a polytechnician 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.610
 in new technologies of 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.860
 information and communication 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.720
 in this short I would like to talk to you about 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:24.240
 hardware the network 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.240
 you are an excellent run to all 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.509
 almost every network uses a 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.500
 file server to store the 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:41.110
 information whether of type 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:44.720
 files documents pictures videos music videos 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.300
 which users need to 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.940
 to work 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.620
 these storage servers must be 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.300
 equipped with storage devices 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.390
 there are different types of media 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.780
 according to the nature of the 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.699
 data to store there see the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.699
 main storage units 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.930
 seeing to start a structure of 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.659
 most used storage in the 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:23.680
 most file servers to 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:27.760
 know the hard drives here is one 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.530
 what it always looks like 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.850
 plug in a computer before putting 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:37.690
 hand to the ground via a server of 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.300
 little files have owned several if one 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:45.780
 had two in the capacity of each 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:49.780
 disc can reach some terra op 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.130
 the cost of a hard drive is all 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.910
 higher than its capacity is large 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.910
 as well as its robustness 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.850
 continuing with the tape drive the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.789
 tape drive is a device that 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:15.819
 is used to copy the information of a 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.819
 server on a magnetic tape 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:24.230
 it's mostly used to make 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.230
 backups 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.079
 another storage medium 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:40.870
 of popular information it is of course 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:43.329
 the rom cd and rom dvd on which you 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.849
 can store a lot of information 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.310
 without it taking much 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.219
 of place 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:55.180
 here is a rom dvd player 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:58.930
 he looks good on road cd rom on 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.870
 which I have already removed the tablecloth and I'm going 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.590
 also the electrical part or the wire 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.849
 red is always listed at term 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:19.449
 that's what a dvd player looks like 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:22.180
 rom in the series the gadgets very 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:26.829
 appreciated for the storage of 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:32.639
 low capacity information noting the 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.639
 usb and d key 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:50.360
 and the sd card or the disk ssd 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:50.360
 as for example the famous Oscars 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.490
 relief is already coming to an end 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.080
 I thank you for following him 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.080
 see you again and see you soon
