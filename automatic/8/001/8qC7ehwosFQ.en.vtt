like this you know in front of the in
screwed<00:00:28.590> things<00:00:28.710> up<00:00:29.000> when<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.090> take<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.330> little

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
screwed things up when I take a little

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.799 
screwed things up when I take a little
straw<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.529> from<00:00:31.740> grass<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.700> little<00:00:33.450> piece<00:00:33.660> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
straw like from grass a little piece of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.410 
straw like from grass a little piece of
grass<00:00:33.960> then<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.880> kind<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.969> thread<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.300> up

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
grass then you kind of thread it up

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.590 
grass then you kind of thread it up
their<00:00:36.570> rear<00:00:36.750> end<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.320> go<00:00:37.910> yeah<00:00:39.000> wall<00:00:39.270> full<00:00:39.540> of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
their rear end and go yeah wall full of

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.020 
their rear end and go yeah wall full of
air<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.020> they<00:00:40.140> couldn't<00:00:40.379> get<00:00:40.590> down<00:00:40.790> then<00:00:41.790> pitch

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
air so they couldn't get down then pitch

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.380 
air so they couldn't get down then pitch
them<00:00:42.180> into<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> slop<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.829> drive<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> bass

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
them into the slop and it drive the bass

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.720 
them into the slop and it drive the bass
absolutely<00:00:45.390> crazy<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.829> probably<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
absolutely crazy but it's probably not a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.100 
absolutely crazy but it's probably not a
realistic<00:00:48.360> way<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.289> everybody<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.460> fish<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:52.050> I

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
realistic way for everybody to fish so I

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.959 
realistic way for everybody to fish so I
was<00:00:52.260> challenged<00:00:52.649> how<00:00:52.770> do<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.920> make<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> real<00:00:53.460> frog

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
was challenged how do I make a real frog

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.209 
was challenged how do I make a real frog
I<00:00:54.449> mean<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> frog<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.530> doesn't<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.039> look

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
I mean a frog that doesn't just look

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.849 
I mean a frog that doesn't just look
like<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.430> frog<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> frog<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.559> swims<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
like a frog but a frog that swims like a

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.209 
like a frog but a frog that swims like a
frog<00:00:59.219> acts<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> frog<00:01:00.629> frog<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.620> two<00:01:01.859> things

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
frog acts like a frog frog do two things

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.070 
frog acts like a frog frog do two things
when<00:01:02.460> they<00:01:02.579> want<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.030> away<00:01:03.149> they<00:01:03.809> skip

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
when they want to get away they skip

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.990 
when they want to get away they skip
across<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> surface<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.250> try<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> get<00:01:05.729> up<00:01:05.850> on

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
across the surface and try to get up on

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.719 
across the surface and try to get up on
land<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.570> they<00:01:06.659> don't<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:06.960> eaten<00:01:07.020> or<00:01:07.799> they

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
land so they don't get eaten or they

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.330 
land so they don't get eaten or they
dive<00:01:09.000> down<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.570> bottom<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.260> bury<00:01:10.740> bury

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
dive down to the bottom and bury bury

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.100 
dive down to the bottom and bury bury
themselves<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> mud<00:01:13.310> this<00:01:14.310> diving<00:01:14.610> frog

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
themselves in the mud this diving frog

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.679 
themselves in the mud this diving frog
sits<00:01:16.110> at<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> right<00:01:16.500> attitude<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.540> can

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
sits at the right attitude so you can

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.210 
sits at the right attitude so you can
throw<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.049> top<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.320> slop<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.680> come<00:01:20.100> over

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
throw it on top of slop and come over

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.859 
throw it on top of slop and come over
slop<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> frogs<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.750> you

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
slop just like all the frogs that you

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.740 
slop just like all the frogs that you
use<00:01:22.049> today<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:23.310> when<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> fish<00:01:23.759> blows<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
use today but when a fish blows up on it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.390 
use today but when a fish blows up on it
you<00:01:25.110> don't<00:01:25.229> need<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.470> reach<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> jig<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
you don't need to reach for a jig and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.780 
you don't need to reach for a jig and
trying<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> catch<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.100> has<00:01:29.100> got<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.610> same

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
trying to catch it this has got the same

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.520 
trying to catch it this has got the same
kind<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> attracting<00:01:30.659> power<00:01:30.869> maybe<00:01:31.170> more

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
kind of attracting power maybe more

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.960 
kind of attracting power maybe more
because<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> will<00:01:31.979> make<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.130> bubble<00:01:32.400> chain<00:01:32.759> when

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
because it will make a bubble chain when

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.719 
because it will make a bubble chain when
you<00:01:33.060> pull<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.869> diving<00:01:34.619> collar<00:01:35.040> but

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
you pull it with this diving collar but

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.819 
you pull it with this diving collar but
what<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.720> stop<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> hole

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
what you can do is stop it in a hole

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.130 
what you can do is stop it in a hole
give<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.549> couple<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.939> jerks<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:40.020> you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
give it a couple of jerks and if you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.510 
give it a couple of jerks and if you
look<00:01:40.290> at<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> video<00:01:40.740> you'll<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.040> how<00:01:41.369> it

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
look at the video you'll see how it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.050 
look at the video you'll see how it
swims<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.600> other<00:01:42.720> thing<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.439> with<00:01:43.590> it
