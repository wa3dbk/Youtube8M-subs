00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:17.400 

I<00:00:15.299> thought<00:00:16.299> I'd<00:00:16.480> recommend<00:00:16.870> something<00:00:17.200> to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
I thought I'd recommend something to

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.260 
I thought I'd recommend something to
which<00:00:17.620> I<00:00:17.740> found<00:00:17.920> actually<00:00:18.250> very<00:00:18.820> recently<00:00:19.210> I

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
which I found actually very recently I

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.930 
which I found actually very recently I
found<00:00:19.300> is<00:00:19.570> actually<00:00:19.810> very<00:00:19.870> useful<00:00:20.820> I've<00:00:21.820> done

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:21.940 
found is actually very useful I've done

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.190 
found is actually very useful I've done
a<00:00:22.000> video<00:00:22.120> before<00:00:22.360> about<00:00:22.660> talking<00:00:22.930> about<00:00:22.960> these

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
a video before about talking about these

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.690 
a video before about talking about these
loops<00:00:23.440> these<00:00:23.770> are<00:00:23.920> great<00:00:24.070> and<00:00:24.250> days<00:00:24.400> like<00:00:24.580> this

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
loops these are great and days like this

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.180 
loops these are great and days like this
where<00:00:24.880> it's<00:00:25.000> sunny<00:00:25.260> when<00:00:26.260> you're<00:00:26.380> outside<00:00:26.500> so

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
where it's sunny when you're outside so

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.500 
where it's sunny when you're outside so
y'all<00:00:27.370> to<00:00:27.490> see<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:27.790> screen<00:00:28.060> normal<00:00:28.390> LCD

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
y'all to see the screen normal LCD

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.210 
y'all to see the screen normal LCD
screen<00:00:29.050> so<00:00:29.530> the<00:00:29.620> idea<00:00:29.710> with<00:00:29.950> one<00:00:30.070> of<00:00:30.130> these

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
screen so the idea with one of these

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.710 
screen so the idea with one of these
loops<00:00:30.490> is<00:00:30.820> you<00:00:30.970> just<00:00:31.150> put<00:00:31.270> it<00:00:31.330> on<00:00:31.390> in<00:00:31.480> front<00:00:31.510> of

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
loops is you just put it on in front of

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.990 
loops is you just put it on in front of
the<00:00:31.810> onto<00:00:32.649> the<00:00:32.739> attached<00:00:32.980> onto<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.370> LCD

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
the onto the attached onto the LCD

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.049 
the onto the attached onto the LCD
screen<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.899> problem<00:00:35.170> always<00:00:35.530> with<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:36.059> 600

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
screen the problem always with the 600

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.200 
screen the problem always with the 600
and<00:00:37.179> 650<00:00:37.449> d<00:00:37.780> and<00:00:38.079> the<00:00:38.530> 700d<00:00:39.160> now<00:00:39.339> as<00:00:39.879> always<00:00:40.089> the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
and 650 d and the 700d now as always the

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.540 
and 650 d and the 700d now as always the
screen<00:00:40.420> is<00:00:40.539> great<00:00:40.749> it<00:00:40.929> swivels<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:41.949> the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
screen is great it swivels and the

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.739 
screen is great it swivels and the
trouble<00:00:42.820> in<00:00:42.879> most<00:00:42.969> of<00:00:43.120> these<00:00:43.210> loops<00:00:43.510> is

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
trouble in most of these loops is

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.229 
trouble in most of these loops is
they're<00:00:44.050> designed<00:00:44.469> to<00:00:44.949> attach<00:00:45.249> when<00:00:46.089> the

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
they're designed to attach when the

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.509 
they're designed to attach when the
screen<00:00:46.510> is<00:00:46.539> actually<00:00:46.749> fixed<00:00:47.230> in<00:00:47.350> place<00:00:47.469> on<00:00:47.920> the

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
screen is actually fixed in place on the

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.340 
screen is actually fixed in place on the
camera<00:00:48.850> so<00:00:49.030> it<00:00:49.269> doesn't<00:00:49.749> when<00:00:49.929> you<00:00:50.019> fix<00:00:50.230> them

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
camera so it doesn't when you fix them

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.599 
camera so it doesn't when you fix them
on<00:00:50.499> you<00:00:50.589> can't<00:00:50.769> really<00:00:50.859> swivel<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.280> camera

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
on you can't really swivel the camera

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.419 
on you can't really swivel the camera
you<00:00:51.730> can't<00:00:51.909> refill<00:00:52.359> the<00:00:53.010> LCD<00:00:54.010> but<00:00:54.190> with<00:00:54.309> this

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
you can't refill the LCD but with this

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.930 
you can't refill the LCD but with this
particular<00:00:55.050> loop<00:00:56.050> set<00:00:56.350> up<00:00:56.469> it<00:00:57.309> allows<00:00:57.370> you<00:00:57.819> to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
particular loop set up it allows you to

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.099 
particular loop set up it allows you to
do<00:00:58.059> that<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.510> nice<00:00:58.690> thing<00:00:58.870> is<00:00:58.929> you<00:00:58.989> see

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
do that and the nice thing is you see

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.840 
do that and the nice thing is you see
now<00:00:59.379> it<00:00:59.530> actually<00:00:59.620> allows<00:01:00.249> you<00:01:00.519> to<00:01:00.579> keep<00:01:00.699> the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
now it actually allows you to keep the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.689 
now it actually allows you to keep the
existing<00:01:00.909> loop<00:01:01.390> you've<00:01:01.569> got<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:03.129> by<00:01:03.399> a

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
existing loop you've got and just by a

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.330 
existing loop you've got and just by a
ten-dollar<00:01:04.540> literally<00:01:05.260> attachment<00:01:06.010> is<00:01:06.130> six

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
ten-dollar literally attachment is six

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.430 
ten-dollar literally attachment is six
by<00:01:06.520> six<00:01:06.580> pounds<00:01:07.120> attachment<00:01:07.690> which<00:01:08.200> allows

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
by six pounds attachment which allows

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.550 
by six pounds attachment which allows
you<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.650> use<00:01:08.800> your<00:01:08.830> loop<00:01:09.100> like<00:01:09.310> this<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:11.320> just

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
you to use your loop like this I'm just

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.080 
you to use your loop like this I'm just
fine<00:01:11.680> i<00:01:11.710> think<00:01:11.920> it's<00:01:12.010> a<00:01:12.070> great<00:01:12.430> great<00:01:12.640> idea<00:01:13.000> in

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
fine i think it's a great great idea in

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.940 
fine i think it's a great great idea in
it<00:01:13.240> one<00:01:13.570> of<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:13.750> few<00:01:13.960> things<00:01:14.140> do<00:01:14.800> with<00:01:14.890> these

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
it one of the few things do with these

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.550 
it one of the few things do with these
cameras<00:01:15.430> etc<00:01:15.610> which<00:01:15.970> is<00:01:16.090> quite<00:01:16.270> cheap<00:01:16.540> so<00:01:17.200> i'll

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
cameras etc which is quite cheap so i'll

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.160 
cameras etc which is quite cheap so i'll
show<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:17.830> that<00:01:17.950> now<00:01:18.160> and<00:01:18.510> my<00:01:19.510> recommendations

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
show you that now and my recommendations

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.830 
show you that now and my recommendations
as<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.770> loop<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:21.130> use<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:21.460> also<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:22.600> set

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
as to the loop to use and also they set

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.180 
as to the loop to use and also they set
it<00:01:22.870> up<00:01:23.020> it's<00:01:23.170> very<00:01:23.320> simple<00:01:23.500> though<00:01:23.710> basically

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
it up it's very simple though basically

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.800 
it up it's very simple though basically
and<00:01:24.400> they'll<00:01:25.060> have<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.270> quick<00:01:25.480> look<00:01:25.510> at<00:01:25.690> that

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
and they'll have a quick look at that

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.090 
and they'll have a quick look at that
now<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:30.220> is<00:01:30.690> basically<00:01:31.690> all<00:01:32.230> it<00:01:32.290> is<00:01:32.500> the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
now so this is basically all it is the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.710 
now so this is basically all it is the
attachment<00:01:33.610> I'm<00:01:33.670> talking<00:01:33.940> about<00:01:33.970> it's<00:01:34.600> called

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
attachment I'm talking about it's called

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.600 
attachment I'm talking about it's called
a<00:01:34.780> carry<00:01:34.990> speed<00:01:35.350> I<00:01:35.620> think<00:01:35.980> it's<00:01:36.070> called<00:01:36.220> swive

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
a carry speed I think it's called swive

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.300 
a carry speed I think it's called swive
I<00:01:36.850> Swizzy<00:01:37.660> the<00:01:38.200> SW<00:01:38.680> IV<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:38.980> four<00:01:39.610> swivel<00:01:39.820> I<00:01:40.000> guess

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
I Swizzy the SW IV I four swivel I guess

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.580 
I Swizzy the SW IV I four swivel I guess
llcd<00:01:42.480> bilker<00:01:43.480> attachment<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.200> can<00:01:44.230> get<00:01:44.500> it

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
llcd bilker attachment you can get it

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.950 
llcd bilker attachment you can get it
with<00:01:44.620> it<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> loop<00:01:45.250> ie<00:01:46.090> one<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:46.420> these<00:01:46.540> things<00:01:46.810> or

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
with it a loop ie one of these things or

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.120 
with it a loop ie one of these things or
you<00:01:46.990> can<00:01:47.110> buy<00:01:47.260> it<00:01:47.320> separately<00:01:47.650> for<00:01:48.010> ten

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
you can buy it separately for ten

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.440 
you can buy it separately for ten
dollars<00:01:48.430> with<00:01:48.550> a<00:01:48.580> loop<00:01:48.760> yours<00:01:48.970> you<00:01:49.090> pay<00:01:49.240> extra

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
dollars with a loop yours you pay extra

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.300 
dollars with a loop yours you pay extra
for<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.690> loop<00:01:49.870> and<00:01:50.650> just<00:01:50.920> watch<00:01:51.040> that<00:01:51.220> when

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
for the loop and just watch that when

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.670 
for the loop and just watch that when
you<00:01:51.370> go<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.520> have<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:51.850> look<00:01:51.970> on<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.150> internet

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
you go to have a look on the internet

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.980 
you go to have a look on the internet
and<00:01:53.680> what<00:01:54.310> happens<00:01:54.610> is<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.760> basically<00:01:54.990> it's

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
and what happens is you basically it's

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.350 
and what happens is you basically it's
got<00:01:56.110> velcro<00:01:56.260> on<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.280> attaches<00:01:58.060> like

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
got velcro on it and it attaches like

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.340 
got velcro on it and it attaches like
that<00:01:58.570> and<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.260> take<00:01:59.440> your<00:01:59.650> loop<00:02:01.170> I'll<00:02:02.170> use<00:02:02.320> my

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
that and you take your loop I'll use my

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.730 
that and you take your loop I'll use my
old<00:02:02.620> and<00:02:03.010> here<00:02:03.400> well<00:02:04.090> loops<00:02:04.780> here<00:02:05.020> this<00:02:05.590> is<00:02:05.710> a

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
old and here well loops here this is a

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.070 
old and here well loops here this is a
very<00:02:05.830> cheap<00:02:06.100> one<00:02:06.280> I<00:02:06.490> think<00:02:06.730> it's<00:02:06.820> about<00:02:06.970> 10<00:02:07.870> 15

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
very cheap one I think it's about 10 15

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.259 
very cheap one I think it's about 10 15
pound<00:02:08.769> something<00:02:09.009> like<00:02:09.099> that<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.429> I'll

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
pound something like that and I'll

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.819 
pound something like that and I'll
explain<00:02:10.509> why<00:02:10.749> in<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.869> minute<00:02:10.959> I've<00:02:11.200> moved<00:02:11.499> on<00:02:11.620> to

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
explain why in a minute I've moved on to

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.650 
explain why in a minute I've moved on to
this<00:02:11.980> particular<00:02:12.189> a<00:02:12.459> different<00:02:12.730> one

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
this particular a different one

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.170 
this particular a different one
and<00:02:13.750> many<00:02:14.560> cuz<00:02:14.710> my<00:02:14.830> eyesight<00:02:15.250> but<00:02:16.000> there's

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and many cuz my eyesight but there's

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.300 
and many cuz my eyesight but there's
another<00:02:16.330> reason<00:02:16.510> as<00:02:16.690> well<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.980> what<00:02:18.100> you<00:02:18.160> do<00:02:18.280> is

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
another reason as well so what you do is

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.400 
another reason as well so what you do is
you<00:02:18.580> basically<00:02:19.150> put<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:21.720> velcro<00:02:22.720> attachment

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
you basically put the velcro attachment

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.160 
you basically put the velcro attachment
like<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.860> over<00:02:24.540> its<00:02:25.540> three<00:02:25.780> little<00:02:25.960> velcro

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
like that over its three little velcro

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.010 
like that over its three little velcro
bits<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.650> attach<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:27.820> it<00:02:28.660> goes<00:02:28.840> on<00:02:28.960> like

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
bits that attach and it goes on like

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.640 
bits that attach and it goes on like
that<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.530> there's<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.830> slot<00:02:30.100> then<00:02:30.340> in<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.760> side

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
that and there's a slot then in the side

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.080 
that and there's a slot then in the side
I'll<00:02:32.650> take<00:02:32.830> out<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.960> camera<00:02:35.430> monitor<00:02:36.430> and

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
I'll take out the camera monitor and

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.590 
I'll take out the camera monitor and
just<00:02:37.300> slide<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.080> in<00:02:38.170> there<00:02:39.240> so<00:02:40.240> it's<00:02:40.360> attached

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
just slide it in there so it's attached

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.120 
just slide it in there so it's attached
just<00:02:41.020> pull<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.350> bit<00:02:41.470> tight<00:02:41.650> if<00:02:41.770> you<00:02:41.860> want<00:02:42.010> but

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
just pull it a bit tight if you want but

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.760 
just pull it a bit tight if you want but
that's<00:02:42.250> okay<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.820> you've<00:02:43.630> then<00:02:43.840> attached<00:02:44.500> it

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
that's okay and you've then attached it

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.890 
that's okay and you've then attached it
to<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:47.460> LCD<00:02:48.460> and<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.120> works<00:02:49.270> really<00:02:49.420> well<00:02:49.540> and

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
to the LCD and it works really well and

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.090 
to the LCD and it works really well and
you<00:02:50.650> can<00:02:51.750> fold<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.900> back<00:02:53.050> so<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:53.890> can<00:02:53.980> actually

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
you can fold it back so you can actually

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.260 
you can fold it back so you can actually
use<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.520> on<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.640> camera<00:02:54.910> as<00:02:55.120> well<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:57.270> any

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
use it on the camera as well and any

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.150 
use it on the camera as well and any
position<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:58.660> want<00:02:58.900> all<00:02:59.680> right<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.010> doesn't

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
position you want all right it doesn't

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.380 
position you want all right it doesn't
when<00:03:00.580> you<00:03:00.640> put<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.880> on<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.000> doesn't<00:03:01.060> actually

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
when you put it on it doesn't actually

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.120 
when you put it on it doesn't actually
allow<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:01.990> to<00:03:02.140> put<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:03.390> LCD<00:03:04.390> right<00:03:04.810> flat<00:03:05.350> onto

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
allow you to put the LCD right flat onto

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.970 
allow you to put the LCD right flat onto
the<00:03:06.630> fit<00:03:07.630> into<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.020> actual<00:03:08.290> slot<00:03:08.680> for<00:03:08.920> it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
the fit into the actual slot for it

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.500 
the fit into the actual slot for it
there<00:03:09.190> but<00:03:09.640> it's<00:03:09.790> good<00:03:09.940> enough<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.390> if<00:03:10.450> you

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
there but it's good enough and if you

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.880 
there but it's good enough and if you
hold<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:10.720> up<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.810> your<00:03:10.900> face<00:03:11.020> like<00:03:11.350> that<00:03:11.470> it's

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
hold it up to your face like that it's

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.490 
hold it up to your face like that it's
fine<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.400> does<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.700> job<00:03:13.020> nice<00:03:14.020> thing<00:03:14.290> as<00:03:14.380> you

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
fine it does the job nice thing as you

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.590 
fine it does the job nice thing as you
see<00:03:14.830> there<00:03:15.040> is<00:03:15.580> you<00:03:15.760> swivel<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.150> round<00:03:16.360> and

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
see there is you swivel it round and

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.240 
see there is you swivel it round and
you've<00:03:17.410> got<00:03:17.730> see<00:03:18.730> there<00:03:18.970> got<00:03:19.750> your<00:03:19.840> basically

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
you've got see there got your basically

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.870 
you've got see there got your basically
loop<00:03:21.540> like<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.570> as<00:03:22.840> well<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.370> it's<00:03:24.370> very<00:03:24.550> very

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
loop like that as well so it's very very

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.120 
loop like that as well so it's very very
good<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.570> quite<00:03:25.930> quite<00:03:26.290> clever<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.620> way<00:03:26.650> it's

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
good and quite quite clever the way it's

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.199 
good and quite quite clever the way it's
designed<00:03:28.500> yeah<00:03:29.500> so<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:29.980> loop<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:30.820> quite

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
designed yeah so this loop is quite

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.120 
designed yeah so this loop is quite
handy<00:03:31.510> so<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.720> has<00:03:31.840> there's<00:03:32.380> three<00:03:32.590> three

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
handy so it has there's three three

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.310 
handy so it has there's three three
features<00:03:33.520> like<00:03:33.640> think<00:03:34.090> fairly<00:03:34.450> useful<00:03:34.660> as

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
features like think fairly useful as

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.510 
features like think fairly useful as
this<00:03:35.500> one<00:03:35.680> which<00:03:35.740> is<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:36.010> main<00:03:36.130> one<00:03:36.310> is<00:03:36.400> the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
this one which is the main one is the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.190 
this one which is the main one is the
diopter<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:37.330> you<00:03:37.420> can<00:03:37.540> adjust<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.930> for<00:03:37.959> your

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
diopter so you can adjust it for your

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.620 
diopter so you can adjust it for your
eyesight<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.550> focuses<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:40.120> screen<00:03:40.420> here

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
eyesight so it focuses the screen here

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.560 
eyesight so it focuses the screen here
that's<00:03:41.320> nice<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.680> less<00:03:41.830> sharp<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.250> image<00:03:42.570> it

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
that's nice and less sharp the image it

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.840 
that's nice and less sharp the image it
also<00:03:43.810> opens<00:03:44.140> which<00:03:44.500> is<00:03:44.680> how<00:03:45.310> do<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.459> can<00:03:45.730> be

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
also opens which is how do you can be

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.550 
also opens which is how do you can be
useful<00:03:46.180> but<00:03:46.209> isn't<00:03:46.510> so<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.200> can<00:03:47.320> actually<00:03:47.410> see

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
useful but isn't so you can actually see

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.410 
useful but isn't so you can actually see
the<00:03:47.770> actual<00:03:47.980> original<00:03:48.190> LCD<00:03:48.700> screen<00:03:49.270> without

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
the actual original LCD screen without

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.040 
the actual original LCD screen without
them<00:03:49.830> having<00:03:50.830> it<00:03:51.100> closed<00:03:52.060> plus<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.989> other

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
them having it closed plus the other

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.050 
them having it closed plus the other
thing<00:03:53.260> is<00:03:53.290> this<00:03:53.709> cord<00:03:54.040> around<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.760> it's<00:03:54.910> quite

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
thing is this cord around it it's quite

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.510 
thing is this cord around it it's quite
useful<00:03:55.209> because<00:03:55.810> i<00:03:56.170> often<00:03:56.500> find<00:03:56.739> if<00:03:57.250> I've<00:03:57.400> got

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
useful because i often find if I've got

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.560 
useful because i often find if I've got
more<00:03:57.640> than<00:03:57.700> one<00:03:57.850> camera<00:03:58.239> or<00:03:58.330> I'm<00:03:58.420> going

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
between cameras and I haven't got a loop

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.040 
between cameras and I haven't got a loop
attached<00:04:00.160> you<00:04:00.670> can<00:04:00.790> literally<00:04:01.000> just<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.480> go

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
attached you can literally just to go

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.870 
attached you can literally just to go
and<00:04:02.080> your<00:04:02.380> cameras<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:02.800> just<00:04:03.610> check<00:04:03.760> the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
and your cameras and just check the

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.220 
and your cameras and just check the
screens<00:04:04.150> there<00:04:04.360> just<00:04:04.540> by<00:04:04.630> putting<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.930> up<00:04:05.050> to

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
screens there just by putting it up to

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.660 
screens there just by putting it up to
it<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:05.940> walking<00:04:06.940> away<00:04:07.030> again<00:04:07.360> so<00:04:08.489> this<00:04:09.489> loop

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
it and walking away again so this loop

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.479 
it and walking away again so this loop
here<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.360> think<00:04:11.320> quite<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.650> good<00:04:11.830> buy<00:04:11.980> despite
