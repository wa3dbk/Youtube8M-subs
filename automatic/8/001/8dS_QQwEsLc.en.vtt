00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.020
 continues the tutorial in collaboration 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.230
 with effective to learn the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.969
 maintenance of the sewing machine la 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.250
 car police cut and sew 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.540
 it should be very frequent every three 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.850
 four days of use 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.640
 because continuous cutting of the fabric creates 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.460
 a lot of dust we remove the leg e 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.260
 let's stop the lake plaque because below 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:38.370
 in correspondence with the gripper yes 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:42.020
 accumulates many to the lake kitchen must 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.020
 be maximum height opposition 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.050
 now we turn the size and sew e 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.000
 we begin to arouse the vines there 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.239
 two are holding lid and not 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.769
 be touched few screws are exposed 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.250
 others are in the center of the suction cups 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.250
 support 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.700
 if you notice a lid you can see a lot of it immediately 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:47.600
 now accumulated dust that must be 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:49.880
 removed with compressed air or with one 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.480
 We also clean spray air spray 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.480
 the mechanical parts 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.580
 it is useful to oil the machine with a 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.489
 detergent spray lubricant 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.590
 anticorrosion some splashes are enough 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.959
 on mechanical parts and will provide from 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.959
 only to spread 1 seat exaggerate 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.430
 now it's enough to reassemble all the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.970
 cover and return to its locked position 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.970
 from the vines 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.720
 we put the plate back and put it back on 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.720
 leg 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.540
 now we really know all about 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.579
 home machine maintenance from 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.430
 sewing and for any other needs 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.650
 it is better to rely on expert hands 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.780
 we thank Mr. George and us 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.969
 see you soon here on sewing school
