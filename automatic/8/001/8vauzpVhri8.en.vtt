this<00:05:18.120> as<00:05:18.330> more<00:05:18.690> or<00:05:18.750> less<00:05:18.990> a<00:05:19.140> peer<00:05:19.590> review<00:05:19.950> of

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
this as more or less a peer review of

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.160 
this as more or less a peer review of
some<00:05:20.220> sort<00:05:20.490> like<00:05:20.700> I<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:21.240> know<00:05:21.270> we<00:05:21.510> all<00:05:21.690> review

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
some sort like I you know we all review

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.440 
some sort like I you know we all review
each<00:05:22.290> others<00:05:22.590> opinions<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:23.280> then<00:05:23.670> we<00:05:23.910> come<00:05:24.300> up

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
each others opinions and then we come up

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.330 
each others opinions and then we come up
with<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:24.750> best<00:05:24.990> solution<00:05:25.260> possible<00:05:25.770> to<00:05:26.190> deal

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
with the best solution possible to deal

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.760 
with the best solution possible to deal
with<00:05:26.490> a<00:05:26.580> certain<00:05:26.850> patch<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:27.680> eventually<00:05:28.680> i'll

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
with a certain patch and eventually i'll

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.710 
with a certain patch and eventually i'll
be<00:05:28.890> in<00:05:29.100> you<00:05:29.370> know<00:05:29.400> it's<00:05:29.700> expanding<00:05:30.420> this<00:05:30.540> two

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
be in you know it's expanding this two

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.210 
be in you know it's expanding this two
different<00:05:31.020> specs<00:05:31.260> even<00:05:31.560> different<00:05:31.770> classes
