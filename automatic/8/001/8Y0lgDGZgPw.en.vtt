00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.979

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.990 
inkwell it's actually glass I'm off like
I<00:02:25.349> think<00:02:25.530> it's<00:02:25.709> like<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.830> metal<00:02:26.130> cap<00:02:26.340> here<00:02:29.000> then

I think it's like a metal cap here then

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.500 
I think it's like a metal cap here then
you<00:02:30.060> get<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.269> AC<00:02:30.420> logo<00:02:32.090> Ukraine<00:02:33.090> which<00:02:33.360> I'm

you get the AC logo Ukraine which I'm

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.070

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
this is really cool it's good a dyed

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.340

feather<00:03:17.850> you<00:03:18.359> can<00:03:18.480> see<00:03:18.540> they<00:03:18.690> cut<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.109> to<00:03:19.140> make

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
feather you can see they cut it to make

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.509 
feather you can see they cut it to make
it<00:03:19.530> look<00:03:19.560> real<00:03:19.920> nice<00:03:20.130> at<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.609> tip<00:03:22.280> down<00:03:23.280> here

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519

so<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:30.410> doubt<00:03:30.620> this<00:03:30.770> would<00:03:30.920> work<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.370> looks<00:03:31.520> more

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
so I doubt this would work it looks more

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.240 
so I doubt this would work it looks more
like<00:03:31.880> a<00:03:31.970> mock-up<00:03:32.709> but<00:03:33.709> I<00:03:33.740> don't<00:03:33.920> really<00:03:34.040> know

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
like a mock-up but I don't really know
