00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.750 
predicting djokovic to win in the five
it's<00:02:36.780> going<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.049> be<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.280> fantastic<00:02:38.280> match

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
it's going to be a fantastic match

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.539 
it's going to be a fantastic match
Wawrinka<00:02:39.689> is<00:02:39.900> playing<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:40.980> big<00:02:41.159> from<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.400> back

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
Wawrinka is playing so big from the back

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.940 
Wawrinka is playing so big from the back
of<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.760> court<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:42.599> think<00:02:42.900> Djokovic<00:02:43.409> with

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
of the court but I think Djokovic with

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.309 
of the court but I think Djokovic with
the<00:02:44.069> defense<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:45.000> elasticity<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:46.019> he<00:02:46.139> has

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
the defense the elasticity that he has

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.259 
the defense the elasticity that he has
out<00:02:46.560> there<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:46.920> think<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.430> gets<00:02:47.579> through<00:02:47.879> in

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
out there I think it gets through in

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.200 
out there I think it gets through in
five<00:02:48.569> tough<00:02:48.900> sets

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.270 

you
