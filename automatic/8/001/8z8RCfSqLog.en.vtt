towards a house because the title on it

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.279 
towards a house because the title on it
was<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> little<00:02:09.209> sketchy<00:02:09.599> there<00:02:10.019> was<00:02:10.110> some

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
was a little sketchy there was some

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.170 
was a little sketchy there was some
ancestral<00:02:10.860> claim<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.519> it<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.880> wasn't<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
ancestral claim to it so it wasn't a

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.570 
ancestral claim to it so it wasn't a
clean<00:02:12.420> title<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.040> weren't<00:02:14.190> sure<00:02:14.430> it's

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
clean title and we weren't sure it's

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.770 
clean title and we weren't sure it's
that<00:02:14.700> much<00:02:14.910> money<00:02:15.090> was<00:02:15.299> actually<00:02:15.420> gonna<00:02:15.660> be

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
that much money was actually gonna be

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.750 
that much money was actually gonna be
exchanging<00:02:16.260> hands<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.250> money<00:02:17.430> has<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.640> be

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
exchanging hands and the money has to be

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.630 
exchanging hands and the money has to be
accounted<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:20.160> anyways<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.580> is

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
accounted for so so anyways this is

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.930 
accounted for so so anyways this is
what's<00:02:21.239> left<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.569> their<00:02:21.720> old<00:02:21.900> house<00:02:22.940> it's

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
what's left of their old house it's

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.289
