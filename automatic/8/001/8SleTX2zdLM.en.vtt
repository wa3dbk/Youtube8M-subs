joint here at the back and then upper

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.750 
joint here at the back and then upper
biceps<00:01:42.080> all<00:01:42.290> double<00:01:42.830> checked<00:01:43.070> in<00:01:43.190> elbow<00:01:43.550> a

wrist<00:01:44.060> joint<00:01:44.420> here<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.380> then<00:01:45.850> waist

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
wrist joint here and then waist

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.190 
wrist joint here and then waist
articulation<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.960> can<00:01:48.200> also<00:01:48.410> pull<00:01:48.800> both<00:01:50.200> ends

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
articulation it can also pull both ends

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.620 
articulation it can also pull both ends
so<00:01:51.830> that<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:52.220> have<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.370> better<00:01:52.820> range<00:01:53.450> of

so that you have a better range of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.330 
so that you have a better range of
motion<00:01:53.990> on<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.200> waist<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:54.650> then<00:01:55.070> like

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
motion on the waist and then like

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.910 
motion on the waist and then like
articulation<00:01:56.000> right<00:01:56.480> here<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:56.930> good<00:01:57.620> splits

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
articulation right here and good splits

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.670 
articulation right here and good splits
and<00:01:58.159> then<00:01:58.700> double<00:01:59.330> jointed<00:01:59.720> knees<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.380> ankle

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
and then double jointed knees and ankle

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.130 
and then double jointed knees and ankle
joint<00:02:00.980> and<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.400> whole<00:02:01.640> joint<00:02:01.970> so<00:02:02.300> this<00:02:02.330> is<00:02:02.690> again

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
joint and a whole joint so this is again

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.710 
joint and a whole joint so this is again
what<00:02:03.409> I<00:02:03.440> said<00:02:03.740> before<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:04.370> reissue<00:02:05.270> of<00:02:05.480> the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
what I said before a reissue of the

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.440 
what I said before a reissue of the
figure<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.530> there<00:02:06.950> are<00:02:07.070> no<00:02:07.250> big<00:02:08.060> difference

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
figure and there are no big difference

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.880 
figure and there are no big difference
between<00:02:08.739> this<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.750> first<00:02:11.750> addition<00:02:12.379> so

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
between this and the first addition so

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.520 
between this and the first addition so
if<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.430> have<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.610> chance<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:15.170> your
