00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello living are like in this videos 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.240
 I'm going to teach how to make a candle with a 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.309
 orange and oil 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.039
 ok to do this truth we need 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.980
 an orange a knife a bit of 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.110
 olive oil and a lighter what 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.390
 let's do is cut right by the 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.570
 half is worth this orange let's do it 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.330
 the part where it opened the branch in 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.710
 this case was removed but good what 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.930
 only thing that we are going to do is cut by the 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.640
 half only the skin is worth no 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.960
 to the bottom 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.960
 and we are going to turn around 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.089
 we have already cut everything now we remove 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:59.699
 little by little the skin without actually removing 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.699
 the internal part we do little by little 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.159
 and now what is it about is about 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.470
 remove all this part to stay 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.650
 with 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.200
 this here is valid in this case during 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.580
 it's tried and broken but good if 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.450
 it happens to us that it is the same then we will see 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.450
 how can we fix it only 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.450
 we came 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:41.360
 and we stretch straight 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.880
 and we get everything everything is perfectly 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.450
 yes if you do it and it breaks 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.009
 what you can do is remove 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.350
 what had happened to me in here what 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.740
 I removed it remains the hole you put it 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.539
 here inside and then with a little bit with a 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.640
 candle you can burn and cover the holes 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.810
 so that when you put the oil there is no 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.810
 fall worth 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.770
 once we're going to do this I 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.530
 removed the top part and trimmed 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.890
 so you can see why because when 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.750
 this is burning we can cover it and the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.630
 wind yes yes we should use it with 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.100
 wind will not affect you so much and so 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.410
 in this way it would be a little more 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.150
 covered I'm going to declare a little 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.640
 making the little holes is very 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.370
 simple I picked up a piece of a pen and 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.970
 nothing, I'm just going to do some 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.970
 holes like that 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.989
 so that the light comes out a little more 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.460
 we can do this with any tube 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.060
 and in any way 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.470
 in fact a very simple way and if 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.100
 when we cover it 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.630
 will be next 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.000
 once we have done 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.950
 this and this we can do is put 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.340
 very simple oil and look to wet 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.340
 pretty he 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.460
 what we have left here the twig 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.560
 OK 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.830
 but oil putting it right by the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.830
 medium 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.800
 I recommend that when you are 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.590
 using what you put underneath a 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.480
 plate in case lost the oil 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.960
 enough and now with a good waiter 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.350
 You will have to wait a while but 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.350
 we have games 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.590
 this male is not very powerful but as 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.420
 you will have to wait a while and 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.420
 when you start when you start learning 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.420
 ok we have the candle this will last us 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:14.690
 We wait a while for him to take a 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.690
 little more and now we can see how it is 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.560
 well let's say the result we see that has 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.630
 it's pretty good and we'll have it 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.759
 little light but it is very nice 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.580
 apart you will get a scent the 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.910
 pretty good room and how can you 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.910
 watch 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.950
 it looks pretty good we have done this 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.100
 superior protection that is good is 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.750
 quite nice because I do not expect anything 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.720
 you liked the video and you see that it is 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.100
 very simple and nothing you can see other 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.290
 videos in a like that are very 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.440
 interesting thank you very much and until the 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.440
 next
