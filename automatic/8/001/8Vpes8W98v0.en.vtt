00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
people used it and I myself personally

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.560 
people used it and I myself personally
didn't<00:03:07.620> like<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.100> again<00:03:08.430> hopefully<00:03:09.210> they

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
didn't like it so again hopefully they

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.240

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
actually go outside of the box actually

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.730 
actually go outside of the box actually
do<00:03:11.610> things<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.000> haven't<00:03:12.210> been<00:03:12.360> done<00:03:12.450> before

I'm<00:03:23.160> gonna<00:03:23.250> give<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.520> a<00:03:23.580> shot<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.030> as<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.330> now

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
I'm gonna give it a shot and as of now

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.750 
I'm gonna give it a shot and as of now
we<00:03:24.510> really<00:03:24.990> don't<00:03:25.170> know<00:03:25.410> much<00:03:25.710> more<00:03:26.010> apart

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
we really don't know much more apart

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.670 
we really don't know much more apart
from<00:03:26.850> this<00:03:27.030> cover<00:03:27.360> art<00:03:27.690> for<00:03:27.930> all<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:28.470> know

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
from this cover art for all we know

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.440 
from this cover art for all we know
that's<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.040> how<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.370> character<00:03:29.850> looks<00:03:30.150> his

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
that's just how the character looks his

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.120 
that's just how the character looks his
arms<00:03:30.870> were<00:03:30.930> may<00:03:31.110> be<00:03:31.170> blown<00:03:31.440> off<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.860> they<00:03:31.950> brew

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
arms were may be blown off and they brew

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.520 
arms were may be blown off and they brew
so<00:03:32.580> again<00:03:32.880> this<00:03:33.210> is<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> speculation<00:03:34.020> but<00:03:34.410> for

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
so again this is a speculation but for

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
so again this is a speculation but for
the<00:03:34.590> most<00:03:34.710> part<00:03:34.860> it<00:03:35.070> looks<00:03:35.220> as<00:03:35.310> if<00:03:35.400> he<00:03:35.520> is

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
the most part it looks as if he is

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.460 
the most part it looks as if he is
wearing<00:03:35.850> an<00:03:35.970> exoskeleton<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.840> again<00:03:37.200> as<00:03:37.320> I've

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
wearing an exoskeleton and again as I've

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.840 
wearing an exoskeleton and again as I've
said<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.680> thousand<00:03:38.130> times<00:03:38.160> before<00:03:38.400> I

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
said a thousand times before I

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.610 
said a thousand times before I
personally<00:03:39.240> would<00:03:39.810> not<00:03:39.960> want<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.260> see<00:03:40.410> anyone

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
personally would not want to see anyone

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.320 
personally would not want to see anyone
