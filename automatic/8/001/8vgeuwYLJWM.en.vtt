00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.720
 good 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.080
 hello to everyone here that is 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.719
 commenting on a videotutorial more than 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.940
 minecraft we will solve this fault 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.770
 that does not let us play is the video pub 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.599
 card drivers and for this we are going to 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.480
 need a program that is the king 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.279
 bile and the link slider that you are going to 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.320
 see in the description 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.759
 as always and good once 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.530
 let's install and everything we give to scan 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.900
 now 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.830
 and now this is going to do is scan 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.190
 all our drivers the drivers that 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:42.870
 we have in the computer 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.879
 and that will help us to see the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.769
 update the rider's forgiveness to be able to 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.000
 save minecraft good against dole 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.920
 obsolete 24 in my case and I lack mind 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.239
 what do we do now, let's see 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.299
 that I already have it installed and then 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.920
 well I explain better when the 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.990
 diet means you do not have this 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.300
 it means that you have to update it 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.510
 and this in you means that you have it 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.090
 well you have to find where these three 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.580
 Screen adapters in cases are the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.610
 internal mobile 925 express chipset 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.260
 family we do now we stay 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.870
 with this name and we give you to obtain 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.150
 drivers in my case now we get 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.120
 but with the name that you owe 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.650
 you have to look for it here and 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.340
 give it to download it for example I'm going to 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.340
 download this 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.560
 Well, I had to cut the video 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:37.090
 since it was getting very long and 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.259
 download other trailers cook but 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.539
 only to serve as an example 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.840
 Once it is downloaded we give it to 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.840
 install 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.530
 and now I get this that there is no 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.789
 no file is there but to you 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.770
 you will leave typical of 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.979
 the typical thing to install it is that it's all 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.060
 and well I will solve the problem and 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.490
 you can play minecraft and 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.100
 enjoy it good has served it
