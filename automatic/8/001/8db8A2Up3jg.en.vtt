powered as you can all figure that out

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.120 
powered as you can all figure that out
and<00:01:06.049> when<00:01:07.049> you're<00:01:07.170> monitoring<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.860> most

um it goes too straight into my computer
speakers<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.540> use<00:01:27.689> those<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.909> I

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
speakers there so I can use those and I

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.929 
speakers there so I can use those and I
will<00:01:30.360> use<00:01:30.689> those<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.790> monitoring<00:01:32.790> when<00:01:32.909> I

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
will use those for monitoring when I

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.060 
will use those for monitoring when I
record<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.509> guitar<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:34.770> actually

record the guitar because I was actually
mixing<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.549> using<00:01:35.790> my<00:01:35.880> headphones<00:01:36.270> next<00:01:37.070> um

and<00:04:53.080> that's<00:04:53.590> just<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.920> demo<00:04:54.100> that<00:04:54.310> came<00:04:54.520> with<00:04:54.760> it

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
and that's just a demo that came with it

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.420 
and that's just a demo that came with it
um<00:04:57.370> you've<00:04:58.030> got<00:04:58.210> your<00:04:58.360> feature<00:04:59.040> EQ<00:05:00.040> up<00:05:00.190> here

um you've got your feature EQ up here

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.760 
um you've got your feature EQ up here
which<00:05:00.640> is<00:05:00.940> it's<00:05:01.270> just<00:05:01.360> a<00:05:01.600> low<00:05:01.750> and<00:05:01.870> a<00:05:01.930> high<00:05:01.960> low

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
and when it is off it uses the effects

and when it is off it uses the effects
send<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:17.170> returns<00:05:17.670> which<00:05:18.670> are<00:05:18.820> on<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:18.970> back

got a pan down here you can pan certain

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.470 
got a pan down here you can pan certain
tracks<00:05:36.360> and<00:05:37.360> then<00:05:37.720> usually<00:05:37.900> affects<00:05:38.620> return

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
tracks and then usually affects return

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.580

explain<00:05:57.370> all<00:05:57.430> this<00:05:57.670> later<00:05:57.910> when<00:05:58.150> I<00:05:58.210> do<00:05:58.300> my

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
explain all this later when I do my

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.310 
explain all this later when I do my
recording<00:05:58.960> demo<00:05:59.140> video<00:06:02.130> here<00:06:03.130> down<00:06:03.370> here<00:06:03.670> just

recording demo video here down here just

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.870 
recording demo video here down here just
get<00:06:05.320> your<00:06:05.440> shift<00:06:05.680> button<00:06:06.070> like<00:06:06.220> I<00:06:06.250> said<00:06:06.580> the

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
get your shift button like I said the

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.640 
get your shift button like I said the
autopunch<00:06:07.330> Wheelock's<00:06:07.780> I'll<00:06:08.080> explain<00:06:08.470> that

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
autopunch Wheelock's I'll explain that

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.210 
autopunch Wheelock's I'll explain that
later<00:06:09.360> rehearsal<00:06:10.360> key<00:06:10.570> which<00:06:10.840> I<00:06:11.170> don't<00:06:11.830> really

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
later rehearsal key which I don't really

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.890 
later rehearsal key which I don't really
know<00:06:12.400> what<00:06:12.490> it<00:06:12.580> does<00:06:12.760> and<00:06:13.120> I'll<00:06:13.540> probably<00:06:13.720> just

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
know what it does and I'll probably just

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.240 
know what it does and I'll probably just
explain<00:06:14.290> this<00:06:14.440> when<00:06:14.620> I<00:06:14.650> figure<00:06:14.920> out<00:06:15.010> what<00:06:15.160> it

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
explain this when I figure out what it

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.940 
explain this when I figure out what it
does<00:06:15.390> the<00:06:16.390> repeat<00:06:16.750> key<00:06:16.960> which<00:06:17.170> loops<00:06:17.740> a

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
does the repeat key which loops a

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.160 
does the repeat key which loops a
certain<00:06:18.280> part<00:06:18.460> of<00:06:18.580> your<00:06:18.670> song<00:06:18.910> the<00:06:19.780> history

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
certain part of your song the history

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.200 
certain part of your song the history
key<00:06:20.440> which<00:06:20.710> goes<00:06:20.920> back<00:06:21.190> to<00:06:21.250> all<00:06:21.490> edits<00:06:22.030> which

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
key which goes back to all edits which

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.300 
key which goes back to all edits which
I'll<00:06:22.360> explain<00:06:22.450> later<00:06:22.720> also<00:06:23.140> and<00:06:23.740> then<00:06:24.130> your

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
I'll explain later also and then your

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.050 
I'll explain later also and then your
instant<00:06:24.760> undo<00:06:25.090> and<00:06:25.390> select<00:06:26.050> redo<00:06:26.410> button<00:06:27.060> and
