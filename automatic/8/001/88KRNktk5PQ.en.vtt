sound up here to see here it says right

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.799 
sound up here to see here it says right
there<00:00:53.719> if<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.870> throw<00:00:55.140> it'll<00:00:55.559> break<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.219> I

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
there if you throw it'll break so I

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.580 
there if you throw it'll break so I
believe<00:00:57.809> that's<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> said<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.440> comes

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
believe that's what it said it comes

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.740 
believe that's what it said it comes
across<00:00:59.100> at<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.399> bottom<00:00:59.670> so<00:00:59.820> if<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.629> guys

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
across at the bottom so if you guys

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.240 
across at the bottom so if you guys
think<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.170> i'll<00:01:01.289> go<00:01:01.410> ahead<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:02.100> be

are<00:01:51.060> really<00:01:51.240> cool<00:01:51.509> too<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.200> uses<00:01:52.500> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
are really cool too it uses the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.580 
are really cool too it uses the
accelerometer<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:54.060> realize<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.439> you're

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
accelerometer to realize that you're

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.780 
accelerometer to realize that you're
throwing<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.040> almost<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.610> would<00:01:56.759> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
throwing it almost like you would a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.630 
throwing it almost like you would a
punch<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.079> go<00:01:58.259> ahead<00:01:58.290> throw<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> punch

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
punch so you go ahead throw like a punch

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.760 
punch so you go ahead throw like a punch
it's<00:01:59.880> going<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> make<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> sound<00:02:00.770> see

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it's going to make the sound see

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.649 
it's going to make the sound see
