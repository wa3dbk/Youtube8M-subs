 very very simple easy for beginner 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.080
 even nothing was elaborated 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.150
 botanically correct for you to 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.599
 suddenly need an idea a cookie 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.880
 and do not know what to do, we'll see the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.430
 we have for today is very easy. 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.219
 Short, quick, you can watch it already. 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.719
 ran to the kitchen to do ok everything that 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.360
 We're going to need to do this. 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:45.360
 small simple flower is a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:49.410
 sieve an obvious one straws 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.730
 end scissors on the paste 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.059
 American White and American Folder 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.250
 yellow or the color of my desired 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.579
 So folks to start this little 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.619
 daisy it's very simple let's do 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.770
 first a piece of American paste 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.930
 white 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.990
 if you want to mix 6 media with a 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.330
 share our flower can mix 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.530
 also but there is no need crop 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.380
 very simple it made the little ball and we go 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.439
 make a small drop then with this 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:31.079
 Ball does not have to be a good one, too. 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.600
 Just fine, just right here. 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.570
 a bit of a bit macho part 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.360
 Larger, okay with a small one. 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.420
 thin tip scissors 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.680
 We're going to have a butt here central. 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.229
 I had these two parts in attacks 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.110
 then separated in each of them we 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.430
 cut half again 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:02.000
 so here it comes and half-quoting 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.000
 here and now I got 4 part right 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:17.760
 now between each piece of it again 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:20.439
 is half more here and finally the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.090
 so what we have so far this 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:27.730
 mess here ok with the tooth duckling 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.549
 We are going, I'm going to put it just a little bit 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.870
 of masena here in the farm of my finger 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.629
 so as not to run the risk of putting 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.260
 my skin like toothpick we 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:42.239
 let's just watch this movement 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.239
 then tweaking each petal 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:57.159
 so let's do this for each session 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:58.719
 this cut is ready here now 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.049
 It's very simple, I'll just give one 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:05.129
 pinched at the tip of each petal 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.129
 that we just created 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.850
 Join everyone here and we'll go 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.870
 leave this little bit separate because 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.800
 Now I'm going to work on my beautiful hen. 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.000
 for me mourinho 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.040
 We'll get you a yellow batter. 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.720
 can lighten your color or can work 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.210
 with tone you want 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:38.620
 so here we get one so much 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:42.400
 tiny yellow mass and is 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:48.100
 let us now to pass this sieve 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:50.230
 mass not totally just karen bando 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.370
 in the sieve screen to have this 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.620
 result 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:01.030
 ok and with that we have the little one 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:05.800
 of our swim and had ultra fast 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:09.730
 we put it in the middle and look at the 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:13.720
 result and with it we put Stephano 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.930
 gomes in the field cake in the sweet without using 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:21.130
 no expensive material nothing that 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.570
 You can not have it at home and then you liked it. 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.750
 More of this video lesson 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.670
 I hope so soon more richer 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.670
 with total sugar
