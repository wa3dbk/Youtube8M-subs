00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.540
 hello I'm going to show you in this video a 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:10.340
 super self-massage for the musculature 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.590
 hamstring for the hamstrings 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.160
 for which we are going to use a stick 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.840
 like this 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.920
 [Music] 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.770
 It can be a stick of unesco bon ya veis 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.010
 which has a good thickness at least 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.590
 three centimeters worth has to be 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.690
 strong because we are also going to make a 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.410
 important strength I do not think a stick of 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.540
 normal broom can serve for this 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.090
 self massage 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.470
 in any way tell us about the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.280
 self massage 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.350
 as well as basic rules that we can 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.810
 perform it with both the knee bent 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.420
 as stretched we can vary that 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.970
 position because that is what is going to do that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.700
 also vary muscle tension and 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.309
 we will be able to work it from different 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.729
 way the self massage we can do it 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.840
 between 5 or 10 minutes although you already know that 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.460
 always left a margin a freedom there 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.310
 I believe that everyone has to decide 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.880
 how much time does the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.900
 massage the massage should be done with 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.940
 a separation never less than 456 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.090
 days since if you work intensely 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.450
 may be sore and will not be 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.820
 reasonable to work it up to date 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.580
 next, far from it and I think that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.560
 neither the second third day 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.360
 the auto message is going to be painful because 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.900
 we're going to do it with a stick we can 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.180
 enter intensely into the muscle can 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.390
 be painful but it should never be 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.820
 very painful do not hurt yourself too much 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.640
 it's not about masochism but about 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.460
 to work of loosening remember 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.240
 always let your breath out if you stop 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.380
 that the auto massage can be good 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.810
 cash and good let's move on 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.250
 directly to the massage we will use 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:12.030
 to make it some oil 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.160
 almonds if I'm going to throw myself if a 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.870
 little bit better for the stick 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.819
 can slip yes 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.710
 then we are going to place ourselves on a table 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:30.090
 if the soil 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:35.330
 in this position we miss the oil 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.330
 so that the area slides well 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.760
 and we're going to take the stick by passing it 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:45.390
 under the leg and we're going to apply 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.390
 a force 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.540
 so that we can go working as 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.700
 you see 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.590
 we can also vary the position of the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.819
 leg we can stretch the mass or 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.510
 bend it more 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.390
 so 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.120
 that muscle tension will vary 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.640
 also 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.250
 we will be able to work a little more 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.349
 inner zone where it is semimembranous 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:20.140
 semitendinoso or vice versa the external zone 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.510
 where is the femoral biceps that what 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.480
 we will perform by changing the position 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.060
 in which we put the sticks and this 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.010
 way we will work more biceps femoral of 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.890
 the opposite will work more the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.250
 internal musculature the movement has 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.790
 that being slow smooth deep is not about 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.079
 here to become a mass as if 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.709
 we were bread 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:47.470
 you have to go working softly we can 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:52.209
 work both of the knee towards the 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:55.200
 pelvis backwards as both can 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.200
 be useful 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:03.480
 the skin should not burn that's why 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.480
 we put a little oil 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.060
 OK 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.090
 and I insist it's a bit painful when 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.750
 well go deep musculature note 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.180
 this job does not mean anything 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:23.530
 we breathe and as long as it's not 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.840
 too much pain is not a very problem 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.910
 well and this is all you want to tell 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.330
 those of the exercise I think it's simple 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.610
 I assure you that it is a very useful exercise 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.220
 a very useful self- massage you will notice 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.230
 then the well-worked history goes to 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.840
 help you unload your muscles 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.520
 improve the circulation of this muscle 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.220
 can be used in the context of a 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.240
 breakage of fibers when it is already 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.850
 well advanced 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.980
 of course not the first weeks and 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.290
 nothing for the third week you can 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.160
 start working os the hamstring 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.610
 this way helping to loosen their 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.400
 tensions worth 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.090
 and this is all you want to tell already 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.520
 you know you can find another heap 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.479
 of self-massage videos of exercises 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:15.770
 of stretching all that here in this
