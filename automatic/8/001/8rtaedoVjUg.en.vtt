00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.800 
basically where it was when I got
dropped<00:02:34.770> off<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.610> full<00:02:35.940> charge<00:02:36.360> and

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
dropped off so this is a full charge and

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.120 
dropped off so this is a full charge and
that<00:02:37.620> all<00:02:37.740> adjusts<00:02:38.430> during<00:02:38.700> your<00:02:38.850> drive<00:02:40.130> like

that over here you can tell that we are
in<00:02:43.410> Eco<00:02:43.770> mode<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:46.260> charge<00:02:46.650> rub<00:02:46.980> as<00:02:47.190> I

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
in Eco mode and to charge rub as I

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.880 
in Eco mode and to charge rub as I
mentioned<00:02:47.760> before<00:02:48.440> there's<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.650> button

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
mentioned before there's the button

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.620 
mentioned before there's the button
right<00:02:49.980> there<00:02:50.040> I'm<00:02:50.490> gonna<00:02:50.640> push<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:50.940> don't<00:02:51.420> go

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
right there I'm gonna push it don't go

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.110 
right there I'm gonna push it don't go
outside<00:02:51.780> watch<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.410> oh<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:53.490> hear<00:02:53.700> something<00:02:54.060> I

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
outside watch this oh I hear something I

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.240 
outside watch this oh I hear something I
just<00:02:54.180> figured<00:02:54.570> out<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.040> turn<00:02:56.100> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
just figured out you have to turn the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.949 
just figured out you have to turn the
car<00:02:56.430> off

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
car off

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.680 
car off
before<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.140> can<00:02:58.380> open<00:02:58.620> up<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.510> electric<00:03:00.510> fuel

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
before you can open up the electric fuel

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.230 
before you can open up the electric fuel
tank<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.020> this<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.860> stage<00:03:02.520> 1<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.030> stage<00:03:03.060> 2

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
tank so this is a a stage 1 and stage 2

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.530 
tank so this is a a stage 1 and stage 2
charging<00:03:04.140> input<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.490> is<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.730> number<00:03:06.150> 3

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
charging input and this is a number 3

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.150 
charging input and this is a number 3
I'm<00:03:07.140> not<00:03:07.230> sure<00:03:07.350> those<00:03:07.500> terms<00:03:07.800> are<00:03:07.950> correctly

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
I'm not sure those terms are correctly

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.000 
I'm not sure those terms are correctly
but<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.370> know<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:08.580> is<00:03:08.670> 1<00:03:08.850> 2<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.450> 3<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.740> this

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
but I know this is 1 2 this is 3 so this

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.100 
but I know this is 1 2 this is 3 so this
is<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.520> use<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.630> plug<00:03:12.840> into<00:03:13.019> a

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
is you can use this to plug into a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.740 
is you can use this to plug into a
normal<00:03:13.350> house<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.970> supercharger

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
normal house and this is a supercharger

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.560 
normal house and this is a supercharger
let's<00:03:15.989> go<00:03:16.050> ahead<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.260> close<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.410> up<00:03:17.570> let's

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
let's go ahead and close that up let's

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.940 
let's go ahead and close that up let's
say<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.660> closer<00:03:18.930> look<00:03:19.170> at<00:03:19.410> what's<00:03:19.620> under<00:03:19.860> the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
say a closer look at what's under the

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.830 
say a closer look at what's under the
hood<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:22.470> here's<00:03:22.950> all<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.820> power<00:03:24.060> under<00:03:24.720> the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
hood so here's all the power under the

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.949 
hood so here's all the power under the
hood<00:03:25.070> basically<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.100> 2<00:03:26.340> battery<00:03:26.730> system<00:03:27.180> that

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
hood basically a 2 battery system that

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.780 
hood basically a 2 battery system that
I've<00:03:28.080> been<00:03:28.230> told<00:03:28.410> about<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.950> one<00:03:29.310> runs<00:03:29.610> the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
I've been told about and one runs the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.610 
I've been told about and one runs the
vehicle<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.690> wine<00:03:30.959> kind<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.320> run<00:03:31.440> some

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
vehicle and a wine kind of run some

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.560 
vehicle and a wine kind of run some
electricity<00:03:32.040> inside<00:03:32.580> when<00:03:33.180> you're<00:03:33.330> charging

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
electricity inside when you're charging

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.940 
electricity inside when you're charging
the<00:03:33.720> vehicle<00:03:34.050> there<00:03:34.200> are<00:03:34.290> three<00:03:34.500> lights<00:03:34.709> here

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
the vehicle there are three lights here

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.190 
the vehicle there are three lights here
up<00:03:35.160> on<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.340> dash<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:36.030> light<00:03:36.720> up<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.959> let<00:03:37.110> you

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
up on the dash that light up to let you

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.800 
up on the dash that light up to let you
know<00:03:37.320> how<00:03:37.560> much<00:03:37.850> juice<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:39.120> in<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.390> vehicle<00:03:39.540> so

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
know how much juice is in the vehicle so

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.390 
know how much juice is in the vehicle so
if<00:03:40.019> it's<00:03:40.140> all<00:03:40.290> full<00:03:40.590> all<00:03:40.860> through<00:03:41.100> your<00:03:41.190> lid

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
if it's all full all through your lid

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.550 
if it's all full all through your lid
then<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.940> car<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.239> fully<00:03:42.450> charged<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:43.080> guess

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
then the car is fully charged I guess

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.770 
then the car is fully charged I guess
then<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.739> light<00:03:44.010> up<00:03:44.040> pretty<00:03:44.280> well<00:03:44.459> at<00:03:44.580> night

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
then you light up pretty well at night

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.060 
then you light up pretty well at night
well<00:03:45.780> it's<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.989> head<00:03:46.200> room<00:03:46.470> here<00:03:46.680> in<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.799> front

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
well it's a head room here in the front

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.220 
well it's a head room here in the front
two<00:03:47.190> seats<00:03:47.220> although<00:03:47.880> there<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.180> no<00:03:48.420> sunroof<00:03:49.019> I

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
two seats although there is no sunroof I

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.880

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
guess that's okay

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.250 
guess that's okay
but<00:03:50.730> it's<00:03:50.850> gonna<00:03:50.970> be<00:03:51.060> pretty<00:03:51.420> interesting<00:03:52.049> to
