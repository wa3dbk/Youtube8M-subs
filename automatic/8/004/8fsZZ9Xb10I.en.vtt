you end up making less than minimum wage

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.369 
you end up making less than minimum wage
it's<00:02:14.519> cool<00:02:14.760> we'll<00:02:15.239> just<00:02:15.510> make<00:02:16.110> up<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
it's cool we'll just make up the

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.740 
it's cool we'll just make up the
difference<00:02:16.849> but<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:17.879> lot<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.090> places<00:02:18.300> don't

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
difference but a lot of places don't

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.790 
difference but a lot of places don't
actually<00:02:19.290> do<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.849> so<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:20.910> get<00:02:21.530> less<00:02:22.530> than

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
actually do that so you get less than

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.400 
actually do that so you get less than
minimum<00:02:22.950> wage<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:24.569> tips<00:02:24.810> don't<00:02:25.080> make<00:02:25.260> it

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
minimum wage and the tips don't make it

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.170 
minimum wage and the tips don't make it
so<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.620> even<00:02:25.950> make<00:02:26.099> minimum<00:02:26.459> wage<00:02:26.519> or<00:02:27.030> your

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
so you even make minimum wage or your

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.460 
so you even make minimum wage or your
commission<00:02:27.540> doesn't<00:02:27.840> make<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.260> even

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
commission doesn't make it so you even

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.619 
commission doesn't make it so you even
make<00:02:28.709> minimum<00:02:29.069> wage<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:30.090> they<00:02:30.209> don't<00:02:30.330> fucking

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
make minimum wage and they don't fucking

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.030 
make minimum wage and they don't fucking
make<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.870> up<00:02:31.019> they<00:02:31.319> just<00:02:31.470> say<00:02:31.620> okay<00:02:31.890> sorry

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
make it up they just say okay sorry

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.830 
make it up they just say okay sorry
seems<00:02:32.849> like<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.180> you're<00:02:33.360> not<00:02:33.510> getting

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
seems like that you're not getting

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.300 
seems like that you're not getting
you're<00:02:34.410> getting<00:02:34.440> hardly<00:02:34.890> anything<00:02:35.099> today

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
you're getting hardly anything today

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.130 
you're getting hardly anything today
that's<00:02:38.310> such<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> backward<00:02:39.299> system<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.019> that's

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
that's such a backward system and that's

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.630 
that's such a backward system and that's
why<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.379> think<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.739> is<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:41.340> gonna

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
why I think this is it's gonna

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.300 
why I think this is it's gonna
eventually<00:02:42.299> be<00:02:42.810> gone<00:02:43.049> see<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.830> me<00:02:43.860> when<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.099> look

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
eventually be gone see to me when I look

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.130 
eventually be gone see to me when I look
at<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> tipping<00:02:45.120> system<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.599> reminds<00:02:45.900> me<00:02:46.049> of

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
at a tipping system it reminds me of

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.910 
at a tipping system it reminds me of
like<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.709> time<00:02:47.370> before<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.329> minimum<00:02:48.870> wage

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
like a time before the minimum wage

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.949 
like a time before the minimum wage
existed<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.880> there<00:02:51.120> was<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.299> time<00:02:51.599> when<00:02:51.630> there

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
existed that there was a time when there

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.930 
existed that there was a time when there
was<00:02:52.110> no<00:02:52.260> minimum<00:02:52.590> wage<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.640> was<00:02:53.760> this

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
was no minimum wage and it was this

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.580 
was no minimum wage and it was this
thing<00:02:54.150> everybody<00:02:54.599> just<00:02:54.750> accepted<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.319> right

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
thing everybody just accepted it right

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.589 
thing everybody just accepted it right
like<00:02:55.769> everybody<00:02:56.069> just<00:02:56.130> accepts<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.790> tip<00:02:57.209> you

make<00:03:43.470> minimum<00:03:43.859> wage<00:03:43.919> I<00:03:44.340> think<00:03:44.609> a<00:03:44.669> lot<00:03:44.849> of<00:03:44.880> it

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
make minimum wage I think a lot of it

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.280 
make minimum wage I think a lot of it
has<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.120> do<00:03:45.329> with<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.569> fact<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.109> people

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
has to do with the fact that the people

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.120 
has to do with the fact that the people
who<00:03:46.500> do<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.889> are<00:03:47.010> often<00:03:47.370> at<00:03:47.880> times<00:03:47.940> on

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
who do it are often at times on

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.530 
who do it are often at times on
undocumented<00:03:50.130> immigrants<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.150> say<00:03:51.269> we<00:03:51.299> can

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
undocumented immigrants so I say we can

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.569 
undocumented immigrants so I say we can

this restaurant is moving down that road

this restaurant is moving down that road
and<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.610> do<00:04:35.670> think<00:04:36.180> at<00:04:36.300> some<00:04:36.480> point<00:04:36.540> that's

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
and I I do think at some point that's

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.410 
and I I do think at some point that's
the<00:04:37.140> future<00:04:37.290> I<00:04:37.500> do<00:04:37.710> think<00:04:38.040> at<00:04:38.130> some<00:04:38.340> point

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
the future I do think at some point

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.910 
the future I do think at some point
we're<00:04:39.420> gonna<00:04:39.510> phase<00:04:39.840> out<00:04:40.110> tipping<00:04:40.560> because

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
we're gonna phase out tipping because

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.390 
we're gonna phase out tipping because
it's<00:04:41.910> again<00:04:42.540> there's<00:04:42.900> no<00:04:42.960> argument<00:04:43.740> for<00:04:44.220> it

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
it's again there's no argument for it

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.550 
it's again there's no argument for it
and<00:04:44.610> there's<00:04:44.850> places<00:04:45.390> are<00:04:45.660> starting<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.170> move

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
and there's places are starting to move

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.050 
and there's places are starting to move
in<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.740> other<00:04:46.830> direction<00:04:47.130> now<00:04:47.640> and<00:04:47.970> I<00:04:48.030> think

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
in the other direction now and I think

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.120 
in the other direction now and I think
it's<00:04:48.450> going<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:48.990> be<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.140> domino<00:04:49.530> effect<00:04:49.560> at<00:04:49.950> some

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
it's going to be a domino effect at some

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.610 
it's going to be a domino effect at some
point<00:04:50.370> where<00:04:50.810> people<00:04:51.810> say<00:04:52.020> look<00:04:52.320> we<00:04:52.440> just

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
point where people say look we just

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.900 
point where people say look we just
can't<00:04:52.800> have<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:53.100> like<00:04:53.130> this<00:04:53.370> anymore<00:04:53.610> because

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
can't have it like this anymore because

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.040 
can't have it like this anymore because
it's<00:04:54.180> too<00:04:54.390> fucked<00:04:54.660> up<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:55.230> people<00:04:55.440> like<00:04:55.860> it
