00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.740
 me 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:20.439
 Today is the former Olympic Japanese representative forest tile 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:22.450
 Thank you very much for looking at the trap from athlete project tama today 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:27.760
 Today is ah 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:34.090
 We introduce bone of turn of 10 type from Hira Kojo 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:38.350
 The trick of this net turn is, after all, from a wide tree to a 10-type individual medley 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:42.470
 It will be most important to turn in the 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:46.280
 After all, from swimming 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:51.710
 After all put a sheet in crawl and so on 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.680
 And when you crawl, of course you are early on him 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.730
 The person who switched the sometimes fast 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:06.500
 Of course it is chrome which is faster if you compete with crawling and swimming 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:12.700
 Able to do well the behavior changes to crawl in goods to take to turn there for that I mean grinded 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:15.540
 You of the can put a where more difference to the people who pay on by one by 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.600
 What is important here is 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.690
 It will be uplift after the move of the turn 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:31.630
 So when you turn firmly 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:33.950
 Keep in mind that you will walk straight to your right and receive the wall gently 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:40.700
 Please try to turn 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:43.680
 So nice to not panic not kick properly a wall around fast in a hurry here and the subsequent 10-inch 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:51.690
 It does not lead to dolphin there 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:54.630
 This is faster if you speed up by kicking properly than players who are swimming swimmers 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:00.870
 Since it will be where the difference to be able 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.670
 If you do so, you can finish the goal with the last crawl with enough time 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.380
 More to receive the wall strongly 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.380
 Please try consciously 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:15.140
 How about a 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:20.510

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.459
 Really After me now it is well aware of one of the swim is a little bit of point 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.459
 I'm glad 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:29.970
 It is the people that want to know it a little more still more detailed floor thing about this swim 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.020

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:39.550
