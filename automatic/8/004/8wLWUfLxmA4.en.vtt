smoothly consistently giving you a
better<00:03:27.630> burn<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.230> hopefully<00:03:28.859> a<00:03:28.889> better<00:03:29.010> throw

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
better burn and hopefully a better throw

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.280 
better burn and hopefully a better throw
can't<00:03:29.970> always<00:03:30.150> guarantee<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.959> throw<00:03:31.200> is

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
can't always guarantee that the throw is

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.740 
can't always guarantee that the throw is
going<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.530> be<00:03:31.620> there<00:03:31.829> but<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:33.180> know<00:03:33.209> not<00:03:33.569> out

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
going to be there but you know not out

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.550 
going to be there but you know not out
of<00:03:33.780> 10<00:03:34.019> it<00:03:34.260> usually<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:35.329> so<00:03:36.329> that's<00:03:36.510> great<00:03:36.690> now

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
of 10 it usually is so that's great now

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.370 
of 10 it usually is so that's great now
the<00:03:38.220> throw<00:03:38.519> I'm<00:03:38.790> like<00:03:39.569> I<00:03:39.660> said<00:03:39.810> earlier<00:03:39.840> it

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
the throw I'm like I said earlier it

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.470 
the throw I'm like I said earlier it
basically<00:03:41.130> had<00:03:41.459> me<00:03:41.609> on<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:41.760> floor<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.060> couldn't

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
basically had me on the floor I couldn't

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.289 
basically had me on the floor I couldn't
move<00:03:42.630> choke<00:03:43.620> me<00:03:43.799> out<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.340> guess<00:03:44.609> what<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:45.030> loved

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299

every minute of it and I like it with
this<00:03:46.980> candle<00:03:47.430> because<00:03:47.519> i<00:03:47.910> think<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:50.370> set

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
this candle because i think that the set

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.699 
this candle because i think that the set
requires<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.299> throw<00:03:51.660> like<00:03:51.690> this<00:03:52.109> it's<00:03:52.350> it's
