00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.420
 of chocolate in sparks in red color 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.420
 two chocolates 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.420

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.760
 a plastic stick of those of which 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.610
 used for chocolate popsicles 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.440
 glass for chocolate color palettes 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.219

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.219
 and some scissors 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.720

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.590
 I occupy it red and green a bag of 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.590
 cellophane girl 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:54.960
 a toothpick 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:58.140
 and a spoon well let's start 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.530
 The first thing we're going to do is we're going to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.530
 to put 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.530
 the stick in one of the chocolates 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.060
 and the other chocolate is going to grab 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.420
 This is how we are going to start with the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.750
 extremes 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.060
 let it be like 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.300
 a little piquito let's use a half the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.420
 another half we are not going to occupy 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:31.060
 and what we're going to do is we're going to 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.060
 hit like this so they have to stay 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.679
 in the form of a cuff 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:44.729
 what we are going to do is let's melt 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.729
 the chocolate in the microwave with 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.670
 if at that minute is not 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.909
 melting is not achieved 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.380
 it gets half a minute more 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.380
 take out and go 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.790
 it happens to us 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.140
 i 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.220
 for lara in 30,000 seconds for 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.220
 tablets 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.939
 and we're going to put it through 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.700
 let's go a little so it's 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.860
 it seems that she is ready 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.860
 and we will pay 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.050
 what we do is that we have so 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.890
 coming out what we're going to do is give it 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.910
 return 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.910
 turn around 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:28.040
 and this is going to melt 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.939
 I do not want anymore 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.939

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.150
 all right 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.950
 now what we are going to do 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.890
 is 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.860
 let's fill up with chocolate what is the 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:00.430
 part 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.430
 from above that we put the chocolate 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.300

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.300
 little red 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:23.560
 we will cover it very well 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.560
 to make it right 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.669
 With the spoon we will remove the 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.669
 excess 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.960
 once we have removed the excess 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.389
 with the 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:47.389
 dark chocolate 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.610
 with the glass that of her 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:57.680
 let's remove the tip 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.680
 we are going to put the eyes 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.860
 with the stick we are going to how to give it well 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.849
 that they are well even 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.849
 little eyes 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.240
 Y 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:28.520
 with the same white we will remove the 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.520
 excess we are going to make him the ace 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.510
 balls 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.140
 again with the stick we are going to 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.140
 accommodate the balls 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.240
 let's remove the excess 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.980
 and so we will stay 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:18.200
 I already have 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:22.729
 one in green 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.680
 in green color already finished and dry 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:27.860
 this is how 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:31.630
 Now what we are going to do is with the 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.630
 cellophane bag blanket 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.460
 the black eye fell but a dessert 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:54.450

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.450
 with the curling we are going to tie 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.180
 the chorritos 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:19.990
 and so we have the little mushroom 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:23.290
 from mario bros this can be used 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:25.120
 how to fit them for centerpieces or 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:28.509

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:32.800
 individually on a birthday or in 

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:35.169
 I hope that you liked it and 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.470
