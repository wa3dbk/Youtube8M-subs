00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
one is now belt driven which is what BMW

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.120 
one is now belt driven which is what BMW
Mercedes<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.270> Lexus<00:02:01.560> use

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
saw my old video of the Genesis r-spec I

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.900 
saw my old video of the Genesis r-spec I
couldn't<00:03:19.690> believe<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:20.260> sporty<00:03:21.010> Genesis

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
couldn't believe that a sporty Genesis

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.449 
couldn't believe that a sporty Genesis
was<00:03:22.180> not<00:03:22.299> going<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.480> have<00:03:23.070> paddle<00:03:24.070> shifters

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
was not going to have paddle shifters

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.910 
was not going to have paddle shifters
but<00:03:24.700> now<00:03:24.850> every<00:03:25.450> single<00:03:25.840> Genesis<00:03:26.380> gets<00:03:26.560> paddle

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
but now every single Genesis gets paddle

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.539 
but now every single Genesis gets paddle
shifters<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:28.269> what's<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.540> bottom<00:03:28.810> line<00:03:29.549> we

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
the transmission is good but the engine

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
to see how loud they are

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.400 
to see how loud they are
we<00:04:22.530> also<00:04:22.800> drove<00:04:22.949> the<00:04:23.130> v8<00:04:23.430> which<00:04:24.270> which<00:04:24.720> is<00:04:24.930> fine

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
we also drove the v8 which which is fine

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.080 
we also drove the v8 which which is fine
we<00:04:25.620> got<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.800> zero<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.100> 60<00:04:26.400> times<00:04:26.550> about<00:04:26.789> 6

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
we got to zero to 60 times about 6

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.040 
we got to zero to 60 times about 6
seconds<00:04:27.449> which<00:04:27.570> is<00:04:27.600> a<00:04:27.720> little<00:04:27.960> bit

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
seconds which is a little bit

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.129 
seconds which is a little bit
disappointing<00:04:28.229> for<00:04:28.860> for<00:04:29.550> a<00:04:29.580> big<00:04:29.760> v8<00:04:30.139> car

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
the wheelbase got longer and there's

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.939 
the wheelbase got longer and there's
just<00:04:48.180> more<00:04:48.240> content<00:04:48.810> inside<00:04:49.139> because<00:04:49.919> that

just more content inside because that

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.890 
just more content inside because that
that<00:04:50.220> that's<00:04:50.460> certainly<00:04:50.820> added<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.479> to

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
the weight but overall they did a fine

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.490 
the weight but overall they did a fine

this vehicle if you wanted something

this<00:05:03.150> size<00:05:03.419> rear-wheel<00:05:04.320> drive<00:05:04.349> you<00:05:05.280> don't

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
this size rear-wheel drive you don't

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.450 
this size rear-wheel drive you don't
have<00:05:05.789> a<00:05:05.820> lot<00:05:06.120> of<00:05:06.150> a<00:05:06.570> lot<00:05:06.780> of<00:05:06.900> options<00:05:07.410> in<00:05:07.949> that

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
have a lot of a lot of options in that

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.700 
have a lot of a lot of options in that
price<00:05:08.729> range<00:05:09.000> you<00:05:09.930> really<00:05:10.169> have<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.440> go<00:05:10.560> up<00:05:10.680> to

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
price range you really have to go up to

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.439 
price range you really have to go up to
almost<00:05:11.570> $50,000<00:05:12.570> to<00:05:13.470> get<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.650> Lexus<00:05:14.130> GS<00:05:14.430> or

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
almost $50,000 to get a Lexus GS or

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.140 
almost $50,000 to get a Lexus GS or
I<00:05:15.509> think<00:05:15.809> can<00:05:15.960> get<00:05:16.110> a<00:05:16.139> CTS<00:05:16.800> with<00:05:17.789> it<00:05:17.909> with<00:05:18.029> the

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
I think can get a CTS with it with the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.239 
I think can get a CTS with it with the
four<00:05:18.360> cylinder<00:05:18.659> around<00:05:18.960> 46,000<00:05:19.949> so<00:05:20.039> to<00:05:20.129> get

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:20.249 
four cylinder around 46,000 so to get

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:22.189 
four cylinder around 46,000 so to get
one<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.610> get<00:05:20.729> it<00:05:20.819> with<00:05:20.909> a<00:05:20.939> v6<00:05:21.150> you're<00:05:22.020> going<00:05:22.139> to

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
one to get it with a v6 you're going to

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.510 
one to get it with a v6 you're going to
be<00:05:22.289> up<00:05:22.559> over<00:05:22.770> 50<00:05:23.309> so<00:05:23.729> there's<00:05:24.270> really<00:05:24.569> about<00:05:25.199> a

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
be up over 50 so there's really about a

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.429 
be up over 50 so there's really about a
$12,000<00:05:26.520> buffer<00:05:27.029> between<00:05:27.180> this<00:05:27.599> and<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.199> next

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:28.439 
$12,000 buffer between this and the next

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:31.579 
$12,000 buffer between this and the next
comparably<00:05:29.069> equipped<00:05:29.990> premium<00:05:30.990> rear-wheel

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:31.589 
comparably equipped premium rear-wheel

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:34.249 
comparably equipped premium rear-wheel
drive<00:05:31.620> sedan<00:05:32.370> and<00:05:32.669> that<00:05:33.270> is<00:05:33.479> a<00:05:33.509> big<00:05:33.809> difference

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
drive sedan and that is a big difference

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.049 
drive sedan and that is a big difference
and<00:05:34.680> in<00:05:34.800> some<00:05:35.069> cases<00:05:35.309> it's<00:05:35.639> as<00:05:35.759> much<00:05:35.909> as

00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:36.059 
and in some cases it's as much as

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:39.019 
and in some cases it's as much as
$20,000<00:05:37.020> so<00:05:37.710> we<00:05:38.039> factor<00:05:38.279> all<00:05:38.610> that<00:05:38.819> into

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:39.029 
$20,000 so we factor all that into

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:40.700 
$20,000 so we factor all that into
consideration<00:05:39.059> the<00:05:39.930> seats<00:05:40.229> have<00:05:40.409> gotten

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
consideration the seats have gotten

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.939 
consideration the seats have gotten
considerably<00:05:40.889> better<00:05:42.199> last<00:05:43.199> model<00:05:43.589> seats

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.339 
considerably better last model seats
weren't<00:05:44.099> that<00:05:44.279> great<00:05:44.430> seats<00:05:45.120> are<00:05:45.270> great<00:05:45.479> this

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349
