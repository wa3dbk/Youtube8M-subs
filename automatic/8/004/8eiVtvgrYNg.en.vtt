00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
first of all they didn't even lunch the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.030

online<00:01:03.570> when<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> game<00:01:04.080> came<00:01:04.379> out<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.920> then

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
online when the game came out and then

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.679 
online when the game came out and then
when<00:01:05.220> they<00:01:05.250> did<00:01:05.580> launch<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> wasn't<00:01:06.390> right

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
when they did launch it it wasn't right

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.170 
for a while so I think for that 2k
deserves<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.900> bit<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.229> pass<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.909> want<00:01:12.150> to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
deserves a bit of a pass and I want to
