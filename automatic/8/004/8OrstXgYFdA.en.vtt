00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
different mixes and new brains to help

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.220 
different mixes and new brains to help
movement<00:00:27.000> freedom<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.420> movement<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:28.140> also

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
movement freedom of movement but also

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.299 
movement freedom of movement but also
helped<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.740> maintain<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.640> good<00:00:30.179> level<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.689> cost

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
helped it maintain a good level of cost

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.240 
helped it maintain a good level of cost
so<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.489> starts<00:00:32.579> up<00:00:32.910> work<00:00:33.329> away<00:00:33.570> down<00:00:34.250> at

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
so if it starts up work away down at

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.020 
so if it starts up work away down at
neck<00:00:35.610> we've<00:00:36.390> got<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> rolled<00:00:36.750> finish<00:00:37.219> so<00:00:38.219> it

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
neck we've got a rolled finish so it

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.090 
neck we've got a rolled finish so it
gives<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.420> nice<00:00:39.570> soft<00:00:40.200> finish<00:00:40.410> against<00:00:40.770> skin

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
gives it a nice soft finish against skin

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.779 
gives it a nice soft finish against skin
also<00:00:41.340> helps<00:00:41.879> maintain<00:00:42.079> the<00:00:43.460> neoprene<00:00:44.460> doesn't

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
also helps maintain the neoprene doesn't

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.040 
also helps maintain the neoprene doesn't
start<00:00:45.030> fraying<00:00:45.390> at<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.020> linings<00:00:46.559> or<00:00:46.680> anything

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
start fraying at the linings or anything

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.350 
start fraying at the linings or anything
little<00:00:49.050> convenient<00:00:49.590> expand<00:00:50.579> around<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> neck

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
little convenient expand around the neck

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.299 
little convenient expand around the neck
so<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:51.989> you're<00:00:52.199> after<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.559> dive<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.250> hit

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
so if you're after a dive you can hit

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.560 
so if you're after a dive you can hit
that<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.550> don't<00:00:53.730> want<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> take<00:00:54.090> your<00:00:54.210> suit<00:00:54.420> off

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570

that we don't want to take your suit off
you<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:54.899> expand<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.379> neck<00:00:55.559> out<00:00:55.800> gives<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
you can expand a neck out gives you a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.069 
you can expand a neck out gives you a
bit<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> actual<00:00:56.520> movement<00:00:56.789> around<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.600> bit<00:00:57.960> more

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
bit of actual movement around a bit more

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.700 
bit of actual movement around a bit more
freedom

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
freedom

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.760 
freedom
you<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:58.980> also<00:00:59.100> do<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.120> dive<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.570> well

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
you can also do that on the dive as well

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.049 
you can also do that on the dive as well
and<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> little<00:01:02.340> zip<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> little

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
and this is the little zip with a little

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.390 
and this is the little zip with a little
baffle<00:01:03.390> inside<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.989> decide<00:01:04.500> hasn't<00:01:04.769> flush<00:01:05.189> all

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
baffle inside I decide hasn't flush all

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.090 
baffle inside I decide hasn't flush all
the<00:01:05.430> way<00:01:05.670> in

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
the way in

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.980 
the way in
so<00:01:08.100> I've<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.670> down<00:01:08.850> halfway<00:01:09.659> between

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
so I've up and down halfway between

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.320 
so I've up and down halfway between
whatever<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> like
