 He also uses that barrel I 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.199
 I like that adidas I think too 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.610
 Cool story 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.159
 so the staff left a lot 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.900
 commented pretty kind of a peek 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:17.790
 there the name of the video calls tennis academy 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.939
 here in the next video playlist this 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.659
 video now I take my 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.280
 academy in this bag I did not put 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.320
 Nothing to do this video, I just 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.979
 Get out there and get the bag in the car. 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.909
 here to make a video for you then 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.950
 first thing you can see is a 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.729
 normal backpack that you find in 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.119
 anywhere 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.130
 the water is not at the door and such but I 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.750
 fill the trough there when I'm in there 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.420
 gym has two water bottles 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.460
 one of my bags in the lac or none 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.720
 I hang out with my suitcase at the gym. 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.850
 For example, let me make a 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.820
 ladder and leaves the side of the ladder 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.270
 if I'm going to do something good by my side 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.340
 because because this bag that has some 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.590
 accessories that I then use among 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.440
 accessories a few things that you 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.000
 also may perhaps have the pole up to 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.700
 then get started 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.090
 one of them is a glove you must have 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.060
 a glove in yours in your backpack 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.490
 Also in your suitcase you take a little light 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.050
 There, to the gym, I just came here. 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.560
 a dollar is not a glove for 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:35.450
 Special gyms via normal that you 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.970
 found in any store or even 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.120
 Hardware sport where the material 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.180
 construction anything you find 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.940
 dollar is excellent 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.110
 lightweight and it has a very 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.510
 great 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.550
 She is rubber so she has a 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.790
 very good grip then to lift 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.400
 weight was excellent so I use this 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:09.920
 luvinha I love it because it's very easy 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:13.730
 not use anything special with it has seen 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:19.700
 here on the channel is also slightly larger 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:22.519
 but also irregular that you use 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.799
 usually to the bar 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.769
 put around your wrist from this 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.620
 way and you use it for example the 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.570
 do an exercise maybe on your back 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.150
 some other type of exercise 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.209
 You use this type of contract so I 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:44.840
 I use this logic once I get loose in the 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:47.540
 11th day of that sometimes I use that type 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.480
 of exercise that we are going to do 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.810
 put it back here he'll come back 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.810
 to the car 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:04.840
 I have clothes and shoes I have here. 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:09.709
 a very good cool thing you get 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.260
 cool because the environment is now 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.120
 has a loud sound on staff like to 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.380
 make a loud sound 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.669
 not all songs so have a headset 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.560
 heard good 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:27.190
 It's important so I have a lot of time. 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.810
 I have a washcloth too. 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.880
 I mean I do not go there drying the 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.070
 but I have a towel if 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.020
 I'm sweating a lot and I have 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.540
 who will not put it to make a 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.620
 logical exercise and personal hygiene has 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.630
 a towel 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.090
 so nothing much i do not have in 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:52.510
 Truth here in mine in my purse 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:05:03.280
 so you leave but I like 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:05:07.420
 you can leave him in the 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.180
 machine and then make you a woman 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:20.770
 maybe you can put it in your 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:24.520
 leg and do an exercise machine 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.680
 logical that is there in goose may 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.100
 put on the ankle bracelet or even 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:34.680
 doing exercises very nice and I use 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.680
 he's been at least a week 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.680
 as I told you why not use 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:45.940
 no clothes I know the staff at 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.770
 sometimes cool bags or backpacks takes 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.970
 morning job puts in the car because 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.710
 do not have time sometimes to do gym 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.870
 and home to shower and go 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.390
 gym they then take the clothes already 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.820
 inside the backpack inside your 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.040
 suitcase of the day then tell me I want 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.700
 to know how it is that if you have a 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.650
 specific suitcase you take some 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.419
 thing for the gym you take arrives at 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.230
 take something to the gym you do not 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:16.090
 take nothing just maybe maybe 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.840
 Do you have a nice luvinha that you 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.640
 like or even other kinds of acts 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:27.160
 I do not know yet but you can 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:31.060
 have your comment there worth the 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:34.180
 more cool and carry a little bag of those 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.190
 animal given to the animal only at least 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.919
 or that it is because usually those 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.720
 cloth lation balls and a suitcase this 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.360
 How does she have it? 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.670
 feasible too then I think it's cool 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.000

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.470
