their<00:01:10.380> turbo<00:01:12.320> scratcher<00:01:14.300> but<00:01:15.300> we<00:01:15.390> just

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
their turbo scratcher but we just

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.560 
their turbo scratcher but we just
received<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.200> mail<00:01:16.289> so<00:01:16.680> were<00:01:17.160> I<00:01:17.670> just

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
received this in the mail so were I just

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.060 
received this in the mail so were I just
pulled<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.080> literally<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.649> the<00:01:19.740> box<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
pulled it literally out of the box and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.050 
pulled it literally out of the box and
put<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.399> the<00:01:20.490> floor<00:01:21.350> okay<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:23.100> comes<00:01:23.399> with<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
put it on the floor okay it comes with a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.040 
put it on the floor okay it comes with a
bag<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.750> catnip<00:01:25.470> which<00:01:25.680> I've<00:01:25.860> put<00:01:26.130> inside<00:01:27.050> and

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
bag of catnip which I've put inside and

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.779 
bag of catnip which I've put inside and
I<00:01:28.170> think<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.500> made<00:01:28.680> more<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.070> mess<00:01:29.100> than<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
I think I made more of a mess than I

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.450 
I think I made more of a mess than I
needed<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.619> actually<00:01:31.800> just<00:01:31.979> pour<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
needed to you can actually just pour the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.889 
needed to you can actually just pour the
catnip<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:32.910> here<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.479> will<00:01:33.630> fall

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
catnip in here and then it will fall

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.920 
catnip in here and then it will fall
into<00:01:34.259> these<00:01:34.560> little<00:01:35.030> slotted<00:01:36.030> areas<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
into these little slotted areas but I

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.050 
into these little slotted areas but I
took<00:01:37.920> off<00:01:38.390> this<00:01:39.410> middle<00:01:40.410> thing<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:41.009> don't<00:01:41.880> know

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
took off this middle thing I don't know

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.080 
took off this middle thing I don't know
if<00:01:42.149> I<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.539> with<00:01:42.690> one<00:01:42.869> hand<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.920> put<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.850> all

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
if I can do with one hand and put it all

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.810 
if I can do with one hand and put it all
about<00:01:45.300> so<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.200> obviously<00:01:46.350> got<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.250> over<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
about so it obviously got all over the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.580 
about so it obviously got all over the
place<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> nice<00:01:48.540> thing<00:01:48.570> about<00:01:48.810> catnip<00:01:49.409> is

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
place but the nice thing about catnip is

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.149 
place but the nice thing about catnip is
it's<00:01:49.830> easy<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.250> pick<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.869> with<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.900> vacuum<00:01:52.439> so

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it's easy to pick up with a vacuum so

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.130 
it's easy to pick up with a vacuum so
that's<00:01:53.400> why<00:01:53.549> trig<00:01:53.880> started<00:01:54.360> rolling<00:01:55.020> around

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
that's why trig started rolling around

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.310 
that's why trig started rolling around
with<00:01:55.680> from<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.270> catnip<00:01:57.720> he's<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.170> in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
with from the the catnip he's not in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.770 
with from the the catnip he's not in
love<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:59.930> here's<00:02:00.930> not<00:02:01.110> wanting<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.439> be

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
love with the here's not wanting to be

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.800 
love with the here's not wanting to be
lovey-dovey<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:05.329> catnip<00:02:06.329> cyclone<00:02:08.810> and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
lovey-dovey with the catnip cyclone and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.860 
lovey-dovey with the catnip cyclone and
this<00:02:09.989> actually<00:02:10.200> also<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.920> great<00:02:11.160> because<00:02:11.340> it

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
this actually also is great because it

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.840 
this actually also is great because it
removes<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.230> easy<00:02:13.380> cleaning<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.610> ball

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
removes for easy cleaning the ball

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.670 
removes for easy cleaning the ball
obviously<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:15.750> be<00:02:15.900> removed<00:02:16.230> for<00:02:16.470> easy

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
obviously can be removed for easy

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.030 
obviously can be removed for easy
cleaning<00:02:17.160> as<00:02:17.310> well<00:02:18.170> or<00:02:19.170> four<00:02:19.590> additional

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
cleaning as well or four additional

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.530 
cleaning as well or four additional
plate<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.549> I<00:02:20.579> mean<00:02:20.730> really<00:02:20.940> not<00:02:21.209> across<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
plate and I mean really not across the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.300 
plate and I mean really not across the
floor<00:02:21.900> would<00:02:22.049> to<00:02:22.170> make<00:02:22.350> him<00:02:22.560> interested<00:02:23.070> for

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
floor would to make him interested for

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.509 
floor would to make him interested for
sure<00:02:23.370> Oh<00:02:24.950> Angie<00:02:25.950> huh

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519

they'll<00:02:29.519> probably<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.239> lot<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.540> fun<00:02:30.810> just

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
they'll probably have a lot of fun just

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.530 
they'll probably have a lot of fun just
rolling<00:02:31.379> that<00:02:31.530> thing<00:02:31.769> around<00:02:33.709> Mexico<00:02:34.709> cheetah

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
scratcher so that you can see and this

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.009 
scratcher so that you can see and this
also<00:03:06.449> fits<00:03:06.719> on<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.019> Bergen<00:03:07.939> star<00:03:08.939> chaser<00:03:09.389> but

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
also fits on the Bergen star chaser but

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.899 
also fits on the Bergen star chaser but
I'll<00:03:10.620> put<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.859> on<00:03:10.889> the<00:03:11.069> turbo<00:03:11.250> scratcher<00:03:11.669> so
