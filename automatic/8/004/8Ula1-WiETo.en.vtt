display<00:01:22.920> setup<00:01:23.570> this<00:01:24.570> should<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.869> pretty

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
display setup this should be pretty

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.390 
display setup this should be pretty
familiar<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.830> basically<00:01:26.280> like

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
familiar this is basically like

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.640 
familiar this is basically like
connecting<00:01:27.270> another<00:01:27.659> monitor<00:01:28.020> directly<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
connecting another monitor directly to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.359 
connecting another monitor directly to
your<00:01:28.740> computer

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
your computer

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.219 
your computer
although<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.060> connection<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.659> through<00:01:30.930> Wi-Fi

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
although the connection is through Wi-Fi

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.770 
although the connection is through Wi-Fi
and<00:01:31.950> all<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.909> drag<00:01:33.210> Windows

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
and all you have to do is drag Windows

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.109 
and all you have to do is drag Windows
to<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.259> display<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.460> let's<00:01:35.670> go<00:01:35.790> ahead<00:01:35.880> and

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
to this display so let's go ahead and

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.980 
to this display so let's go ahead and
drag<00:01:36.329> my<00:01:36.570> email<00:01:37.049> right<00:01:37.470> here<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.790> slide<00:01:39.119> over

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.450 

because<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> iPad<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> touchscreen<00:01:44.310> this

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
because the iPad is a touchscreen this

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.149 
because the iPad is a touchscreen this
essentially<00:01:44.970> gives<00:01:45.000> me<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> touch<00:01:45.810> screen

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
essentially gives me a touch screen

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.319 
essentially gives me a touch screen
external<00:01:47.159> display<00:01:47.430> which<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.670> kind<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.149> neat

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
external display which is kind of neat

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.810 
external display which is kind of neat
but<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.320> limited<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:50.040> not<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.520> having

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
but it is limited it's not like having

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.359 
but it is limited it's not like having
the<00:01:51.299> touch<00:01:51.540> screen<00:01:51.899> functionality<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.979> your

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the touch screen functionality on your

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.510 
the touch screen functionality on your

iPad running its native apps all you can
do<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.759> basically<00:01:56.939> click<00:01:57.899> or<00:01:58.590> select<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.280> it's

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
do is basically click or select and it's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.819 
do is basically click or select and it's
a<00:01:59.460> little<00:01:59.640> clumsy<00:02:00.200> of<00:02:01.200> course<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.710> just

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
a little clumsy of course you can just

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.499 
a little clumsy of course you can just
use<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.219> mouse<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.000> would<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.299> an

while I'm doing something else that's

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.120 
while I'm doing something else that's
filling<00:02:31.150> up<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.330> screen<00:02:31.600> on<00:02:31.750> my<00:02:31.870> desktop<00:02:32.230> now

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
filling up the screen on my desktop now

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.950 
filling up the screen on my desktop now
because<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.520> iPad<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.090> using<00:02:34.420> Wi-Fi<00:02:34.690> to

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
because the iPad is using Wi-Fi to

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.250 
because the iPad is using Wi-Fi to
connect<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.130> iMac<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.390> means<00:02:37.960> there's<00:02:38.170> a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
connect to the iMac that means there's a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.890 
connect to the iMac that means there's a
lot<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.590> lags<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.370> can't<00:02:39.760> use<00:02:39.940> an<00:02:40.090> iPad<00:02:40.510> to

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
lot of lags so you can't use an iPad to

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.500 
lot of lags so you can't use an iPad to
play<00:02:41.410> back<00:02:41.650> video<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.580> let's<00:02:42.850> grab<00:02:43.120> something

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
play back video so let's grab something

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.930 
play back video so let's grab something
from<00:02:43.570> iTunes<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.290> show<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.740> what<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:44.920> mean<00:02:45.190> I'm

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
from iTunes and show you what I mean I'm

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.670

playing<00:02:46.090> Star<00:02:46.450> Trek<00:02:46.690> here<00:02:46.900> I'm<00:02:47.020> gonna<00:02:47.170> drag<00:02:47.530> it

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
playing Star Trek here I'm gonna drag it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.950 
playing Star Trek here I'm gonna drag it
over<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:51.580> iPad<00:02:52.030> now<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.540> can<00:02:52.660> see<00:02:52.840> it's

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
over to the iPad now you can see it's

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.910 
over to the iPad now you can see it's
pretty<00:02:53.080> herky-jerky

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
pretty herky-jerky

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.110 
pretty herky-jerky
and<00:02:54.100> that's<00:02:54.250> because<00:02:54.520> it's<00:02:54.670> running<00:02:54.970> like<00:02:55.090> a

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
and that's because it's running like a

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.350 
and that's because it's running like a
VNC<00:02:55.570> client<00:02:55.810> basically<00:02:56.710> capturing<00:02:57.280> images<00:02:57.700> of

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
VNC client basically capturing images of

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.530 
VNC client basically capturing images of
a<00:02:58.750> desktop<00:02:59.350> on<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.950> iMac<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.180> not<00:03:01.270> an

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
a desktop on the iMac so it's not an

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.990 
a desktop on the iMac so it's not an
adder<00:03:02.020> echt<00:03:02.230> feed<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.340> real<00:03:03.760> display

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
adder echt feed like a real display

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.600 
adder echt feed like a real display
would<00:03:04.330> be<00:03:04.480> it's<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:05.290> virtual<00:03:05.710> feed<00:03:05.950> through

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
would be it's a virtual feed through

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.780 
would be it's a virtual feed through
Wi-Fi<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.530> once<00:03:08.740> again<00:03:08.950> that's<00:03:09.070> detroit<00:03:09.520> borg
