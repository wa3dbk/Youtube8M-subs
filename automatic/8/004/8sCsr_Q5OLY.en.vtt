00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
all right let's have a quick look here

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.420 
all right let's have a quick look here
we<00:00:03.330> have<00:00:03.510> two<00:00:03.750> lokos<00:00:04.170> we<00:00:04.770> want<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.040> run<00:00:05.190> down

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
we have two lokos we want to run down

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.490 
we have two lokos we want to run down
the<00:00:05.549> same<00:00:05.790> stretch<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.120> track<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.779> end<00:00:07.379> up

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the same stretch of track and end up

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.950 
the same stretch of track and end up
into<00:00:07.799> several<00:00:08.069> destinations<00:00:08.570> so<00:00:09.570> obviously

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
into several destinations so obviously

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.080 
into several destinations so obviously
we<00:00:10.139> need<00:00:10.349> them<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.650> share<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.460> one<00:00:11.639> piece<00:00:11.940> of

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
we need them to share the one piece of

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.390 
we need them to share the one piece of
track<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:13.080> how<00:00:13.290> we<00:00:13.349> can<00:00:13.679> all<00:00:13.769> accomplish<00:00:14.190> this

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
track so how we can all accomplish this

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.230 
track so how we can all accomplish this
I<00:00:16.580> have<00:00:17.580> here

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
I have here

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.769 
I have here
some<00:00:20.240> to<00:00:20.510> aspect<00:00:21.050> auto<00:00:21.380> signals<00:00:22.090> to<00:00:23.090> their<00:00:23.330> on

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
some to aspect auto signals to their on

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.290 
some to aspect auto signals to their on
there<00:00:24.050> and<00:00:24.320> then<00:00:24.380> to<00:00:24.859> down<00:00:25.279> at<00:00:25.430> the<00:00:25.520> end<00:00:25.670> to

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
there and then to down at the end to

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.300 
there and then to down at the end to
release<00:00:26.599> this<00:00:27.079> single<00:00:27.529> stretch<00:00:27.770> of<00:00:27.919> track<00:00:28.099> in

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
release this single stretch of track in

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.819 
release this single stretch of track in
the<00:00:28.369> middle<00:00:28.810> remember<00:00:29.810> signals<00:00:30.169> block<00:00:30.470> track

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
the middle remember signals block track

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.710 
the middle remember signals block track
they<00:00:31.099> don't<00:00:31.279> allow<00:00:31.400> trains<00:00:32.000> to<00:00:32.150> run<00:00:32.239> on<00:00:32.540> it<00:00:32.689> and

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
they don't allow trains to run on it and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.479 
they don't allow trains to run on it and
then<00:00:33.710> I<00:00:33.980> have<00:00:34.280> these<00:00:34.520> two<00:00:34.850> which<00:00:35.600> are<00:00:35.870> to<00:00:36.680> t1

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
then I have these two which are to t1

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.660 
then I have these two which are to t1
esignal<00:00:38.470> meaning<00:00:39.470> there's<00:00:39.710> two<00:00:39.980> entrances<00:00:40.190> in

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
esignal meaning there's two entrances in

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.150 
esignal meaning there's two entrances in
one<00:00:40.850> exit

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
one exit

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.690 
one exit
and<00:00:43.490> those<00:00:43.790> are<00:00:43.910> going<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.210> control<00:00:44.540> that<00:00:44.660> form

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
and those are going to control that form

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and those are going to control that form
okay<00:00:46.700> let's<00:00:46.940> run<00:00:47.300> this<00:00:47.480> see<00:00:47.989> how<00:00:48.320> things<00:00:48.680> work

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
the chains are going to just bow through

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.440 
the chains are going to just bow through
these<00:00:52.309> first<00:00:52.550> set<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:52.940> lights<00:00:53.150> because

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
these first set of lights because

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.550 
these first set of lights because
