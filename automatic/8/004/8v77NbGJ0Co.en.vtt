00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.920
 Italian meringue 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.370
 ingredients 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.100
 implements to be used to reduce 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.500
 salmonella risk which is found 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.630
 in the shell and the yolk we will remove the 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.860
 direct eggs from the refrigerator and 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.230
 we will wash with cold water 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.910
 then we will remove them with a towel 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.460
 clean paper 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.010
 and so we will avoid its contamination in the 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.689
 moment to break the shell we separate 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.369
 the whites and we keep them in the 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.010
 refrigerator until the moment it is 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.440
 are going to use now we start the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.949
 preparation we get the whites from 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.260
 refrigerator we had all the board and 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.870
 we begin to beat until we reach 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.580
 volume this process can take 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.580
 about three minutes 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.230
 once the volume has been reached 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.740
 we stop beating to go prepare the 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.740
 syrup 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.190
 in a pot we deposit the sugar and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.200
 then we cover with the water 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.750
 we lower the sugar residue with 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.960
 spatula we choose the medium burner from 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.450
 the kitchen and we left a half flame 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.630
 this particular elaboration we will use 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.660
 Three alternatives blasting check 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.290
 one of them is chronometer the other 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.050
 thermometer and also a homemade method of 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.940
 water testing 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.610
 once the process of 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.140
 boiling the sugar will dissolve 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.140
 from the outside in 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.080
 will also appear large bubbles and 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.800
 after the time they will be decreasing 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.800
 its size 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.650
 to check with the home method 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.980
 deposit some syrup in a cup 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.920
 with water if to touch it with your fingers 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.920
 form a blast then it 's ready 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.580
 we set the syrup to low flame and 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.650
 we started to beat the meringue 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.930
 now we are incorporating the syrup 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.930
 slowly around the whites 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.189
 in relation to salmonella bacteria 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.250
 die at a minimum temperature of 71 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:19.709
 degrees these clear ones are being 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.329
 subjected to at least one temperature 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.329
 of 116 degrees 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.920
 The shake should be done until the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.920
 base of the bowl is completely cold 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.790
 We turn to check the firmness of the 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.790
 Meringue 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.519
 we empty the meringue and with the spatula 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.730
 we spread to form a surface 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.730
 smooth 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.599
 and now we will begin to decorate with 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.260
 spoon we will be forming small 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.260
 mounds 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.040
 the meringue is a dessert that is made 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.220
 with the egg whites milkshake more 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.260
 sugar there are three types and meringue 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.380
 French or basic that is the best known 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.350
 of all is done by beating the egg whites 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.910
 and sprinkling sugar on these 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.070
 you can also find the Swiss meringue 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.190
 is done by beating the whites with the 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.680
 sugar in a bain-marie container and 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.440
 finally the Italian meringue that 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.100
 uses syrup at blast point is 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.229
 say between 116 and 119 degrees of 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.050
 temperature is characterized 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.860
 mainly for being very firm and 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.860
 sparkly 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.450
 we do it with grid or with 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.050
 enveloping heat supervising so that 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.050
 Do not burn yourself 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.680
