00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello everyone today on my channel 

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.210
 video with two boxes at once 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.700
 boxes from here tolerance how are you 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.309
 see the old model but the knives are good 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.080
 probably not the most famous beat 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.570
 boxes provided by my new 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.520
 regular partner shopping phoenix 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.890
 who sells lanterns 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.859
 equipment knives which is located in 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.560
 the city where east is in the mall 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.920
 green bricks and it goes today 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.369
 about 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.070
 tadam is probably one of the most 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.840
 famous models of the company of the sanatorium 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:41.340
 respectively model 300 model 350 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:46.170
 let's see both knives we have siz there 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.480
 with the spoke system in general we have with 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.570
 you two such during tails 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.480
 more than 300 less than 350 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.609
 well, let's probably talk about first 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.510
 greater zink means designer of both 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.040
 knives is his kent arches 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.080
 our either 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.380
 we use ken onion in american style 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.479
 the materials here are just wonderful 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.150
 thirty in the performance of caches 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.250
 from zero tolerance are excellent yet 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.710
 make and cover gone and cover this 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.220
 sharing porridge on it is great to stay 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.229
 finger grease 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.360
 there, etc. etc. etc. that we read 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.759
 cut it needs to be washed with soap and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.450
 something tough to remove the marks but it 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.430
 if you are an idealist like me if not 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.970
 then figs with him and so can use 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.430
 really wear powerful saltpeter drink 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.700
 in my opinion only 301 zero 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.820
 tolerance was also not a review on the channel 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.000
 generally huge terribly heavy means 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.490
 what is he doing here and by the way 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.860
 we have matt now on new calls 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.920
 bodies goes glossy here matt 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.630
 warm window spider k means clip but 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.150
 here with you rearranged to 4 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.570
 position yourself old 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.990
 with g10 from this side we have titanium there 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.750
 alloy 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.040
 a washer is present but to 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.650
 sorry for that moment when 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.530
 the knife was made to make suharev was not 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.000
 fashionable therefore here on us with you 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.000
 prostatitis which rests on 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.560
 in the heel of the blade we have here 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.080
 so powerful and today at 10 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.330
 here unfortunately we do not see but there 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:40.170
 ordinary guy mate screw head 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.690
 by this principle a knife like i was looking for 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.140
 use the spokes system spokes iv this 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.090
 just assisted kershaw very much 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.780
 cool powerful sticks out here like this 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.020
 flipper 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.720
 and it opens just to 1 despite 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.260
 all the absurdities of the enormity of the knife can 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.910
 looks quite 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.400
 interesting here this reform and we 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.530
 deliver down some difficulty if you 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.690
 inexperienced and when sharpening there on the water 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.420
 or on apex but if you use 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.900
 angel then this is just generally a super thing 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.510
 very comfortable and very desirable and cool 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.590
 cut and the length of the cutting edge longer than I 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.140
 what is the length of the blade that I can say well 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.400
 I still have the last time from 301 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.100
 indelible impressions good knife 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.900
 powerful but this is a knife that is very 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.600
 little hard to believe that in principle can 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.769
 cut it rather so have tactics 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.860
 there hack a network or something else but 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.690
 look there is this knife and by the way 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.209
 let me tell you a little bit 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.670
 about his characteristics reading our cabbage 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.299
 mean the length of the knee Mazda themselves nine 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.900
 and a half centimeters the weight of the knife is just 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.060
 probably one of the most monstrous 227 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.390
 grams but for someone monstrous for 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.160
 someone not but for those for whom 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.400
 monstrous there is a smaller version of zero 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.580
 tolerance 350 differs on not only 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.810
 by size 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.360
 and but also let's say the locking system 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.739
 here we see liner lock 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.470
 through steel liners 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.810
 then here we are doing and coverage 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.600
 two-tone tiger stripe tiger 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.600
 strips by the way I really like how 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.700
 it looks like that 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.010
 A little thought about how to all 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.770
 upstairs you heard about my dependence blur 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.230
 passion kershaw blur and from thinking buy 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.240
 limit on the pussy rater with this 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.890
 coated unfortunately this is the only one 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.650
 blur model that has it 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.410
 tiger stripe cover but something that 's straight 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.910
 I want to think about it all over 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.670
 the rest is the same knife here 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.370
 the inclusion of more acceptable weight in 175 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.430
 gram blade length 8 3 centimeters 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.950
 use of g10 from two sides in 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.920
 the rest is the same system spokes 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:07.540
 same 4-way setting 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.940
 clips very cheerfully click because of 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.510
 blade easier than 3 weave knife 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.490
 fly out with even greater speed and 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:20.020
 accompanied by so very pleasant 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:23.260
 class means liners with internal 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.470
 the sides are pretty well made let's 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.750
 I will try to show 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.160
 see what's inside the Roskilde plan 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.680
 these rabbis and us present 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.680
 plastic backspacer 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.260
 thats but let's say a smaller knife look like 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.300
 a little awkward too wide i would 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.830
 mugler rather not even that 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.900
 Blur if I remember correctly that 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.380
 slightly longer cutting edge myself 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.830
 blade 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.410
 standing knife not bad let's say exist 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.740
 three models for different horn for small 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.640
 for small hands for medium and 301 for 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.490
 the biggest 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:02.080
 here it is 301 generally serious legs 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:04.720
 principle like they are 300 probably on this and 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.139
 all what two wonderful chic 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.990
 do and cover is probably the most 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.900
 to the forum because in fact 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:15.810
 emitter onions he stood on and but himself 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.999
 start zero tolerance hand show he is very 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.460
 did not cooperate much earlier now he 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:25.590
 cooperate more with bright tee 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.789
 kolyma river nays x and thus on this 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.319
 thank you all 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:30.740
 knives were provided by others there 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.740
