album since its it seems like there's a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.089 
album since its it seems like there's a
lot<00:00:23.010> more<00:00:23.189> electronic<00:00:23.730> stuff<00:00:23.910> going<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
not as many guitar based songs I mean

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.089 
not as many guitar based songs I mean
how<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.590> go<00:00:28.859> about<00:00:28.980> covering<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.439> know<00:00:31.439> like

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
how do you go about covering I know like

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.310 
how do you go about covering I know like
lotus<00:00:32.700> flowers<00:00:33.149> something<00:00:33.570> very<00:00:33.750> dance<00:00:34.110> you

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
lotus flowers something very dance you

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.479 
lotus flowers something very dance you
know<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.680> once<00:00:35.040> covered<00:00:35.460> lotus<00:00:35.910> flower<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.630> I

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
know I once covered lotus flower and I

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.420 
know I once covered lotus flower and I
think<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.760> best<00:00:38.969> way<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
think the best way to do it is just to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.420 
think the best way to do it is just to
sort<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.520> figure<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.420> chords<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
sort of figure out what chords it is

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.340 
sort of figure out what chords it is
quotes<00:00:44.430> are<00:00:44.579> using<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.660> try<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.870> simplify<00:00:46.200> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
quotes are using and I try to simplify a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.760 
quotes are using and I try to simplify a
final<00:00:46.710> guitar<00:00:46.950> chords<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.780> chord

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
final guitar chords so just chord

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.069 
final guitar chords so just chord
doesn't<00:00:50.730> how<00:00:50.820> about<00:00:51.000> how<00:00:51.149> about<00:00:51.180> how<00:00:52.050> about

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
doesn't how about how about how about

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.900 
doesn't how about how about how about
other<00:00:52.440> things<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.460> else<00:00:53.640> is

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
other things what what what else is

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.880 
other things what what what else is
really<00:00:54.300> important<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.110> song<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:55.680> just

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
really important in this song not just

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.340 
really important in this song not just
the<00:00:55.980> chords<00:00:56.280> right<00:00:56.399> there's<00:00:56.640> no<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:57.329> bean<00:01:03.350> so

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350

maybe<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.860> groove<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.489> could<00:01:05.670> talk<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> little

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
maybe the groove we could talk a little

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.609 
maybe the groove we could talk a little
about<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.330> chords<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> song<00:01:06.930> right<00:01:07.380> so

we've<00:01:07.799> got<00:01:08.040> my<00:01:08.970> basic<00:01:09.390> tutorial<00:01:09.840> which<00:01:09.990> showed

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
we've got my basic tutorial which showed

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.440 
we've got my basic tutorial which showed
you<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.680> what<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.010> played<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.580> my<00:01:12.030> channel

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
you know what we played on my channel

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.060 
you know what we played on my channel
sort<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.750> my<00:01:12.869> version<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.740> right

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.260 

so<00:01:20.070> that's<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.520> meant<00:01:20.700> by<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:20.820> fear<00:01:21.120> in

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
so that's what you meant by the fear in

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.430 
so that's what you meant by the fear in
the<00:01:21.390> other<00:01:21.690> right<00:01:21.870> and<00:01:22.130> obviously<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.490> melody

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
the other right and obviously the melody

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.720 
the other right and obviously the melody
but<00:01:25.440> that's<00:01:25.590> how<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.800> doing<00:01:26.160> a<00:01:26.220> lot<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.490> other

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
but that's how you doing a lot of other

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.690 
but that's how you doing a lot of other
crazy<00:01:27.150> weird<00:01:27.600> stuff<00:01:28.020> right<00:01:28.350> yeah<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.430> is

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
crazy weird stuff right yeah this is

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.500 
crazy weird stuff right yeah this is
that<00:01:29.760> is<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.330> just<00:01:30.660> magical<00:01:32.210> isn't<00:01:33.210> touch

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
that is that just magical isn't touch

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.280 
that is that just magical isn't touch
it's<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.990> touch<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.380> magic<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.040> also<00:01:35.190> a

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
it's a touch of magic but it's also a

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.170 
it's a touch of magic but it's also a
foundation<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.440> theory<00:01:37.740> no<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.910> trying<00:01:39.090> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
foundation in theory no just trying to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.470 
foundation in theory no just trying to
figure<00:01:39.450> out<00:01:39.510> like<00:01:39.660> what<00:01:40.820> like<00:01:41.820> from<00:01:42.120> for<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
figure out like what like from for the

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.410 
figure out like what like from for the
base<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.660> music<00:01:43.200> theory<00:01:43.820> probably<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
base of music theory probably for the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.360 
base of music theory probably for the
basic<00:01:45.750> chord<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.110> what<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.620> like<00:01:47.250> kind

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
basic chord like what you can like kind

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.270 
basic chord like what you can like kind
of<00:01:47.460> stack<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.880> top<00:01:47.910> of<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.360> whoa<00:01:48.720> whoa<00:01:49.280> there's

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
of stack on top of it whoa whoa there's

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.010 
of stack on top of it whoa whoa there's
a<00:01:50.340> basic<00:01:50.790> chord<00:01:51.060> oh<00:01:51.330> yes

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
a basic chord oh yes

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.770 
a basic chord oh yes
and<00:01:52.110> there's<00:01:53.000> stuff<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.150> can<00:01:54.300> stack<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.720> top

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
and there's stuff you can stack on top

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.840 
and there's stuff you can stack on top
of<00:01:55.050> it<00:01:55.320> nothing<00:01:55.619> elaborate<00:01:56.550> a<00:01:56.610> little<00:01:56.670> bit

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
of it nothing elaborate a little bit

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.359 
of it nothing elaborate a little bit
more<00:01:56.970> um<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.290> instance<00:01:58.590> you're<00:01:59.100> doing

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
more um like for instance you're doing

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:23.080 
more um like for instance you're doing
this

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.350 

so<00:02:23.959> these<00:02:24.110> are<00:02:24.290> essentially<00:02:24.709> up<00:02:25.040> for

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
so these are essentially up for

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.020 
so these are essentially up for
extensions<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:27.680> basic<00:02:28.099> cord<00:02:28.370> right<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:28.880> now

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
extensions of a basic cord right so now

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.520 
extensions of a basic cord right so now
those<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.480> who<00:02:29.660> know<00:02:29.840> about<00:02:29.959> some<00:02:30.290> jazz

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
those of you who know about some jazz

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.080 
those of you who know about some jazz
theory<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.069> I<00:02:31.099> believe<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.550> studied<00:02:31.880> some

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
theory and I believe you studied some

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.449 
theory and I believe you studied some
jazz<00:02:32.330> what<00:02:32.599> you're<00:02:32.780> doing<00:02:32.989> under<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.010> school

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
jazz what you're doing under the school

complexity of an arrangement tabs
efficacy<00:03:17.690> sort<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.560> just<00:03:18.799> goes<00:03:19.040> like<00:03:19.310> this

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
efficacy sort of just goes like this

efficacy sort of just goes like this
there's<00:03:21.110> like<00:03:21.290> no<00:03:21.470> point<00:03:21.500> in<00:03:21.920> tabbing<00:03:22.340> out

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
there's like no point in tabbing out

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:23.920 
there's like no point in tabbing out
what<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:22.819> did<00:03:22.970> because<00:03:23.299> there's<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:23.810> much
