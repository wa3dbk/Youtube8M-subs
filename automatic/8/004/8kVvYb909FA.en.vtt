 though provisionally the commandment was 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.200
 had to subordinate everything 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.360
 but today the future demands different standards 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.860
 shorter working hours during leisure time

 Green areas children's playgrounds and seating areas are embedded 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.190
 are created in the Tossehof area 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.560

 completed this year 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.900
 it may stand 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.500
 It and both architects the right track direct the one 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.459
 Grazing the spot 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.789
 the water on in large trains, this construction project was continued in 1972 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:26.359
 an outstanding urban design dominant is finished here in the shell

 Asked 17 floor-ceiling bags housing complex dar 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.409
 satellite cities are emerging on the outskirts of the city 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.739
 which will house tens of thousands of people 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.010
 It often turns out that these settlements want from the citizens 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.369
 living in it should not be accepted 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:50.369
 they were so much on the drawing board 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:53.769
 Today, some confess with sadness 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.539
 in the reconstruction of our destroyed cities after 1945 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.149
 a lot was missed 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.529
 It would be much different if you develop early 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:10.359
 The architects would have taken the shackles of too tight planning 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.099
 another long-term project the housing estate Tossehof 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:19.159
 Condition for this new living environment that not only the comfort between the 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.399
 be four walls 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:25.009
 easy accessibility of shops well developed and long distance traffic

 Road playgrounds for children and other communication options 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:34.340
 must be taken into account in planning and execution 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:39.909
 This is especially evident in the burned satellites 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:44.499
 where every movement is adults 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:48.179
 and everyone playfully Euro 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.479
 in the outdoor pools not even not in it 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.119
 as standardized movement song cents a year on the drawing board 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.369
 the value is lost

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.089
 this horizon arm 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.260
 in densely populated urban centers is particularly important 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.100
 that the value of free time is recognized because there is a danger of loneliness 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.969
 Boredom that says they and and lead crime 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:22.150
 A glance at an exhibition clarifies what has just been said 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.180
 by Profi Topol has become the city of people under this leitmotif 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.000

 Music theater was opened to guests churches 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.150
 the concluding words of ernst-otto Glasmeier confirm that shown 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.569
 Similarly, according to the report, people only shape each one 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.699
 we have to go the ways in the city of Marl
