00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Today we have the first and only 

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.400
 Smartphone from amazon nokia attempts on 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.429
 android world electric harley 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.559
 davidson and not a word about google conference 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.929
 Il and other android updates because 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.940
 we are going to the event itself and waiting for you 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.439
 a bunch of exclusive on our channel but for now 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.410
 go and trouble the inhabitants of Internet networks 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.180
 This is the most interesting show driver in the world. 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.269
 Gadget to the Internet and technology for weeks 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.269
 him 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:33.210
 electric today we have about once 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.219
 in half a year overseas company amazon 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.660
 shows something new about the smartphone 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.309
 from the largest american internet 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.410
 the flea market was probably already spoken for a year 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.600
 back and finally he submitted 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.160
 Meet fire background true 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.090
 characteristics of the device do not say that 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.180
 straight fire 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.579
 4-inch display with 720p resolution 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.219
 quad-core snapdragon 800 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.800
 two cameras for 13 and 2 megapixels 2 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.270
 gigabytes of RAM and 32 or 64 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.460
 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.739
 and there are curious corners 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.910
 black dots are cameras that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.680
 track the position of the head 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.479
 user as a result in a number 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.880
 application picture adapts to 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.189
 view of the user in such a way that is created 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.140
 3d effect as infrared 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.820
 backlight this chip should even work 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.250
 in the dark but it's anyway cooler 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.080
 than the dull display with the so-called 3d 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.570
 without glasses but how much is this chip in 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.490
 the principle justified the question more than 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.979
 open still in the phone there is a built in 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.689
 shazam movie music magazines and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.090
 a common product function is called 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.220
 firefly and even made a separate one for her 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.869
 button in general words to the public 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.729
 consumption and by the way the smartphone works 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.880
 unrecognizable android 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.710
 under the name of the file with 3.5 naturally with 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.210
 corporate app store and other 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.009
 content one side up in this 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.020
 device there are unusual ideas on the other 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.729
 the parties look very ridiculous and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.240
 will be in demand mainly in America 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.650
 but what are the guys smeared 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.960
 cleaned so it is how to sell 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.020
 Things are therefore very possible for a gadget 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.640
 even good prospects in the meantime 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.810
 nokia continues to terrorize android 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.490
 public their unexpected 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.899
 announcements the other day began 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.090
 beta testing corporate android 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.920
 shell called z launcher 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.319
 the main trick sorting is that 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.580
 application list is dynamic 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.290
 that is, the location of the icons 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.390
 varies with time of day 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.640
 and what services do you use 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.440
 more often let's say right idea dubious it 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.239
 hardly a smartphone will be able to accurately guess 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.890
 when do i need a taxi and when 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.959
 want to run another photo 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.000
 Instagram masterpiece 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.410
 systems are also drawn on and external 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.900
 launcher looks pretty nice 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.819
 Separately, it is worth noting that z launcher 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.959
 has nothing to do with the shell 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.269
 mounted on the ground 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.739
 nokia x android smartphone manufacturer 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.090
 most likely it is an attempt to plant 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.610
 some part of the users on 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.470
 branded service like nokia cards or 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.850
 music but do it without letting 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.180
 sane flagship smartphone on 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.470
 android is very difficult to remember how much 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.360
 rumors went about the fact that samsung 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.610
 going to make an advanced version 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.090
 your flagship smartphone and what they say 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.799
 call it galaxy s5 prime so that's it 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.049
 these rumors were true only 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.730
 except that the device is called galaxy 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.400
 s5 l ie and 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.049
 and generally it is not positioned as something 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.940
 important and great but more like 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.049
 handouts i zamorochen them a geek but what 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.090
 the truth is that the device is really 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.590
 pumped nehilo firstly in it 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.500
 the freshest chip from qualcomm is installed 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.910
 snapdragon 805 4 2 its nucleus 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.680
 gigahertz which supports 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.790
 lt technology and barely that is 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.069
 theoretical mobile speed 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.750
 Internet exceeds 200 megabits per 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.640
 second true it's probably only 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.440
 clean field in the meter from the antenna will work 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.000
 Also pleased with the improved display all those 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.750
 same 5 1 inch but with a resolution of 2560 on 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.970
 1440 pixels 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.440
 Yes, and made by technology super 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.000
 amoled and of course 3 gigabytes 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.889
 RAM where without it that is 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.269
 message about something like that needs to be seriously 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.310
 thought that we could not shove the whole 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.470
 fancy technical stuffing in the carcass 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.959
 modern flagships please 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.989
 keep the tour because this is not the main thing 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.090
 which is likely the samsung developers like 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.370
 In the case of galaxy s5, they consider that the main thing 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.139
 this is a fingerprint sensor and pulse world 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.000
 and both of these achievements are the Korean gadget 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:00.670
 Promo here and there are cameras 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.650
 with megapixels and a 2800 battery 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.060
 Milliamper clock is a clear thing first gadget 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.440
 will be on sale in South Korea 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.720
 is it worth waiting for him in europe 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.530
 it is not clear yet but in any case the device 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.070
 very good 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.570
 and so rushed from whom I did not expect so 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.070
 from these guys harley davidson 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.570
 cult growler manufacturer 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.730
 cartoons decided to try instead 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.500
 gasoline electricity american 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.780
 the company did not reveal the cards for a long time 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.280
 your secret life project 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.950
 but now this video has appeared and 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.380
 some characteristics 1 electro harley 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.750
 the engine will have 74 horsepower 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.580
 and overclocking to a hundred will be less than four 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.919
 seconds maximum speed yet 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.390
 limited at around 150 kilometers in 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.520
 hour but it is possible that after 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.960
 test restrictions with him separately 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.240
 work was done on the sound of the engine 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.160
 instead of a low growl now sort of 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.090
 man-made roar like a jet 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.919
 engine 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.870
 In addition, there will be a touch on the steering wheel 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.730
 the display is visible for monitoring all 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.280
 systems including battery charge 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.810
 which is enough for 85 kilometers of the background 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.390
 iron horse will be charged from 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.919
 a normal 220 volt outlet for three 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.600
 and a half hours, of course, that all 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.490
 car and motorcycle manufacturers 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.770
 try to switch to electricity and 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.050
 try yourself on the not yet plowed market 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.930
 electric vehicles and this is really cool i 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.460
 would such a ride 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.360
 Only here are serious guys at the box office as 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.009
 may not appreciate innovation 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.229
 and with our gadget probably dreams 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.659
 every video blogger is a flying robot 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.819
 who himself can shoot video and 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:26.039
 he is called hex plus he can fly 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:27.990
 for the owner as a devoted dog and 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.300
 shoot it on camera controlling the focus 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.490
 and making beautiful passages helicopter 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.979
 reaches speeds of up to 70 kilometers 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.990
 hour and can shoot at a distance of up to 50 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.550
 meters to an object other than this hack plus 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.409
 no problem independently commits 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.000
 takeoff and landing behavior parameters 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.590
 flight can be changed using applications 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.900
 for the smartphone for the very same shooting 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.370
 used popular cameras guopro on 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.319
 the board provides for her special 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.430
 mount so if you can do 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:55.319
 something like that haks plus can you 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.150
 cool withdrawing make youtube hero 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.740
 only still helicopter operators have 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.270
 one significant minus time 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.759
 autonomous flight from a single charge 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.650
 is only 15 minutes so all 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.449
 tricks to do as quickly as possible 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.430
 from the first time and then torment 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.840
 the battery to charge the startup has already collected on 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.669
 kickstarter nearly a million dollars and 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.889
 I hope the guys have enough money start 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:17.150
 production price for 1 helicopter will be 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.150
 start at 500 dollars 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.480
 some kind of drone and moonlighting 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.400
 operators and others are about to become 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.230
 by couriers to deliver drugs to residents 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.720
 san francisco startup funny name 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.490
 q &amp; q and plans to launch the end of July 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.380
 high-speed drug delivery in the center 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.120
 most European American city 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.770
 It is assumed that smart drones will be 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.330
 serve the public good and deliver 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.340
 necessary medicines by air in 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.380
 for 8-12 minutes after placement 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.910
 the order itself the order will be carried out 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.370
 with applications for smartphone 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.260
 project founder Josh Tsyren claims 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.030
 that already 600 people have registered 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.590
 this program so it looks like this 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.630
 the servant will be popular in 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.010
 san francisco by the way we are collecting just 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.870
 go there floor 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.430
 but it 's not all for last 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.980
 something our Russian 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.900
 and we will talk about real combat robots 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.730
 on the past exercises of the Baltic fleet 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.420
 two were demonstrated at once 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.980
 new items 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.510
 and the first one is intelligence 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.830
 unmanned aerial vehicles under 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.300
 codename pear 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.280
 I really don't know who came to mind 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.670
 such name why for example not an apple 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.080
 or the potato is not a pear shorter 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.000
 saying these pears flying in the air 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.710
 helped to evaluate goals and adjust 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.990
 fire from the guns of other robots 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.090

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.590
 our military did the training themselves 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.330
 successfully all goals are cleared of this to me 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.800
 american robot ass or cheetah 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.680

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.020
