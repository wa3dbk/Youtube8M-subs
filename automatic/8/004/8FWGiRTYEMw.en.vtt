hey<00:00:03.040> everybody<00:00:03.460> its<00:00:03.639> Travis<00:00:03.969> speaking<00:00:04.330> last

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:04.990 
hey everybody its Travis speaking last

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.869 
hey everybody its Travis speaking last
time<00:00:05.200> we<00:00:05.350> took<00:00:05.500> a<00:00:05.560> look<00:00:05.740> at<00:00:05.950> creating<00:00:06.370> objects

00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:06.879 
time we took a look at creating objects

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.209 
time we took a look at creating objects
in<00:00:07.029> geometry<00:00:07.330> in<00:00:07.690> 3ds<00:00:08.020> max<00:00:08.440> today<00:00:08.710> I'd<00:00:08.920> like<00:00:08.950> to

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:09.219 
in geometry in 3ds max today I'd like to

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.009 
in geometry in 3ds max today I'd like to
talk<00:00:09.370> a<00:00:09.430> little<00:00:09.670> bit<00:00:09.880> about<00:00:10.019> transforming

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:11.019 
talk a little bit about transforming

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.310 
talk a little bit about transforming
those<00:00:11.170> objects<00:00:11.710> so<00:00:12.550> by<00:00:12.940> transforming<00:00:13.690> I<00:00:14.110> mean

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
those objects so by transforming I mean

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.980 
those objects so by transforming I mean
moving<00:00:14.710> those<00:00:15.009> objects<00:00:15.549> and<00:00:15.750> rotating<00:00:16.750> and

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
moving those objects and rotating and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.499 
moving those objects and rotating and
perhaps<00:00:17.500> applying<00:00:18.070> scales<00:00:18.579> to<00:00:18.910> them<00:00:19.090> as<00:00:19.210> well

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509 
perhaps applying scales to them as well

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.530 
perhaps applying scales to them as well
you'll<00:00:20.380> find<00:00:20.680> here<00:00:20.890> transform<00:00:21.489> tools<00:00:21.759> up<00:00:22.029> here

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
you'll find here transform tools up here

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.499 
you'll find here transform tools up here
next<00:00:22.810> to<00:00:23.110> the<00:00:23.410> selection<00:00:23.939> selection<00:00:24.939> tools<00:00:25.180> so

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
next to the selection selection tools so

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.600 
next to the selection selection tools so
again<00:00:26.050> you<00:00:26.140> got<00:00:26.259> move<00:00:26.680> rotate<00:00:27.669> and<00:00:28.239> scale<00:00:29.610> so

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
again you got move rotate and scale so

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.639 
again you got move rotate and scale so
just<00:00:31.149> to<00:00:31.239> show<00:00:31.419> you<00:00:31.480> a<00:00:31.599> little<00:00:31.840> bit<00:00:31.960> every

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
just to show you a little bit every

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.730 
just to show you a little bit every
command<00:00:33.040> has<00:00:33.250> its<00:00:33.460> own<00:00:33.670> unique<00:00:34.150> UCS<00:00:34.900> icon<00:00:35.140> so

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:35.740 
command has its own unique UCS icon so

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.800 
command has its own unique UCS icon so
as<00:00:35.830> you<00:00:35.920> can<00:00:36.040> see<00:00:36.430> I<00:00:36.460> hover<00:00:37.330> over<00:00:37.720> these

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
as you can see I hover over these

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.490 
as you can see I hover over these
different<00:00:38.080> axis<00:00:38.740> they<00:00:38.920> turn<00:00:39.190> yellow<00:00:39.490> and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
different axis they turn yellow and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.170 
different axis they turn yellow and
that'll<00:00:41.500> allow<00:00:41.710> you<00:00:41.890> to<00:00:42.070> move<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.340> object<00:00:43.000> in

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
that'll allow you to move the object in

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.160 
that'll allow you to move the object in
that<00:00:43.540> specific<00:00:44.670> dimension<00:00:45.670> so<00:00:46.570> one<00:00:46.990> of<00:00:47.020> the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
that specific dimension so one of the

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.780 
that specific dimension so one of the
things<00:00:47.410> that<00:00:47.590> you<00:00:47.650> can<00:00:47.829> also<00:00:48.100> do<00:00:48.520> is

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
things that you can also do is

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.590 
things that you can also do is
right-click<00:00:49.390> on<00:00:50.050> that<00:00:50.110> tool<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.490> it'll<00:00:52.360> allow

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
right-click on that tool and it'll allow

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.979 
right-click on that tool and it'll allow
you<00:00:52.660> to<00:00:52.870> give<00:00:53.590> precise<00:00:54.270> input<00:00:55.270> as<00:00:55.450> well<00:00:55.720> so<00:00:55.960> I

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
you to give precise input as well so I

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.220 
you to give precise input as well so I
could<00:00:56.230> make<00:00:56.380> this<00:00:56.560> 18<00:00:56.890> I<00:00:57.730> could<00:00:58.420> change<00:00:58.690> that<00:00:58.930> Y

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
could make this 18 I could change that Y

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.979 
could make this 18 I could change that Y
to<00:01:00.030> 30<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.680> change<00:01:02.680> not<00:01:02.920> zero<00:01:03.310> that<00:01:04.030> z<00:01:04.390> axis<00:01:04.960> to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
to 30 and change not zero that z axis to

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.130 
to 30 and change not zero that z axis to
zero<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.860> as<00:01:06.610> you<00:01:06.790> see<00:01:07.090> over<00:01:07.120> here<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.690> updates

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
zero and as you see over here it updates

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.740 
zero and as you see over here it updates
automatically<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.190> brings<00:01:10.120> out<00:01:10.270> right<00:01:10.510> back

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
automatically and brings out right back

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.140 
automatically and brings out right back
to<00:01:10.900> that<00:01:11.050> ground<00:01:11.320> plane<00:01:11.650> now<00:01:12.370> if<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:12.670> wanted<00:01:13.000> to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
to that ground plane now if I wanted to

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.480 
to that ground plane now if I wanted to
bring<00:01:13.390> this<00:01:13.630> cylinder<00:01:14.380> or<00:01:14.740> sorry<00:01:14.979> this<00:01:15.159> cone

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
bring this cylinder or sorry this cone

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.660 
bring this cylinder or sorry this cone
right<00:01:16.479> over<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:17.020> our<00:01:17.380> zero<00:01:17.950> coordinate<00:01:18.490> I

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
right over to our zero coordinate I

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.140 
right over to our zero coordinate I
could<00:01:18.909> easily<00:01:19.450> just<00:01:19.780> punch<00:01:20.229> that<00:01:20.440> in<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:21.729> I'm

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
could easily just punch that in but I'm

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.670 
could easily just punch that in but I'm
going<00:01:22.299> to<00:01:22.360> show<00:01:22.510> you<00:01:22.540> another<00:01:22.870> place<00:01:23.229> you<00:01:23.530> can

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
going to show you another place you can

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.430 
going to show you another place you can
do<00:01:23.830> that<00:01:23.979> as<00:01:24.130> well<00:01:24.370> in<00:01:24.670> here<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:25.720> want<00:01:26.320> that

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
do that as well in here so I want that

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.310 
do that as well in here so I want that
to<00:01:26.500> be<00:01:26.650> on<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.250> 0<00:01:27.580> and<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.820> X<00:01:28.290> 0<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.620> Y<00:01:29.799> and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
to be on the 0 and the X 0 and the Y and

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.010 
to be on the 0 and the X 0 and the Y and
notice<00:01:32.320> now<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:32.920> it's<00:01:33.040> right<00:01:33.400> on<00:01:33.700> our<00:01:33.880> our<00:01:34.690> 0

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
notice now that it's right on our our 0

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.010 
notice now that it's right on our our 0
origin<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.880> another<00:01:37.090> thing<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.390> you<00:01:37.540> can<00:01:37.780> do

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
origin so another thing that you can do

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.550 
origin so another thing that you can do
is<00:01:38.549> apply<00:01:39.549> rotations<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.510> these<00:01:40.659> objects<00:01:41.140> so

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
is apply rotations to these objects so

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.380 
is apply rotations to these objects so
I'm<00:01:41.740> just<00:01:41.920> gonna<00:01:42.010> go<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.490> single<00:01:42.909> viewport

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
I'm just gonna go to a single viewport

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.350 
I'm just gonna go to a single viewport
and<00:01:43.600> change<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> perspective<00:01:45.310> so<00:01:46.210> we

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
and change this to a perspective so we

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.260 
and change this to a perspective so we
can<00:01:46.540> move<00:01:46.750> this<00:01:46.930> around<00:01:47.110> freely<00:01:48.000> I'll<00:01:49.000> just

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
can move this around freely I'll just

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.170 
can move this around freely I'll just
zoom<00:01:49.540> out<00:01:49.810> get<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.799> little<00:01:51.070> bit<00:01:51.189> better<00:01:51.430> better

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
zoom out get a little bit better better

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.380 
zoom out get a little bit better better
look<00:01:52.450> here<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.680> if<00:01:53.770> I<00:01:53.860> want<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.159> rotate<00:01:54.850> this

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
look here so if I want to rotate this

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.039 
look here so if I want to rotate this
cylinder<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:57.549> can<00:01:57.670> see<00:01:57.880> when<00:01:58.030> I<00:01:58.060> select<00:01:58.600> it<00:01:58.750> in

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
cylinder you can see when I select it in

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.499 
cylinder you can see when I select it in
the<00:01:59.439> command<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.369> automatically<00:02:00.939> selects<00:02:01.360> the

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
the command it automatically selects the

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.719 
the command it automatically selects the
cylinder<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.049> applies<00:02:02.439> that<00:02:02.680> different<00:02:03.130> UCS

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
cylinder and applies that different UCS

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.679 
cylinder and applies that different UCS
now<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.170> bottom<00:02:05.580> so<00:02:06.580> again<00:02:07.180> I<00:02:07.210> can<00:02:07.479> choose

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
now to the bottom so again I can choose

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.880 
now to the bottom so again I can choose
one<00:02:08.019> axis<00:02:09.179> or<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:11.200> can

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
one axis or I can

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.190 
one axis or I can
choose<00:02:13.340> these<00:02:13.670> options<00:02:13.730> down<00:02:14.569> here<00:02:14.630> and

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
the Y and 0 for the Z see what that does

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.670 
the Y and 0 for the Z see what that does
for<00:02:25.580> us<00:02:25.850> now<00:02:26.170> again<00:02:27.170> we'd<00:02:27.380> be<00:02:27.530> looking

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
for us now again we'd be looking

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.199 
for us now again we'd be looking
straight<00:02:28.550> on<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:30.160> it's<00:02:31.160> only<00:02:31.370> rotated<00:02:32.060> in

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
straight on and it's only rotated in

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.020 
straight on and it's only rotated in
that<00:02:32.390> one<00:02:32.630> axis<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:34.520> other<00:02:34.670> thing<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:34.880> I

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
that one axis the other thing that I

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.699 
that one axis the other thing that I
might<00:02:35.209> want<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.510> do<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.810> change<00:02:36.170> where<00:02:36.560> this

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
might want to do is change where this

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.060 
might want to do is change where this
pivot<00:02:37.130> location<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.900> just<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.680> give<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:39.950> an

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
pivot location is so just to give you an

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.590 
pivot location is so just to give you an
idea<00:02:40.190> I'm<00:02:40.430> going<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.610> bring<00:02:40.760> this<00:02:40.940> back<00:02:41.000> to

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
idea I'm going to bring this back to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.590 
idea I'm going to bring this back to
zero<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.610> I'm<00:02:43.610> gonna<00:02:43.730> come<00:02:44.000> up<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.150> the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
zero and I'm gonna come up to the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.160 
zero and I'm gonna come up to the
hierarchies<00:02:45.290> tab<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:46.510> what<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.600> can<00:02:47.780> do<00:02:47.989> is

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
hierarchies tab and what you can do is

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.670 
hierarchies tab and what you can do is
affect<00:02:48.860> your<00:02:49.070> pivot<00:02:49.570> so<00:02:50.570> by<00:02:51.019> selecting<00:02:51.560> this

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
affect your pivot so by selecting this

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.780 
affect your pivot so by selecting this
option<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.489> changes<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.600> pivot<00:02:54.019> and<00:02:54.790> isolates

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
option it changes the pivot and isolates

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.090 
option it changes the pivot and isolates
where<00:02:56.750> you're<00:02:56.989> going<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.380> be<00:02:57.530> doing<00:02:57.739> your

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
where you're going to be doing your

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.670 
where you're going to be doing your
rotation<00:02:58.760> so<00:02:59.600> I'll<00:02:59.750> just<00:02:59.989> select<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.410> move

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
rotation so I'll just select the move

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.670 
rotation so I'll just select the move
tool<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.880> just<00:03:02.090> want<00:03:02.269> to<00:03:02.330> move<00:03:02.570> this<00:03:02.959> up<00:03:03.230> to

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
tool and I just want to move this up to

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.370 
tool and I just want to move this up to
the<00:03:03.920> center<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.269> get<00:03:05.480> an<00:03:05.600> idea<00:03:05.690> as<00:03:06.050> to<00:03:06.140> where

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
the center so to get an idea as to where

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.930 
the center so to get an idea as to where
the<00:03:06.500> center<00:03:06.830> is<00:03:07.010> I'm<00:03:07.160> going<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.370> change<00:03:07.820> my

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
the center is I'm going to change my

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.620 
the center is I'm going to change my
projection<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.019> orthographic<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.610> now<00:03:11.600> I

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
projection to orthographic and now I

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.410 
projection to orthographic and now I
have<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:12.170> perfect<00:03:12.620> elevation<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.580> this

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
have a perfect elevation of this

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.140 
have a perfect elevation of this
cylinder<00:03:15.290> here<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.680> I'm<00:03:16.489> just<00:03:16.519> gonna<00:03:16.820> move

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
cylinder here and I'm just gonna move

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.610 
cylinder here and I'm just gonna move
that<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.220> center<00:03:19.610> right<00:03:19.790> there<00:03:20.290> now<00:03:21.290> I<00:03:21.320> can

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
that to the center right there now I can

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.090 
that to the center right there now I can
uncheck<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.489> pivot<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.440> could<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:25.040> course

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
uncheck the pivot and I could of course

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.819 
uncheck the pivot and I could of course
bring<00:03:25.610> my<00:03:26.079> projection<00:03:27.079> back<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.410> perspective

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
bring my projection back to perspective

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.030 
bring my projection back to perspective
and<00:03:28.790> now<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.180> can<00:03:29.480> apply<00:03:29.690> that<00:03:29.810> same<00:03:30.040> rotation

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
and now I can apply that same rotation

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.150 
and now I can apply that same rotation
and<00:03:31.310> I<00:03:32.000> know<00:03:32.090> that<00:03:32.450> I'm<00:03:32.660> rotating<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:33.709> right

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
and I know that I'm rotating it right

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.910 
and I know that I'm rotating it right
along<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.579> center<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:36.820> at<00:03:37.820> any<00:03:37.970> time<00:03:38.239> you<00:03:38.480> can

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
along the center and at any time you can

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.110 
along the center and at any time you can
reset<00:03:39.920> your<00:03:40.010> pivot<00:03:40.370> back<00:03:40.549> to<00:03:40.760> where<00:03:40.910> it<00:03:41.000> was

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
reset your pivot back to where it was

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.000 
reset your pivot back to where it was
originally<00:03:41.540> just<00:03:41.660> by<00:03:41.989> hitting<00:03:42.230> this<00:03:42.470> reset

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
originally just by hitting this reset

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.250 
originally just by hitting this reset
button<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:45.620> last<00:03:46.070> but<00:03:46.190> not<00:03:46.430> least<00:03:46.989> we'll<00:03:47.989> come

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
button so last but not least we'll come

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.000 
button so last but not least we'll come
in<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:49.060> do<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.090> little<00:03:50.299> bit<00:03:50.480> of<00:03:50.540> scaling<00:03:51.200> so

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
in and do a little bit of scaling so

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.420 
in and do a little bit of scaling so
I'll<00:03:52.100> select<00:03:52.250> this<00:03:52.549> box<00:03:52.820> back<00:03:53.120> here<00:03:53.540> and

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
I'll select this box back here and

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.789 
I'll select this box back here and
choose<00:03:55.430> my<00:03:55.610> scale<00:03:55.970> command<00:03:56.480> now<00:03:57.140> you'll

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
choose my scale command now you'll

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.979 
choose my scale command now you'll
notice<00:03:58.040> that<00:03:58.220> there's<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.760> little<00:03:59.000> tiny<00:03:59.540> drop

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
notice that there's a little tiny drop

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.430 
notice that there's a little tiny drop
down<00:04:00.260> here<00:04:00.290> as<00:04:00.739> well<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.400> can<00:04:01.489> scale<00:04:02.000> in

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
down here as well so I can scale in

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.280 
down here as well so I can scale in
multiple<00:04:03.440> axis<00:04:04.310> or<00:04:04.519> just<00:04:04.970> one<00:04:05.180> dimension<00:04:05.390> I'm

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
multiple axis or just one dimension I'm

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.199 
multiple axis or just one dimension I'm
gonna<00:04:06.470> keep<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.860> on<00:04:06.890> a<00:04:07.010> uniform<00:04:07.370> scale<00:04:07.760> for<00:04:08.150> the

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
gonna keep it on a uniform scale for the

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.810 
gonna keep it on a uniform scale for the
time<00:04:08.450> being<00:04:08.780> but<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.650> quick<00:04:09.950> way<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.220> change

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
time being but a quick way to change

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.300 
time being but a quick way to change
whether<00:04:11.720> you're<00:04:11.959> going<00:04:12.109> uniform<00:04:12.769> or<00:04:13.070> on<00:04:13.250> a

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
whether you're going uniform or on a

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.029 
whether you're going uniform or on a
single<00:04:13.640> axis<00:04:14.090> is<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:15.049> come<00:04:15.410> around<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:15.829> see

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
single axis is to come around and see

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.979 
single axis is to come around and see
what<00:04:16.280> you're<00:04:16.430> highlighting<00:04:16.820> here<00:04:17.209> on<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.419> UCS

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
what you're highlighting here on the UCS

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.529 
what you're highlighting here on the UCS
so<00:04:18.799> if<00:04:18.890> you<00:04:18.950> want<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.160> choose<00:04:19.340> these<00:04:19.640> two<00:04:19.700> axes

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
so if you want to choose these two axes

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.190 
so if you want to choose these two axes
you<00:04:21.500> can<00:04:21.680> do<00:04:21.830> that<00:04:22.039> or<00:04:22.849> you<00:04:23.030> can<00:04:23.360> only<00:04:23.539> choose

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
you can do that or you can only choose

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.740 
you can do that or you can only choose
the<00:04:24.260> Z<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:24.950> it'll<00:04:25.520> scale<00:04:25.789> it

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
the Z and it'll scale it

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.440 
the Z and it'll scale it
a<00:04:26.780> bigger<00:04:27.230> height<00:04:27.560> or<00:04:27.890> you<00:04:28.730> can<00:04:28.880> choose<00:04:29.150> all

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
a bigger height or you can choose all

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.770 
a bigger height or you can choose all
three<00:04:30.050> by<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:31.250> center<00:04:31.640> of<00:04:31.850> this<00:04:32.030> triangle

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
three by the center of this triangle

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.840 
three by the center of this triangle
here<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.290> it'll<00:04:33.980> scale<00:04:34.310> in<00:04:34.490> all<00:04:34.610> three

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
here and it'll scale in all three

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.500 
here and it'll scale in all three
dimensions<00:04:36.700> so<00:04:37.700> that's<00:04:37.880> some<00:04:38.030> pretty<00:04:38.240> simple

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
dimensions so that's some pretty simple

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.700 
dimensions so that's some pretty simple
stuff<00:04:38.960> for<00:04:40.540> applying<00:04:41.540> transformations<00:04:42.470> to

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
stuff for applying transformations to

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.490 
stuff for applying transformations to
your<00:04:42.890> objects<00:04:43.550> one<00:04:44.360> of<00:04:44.480> the<00:04:44.540> things<00:04:44.780> that<00:04:45.050> you

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
your objects one of the things that you

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.350 
your objects one of the things that you
might<00:04:45.710> want<00:04:45.920> to<00:04:46.040> do<00:04:46.190> as<00:04:46.400> well<00:04:46.670> as<00:04:47.350> make<00:04:48.350> some

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
might want to do as well as make some

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.970 
might want to do as well as make some
make<00:04:50.360> some<00:04:50.510> connections<00:04:51.020> from<00:04:51.230> this<00:04:51.620> piece<00:04:51.830> of

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
make some connections from this piece of

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.310 
make some connections from this piece of
geometry<00:04:52.190> to<00:04:52.520> this<00:04:52.820> one<00:04:53.120> so<00:04:53.810> we<00:04:53.930> already<00:04:54.140> know

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
geometry to this one so we already know

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.550 
geometry to this one so we already know
that<00:04:54.350> this<00:04:54.710> is<00:04:54.770> occurring<00:04:55.190> on<00:04:55.580> that<00:04:56.110> dot<00:04:57.110> zero

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
that this is occurring on that dot zero

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.580 
that this is occurring on that dot zero
origin<00:04:58.340> so<00:04:59.030> maybe<00:04:59.450> I'll<00:04:59.600> just<00:04:59.780> come<00:04:59.990> in<00:05:00.169> here

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
origin so maybe I'll just come in here

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.290 
origin so maybe I'll just come in here
and<00:05:01.090> I'll<00:05:02.090> change<00:05:02.480> these<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:03.020> zero<00:05:04.030> these<00:05:05.030> to

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
and I'll change these to zero these to

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.560 
and I'll change these to zero these to
zero<00:05:05.570> and<00:05:06.050> now<00:05:06.470> you<00:05:06.530> can<00:05:06.740> see<00:05:06.980> that<00:05:07.160> my<00:05:08.120> sphere

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
zero and now you can see that my sphere

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.440 
zero and now you can see that my sphere
is<00:05:08.690> in<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.990> exact<00:05:09.290> location<00:05:09.710> as<00:05:10.640> this<00:05:11.060> cone

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
is in the exact location as this cone

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.159 
is in the exact location as this cone
but<00:05:12.260> now<00:05:12.440> I<00:05:12.470> can<00:05:12.740> just<00:05:12.919> use<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.520> one<00:05:13.760> axis<00:05:14.570> to

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
but now I can just use the one axis to

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.780 
but now I can just use the one axis to
bring<00:05:15.380> that<00:05:15.500> up<00:05:15.710> to<00:05:15.890> where<00:05:15.980> I<00:05:16.040> want<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:16.430> to<00:05:16.580> be

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
bring that up to where I want it to be

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.040 
bring that up to where I want it to be
if<00:05:17.000> it's<00:05:17.210> right<00:05:18.140> on<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.440> top<00:05:19.480> now<00:05:20.480> I<00:05:20.510> can<00:05:20.810> see

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
if it's right on the top now I can see

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.250 
if it's right on the top now I can see
that<00:05:21.340> that<00:05:22.340> object<00:05:22.610> is<00:05:23.120> exactly<00:05:23.780> where<00:05:24.050> I<00:05:24.080> want

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
that that object is exactly where I want

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.909 
that that object is exactly where I want
it<00:05:24.380> to<00:05:24.500> be<00:05:24.620> and<00:05:25.400> now<00:05:25.520> if<00:05:25.730> I<00:05:25.820> wanted<00:05:26.180> this<00:05:26.740> to<00:05:27.740> say

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
it to be and now if I wanted this to say

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.480 
it to be and now if I wanted this to say
B<00:05:28.100> inverse<00:05:28.720> well<00:05:29.720> I<00:05:29.810> could<00:05:29.990> simply<00:05:30.440> move<00:05:31.160> that

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
B inverse well I could simply move that

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.190 
B inverse well I could simply move that
up<00:05:31.760> and<00:05:32.830> then<00:05:33.830> come<00:05:34.070> back<00:05:34.100> to<00:05:34.540> the<00:05:35.540> properties

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
up and then come back to the properties

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.100 
up and then come back to the properties
and<00:05:36.850> make<00:05:37.850> this<00:05:38.000> a<00:05:38.060> little<00:05:38.419> bit<00:05:38.570> different<00:05:38.960> so

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
and make this a little bit different so

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.830 
and make this a little bit different so
I'd<00:05:39.200> make<00:05:39.380> this<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.800> skinny<00:05:40.130> end<00:05:40.400> and<00:05:40.840> that

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
I'd make this the skinny end and that

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.360 
I'd make this the skinny end and that
top<00:05:42.169> radius<00:05:42.680> the<00:05:42.979> wide<00:05:43.130> end<00:05:43.930> so<00:05:45.250> there<00:05:46.250> you

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
top radius the wide end so there you

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.860 
top radius the wide end so there you
have<00:05:46.430> it<00:05:46.640> there's<00:05:46.820> some<00:05:46.970> pretty<00:05:47.450> simple

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
have it there's some pretty simple

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.710 
have it there's some pretty simple
