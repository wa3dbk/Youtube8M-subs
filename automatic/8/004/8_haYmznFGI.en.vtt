00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.639
 syrup syrup or simple syrups in the 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.320
 life really, if that's what we're going to 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.549
 learn to do here and a lot of attention 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.889
 all those who like the 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.680
 pastry or cocktails because it is 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.050
 ideal for all types of cakes 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.790
 daiquiris cocktail cakes 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.880
 daisies etcetera good what you want 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.890
 it's very easy to do and in addition you can 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.790
 do in many different ways can 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:34.000
 be vanilla syrup syrup 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.130
 violets or can be lemon maple 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.840
 good orange etcetera and also from 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.210
 liqueurs with liqueur flavor that is very 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.640
 interesting and very useful the elements are 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.500
 very simple and although you can do very 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.150
 just at home you can also 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.620
 buy in the store 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.960
 what we always say the store comes out a 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.960
 little bit more expensive and when we do it in 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.880
 house we know what elements we put in how 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.410
 we do it and I recommend you do it 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.840
 at home if you have a minute of agreement 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.120
 Well, let's see the ingredients 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.360
 that simpler can not be water and 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.870
 sugar and here it is here we have a cup 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.020
 of water and two cups 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:14.140
 because the proportion is always this way 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.720
 simple the double of sugar that of water 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.030
 that you do not forget, we're going to 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.910
 we're going to start by heating the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.450
 water and even boiling water and we're going to 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.039
 throw the sugar 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.219
 and now the time has come for 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:32.090
 stir it up moving it moving 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.930
 that all the sugar has dissolved 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.780
 completely 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.200
 and here is the sugar dissolved 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.770
 and we have our simple syrup syrup 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.609
 or syrup 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.920
 the time has come to put a 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.549
 pot for you to see it well 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.549
 and here we go 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.340
 this is the simple syrup that we can 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.770
 give different flavors and that we will go 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.080
 teaching as we said to do each one 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.360
 of them in successive segments thing that 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.580
 attentive and good now is the 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.500
 time to save it save it 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.030
 in a hermetically sealed container 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.130
 I'll keep it in the fridge as soon as 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.019
 has cooled logically and then when 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.209
 you use it remember that it will be much 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.160
 thicker and that thickness is 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.080
 will keep even if you take it out of the fridge 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.330
 what it is to keep that 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.370
 consistency I hope it serves you 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.170
 very useful that you use a lot and that 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.239
 keep watching all our segments 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.190
 where we will tell how to make the 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.190
 different flavors of agreement chao
