00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 today's cattelan heir will be on the two 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.970
 stakes gloomy edition gold bump 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.620
 the 100 100 appliance is excellent 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.630
 altar for the exits but if as a note 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.190
 there are so many I do two at a time 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.109
 better this is what it is for now 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.080
 state of more we have just the palette 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.560
 on the pink and the gym on the colors instead 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.480
 more brownish than copper the price 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.359
 recommended of 16 euros and 90 are there 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.010
 within five colors and they are different 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.929
 for apple and long ones with more 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.820
 colors because these are the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.430
 same as eye shadow formulation 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.239
 individual punks that are less better 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.860
 compared to those that usually 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.140
 we found in the palettes like 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.390
 you know they were not crazy 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.570
 obviously from which he was elected changes 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.950
 the quality depending on the color and then 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.870
 only to be taken individually and a 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.820
 study analyzing individually 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.250
 however , I will show you on the meantime 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.329
 in color this is the palette on 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.370
 rose 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.850
 the only value that is really documents 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.109
 the third is the opaque ruin than on 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.379
 hand you see little but on what you see 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.210
 even less and I'll show you a trick 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.920
 done with this spoon here so 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.290
 at least you see the work I have done a 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.330
 complete semi makeup with this 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.270
 palettina I show you talete 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.900
 number 02 is the one on the shades of pink uses 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:27.990
 under a primer start at the one over 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:29.520
 clear wide inside as per 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.350
 second color 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.880
 let's say that once you put them 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.259
 on the eyes the first and second one 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.119
 which are very similar is not noticed 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.680
 you can see a lot of difference 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.070
 net the first whiter according to some 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.350
 more pink, however, is not something you say 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.540
 there is a crazy spearman that today 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:52.799
 brush and go loses the third color the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:55.729
 opaque pink I put that fifth color 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.729
 their marc 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.780
 it seems nuanced to me 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.510
 only in the bag does it run darker 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.510
 the dull brown 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.110
 this then girls too done that 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.150
 the small stick 02 we say that he is mine 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.540
 color write well very well 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.280
 the color pink writes like this is not so 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.110
 that you notice a lot and if you dull it 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.970
 however, also it tends to drop a bit and 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.220
 so I have imposed disperses you see it 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.990
 more so the first two write though 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.280
 they are very similar to each other 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.500
 so once put on the eyes 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.120
 you see that these networks are not there 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.130
 a huge difference if the two 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.100
 however spoken are not gods 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.180
 super writing metalised then one 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.550
 once the eyes are set, one does not notice 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.890
 very certain if you love the look on 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.700
 rotate the nice little stick the difficulty 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.800
 of nuances I would say a 7 is not is not 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.600
 very easy from the sea especially with 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.790
 the shutters serve a few Sassari 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.770
 practice some time to blend them 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.450
 because otherwise if you put the 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.740
 primer and then these colors here we say 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.300
 that is not enough to blur the thing you are 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.430
 I did not advise it because I wanted to 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.220
 try mature which is after putting the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.900
 premier use opaque or neutral color 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.800
 I didn't want to use the first color 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.870
 of Palestine because it was too much 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.470
 brilliant did not want to see all eyes 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.269
 But precisely brilliant though if you are a 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.459
 wall panel so use a matte first for 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.200
 go anyway to remove the extra 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.190
 primer that otherwise you struggle to 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.680
 blend dark colors 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.230
 I know you were curious and therefore these 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.550
 are understood with even in the scale in the 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.070
 part will pull put nothing because 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.110
 morning if I wanted to go out I wanted it 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.820
 weigh down the look too though 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.620
 this resulted 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.760
 welcome back now that you've seen the 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.550
 word before walls I do eat 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.959
 but second and here also we have some 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.220
 the problem that the first two colors are 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.140
 very clear especially on the eye 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.080
 they look very similar the other three are 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.000
 very beautiful very pigmented and two 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.100
 showed that logic at work 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.730
 that is, this work also here first 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.030
 to go 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:08.610
 how many always put a bit of trainer 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:11.170
 below start with the lightest color 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.340
 in the inner corner 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.110
 I do a bit the same procedure is 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.780
 covered as with rose to show 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.530
 all five colors on the eye 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.180
 obviously the color changes a lot when 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.860
 I'll take you with your fingers and when you take it 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.449
 always with the brush with the companies a lot 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.310
 more intense response when picking up 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.080
 that brush because in any case the oils 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.520
 that we have on the fingers make slide and 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.490
 mail and make will adhere to the of 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:39.789
 attitude number to take the 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:46.090
 soccer color but to take the fourth 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:48.150
 color and then take some color more 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.150
 dark 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.350
 so this is the trick done 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.860
 quickly with all five colors and 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.860
 touch of mascara 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.660
 ok looking at this individually then 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.160
 that is, two with the makes who is pink and the 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.690
 dark brown then social brown 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.240
 dark the other colors are on 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.340
 bright satin and there is also to say 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.980
 that this is all between the two teams 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.170
 commented and has a higher quality 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.340
 compared to the one on rose where there are 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.590
 nice colors you can do a lot 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.510
 trick you saw also the tutor is a 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.490
 torino federico tool that they did 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.110
 see first but let's say it's a bit 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.180
 more difficult to work and color yes 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.980
 they fade less easily than 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.420
 the brown one 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.990
 both palettes come with a 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.850
 applicator in these here a bit sad 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.140
 but if you have to take a little 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.580
 color of put it for example in the center 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.590
 I leave very intensely 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.970
 pagini are obviously impossible 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.170
 impossible to fade with these and 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.540
 however you have to be to have the 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.460
 absurd patience from the opening date 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.710
 the six-month deadline 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.810
 but few know that they usually write 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.450
 six months is on the safe side however they last of 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.270
 more and inside there are four grams 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.220
 of product then divided on five 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.620
 colors usually a vamp eyeshadow pupa 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:05.550
 normal instead 2.5 grams of product 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:08.070
 therefore it is practically less than two 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.440
 shadows that the individual pupa for 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.210
 regarding the duration with under the 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.270
 first of all, the whole 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.730
 day without going to drool and we say 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.710
 which, as I said, is easier 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.240
 to blur the one on the brown that it is 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.890
 I really do a lot to fade 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.810
 however I have not found any problem 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.730
 the one in its own way a little more difficult to 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.100
 fade out either because the color is anyway 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.990
 center the one on the opaque rosin is 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.600
 practically invisible therefore it is 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.790
 difficult to build some color 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.290
 and putting it both because also colors 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.880
 the darker ones are above all the 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.100
 red a little more difficult to blend 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.390
 I wait for the colors that are here that 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.370
 I'm a little silky that a little easier 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.190
 then to work 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.590
 32 individual votes because precisely the 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.660
 quality is different then as far as 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.910
 regards the relative on my rose my vote 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.060
 is 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:59.160
 drum roll the 7 and i do 7 because it is 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.920
 nice as a palette but it does have us 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.990
 flaws an eye shadow that one writes 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.000
 a lot and 2 eye shadows that put on the eye 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.620
 they look very similar especially on the 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.850
 clear complexions on the tank tops speeches 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.330
 there is a bit of difference between the two 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.860
 colors 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.990
 however if it feels as clear as a venue 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.780
 little for what concerns the 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.910
 stick on the brown my vote is 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.140
 taxi the eight and a half lead eight drums 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.410
 and a half with the found a small stick 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.520
 really bad for a long time 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.350
 very well 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.050
 beautiful colors are prizes and favorite colors 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.880
 so there are people who are quality and 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.580
 I really like the colors 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.800
 obviously they lack a bit of bridging but 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.290
 expensive that is, maybe it will take the place of 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.790
 white premise light brown park 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.900
 but to do them also eyebrows 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.280
 it was my dream 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.980
 but let's say it really is really 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.260
 valid as a palestine also used with 

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.450
 brushes do not lose their intensity and are 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.920
 really beautiful 

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.920
 will be bye beautiful hello beauties
