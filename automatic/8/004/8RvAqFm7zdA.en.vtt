pieces of leather with a kevlar bond
sandwiched<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.610> between<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:09.780> not

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
sandwiched in between so it's not

I<00:02:12.770> just<00:02:13.010> showed<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:14.330> actually<00:02:14.900> has<00:02:15.050> a

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
I just showed you this actually has a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.250 
I just showed you this actually has a
synthetic<00:02:15.560> chemical<00:02:16.550> in<00:02:17.510> between<00:02:17.930> those<00:02:18.110> two

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
synthetic chemical in between those two

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.930 
synthetic chemical in between those two
pieces<00:02:18.530> of<00:02:18.620> leather<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.430> prevents<00:02:19.820> the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
pieces of leather and it prevents the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.360 
pieces of leather and it prevents the
grip<00:02:20.120> from<00:02:20.360> stretching<00:02:20.660> as<00:02:20.990> much<00:02:21.230> some<00:02:22.130> girls

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
doesn't stretch as much it just takes a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.340 
doesn't stretch as much it just takes a

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
more frequently and they should be this

grip<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:40.760> stronger<00:02:41.240> but<00:02:41.660> like<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:41.900> said<00:02:41.960> it<00:02:42.170> does

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
grip is stronger but like I said it does

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.510 
grip is stronger but like I said it does
take<00:02:42.440> some<00:02:42.560> getting<00:02:42.620> used<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:43.100> because<00:02:43.280> it

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
take some getting used to because it

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.770
