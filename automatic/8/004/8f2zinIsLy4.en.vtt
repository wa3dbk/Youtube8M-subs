00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
I think the most regrettable thing that happened in Germany

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.780
was that's what we did not see.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.360
A press conference after the race, surely you have read many things about it,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.660
in that press conference some..., i was going to say colleagues, some british journalists

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660
three or four eh!, not the majority,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.260
three or four,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.020
tried to stone Fernando Alonso with questions that did not seek answers,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.500
just wanted to get him out of control.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.180
We wanted to show you that press conference

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.380
In fact we have not even translated Fernando or the journalist so you can see and hear

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.380
the tones in which the questions were asked.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.320
You will have to read in this kind of karaoke, but it's worth it.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.840
This, this shame, is what we were able to see in German Grand Prix few days ago.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.760
What does a world champion driver do when he wins a race and they ask him this?

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.000
This is what he had to endure, after being the fastest of the weekend.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Questions from a court: the british press.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.600
The truth is that he was very measured in front of so much impertinence.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.900
The first smiles came out from the Asturian and Vettel.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.700
Massa in his world with a gesture that was scary.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.800
The british returned to the charge.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.700
The avalanche of accusatory questions does not stop, until its a spanish journalist turn.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.000
Carlos Miquel is witness to harassment

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.060
and surprised, he asks:

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.620
British sector murmurs with the question and the answer

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.320
And returns to discharge his fury against the Spanish driver:

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.640
Seeing the tone that was reaching the conference, Vettel decides to take the tension with a joke:

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.720
In this situation there is a brave who changes the objective, asking Vettel fot the team orders that also have been in Red Bull.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.480
Grotesque, isnt it?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.300
Massa and Alonso did not look at each other, they did not even help each other.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.180
It seemed that the British press had outstanding accounts with Spanish driver,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.700
who managed to overcome the storm with patience and resignation.
