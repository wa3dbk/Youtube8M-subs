first<00:01:08.280> five<00:01:08.549> levels<00:01:09.030> maybe<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.659> 200<00:01:10.170> point

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
first five levels maybe this 200 point

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
first five levels maybe this 200 point
one<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:10.740> that's<00:01:11.490> probably<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:11.820> far<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.150> I'll

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
one here that's probably as far as I'll

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.420 
one here that's probably as far as I'll
get<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:13.470> that's<00:01:13.650> okay<00:01:13.890> that's<00:01:14.010> all<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.250> need

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
get but that's okay that's all you need

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.670 
get but that's okay that's all you need
you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.729> replay<00:01:15.060> levels<00:01:15.240> if<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.960> replay<00:01:16.470> them

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
you can replay levels if you replay them

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.440 
you can replay levels if you replay them
within<00:01:16.920> 12<00:01:17.159> hours<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.640> they're<00:01:17.939> worth<00:01:18.180> less

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
within 12 hours like they're worth less

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.980 
within 12 hours like they're worth less
points<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.950> if<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.400> replay<00:01:20.759> them<00:01:21.060> regularly

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
points but if you replay them regularly

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.780 
points but if you replay them regularly
you'll<00:01:22.470> obviously<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.130> more<00:01:23.159> points<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you'll obviously get more points and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.340 
you'll obviously get more points and
rank<00:01:23.970> higher<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.869> that's<00:01:24.990> what<00:01:25.080> I'm<00:01:25.140> gonna<00:01:25.229> do

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
rank higher so that's what I'm gonna do

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.050 
rank higher so that's what I'm gonna do
obviously<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.430> super<00:01:26.880> high

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
obviously if you have really super high

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.850 
obviously if you have really super high
level<00:01:27.119> hunters<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> max<00:01:28.740> is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
level hunters like I think the max is

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.010 
level hunters like I think the max is
over<00:01:29.009> 30<00:01:29.250> you're<00:01:30.000> gonna<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.390> got<00:01:30.540> no<00:01:30.689> stress

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
over 30 you're gonna you got no stress

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.990 
over 30 you're gonna you got no stress
stress<00:01:31.619> less<00:01:31.860> you'll<00:01:32.040> get<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> Simmons<00:01:32.670> piece

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
stress less you'll get the Simmons piece

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.149 
stress less you'll get the Simmons piece
of<00:01:33.180> cake<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:34.290> let's<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.710> we'll<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.009> this
