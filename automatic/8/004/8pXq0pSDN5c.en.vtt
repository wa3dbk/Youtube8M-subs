 to the guest commentary at the core yes 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.780
 my name is marcel scorpion i do 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.389
 his three months youtube commentary 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.429
 I have already reached 350 subscribers 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.839
 the animal what right now with you 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.190
 I would like to discuss mine 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.449
 channel also ever treated but 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.189
 I thought that's just it 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.660
 important topic that a few more people 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.269
 should appeal and that's why I have 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.800
 this guest commentary chose for 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.380
 you want to come to a few first 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.140
 give eckdaten to the gameplay namely 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.730
 are in the background a kind cr moab the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.809
 towers were mufflers and 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.090
 red dot sight 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.370
 the perks dexterity hardliner and 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.219
 master marksman and the special of the park 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.550
 were quick to pull raiders and eat 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.530
 that is the topic of what it is today 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.270
 go to my house during gamescom 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.789
 fluttered why is my house celebrated 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.760
 had been in a local newspaper 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.430
 and that was about whether pc or all 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.930
 video games in the near future maybe 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.030
 free offers can be offered 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.739
 that will then look like that money 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.539
 for items or monthly issues 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.189
 have bought it plays itself handy 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.689
 nothing is paid so you get free 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.600
 example of this 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.220
 for example, these are runes of magic 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.090
 that a world of warcraft clown is buying 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.439
 you then objects or 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.280
 mods and so you know you have to stop it 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.689
 spend money 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.549
 I have one here now 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.869
 disadvantage is listed then 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.150
 I've seen what's up 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.530
 good ones are not good at what's good 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
 every case first that everyone play 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.000
 can casuals has it their fun 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.439
 because if I have to start because of that too 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.030
 Do not spend money on it 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.470
 sit down times in the month unlock 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.579
 leaves and the play off places firma 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.320
 or if you like the objects you 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.549
 simply buying could not buy 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.360
 and thereby do not risk anything 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.799
 paid the developers can of course 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.060
 also extremely fumble because the people 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.170
 can make to the wall they simply 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.119
 for which they paid nothing in principle 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.740
 but just about later 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.509
 the addons you buy like the ones 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.270
 oldest call of duty or for 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.040
 objects that are extremely expensive 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.630
 that would be easy for the casuals one 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.009
 carefree fun means you can 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.079
 But she sits for the console or from 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.369
 pc just play a bit and if 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.930
 you do not have to buy anymore 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.600
 just do not put these super items 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.210
 the game forever 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.679
 Of course, that's the night away 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.149
 money really for every month 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.620
 flutes goes for the pro gamer 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.970
 program always want to be successful 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.860
 so if you want to play along and 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.720
 You then have to pay the money accordingly 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.250
 spend and granny from the role playing 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.569
 to get away times to call of duty I have 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.989
 Just give me a little something 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.140
 children 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.030
 what if it was a superweapon? 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.340
 for five euros the damage the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.410
 miss him and I'll tell you the p90 m1 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.300
 at one time would all posters with 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.910
 running around and success would happen all at once 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.350
 For sale this weapon would be easy 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.520
 Everyone wants to be very good at playing 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.110
 it should be different but everyone else 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.790
 they'll play anyway anyway 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.290
 and it would just be such unfairness 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.019
 the game is not money 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.280
 have style weapons to buy 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.870
 it's practically like this one now 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.610
 Often you buy the game three times payable 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.959
 51 euro and then the money is gone 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.030
 but you have the game, you know 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.819
 Yesterday it is practically once 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.340
 Pay now always have it every month 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.019
 Feel free to spend 15 euros this month 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.850
 this only costs them to take care of that 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.880
 also so much on it and so on 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.000
 further that is a so-called 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.860
 free-to-play turin system that means that 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.329
 that success becomes easy to buy and 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.810
 you otherwise have no more fun in mind 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.030
 can simply a disadvantage for 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.280
 Pros like that I have just now 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.030
 explained and that are five euros for 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.890
 many today just a lot of money for five 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.840
 euros are maybe 13 14 for people 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.739
 15 the game is just a buzz 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.390
 They may not even be that way 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.829
 can pay and above all is 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.150
 nowadays so that you 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.220
 Payment options for something really 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.840
 complicated over with bank transfer 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.130
 Pay with credit card 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.510
 the whole people do not have to 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.010
 Parents first to pump and whether the the 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.530
 one does not support support either 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.840
 and then there is a next one 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.700
 The second danger of danger like the danger of driving 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.170
 that can not be bought because 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.430
 it's probably like that 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.870
 many also play something against the 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.340
 You could buy yourself otherwise 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.989
 two also play but that will be extreme 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.299
 had to take a lot of time in challenging 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.950
 play extremely well and that would be 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.140
 that's exactly how we say a situation 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.459
 This pb 97 superweapon could be one 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.200
 then play freely in which we say 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.000
 then you could be prestige 40 times 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.310
 They practically buy with ingame money 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.569
 Prezi stop let me know what 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.650
 Of course, all children would think 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.760
 okay i need this thing that can 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.170
 I do not keep up and have to 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.030
 accordingly as long as gamble until 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.079
 they have reached this prestige and 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.980
 let's be honest who wants that 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.900
 at all 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.280
 in conclusion, I can just underneath 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.680
 I do not opt ​​for this system 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.540
 am just let's say 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.919
 suboptimal that people stop then 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.300
 practically several times for a game 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.860
 maybe have to pay for what 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.910
 later have no more bock because 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.960
 You will not get the money again 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.400
 if you say that I am here now 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.770
 to pay monthly because you get that 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.210
 money from the months before not synonymous 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.560
 again while you are doing something for example now 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.970
 I'll wait for a three tomorrow for now 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.919
 Could sell 30 euros 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.150
 that means it's fun for her either 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.090
 or not and you just can not do anything 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.760
 change more 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.870
 yes , but that's the topic that I have 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.220
 on my channel also normal in one 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.690
 detailed comment as mentioned 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.570
 and have a look around for you 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.560
 to address larger mass and wants 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.150
 tell you a little bit now 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.949
 what to see on my channel like this 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.600
 because of course I'm honest it is 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.710
 relatively heavy youtube still big too 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.150
 so be on this glass 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.380
 commented on and perhaps 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.940
 to address a few more people the 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.310
 maybe look at main channel 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.270
 if you like 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.460
 and I have on a channel 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.600
 relatively diverse so I have many 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.770
 Pug and so far that maybe 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.720
 not so much variety but me 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.360

 by having reached with an o 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.010
 at least in the comments that's the case 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.530
 read 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.300
