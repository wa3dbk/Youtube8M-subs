00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
it's 45 millimeter exactly and it has a

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.860 
it's 45 millimeter exactly and it has a
really<00:04:13.190> nice<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.640> can<00:04:13.700> see<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.120> curvature<00:04:14.390> -

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
really nice you can see the curvature -

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.870 
really nice you can see the curvature -
also<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.380> arch<00:04:15.560> support<00:04:15.799> unit<00:04:16.310> almost<00:04:16.579> looks

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
also the arch support unit almost looks

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.969 
also the arch support unit almost looks
like<00:04:17.000> a<00:04:17.060> bit<00:04:17.180> of<00:04:17.269> a<00:04:17.359> wave<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:18.049> does<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:18.739> can

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
like a bit of a wave it does and you can

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.320 
like a bit of a wave it does and you can
feel<00:04:19.250> it<00:04:19.280> in<00:04:19.579> there<00:04:19.729> too<00:04:20.000> so<00:04:20.329> it's<00:04:20.450> really

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
feel it in there too so it's really

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.460 
feel it in there too so it's really
so<00:04:21.480> you<00:04:21.570> get<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:21.750> little<00:04:21.870> bit<00:04:22.080> of<00:04:22.230> height<00:04:22.440> and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
so you get a little bit of height and

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.470 
so you get a little bit of height and
elevation<00:04:23.160> which<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.490> great<00:04:23.730> I<00:04:23.940> really<00:04:24.090> like

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
elevation which is great I really like

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.360 
elevation which is great I really like
this<00:04:24.660> food<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:25.050> like<00:04:25.410> its<00:04:25.650> color<00:04:25.830> block<00:04:26.130> like
