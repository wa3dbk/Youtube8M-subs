00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.800 
it's too heavy for me but I think I
would<00:04:16.190> just<00:04:16.250> put<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.519> in<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.639> car<00:04:16.910> and<00:04:17.510> so<00:04:17.660> what

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
would just put it in a car and so what

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.319 
would just put it in a car and so what
