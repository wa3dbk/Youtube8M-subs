00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.419

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.919
 but that's okay, I'm you 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.119
 actually told the diet my 

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:08.099
 computer is dead at the gate and 

00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:09.629
 love oka 930 was plugged into a 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.889
 usb socket of the computer and there is 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.389
 had almost no battery Sunday 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.799
 evening and as my computer was no longer 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.389
 powered the nokia did not charge 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.990
 during the night and so there is madam 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.720
 alarm clock failure 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.769
 Here bah what Banon do not believe it 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.000
 preferred I tell you that I was 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.740
 sequestered all day and that I was 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.210
 listen to jazz to punish for having 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.990
 been naughty this weekend during a match 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.119
 field hockey 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.500
 adama realizes where the favorite 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.169
 short version 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.919
 hello we're on Tuesday 18th November 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.710
 2014 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.710
 and that's the hate always hated 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.540
 we are talking about nokia today with a 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100
 rather amazing new to which we 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.140
 did not really expect after having 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.490
 resold his mobile business to microsoft 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.380
 it looks like the builder 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.000
 Finnish intends to return 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.250
 on the mobile phone market 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.660
 yes the president of nokia technology in 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.850
 declared effect that he intended to 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.050
 to offer its trademark under licenses to 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.190
 third-party manufacturers 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.480
 in clear of the builders of 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.579
 smartphones could very soon 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.649
 get out of mobiles under the nokia brand 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.600
 by cons for nokia however obliged 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.909
 to wait until 2016 for smartphones or 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.259
 2024 for feature phones its 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.670
 basic phones are only for 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.740
 call send sms 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.060
 a dependent mom for the brand 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.140
 to produce a notebook of 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.820
 charges for devices that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.530
 would retain the asset of what makes 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.570
 nokia until today devices 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.469
 solid performant and richly endowed on 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.329
 the software part 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.249
 we obviously think of smartphones 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.810
 android because we can not see how nokia 

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:32.520
 could propose windows phones the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.020
 confusion would be total then one in 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.240
 no doubt speak again in a year and a half 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.409
 no when a brand announces a new 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.880
 product we are often entitled to videos 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.619
 certainly instructive 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.149
 but sometimes a little mollassonne and in 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.409
 general everyone misses by 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.420
 but when snapshot announces a 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.590
 innovation in its application it does not 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.240
 not at all like everyone 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.639
 so it's with a video completely 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.499
 crazy that snapshot announced yesterday the 

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:54.389
 snap cash launch and like you 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:56.100
 have no doubt guessed nakache is a 

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:57.899
 new snapshot feature that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.340
 allows us to send money to your 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.209
 friends as simply as when you 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.950
 send them a message 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.630
 once your credit card has added 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.880
 in the application simply 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.619
 select your friend in 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.360
 because the amount of the transfer then 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.890
 click on the little button dollars and 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.520
 hop the money is sent to his account 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.590
 banking 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.000
 a question arises however snapshot 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.950
 can not maintain the secrecy of 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.690
 photos supposed to be ephemeral in his 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.890
 app what's going to happen with the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.390
 bank card numbers for 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.130
 secure transactions 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.599
 snap pussy signed a partnership with 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.340
 square a start up that was done 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.170
 know by introducing the payment 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.000
 with an iphone in the united states and 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.590
 snapshot assures us that everything is ultra 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.569
 secure for now the service is 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.099
 limited to the United States and 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.110
 can be used only by snapshots 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.670
 major clashes but snapshot at a 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.110
 community so many that this 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.370
 large scale test will 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.720
 quickly to know if the app 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.549
 works well and interests the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.500
 users if this is the case the service 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.480
 could be extended to the rest of the world 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.010
 to follow linotte head of all 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.239
 country do you rejoice an application that 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.010
 pushed to you is available on 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.630
 the linotte appstore is the name of a small 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.069
 lovely bird but also a 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.380
 application that serves as a reminder 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.849
 geolocate its use is very 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.930
 simple when you launch the app you 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.760
 can look for a place that you 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.390
 interest like a restaurant a shop 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.829
 etc. 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.239
 and if you find it is that it has been 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.160
 identified by the community of 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.170
 foursquare users that linnet 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.670
 query in real time when you 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.690
 go around this place 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.440
 that we would have selected 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.430
 previously 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.049
 linotte sends you a small 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.310
 notification to the song of the linnet 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.319
 birds that can also be done 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.209
 think according to your distance from the point 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.620
 of interest a color is different and 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.060
 allows you to see the direction of the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.319
 point of interest with an arrow that 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.280
 use the iphone compass for 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.170
 tell you the direction 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.549
 of course you can then be 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.989
 guided by the app for you there 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.739
 walk or drive 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.930
 public transport 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.280
 linnet is a very good idea and for 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.239
 which designers are already in 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.680
 preparing new ones 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.630
 features for a next 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.910
 linotte version available for the moment on 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.829
 ios for now is our heart asset 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.299
 of the day the question of the day comes to us 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.609
 of the udc and theo who asks us when 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.560
 will android 5 be available for 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.180
 g motorola g's then guys 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.560
 we will have to be a little patient 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.280
 because if motorola announces a 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.510
 availability 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.650
 it's not that simple 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.590
 take the example of a motorization 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.000
 2014 according to motorola android 5 is already 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.040
 available to the league motorcycles since the 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.450
 day of release of lollipop but in the 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.950
 facts the distributed version in europe 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.840
 are not the same and to date the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.280
 European x bikes so still not been 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.900
 updated with android 5 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.410
 as for the bikes I have it even worse 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.670
 setting 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.870
 we are not yet available in the United States 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.890
 we're talking about a delay of about two 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.970
 weeks and there also versions 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.500
 Europeans are different 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.480
 so it's smaller so to table 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.830
 on an arrival android 5 on motorcycle I 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.330
 towards the end of the year it is this 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.460
 what does motorola say and that's probably 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.170
 what have a madman the most accurate it's 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.700
 today the day of the cool box 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.800
