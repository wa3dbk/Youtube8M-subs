00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
simple you're going to need to pry out

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.679 
simple you're going to need to pry out
these<00:02:01.860> Oh<00:02:01.890> white<00:02:02.759> tabs<00:02:03.060> all<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.509> get<00:02:03.659> are

these silver tabs all you do is just

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.080 
these silver tabs all you do is just
take<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> screwdriver<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.580> sort<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.910> just

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
take a screwdriver and you sort of just

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.820 
take a screwdriver and you sort of just
pry<00:02:09.360> them<00:02:09.569> lift<00:02:09.840> them<00:02:10.020> up<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.319> little<00:02:10.410> bit<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
pry them lift them up a little bit and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.140 
pry them lift them up a little bit and
pull<00:02:11.190> forward<00:02:11.660> when<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.780> do

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
pull forward when you do

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.670 
pull forward when you do
because<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:13.689> is<00:02:13.810> constructed<00:02:14.260> in<00:02:14.530> two

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
because this is constructed in two

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.339 
because this is constructed in two
pieces<00:02:14.950> be<00:02:15.670> much<00:02:16.090> easier<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.599> get<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.870> rest<00:02:17.110> of

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
pieces be much easier to get the rest of

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.670 
pieces be much easier to get the rest of
the<00:02:17.560> grill<00:02:17.890> out<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:19.269> there<00:02:19.480> are<00:02:19.720> six<00:02:20.409> of<00:02:20.530> these

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
the grill out so there are six of these

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.670 
the grill out so there are six of these
that<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:20.980> need<00:02:21.159> to<00:02:21.280> do<00:02:21.459> one<00:02:22.360> on<00:02:22.569> each<00:02:23.019> side<00:02:23.349> and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
that you need to do one on each side and

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.000 
that you need to do one on each side and
two<00:02:24.010> on<00:02:24.400> top<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.480> two<00:02:25.659> on<00:02:25.689> bottom<00:02:26.019> what<00:02:26.980> I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
two on top and two on bottom what I

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.979 
two on top and two on bottom what I
recommend<00:02:27.489> doing<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.879> sort<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.209> working<00:02:28.569> along

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
recommend doing is sort of working along

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.140 
recommend doing is sort of working along
the<00:02:29.260> bottom<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.920> then<00:02:30.189> to<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.489> sides<00:02:30.760> once

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
the bottom and then to the sides once

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.059 
the bottom and then to the sides once
you<00:02:31.299> have<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.720> done<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.739> girl's<00:02:32.950> going

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
you have that done the girl's going

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.679 
you have that done the girl's going
pretty<00:02:33.370> much<00:02:33.459> out<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.879> can<00:02:34.030> pull<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.299> forward

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
pretty much out you can pull it forward

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.270 
pretty much out you can pull it forward
just<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.959> little<00:02:34.989> bit<00:02:35.260> more<00:02:35.500> from<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.739> car<00:02:36.040> and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
just a little bit more from the car and

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.460 
just a little bit more from the car and
then<00:02:36.519> lift<00:02:36.730> those<00:02:36.939> top<00:02:37.269> two<00:02:37.510> tabs<00:02:37.810> up<00:02:38.079> and<00:02:38.319> the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
then lift those top two tabs up and the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.199 
then lift those top two tabs up and the
whole<00:02:38.650> grill<00:02:38.920> will<00:02:39.159> just<00:02:39.340> pop<00:02:39.519> out<00:02:39.700> again<00:02:40.060> be

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
whole grill will just pop out again be

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.599 
whole grill will just pop out again be
very<00:02:40.239> careful<00:02:40.450> not<00:02:41.319> to<00:02:41.560> break<00:02:41.769> these<00:02:41.980> plastic

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
very careful not to break these plastic

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.640 
very careful not to break these plastic
tabs<00:02:43.000> they're<00:02:43.720> very<00:02:44.019> easy<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.470> break

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
tabs they're very easy to break

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.869 
tabs they're very easy to break
especially<00:02:44.950> when<00:02:45.370> you're<00:02:45.519> using<00:02:45.700> a

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
especially when you're using a

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.059 
especially when you're using a
screwdriver<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:47.200> if<00:02:47.319> you<00:02:47.440> do<00:02:47.620> break<00:02:47.829> them

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
screwdriver and if you do break them

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.270 
screwdriver and if you do break them
then<00:02:48.629> this<00:02:49.629> grill<00:02:49.989> will<00:02:50.260> not<00:02:50.440> see<00:02:50.709> nicely<00:02:51.099> for

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
then this grill will not see nicely for

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.069 
then this grill will not see nicely for
either<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.760> next<00:02:51.940> owner<00:02:52.180> or<00:02:52.450> if<00:02:52.599> you<00:02:52.720> choose

to go up with the girls back in for some

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.229 
to go up with the girls back in for some
reason<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:56.590> just<00:02:56.799> be<00:02:56.920> careful<00:02:57.099> about<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.549> we

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
reason so just be careful about that we

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.780 
reason so just be careful about that we
did<00:02:58.450> find<00:02:58.780> from<00:02:59.530> our<00:02:59.680> experience<00:03:00.370> here<00:03:00.549> right

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
did find from our experience here right

did find from our experience here right
hidden<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.299> myself<00:03:01.480> putting<00:03:02.290> these<00:03:02.470> in<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.799> is

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
hidden and myself putting these in it is

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.530 
hidden and myself putting these in it is
very<00:03:03.220> easy<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.489> break<00:03:03.730> them<00:03:03.970> putting<00:03:04.209> them<00:03:04.389> in

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
very easy to break them putting them in

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.030 
very easy to break them putting them in
and<00:03:04.750> if<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:04.930> break<00:03:05.139> these<00:03:05.620> tabs<00:03:05.920> here

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
and if you break these tabs here

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.309

bezel to the grill that can create a bit
of<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.680> problem<00:03:14.889> we<00:03:15.400> found<00:03:15.609> that<00:03:15.790> if<00:03:15.939> you<00:03:15.970> just

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
of a problem we found that if you just

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.330 
of a problem we found that if you just
actually<00:03:16.569> wrapped<00:03:16.989> up<00:03:17.260> duct<00:03:17.560> tape<00:03:17.829> on<00:03:18.010> itself

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
actually wrapped up duct tape on itself

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.650 
actually wrapped up duct tape on itself
several<00:03:18.609> times<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.090> put<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.299> in<00:03:19.419> there<00:03:19.569> it

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
several times and put it in there it

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.150 
several times and put it in there it
will<00:03:19.750> hold<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.199> nicely<00:03:20.410> just<00:03:20.739> make<00:03:20.919> sure<00:03:21.040> it's

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
will hold it nicely just make sure it's

those plastic tabs okay so looking at
the<00:03:38.560> tabs<00:03:39.129> there<00:03:39.459> so<00:03:39.669> you<00:03:39.849> just<00:03:39.909> take<00:03:40.180> two<00:03:40.359> a

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
the tabs there so you just take two a

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.539 
the tabs there so you just take two a
screwdriver<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.349> just<00:03:41.739> lift<00:03:42.040> up<00:03:42.190> like<00:03:42.340> that

and when you do that pull forward on the
grill<00:03:45.669> obviously<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.000> can't<00:03:46.209> do<00:03:46.389> this<00:03:46.479> because

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
grill obviously I can't do this because

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.390 
grill obviously I can't do this because
I<00:03:46.690> have<00:03:46.810> one<00:03:46.840> hand<00:03:47.109> holding<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.500> camera<00:03:47.799> but

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
I have one hand holding the camera but

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.039 
I have one hand holding the camera but
you<00:03:48.459> just<00:03:48.579> pull<00:03:48.790> forward<00:03:49.030> on<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.569> silver

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
you just pull forward on the silver

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.500 
you just pull forward on the silver
bezel<00:03:50.290> there<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.919> as<00:03:51.879> you<00:03:52.120> do<00:03:52.269> that<00:03:52.299> you<00:03:52.479> just

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
bezel there and as you do that you just

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.990 
bezel there and as you do that you just
work<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:53.049> little<00:03:53.650> by<00:03:53.739> little<00:03:53.979> on<00:03:54.220> each<00:03:54.459> one<00:03:54.729> all

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
work a little by little on each one all

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.879 
work a little by little on each one all
the<00:03:55.299> way<00:03:55.419> around<00:03:55.750> until<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.290> get<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.680> top

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
the way around until you get to the top

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.699 
the way around until you get to the top
once<00:03:57.609> you<00:03:57.790> have<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.239> two<00:03:58.540> sides<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.319> the<00:03:59.500> two

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
once you have the two sides and the two

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.530 
once you have the two sides and the two
bottom<00:04:00.250> ones<00:04:00.280> out<00:04:00.729> are<00:04:00.909> you<00:04:00.970> going<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.180> find<00:04:01.389> is

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
bottom ones out are you going to find is

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.110 
bottom ones out are you going to find is
that<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.780> grill<00:04:01.989> comes<00:04:02.229> away<00:04:02.709> like<00:04:02.919> this<00:04:03.159> it

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
that the grill comes away like this it

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.399 
that the grill comes away like this it
becomes<00:04:04.299> a<00:04:04.599> little<00:04:04.750> bit<00:04:04.840> easier<00:04:05.199> to<00:04:05.290> gain

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
becomes a little bit easier to gain

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.770 
becomes a little bit easier to gain
access<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.949> the<00:04:06.220> top<00:04:06.459> I<00:04:06.699> kind<00:04:07.120> of<00:04:07.180> pull<00:04:07.659> it

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
access to the top I kind of pull it

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.129 
access to the top I kind of pull it
forward<00:04:08.199> from<00:04:08.669> one<00:04:09.669> side<00:04:10.060> it's<00:04:10.629> fighting<00:04:11.019> me<00:04:11.109> a

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
forward from one side it's fighting me a

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.890 
forward from one side it's fighting me a
little<00:04:11.470> bit<00:04:11.940> but<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:13.030> pull<00:04:13.239> it<00:04:13.329> forward<00:04:13.720> from

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
little bit but you pull it forward from

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.379 
little bit but you pull it forward from
one<00:04:14.379> side<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.579> whole<00:04:15.729> grill<00:04:16.030> kind<00:04:16.269> of

one side and the whole grill kind of

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.750 
one side and the whole grill kind of
just<00:04:16.539> comes<00:04:16.720> out<00:04:16.870> like<00:04:17.019> that<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:18.220> have<00:04:18.609> to

right<00:04:55.970> in<00:04:57.220> again<00:04:58.220> you<00:04:58.550> know<00:04:58.670> you<00:04:58.940> want<00:04:59.120> to<00:04:59.150> do

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
right in again you know you want to do

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.030 
right in again you know you want to do
this<00:04:59.360> with<00:04:59.540> the<00:04:59.660> heel<00:04:59.960> of<00:05:00.200> your<00:05:00.230> hand<00:05:00.680> kind<00:05:01.010> of

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
this with the heel of your hand kind of

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.740 
this with the heel of your hand kind of
like<00:05:01.160> this<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.790> just<00:05:01.850> make<00:05:02.120> sure<00:05:02.240> it<00:05:02.360> seats<00:05:02.570> up

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
like this and just make sure it seats up

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.840 
like this and just make sure it seats up
properly<00:05:03.200> being<00:05:03.890> careful<00:05:04.250> not<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.400> break<00:05:04.670> any

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
properly being careful not to break any

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.150 
properly being careful not to break any
of<00:05:05.000> those<00:05:05.120> tabs<00:05:05.450> also<00:05:06.260> make<00:05:06.530> sure<00:05:06.560> that<00:05:06.800> when

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
of those tabs also make sure that when

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.660 
of those tabs also make sure that when
you're<00:05:07.310> done<00:05:07.460> the<00:05:07.790> hood<00:05:08.660> latch<00:05:08.840> clears<00:05:09.670> this

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
you're done the hood latch clears this

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.740 
you're done the hood latch clears this
first<00:05:11.710> poke<00:05:12.710> here<00:05:13.010> it's<00:05:13.250> kind<00:05:13.520> of<00:05:13.670> kind<00:05:14.600> of

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
first poke here it's kind of kind of

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.540 
first poke here it's kind of kind of
tight<00:05:14.990> on<00:05:15.200> my<00:05:15.380> car<00:05:15.650> so<00:05:15.890> I<00:05:16.070> may<00:05:16.190> do<00:05:16.250> some

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
tight on my car so I may do some

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.640 
tight on my car so I may do some
adjusting<00:05:17.090> there<00:05:17.270> to<00:05:17.420> get<00:05:17.510> it<00:05:17.660> just<00:05:17.810> right<00:05:17.930> but

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
adjusting there to get it just right but

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.610 
adjusting there to get it just right but
ultimately<00:05:19.280> once<00:05:19.730> you're<00:05:19.970> done<00:05:20.210> just<00:05:21.020> Paul<00:05:21.320> go

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
ultimately once you're done just Paul go

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.280 
ultimately once you're done just Paul go
ahead<00:05:21.770> and<00:05:21.920> polish<00:05:22.310> up<00:05:22.460> this<00:05:22.610> plastic<00:05:23.180> and<00:05:23.420> you

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
ahead and polish up this plastic and you

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.330 
ahead and polish up this plastic and you
pretty<00:05:24.440> much<00:05:24.560> all<00:05:24.770> set<00:05:24.920> to<00:05:25.040> go

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
pretty much all set to go

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.090 
pretty much all set to go
really<00:05:25.580> simple<00:05:25.940> DIY<00:05:26.210> there<00:05:26.900> but<00:05:27.500> ultimately

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
really simple DIY there but ultimately

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.730 
really simple DIY there but ultimately
it<00:05:28.550> adds<00:05:28.820> quite<00:05:29.390> a<00:05:29.420> lot<00:05:29.750> to<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:29.990> front<00:05:30.290> of<00:05:30.500> the

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
it adds quite a lot to the front of the

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.650 
it adds quite a lot to the front of the
car<00:05:30.950> I'll<00:05:31.220> take<00:05:31.490> some<00:05:31.700> footage<00:05:32.030> of<00:05:32.180> that<00:05:32.360> and

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
car I'll take some footage of that and

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.260 
car I'll take some footage of that and
just<00:05:32.900> a<00:05:33.080> second<00:05:33.500> with<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.430> hood<00:05:34.610> closed<00:05:34.940> so

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
just a second with the hood closed so

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.450 
just a second with the hood closed so
again<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.230> know<00:05:36.320> pretty<00:05:36.680> easy<00:05:36.920> to<00:05:37.100> do<00:05:37.190> just<00:05:37.370> be

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
again you know pretty easy to do just be

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.840 
again you know pretty easy to do just be
mindful<00:05:37.820> those<00:05:38.210> tabs<00:05:38.480> don't<00:05:38.870> break<00:05:39.110> them<00:05:39.380> and

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
mindful those tabs don't break them and

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.910 
mindful those tabs don't break them and
you<00:05:40.850> add<00:05:41.090> a<00:05:41.120> nice<00:05:41.510> little<00:05:41.540> aesthetic<00:05:42.530> update

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
you add a nice little aesthetic update

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.340 
you add a nice little aesthetic update
to<00:05:43.070> your<00:05:43.190> car<00:05:43.420> okay<00:05:44.420> so<00:05:44.480> there<00:05:44.960> we<00:05:45.140> are

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
to your car okay so there we are

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.030 
to your car okay so there we are
halos<00:05:46.070> blazing<00:05:46.820> both<00:05:47.390> grilles<00:05:47.720> in<00:05:48.020> I<00:05:48.380> really

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
halos blazing both grilles in I really

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.160 
halos blazing both grilles in I really
do<00:05:49.190> think<00:05:49.400> it<00:05:49.610> adds<00:05:49.790> a<00:05:50.000> nice<00:05:50.150> little<00:05:50.480> bit<00:05:51.050> of

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
do think it adds a nice little bit of

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.690 
do think it adds a nice little bit of
something<00:05:51.560> to<00:05:51.590> the<00:05:51.920> front<00:05:52.160> of<00:05:52.220> the<00:05:52.280> car<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:52.610> if

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
something to the front of the car and if

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.510 
something to the front of the car and if
the<00:05:52.850> camera<00:05:53.210> will<00:05:53.330> focus<00:05:53.540> properly<00:05:54.250> but<00:05:55.250> it

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
the camera will focus properly but it

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.360 
the camera will focus properly but it
definitely<00:05:56.240> adds<00:05:56.450> a<00:05:56.630> more<00:05:56.810> clean<00:05:57.170> look<00:05:57.440> to<00:05:58.250> the

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
definitely adds a more clean look to the

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.670 
definitely adds a more clean look to the
car<00:05:58.580> again<00:05:59.420> this<00:05:59.600> is<00:05:59.810> really<00:06:00.320> not<00:06:00.500> that

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
car again this is really not that

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.770 
car again this is really not that
important<00:06:01.280> it's<00:06:01.400> purely<00:06:01.910> aesthetic<00:06:02.090> but<00:06:02.750> I

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
important it's purely aesthetic but I

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.810 
important it's purely aesthetic but I
really<00:06:03.620> like<00:06:03.770> the<00:06:03.890> way<00:06:03.980> it<00:06:04.100> looks<00:06:04.280> I<00:06:04.460> think<00:06:04.490> it

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
really like the way it looks I think it

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.570 
really like the way it looks I think it
is<00:06:05.030> much<00:06:05.300> more<00:06:05.570> up-to-date<00:06:06.050> than<00:06:06.500> the<00:06:07.190> old

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
is much more up-to-date than the old
