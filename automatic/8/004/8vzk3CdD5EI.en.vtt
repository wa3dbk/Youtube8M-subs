00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
like so now i'm going to try do the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
impossible and actually find your

impossible and actually find your
selection<00:01:02.280> which<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.730> pretty<00:01:03.660> difficult<00:01:03.989> but

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
selection which is pretty difficult but

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.800 
selection which is pretty difficult but
i<00:01:04.769> think<00:01:05.159> i<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.700> handle<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:10.189> hmm<00:01:11.240> now<00:01:12.240> i<00:01:12.270> really

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
i think i can handle it hmm now i really

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.570 
i think i can handle it hmm now i really
don't<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.200> your<00:01:13.560> selection<00:01:14.040> maybe<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.430> in

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
don't see your selection maybe it's in

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.380 
don't see your selection maybe it's in
the<00:01:14.760> bottom<00:01:15.689> half<00:01:17.810> has<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:19.560> not<00:01:19.710> my<00:01:19.890> day

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390

that's<00:01:21.390> actually<00:01:21.840> one<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.110> reasons<00:01:22.500> why<00:01:22.710> I

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
that's actually one of the reasons why I

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.120 
that's actually one of the reasons why I
set<00:01:23.130> these<00:01:23.720> aces<00:01:24.720> over<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.979> they

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
set these aces over here because they

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.969
