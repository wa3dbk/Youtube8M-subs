absolutely<00:02:42.720> which<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.770> problem<00:02:44.190> for<00:02:44.400> us<00:02:44.610> as

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
absolutely which is a problem for us as

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.270 
absolutely which is a problem for us as
dentists<00:02:45.330> because<00:02:45.870> some<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.740> know<00:02:46.830> there<00:02:47.250> is

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
dentists because some you know there is

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.450 
dentists because some you know there is
a<00:02:47.430> reason<00:02:47.880> why<00:02:48.030> they're<00:02:48.240> cheaper<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.460> the

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
a reason why they're cheaper and the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.880 
a reason why they're cheaper and the
problem<00:02:50.880> with<00:02:51.090> them<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.290> lot<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.560> them

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
problem with them is that a lot of them

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.790 
problem with them is that a lot of them
are<00:02:53.100> more<00:02:53.610> acidic<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:55.080> effect<00:02:55.230> what<00:02:55.560> they

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
are more acidic so in effect what they

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.680 
are more acidic so in effect what they
do<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.040> dissolve<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.700> enamel<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.210> your<00:02:57.270> teeth

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
do is dissolve the enamel of your teeth

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.020 
do is dissolve the enamel of your teeth
so<00:02:58.140> I've<00:02:58.230> had<00:02:58.410> patients<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:59.190> we've<00:02:59.670> had<00:02:59.820> to

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
so I've had patients that we've had to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.150 
so I've had patients that we've had to
kind<00:03:00.300> of<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.570> know<00:03:00.600> crown<00:03:00.990> every<00:03:01.320> single<00:03:01.710> cap

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
kind of you know crown every single cap

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.740 
kind of you know crown every single cap
every<00:03:02.520> single<00:03:02.820> tooth<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.270> their<00:03:03.540> mouth

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
every single tooth in their mouth

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.900 
every single tooth in their mouth
because<00:03:04.620> there's<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.100> much<00:03:05.250> damage<00:03:05.550> being

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
because there's so much damage being

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.630 
because there's so much damage being
done<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.570> can<00:03:06.720> also<00:03:06.810> burn<00:03:07.140> your<00:03:07.350> gums<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.130> that

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
not just not following the instructions

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.360 
not just not following the instructions
because<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.530> thought<00:03:10.709> all<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.100> was<00:03:11.220> just

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
because I thought all of this was just

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.100 
because I thought all of this was just
based<00:03:11.580> around<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.910> hydrogen<00:03:12.450> peroxide<00:03:12.720> gel

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
based around the hydrogen peroxide gel

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.130 
based around the hydrogen peroxide gel
yes<00:03:14.100> well<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.030> products<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.080> buy

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
yes well the the products that you buy

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.729 
yes well the the products that you buy
over<00:03:16.470> counter<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.950> much<00:03:17.370> weaker<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.930> what<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.290> lot

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
over counter a much weaker so what a lot

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.030 
over counter a much weaker so what a lot
of<00:03:19.860> manufacturers<00:03:20.370> do<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:21.209> they<00:03:21.600> add<00:03:21.930> acid<00:03:22.860> in

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
of manufacturers do is they add acid in

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.000 
of manufacturers do is they add acid in
there<00:03:23.520> basically<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:25.440> can<00:03:25.590> have<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.860> two

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
there basically so you can have the two

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.530 
there basically so you can have the two
extremes<00:03:26.370> from<00:03:26.610> where<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:27.060> doesn't<00:03:27.390> work

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
extremes from where it doesn't work

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.000 
extremes from where it doesn't work
because<00:03:27.870> there's<00:03:28.200> not<00:03:28.350> really<00:03:28.500> anything<00:03:28.770> in

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
because there's not really anything in

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.520 
because there's not really anything in
there<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.489> has<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.150> effect<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.410> other

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
there that has the effect to the other

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.920 
there that has the effect to the other
extreme<00:03:31.590> where<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.459> it's<00:03:32.700> quite<00:03:33.150> acidic<00:03:33.480> and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
extreme where that it's quite acidic and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.540 
extreme where that it's quite acidic and
so<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.350> dissolves<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.860> enamel<00:03:35.160> if<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.370> does

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
so it dissolves the enamel if it does

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.860 
so it dissolves the enamel if it does
anybody<00:03:35.880> really<00:03:36.030> need<00:03:36.300> to<00:03:36.420> get<00:03:36.540> their<00:03:36.720> teeth

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
anybody really need to get their teeth
