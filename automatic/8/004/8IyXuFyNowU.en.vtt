 hello everyone and welcome to football 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.250
 today we are going to talk about the galactic 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.529
 of Florentine of all years to 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.199
 for us it is still not galactic 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.039
 one has that level but for Florentine 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.350
 if we are talking about raheem sterling 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.720
 21-year-old player currently plays in 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.289
 the liverpool and that he has gotten 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.570
 florentine to be the galactic the 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:38.570
 bomb player who records every year 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.239
 because we say this first because 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.859
 sterling has refused to renew 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.109
 wants to renew with the free one because it is 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.670
 looking for an exit and in the seconds 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.859
 because Florentine just likes it 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.829
 attack players and that you know that 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:55.789
 they can sell shirts and I can 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.109
 give that economic level that you like to 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.789
 this president 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.859
 let's also talk about the 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.420
 characteristics of this player is a 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.699
 player who can play from end of 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.520

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.050

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.250
 he also has a great shot of the two 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.770
 things that stuff too and it's a 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.960
 player who loves to play with 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.210
 spaces is to say the spaces that 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.370
 they create behind the defense he moves 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.140
 like fish in water thing that also 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.840

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.740
