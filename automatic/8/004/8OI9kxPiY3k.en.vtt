00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
result of the engine package we

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.220 
result of the engine package we
redesigned<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.300> loader<00:00:37.540> arms<00:00:38.020> not<00:00:38.649> just<00:00:39.129> for

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
redesigned the loader arms not just for

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.720 
redesigned the loader arms not just for
accommodating<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.410> engine<00:00:41.739> but<00:00:42.370> also<00:00:42.550> to

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
accommodating the engine but also to

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.420 
accommodating the engine but also to
give<00:00:42.910> more<00:00:43.090> performance<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.649> with<00:00:45.129> the<00:00:45.219> lift

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
give more performance so with the lift

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.560 
give more performance so with the lift
arms<00:00:45.760> you're<00:00:45.879> going<00:00:45.910> to<00:00:46.030> get<00:00:46.180> more<00:00:46.390> lift

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
arms you're going to get more lift

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.930 
arms you're going to get more lift
capacity<00:00:47.140> more<00:00:47.590> breakout<00:00:48.010> force<00:00:48.309> and<00:00:48.640> a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
capacity more breakout force and a

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.020 
capacity more breakout force and a
higher<00:00:49.149> reach<00:00:50.190> another<00:00:51.190> thing<00:00:51.460> that's<00:00:51.850> a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
higher reach another thing that's a

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.420 
higher reach another thing that's a
benefit<00:00:52.420> from<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.750> redesign<00:00:53.230> is<00:00:53.500> this<00:00:54.100> panel

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
benefit from the redesign is this panel

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.240 
benefit from the redesign is this panel
here<00:00:54.730> instead<00:00:55.390> of<00:00:55.449> having<00:00:55.719> tools<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:57.129> remove

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
here instead of having tools to remove

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.069 
here instead of having tools to remove
to<00:00:57.579> get<00:00:57.670> into<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.940> engine<00:00:58.149> compartment<00:00:58.390> it's

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
to get into the engine compartment it's

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.340 
to get into the engine compartment it's
actually<00:00:59.559> just<00:01:00.160> a<00:01:00.340> self<00:01:00.699> guided<00:01:01.149> system<00:01:01.539> so

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
actually just a self guided system so

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.869 
actually just a self guided system so
you<00:01:02.859> don't<00:01:02.890> have<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.280> worry<00:01:03.430> about<00:01:03.519> having<00:01:03.760> a

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
you don't have to worry about having a

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.320 
you don't have to worry about having a
toolbox<00:01:04.239> or<00:01:04.449> by<00:01:04.600> in<00:01:05.019> order<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:05.320> get<00:01:05.440> inside

cap<00:02:50.530> has<00:02:51.010> changed<00:02:51.430> as<00:02:51.549> well<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:52.450> have<00:02:52.599> two

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
cap has changed as well you have two

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.629 
cap has changed as well you have two
bolts<00:02:53.169> that<00:02:53.439> are<00:02:53.650> forcing<00:02:53.889> back<00:02:54.159> which<00:02:54.519> is

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
bolts that are forcing back which is

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.319 
bolts that are forcing back which is
easier<00:02:54.939> for<00:02:55.030> service<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.760> biggest<00:02:58.060> change

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
easier for service the biggest change

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.270 
easier for service the biggest change
that<00:02:58.569> you'll<00:02:58.689> see<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.139> this<00:02:59.680> area<00:02:59.949> right<00:03:00.069> here

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
that you'll see is this area right here

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.729 
that you'll see is this area right here
it<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.090> basically<00:03:01.359> just<00:03:01.719> a<00:03:02.049> beefier<00:03:02.409> design

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
it is basically just a beefier design

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.500 
it is basically just a beefier design
and<00:03:03.040> it's<00:03:03.129> going<00:03:03.219> to<00:03:03.310> add<00:03:03.459> reliability<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.419> the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
and it's going to add reliability to the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.679 
and it's going to add reliability to the
machine<00:03:05.129> for<00:03:06.129> f-series<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:07.209> boom<00:03:07.419> and<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.659> e

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.589 
machine for f-series the boom and the e
stick<00:03:08.019> are<00:03:08.169> is<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.349> same<00:03:08.560> as<00:03:08.769> e<00:03:09.359> when<00:03:10.359> we<00:03:10.449> get

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
stick are is the same as e when we get

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.939 
stick are is the same as e when we get
back<00:03:10.719> here<00:03:10.930> we<00:03:11.109> can<00:03:11.230> talk<00:03:11.409> about<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.769> dual

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:11.949 
back here we can talk about the dual

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.429 
back here we can talk about the dual
lock<00:03:12.099> coupler<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.669> was<00:03:13.329> available<00:03:13.569> on<00:03:13.930> eseries

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
lock coupler it was available on eseries

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.550 
lock coupler it was available on eseries
the<00:03:15.340> benefits<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:15.909> the<00:03:16.000> dual<00:03:16.150> lock<00:03:16.389> is<00:03:16.659> that

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
the benefits of the dual lock is that

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.159 
the benefits of the dual lock is that
this<00:03:17.680> cam<00:03:17.980> here<00:03:18.340> automatically<00:03:19.120> locks<00:03:19.419> on<00:03:19.659> so

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
this cam here automatically locks on so

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.379 
this cam here automatically locks on so
once<00:03:20.409> you<00:03:20.530> lock<00:03:20.709> this<00:03:20.889> in<00:03:20.949> place<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:22.060> buckets

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
once you lock this in place the buckets

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.629 
once you lock this in place the buckets
not<00:03:22.569> going<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.810> move<00:03:23.290> around<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.919> wedge
