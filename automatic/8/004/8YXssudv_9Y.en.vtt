00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
it was just the tiny tear through the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.910 
it was just the tiny tear through the
112<00:02:30.270> francs<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:34.020> was<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.440> was<00:02:34.470> my<00:02:34.709> main

112 francs and it was it was my main

112 francs and it was it was my main
tele<00:02:35.250> through<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.300> I'm<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:36.660> like<00:02:36.690> that's

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
tele through that I'm just like that's

bigger<00:02:41.070> than<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.430> usually<00:02:41.610> do<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.209> because

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
bigger than I usually do just because

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.820 
bigger than I usually do just because
it's<00:02:42.630> got<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> lot<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.019> different<00:02:43.440> delay

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
it's got a lot of different delay

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.440 
it's got a lot of different delay
settings<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.459> stuff<00:02:44.580> like<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.970> but<00:02:45.180> usually

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
settings and stuff like that but usually

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.620 
settings and stuff like that but usually
I<00:02:45.900> mean<00:02:46.739> it's<00:02:47.130> got<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:47.970> channel<00:02:48.299> switcher

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
I mean it's got the channel switcher

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.170 
I mean it's got the channel switcher
that<00:02:48.810> switches<00:02:49.170> channels<00:02:49.500> off<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.739> dual<00:02:49.890> tear

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
that switches channels off the dual tear

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.280 
that switches channels off the dual tear
and

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
and

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.380 
and
a couple<00:02:53.280> delay<00:02:53.489> pedals<00:02:53.879> but<00:02:54.239> there's

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
a couple delay pedals but there's

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.940 
a couple delay pedals but there's
nothing<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.870> really<00:02:55.290> gets<00:02:55.439> in<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.620> way<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:55.769> a

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950
