00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
reason and I saw my sexuality as such a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.590 
reason and I saw my sexuality as such a
small<00:01:03.660> part<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.140> who<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.880> didn't

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
small part of who I was that I didn't

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.440 
small part of who I was that I didn't
feel<00:01:07.549> in<00:01:08.549> any<00:01:08.729> way<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.860> it<00:01:10.860> would<00:01:11.450> ever

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
feel in any way that it would ever

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.520 
feel in any way that it would ever
interfere<00:01:13.290> with<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.159> school<00:01:14.729> or<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:16.049> group

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
interfere with a school or with a group

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.960 
interfere with a school or with a group
of<00:01:16.950> people<00:01:18.740> like<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.890> knew<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.070> Christians

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
of people like I knew that Christians

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.510 
of people like I knew that Christians
didn't<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:21.600> approve<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:23.369> gay

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
didn't really approve of the gay

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.730 
didn't really approve of the gay
lifestyle<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.720> never<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.290> occurred

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
lifestyle but it never really occurred

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.530 
lifestyle but it never really occurred
to<00:01:25.799> me<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:27.180> would<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.930> sort<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
to me that it would be this sort of

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.070 
to me that it would be this sort of
I<00:01:29.950> guess<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.100> never<00:01:31.310> really<00:01:31.550> occurred<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.870> me

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
I guess it never really occurred to me

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.550 
I guess it never really occurred to me
that<00:01:33.110> I<00:01:33.470> would<00:01:33.940> come<00:01:34.940> against<00:01:35.450> as<00:01:35.960> much

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
that I would come against as much

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.700 
that I would come against as much
opposition<00:01:37.040> as<00:01:37.460> what<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.700> have<00:01:38.500> from<00:01:39.500> Chris

that I renowned for my faith the idea
that<00:05:52.510> it's<00:05:52.660> a<00:05:52.750> choice<00:05:54.240> that's<00:05:55.240> the<00:05:55.420> most

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
that it's a choice that's the most

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.200 
that it's a choice that's the most
difficult<00:05:56.890> thing<00:05:57.550> to<00:05:57.580> explain<00:05:57.970> to<00:05:58.480> somebody

difficult thing to explain to somebody

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:08.429 
difficult thing to explain to somebody
and<00:06:01.210> it's<00:06:01.420> nearly<00:06:01.630> impossible<00:06:01.810> to<00:06:03.090> convince

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:08.439 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:10.649 

I<00:06:08.469> found<00:06:09.459> it<00:06:09.580> nearly<00:06:09.759> impossible<00:06:09.909> to<00:06:10.360> convince

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
I found it nearly impossible to convince

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:14.820 
I found it nearly impossible to convince
Christians<00:06:11.639> and<00:06:12.639> many<00:06:13.300> others<00:06:13.749> that<00:06:14.139> it's

Christians and many others that it's

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.369 
Christians and many others that it's
like<00:06:16.709> that<00:06:17.709> it<00:06:17.830> wasn't<00:06:18.099> a<00:06:18.369> choice<00:06:19.139> for<00:06:20.139> me<00:06:20.289> to

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:20.379 
like that it wasn't a choice for me to

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:28.029 
like that it wasn't a choice for me to
