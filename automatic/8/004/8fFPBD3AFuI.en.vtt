00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.970
 and here I have a low center 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.210
 a very marked pressure on a level of 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.740
 pressure well below 1,000 hector 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.740
 then the formation of a cyclone 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.670
 extratropical and we are here in the day 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.039
 28 this morning is the simulation for the morning 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.769
 from February 28th 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.189
 What is the concern for the carnival? 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.850
 this cyclone because this cyclone goes 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.719
 leave there the sea is very rough then 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.370
 with expectation for the carnival to lala 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.190
 today so let's go 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.100
 on March 1st, look who just came 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.890
 pass the carnival with us a front 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.440
 with the extratropical cyclone and this 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.539
 cold front already on March 1 already 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.219
 will be advancing there along the coast of 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.160
 Paul arriving even to the river of 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.859
 January there is a worry about 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.770
 the beaches of São Paulo begin 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.359
 carnival under rain in and inclusive 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.260
 the region of creek of kings we will see 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.520
 how is one southern Brazil tá 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.159
 west central if holy spirit mines 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.439
 east coast looks northeast coast 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.470
 It 's raining but with the sun. 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.600
 appearing for much of the day 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.400
 being able to have some rain showers 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.040
 but that will not cause major problems 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.020
 the strong instability here between the 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.420
 amazonas acre and rondônia 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.640
 but the first day of the carnival Saturday to 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.280
 concern here is O coastline are 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.680
 paulo south coast of the river is here where 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.530
 I have death the chance to stay in heaven 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.020
 cloudy and rain, it's okay with 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.950
 my cold forehead during day 2 of 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.920
 March, right? 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.140
 the cold front goes away it moves 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.170
 to sea leaves a little 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.189
 instability but look already then from 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.890
 from day 2 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.329
 I'm not going to have a situation of 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.340
 too much instability 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.820
 you can not beat the rain 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.880
 is now only the great river of the south 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.399
 here could get rid of and there is a chance 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.770
 really really small but in 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.380
 practically all areas there of the 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.020
 southeast central north west and interior 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.670
 from the northeast I'm going to have rain showers 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.950
 one has the heat but 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.510
 particularly on March 2 here 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:28.620
 Is this the chance for us, for example? 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.960
 We have your night on the river, it 's big here. 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.440
 in sao paulo a chance to slam 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.190
 rain at night is relatively high 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.090
 still okay but not in the early hours of 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.070
 Monday 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.920
 okay there is a greater accumulation of 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.920
 instability're looking here at the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.740
 north of the river lakes region so day 2 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.290
 March second carnival day can 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.560
 be half locked in rio de janeiro 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.330
 Let's see, it's okay , March 3rd, I do not 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.860
 I have more so a cold front 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.260
 organized're 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.870
 the idea of ​​March 3 is that people 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.150
 rain showers in the afternoon and 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.430
 night in most parts of the country 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.040
 okay but with the sun appearing in large 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.470
 part of the day few rain again here 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.370
 in the great southern river even in santa 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.250
 Catherine 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.630
 tá has has little situation of rain and there 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.990
 We already have a parade, right ? 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.330
 Monday to Sunday to Monday 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.260
 Actually, I already have a parade on the river. 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.530
 of January 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.480
 just kick one will here to analyze 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.500
 A little something here is a little 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.650
 I forgot 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.690
 because this is a concern because of 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.880
 Sunday to Monday begin the 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.630
 parades of the river and then I can have 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.610
 problem 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.280
 on the first night of the Rio de 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.570
 january second night of river parades 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.209
 of January 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.150
 there is a chance of rain already decreasing enough 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.190
 This is not going to be too much of a problem 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.480
 It's generally the way I think we're going. 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.120
 have a carnival that will give 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.480
 enjoy but I've been talking about these 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.360
 last days and I will repeat the no do not go 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.850
 for the carnival, are you going to travel? 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.580
 not with that expectation of those she 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.459
 help that heat that he dry weather 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.560
 that we had until last week 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.049
 Forget that is the chance to have 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.880
 rainfall is relatively high 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.590
 in most of brazil 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.900
 but the rain shower that does not last 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.340
 All day then you have the sun. 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.199
 heat and those rain showers 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.590
 should happen especially in the afternoon 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.590
 and at night
