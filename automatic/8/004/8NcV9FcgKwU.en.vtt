00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.530 

because<00:00:31.900> the<00:00:32.050> future<00:00:32.259> we<00:00:33.160> know<00:00:33.370> that<00:00:33.579> that<00:00:34.090> our

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
because the future we know that that our

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.600 
because the future we know that that our
lives<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:35.350> the<00:00:35.440> world<00:00:35.649> is<00:00:35.890> changing<00:00:36.399> so

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
lives and the world is changing so

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.260 
lives and the world is changing so
rapidly

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
rapidly

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.250 
rapidly
so<00:00:37.540> I'm<00:00:37.719> predictable<00:00:38.850> some<00:00:39.850> of<00:00:39.969> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
so I'm predictable some of the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.060 
so I'm predictable some of the
developments<00:00:41.260> are<00:00:41.379> definitely<00:00:41.920> not

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
developments are definitely not

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:52.640 
developments are definitely not
confident

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.370 

it<00:00:53.650> is<00:00:53.800> uncertain<00:00:54.310> and<00:00:54.610> that<00:00:54.870> each<00:00:55.870> one<00:00:56.170> of<00:00:56.290> us

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
it is uncertain and that each one of us

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:04.829 
it is uncertain and that each one of us
has<00:00:56.650> some<00:00:56.920> roles<00:00:57.220> planets<00:01:03.330> you<00:01:04.330> know<00:01:04.360> that<00:01:04.690> is

has some roles planets you know that is

has some roles planets you know that is
futures<00:01:05.290> all<00:01:05.530> as<00:01:05.710> part<00:01:05.980> of<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.220> present

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.389 

the<00:01:10.820> question<00:01:11.240> of<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.540> future<00:01:12.049> or<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.070> center

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
the question of the future or the center

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.530 
the question of the future or the center
related<00:01:14.329> to<00:01:14.479> what's<00:01:14.750> going<00:01:15.470> on<00:01:15.649> now

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
related to what's going on now

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.690 
related to what's going on now
really<00:01:18.230> to<00:01:18.380> think<00:01:18.530> about<00:01:18.860> future<00:01:19.100> from<00:01:19.520> the

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
really to think about future from the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:31.900 
really to think about future from the
present<00:01:19.990> perspective

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.370 

and<00:01:32.910> artists<00:01:33.480> should<00:01:33.690> have<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> sense<00:01:34.230> of

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
and artists should have a sense of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.860 
and artists should have a sense of
future<00:01:34.620> ah<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.180> place<00:01:36.420> where<00:01:36.600> we're

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
future ah it's the place where we're

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.900 
future ah it's the place where we're
able<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.200> express<00:01:37.440> our<00:01:37.770> fears<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.820> desires

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
able to express our fears and desires

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.850 
able to express our fears and desires
and<00:01:39.510> our<00:01:39.630> hopes<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:41.250> art<00:01:41.400> should<00:01:42.090> not<00:01:42.470> find<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and our hopes the art should not find a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.550 
and our hopes the art should not find a
solution<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.850> our<00:01:44.910> that's<00:01:45.900> not<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.230> role<00:01:46.380> of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
solution for our that's not the role of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.250 
solution for our that's not the role of
the<00:01:46.740> artist<00:01:47.040> as<00:01:47.250> never<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.110> art

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
the artist as never get the art

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.510 
the artist as never get the art
and<00:01:49.590> ask<00:01:49.740> questions<00:01:50.660> nobody<00:01:51.660> without<00:01:52.220> art<00:01:53.220> has

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and ask questions nobody without art has

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.180 
and ask questions nobody without art has
the<00:01:53.670> capacity<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.330> channel<00:01:55.290> our<00:01:55.530> thoughts<00:01:55.830> and

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
the capacity to channel our thoughts and

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.760 
the capacity to channel our thoughts and
our<00:01:56.250> ideas<00:01:56.930> it<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.110> do<00:01:58.230> that<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.470> many<00:01:58.650> ways

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
our ideas it can do that in many ways

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.830 
our ideas it can do that in many ways
but<00:01:59.130> one<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.370> the<00:01:59.520> ways<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.730> it<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.120> do<00:02:00.330> is<00:02:00.600> to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
but one of the ways that it can do is to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.720 
but one of the ways that it can do is to
which<00:02:01.080> is<00:02:01.230> I<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.590> really<00:02:02.010> valuable<00:02:02.040> in

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
which is I think is really valuable in

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.310 
which is I think is really valuable in
the<00:02:02.880> way<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.390> make<00:02:03.510> a<00:02:03.630> visual<00:02:03.840> poetry

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
the way that it can make a visual poetry

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.280 
the way that it can make a visual poetry
and<00:02:04.740> allow<00:02:05.340> us<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.940> see<00:02:06.450> forwards<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.110> allow

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and allow us to see forwards and allow

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.530 
and allow us to see forwards and allow
us<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.470> think<00:02:07.650> about<00:02:08.220> where<00:02:08.910> we're<00:02:09.090> going<00:02:09.270> and

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
us to think about where we're going and

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.639 
us to think about where we're going and
where<00:02:09.720> we're<00:02:09.899> starting<00:02:10.140> from

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
where we're starting from

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.430 
where we're starting from
I<00:02:10.950> think<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.490> is<00:02:11.640> artists<00:02:12.420> who<00:02:12.630> open<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.260> view

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
I think it is artists who open a view

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.250 
I think it is artists who open a view
onto<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.190> future<00:02:14.460> by<00:02:15.090> exercising<00:02:15.720> what<00:02:16.230> I

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
onto the future by exercising what I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.890 
onto the future by exercising what I
call<00:02:16.650> radical<00:02:16.890> imagination<00:02:17.850> but<00:02:18.120> artists<00:02:18.690> are

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
call radical imagination but artists are

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.470 
call radical imagination but artists are
capable<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.650> catching<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.760> moments<00:02:21.360> of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
capable of catching the moments of

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.990 
capable of catching the moments of
formulating<00:02:22.200> themselves<00:02:22.890> beyond<00:02:23.760> language

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
formulating themselves beyond language

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.420 
formulating themselves beyond language
in<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.510> way<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.320> think<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.710> will<00:02:25.950> help<00:02:26.160> us

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
in a way and I think that will help us

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.270 
in a way and I think that will help us
give<00:02:26.700> us<00:02:26.820> some<00:02:27.000> guidance<00:02:27.450> for<00:02:27.660> infusion<00:02:28.280> fully

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
give us some guidance for infusion fully

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.390 
give us some guidance for infusion fully
because<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.180> earliest

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.030 

art<00:02:36.030> art<00:02:37.019> as<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:38.329> spiritual<00:02:40.340> part<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.629> life<00:02:42.629> and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
art art as a spiritual part of life and

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.809 
art art as a spiritual part of life and
maybe<00:02:44.040> afterlife<00:02:44.909> free<00:02:45.599> life<00:02:46.459> art<00:02:47.459> has<00:02:47.790> a

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
maybe afterlife free life art has a

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.979 
maybe afterlife free life art has a
practical<00:02:48.659> way<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.189> hold<00:02:50.209> information<00:02:51.209> for

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
practical way to hold information for

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.640 
practical way to hold information for
future<00:02:52.140> generations<00:02:53.010> putting<00:02:53.819> information

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
future generations putting information

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:07.520 
future generations putting information
time<00:03:04.220> me<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.370> future<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.939> I<00:03:06.329> mean<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.959> think

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
time me the future is I mean I I think

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:19.550 
time me the future is I mean I I think
it's<00:03:07.650> quite<00:03:07.859> right<00:03:17.389> the<00:03:18.389> idea<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.019> future

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
it's quite right the idea of the future

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.129 
it's quite right the idea of the future
as<00:03:19.920> something<00:03:20.909> that<00:03:20.939> is<00:03:21.150> not<00:03:21.329> possible<00:03:21.599> only

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
as something that is not possible only

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.710 
as something that is not possible only
happens<00:03:22.769> when<00:03:22.980> one<00:03:23.519> cannot<00:03:23.819> see<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> horizon

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
happens when one cannot see a horizon

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.990 
happens when one cannot see a horizon
and<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.859> horizon<00:03:26.010> has<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.639> do<00:03:26.760> with<00:03:26.879> the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
and the horizon has to do with the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.819 
and the horizon has to do with the
possibility<00:03:27.659> as<00:03:28.019> long<00:03:28.349> as<00:03:28.530> there<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.799> a

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
possibility as long as there is a

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.619 
possibility as long as there is a
horizon<00:03:29.459> where<00:03:29.700> one<00:03:29.939> can<00:03:30.150> imagine<00:03:30.510> the

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
horizon where one can imagine the

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.720 
horizon where one can imagine the
possibility<00:03:30.750> then<00:03:31.500> one<00:03:31.799> can<00:03:32.010> envision<00:03:32.310> and

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
possibility then one can envision and

possibility then one can envision and
visit<00:03:33.060> whatever<00:03:33.420> future<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:34.170> think<00:03:34.439> there<00:03:34.799> is

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
visit whatever future I think there is

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.789 
visit whatever future I think there is
that<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.459> uncertainty<00:03:36.260> is<00:03:37.260> not<00:03:37.319> a

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
that that uncertainty is not a

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.259 
that that uncertainty is not a
disturbing<00:03:38.670> quality<00:03:40.160> it's<00:03:41.160> an<00:03:41.310> open<00:03:41.760> quality

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
disturbing quality it's an open quality

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.979 
disturbing quality it's an open quality
means<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:43.139> we<00:03:43.530> can<00:03:43.799> make<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.699> future<00:03:45.120> it's

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
means that we can make the future it's

00:03:45.989 --> 00:04:08.490 
means that we can make the future it's
up<00:03:46.169> to<00:03:46.319> us<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.470> make<00:03:46.650> up

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.270 

you

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.400 

future<00:04:16.280> interface<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.420> think<00:04:17.750> it's<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:18.019> very

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
future interface I think it's a very

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.280 
future interface I think it's a very
hygienic<00:04:19.299> futuristic<00:04:20.299> vision<00:04:20.810> which<00:04:21.049> does

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
hygienic futuristic vision which does

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.800 
hygienic futuristic vision which does
try<00:04:21.890> to<00:04:21.950> translate<00:04:22.430> into<00:04:22.730> a<00:04:22.910> film<00:04:23.240> it's<00:04:23.510> it's

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
try to translate into a film it's it's

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.110 
try to translate into a film it's it's
also<00:04:24.020> scary<00:04:24.200> now<00:04:24.710> in<00:04:24.920> a<00:04:24.980> way<00:04:25.130> it's<00:04:25.400> suicide<00:04:25.850> and

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
also scary now in a way it's suicide and

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.560 
also scary now in a way it's suicide and
