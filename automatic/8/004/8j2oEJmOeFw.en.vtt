00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.240
 thrust of the upper block friend moderately 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.670
 wide grip on one of the main 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.650
 exercise at any level then bumps 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.470
 i.e. this is a common exercise 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:22.560
 she is comfortable she is comfortable and at the same 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.699
 time she works great 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.930
 latissimus dorsi irreplaceable 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.480
 option for those people who can not 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.210
 pull up with your own weight here 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.630
 there are a few rules first tenable not 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.489
 should be too wide there 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.219
 strange we are confusing about what than 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.920
 wider grip in traction the wider the back will be 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.460
 actually quite the opposite than 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.230
 wider grip 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.420
 the longer will be developed muscles 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.520
 because they watch the movement very much 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.430
 shortens and goes negative 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.620
 impact on Christmas time and muscles rotate 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.140
 shoulders so i highly recommend 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.600
 hyper wide reach and traction that 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.510
 chest that head grabbing should be 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.479
 moderately broad it's about a couple 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.920
 palm wider shoulders and note that 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.860
 pull you need not even chest 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.780
 we are clavicle as shown in the video then 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.560
 there you reduce scapula clicks 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.250
 bend 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.830
 and hold the handle to the base of the neck on 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.880
 level to include not on the chest not on the belly 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.960
 collarbone 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.479
 it is very important as soon as you mentally 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.100
 imagine that you are exactly 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.549
 turn on and make sure that 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.650
 to glance 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.409
 base of the ears to your collarbone 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.880
 automatically going more powerful 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.890
 contraction of the broadest muscles of the back and 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.509
 aligns the position of the elbows it is very 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.920
 important since most people when 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.630
 they try to tighten up to the chest or else 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.299
 below the elbow years ago 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.700
 this is a critical error here 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.390
 case we relieve the broadest load 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.700
 translating her 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.490
 partially chest and on biceps therefore 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.990
 once again from fully stretched 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.729
 provisions we reduce the shoulder blades 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.710
 just bend and pull it 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.710
 turns on looks bad while down 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.080
 with
