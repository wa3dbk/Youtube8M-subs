00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
objective that being said because that's

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.970 
objective that being said because that's
where<00:00:54.600> they<00:00:54.660> put<00:00:54.780> everyone<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.110> spawn<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
that's what makes it small though the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.569 
that's what makes it small though the
map<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.989> big<00:00:58.350> you're<00:00:58.620> still<00:00:58.829> able<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.160> play<00:00:59.370> in

those<00:00:59.730> small<00:01:00.000> areas<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:00.930> that's<00:01:01.170> where

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
those small areas because that's where

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.520 
those small areas because that's where
everything<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.859> happening<00:01:02.190> now<00:01:03.229> it<00:01:04.229> gets<00:01:04.409> even

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
a lmg hiding in a bush are hiding there

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.719 
a lmg hiding in a bush are hiding there
in<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> place<00:01:52.770> where<00:01:52.979> they're<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.310> supposed<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
in a place where they're not supposed to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.850 
in a place where they're not supposed to
be<00:01:53.990> unless<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.200> course<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.500> know<00:01:55.619> they're

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
be unless of course you know they're

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.740 
be unless of course you know they're
defending<00:01:56.189> their<00:01:56.399> objective<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.090> they're

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
defending their objective and they're

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.410 
defending their objective and they're
stopping<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.860> opposing<00:01:59.280> team<00:01:59.460> from<00:01:59.969> getting

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
stopping the opposing team from getting

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.850 
stopping the opposing team from getting
to<00:02:00.540> where<00:02:00.659> they<00:02:00.750> need<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.200> think<00:02:01.439> that's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
to where they need to be I think that's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.670 
to where they need to be I think that's
probably<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.820> right<00:02:03.000> way<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.680> describe

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
probably the right way to describe

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.550 
probably the right way to describe
someone<00:02:05.219> defending<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.090> that's<00:02:06.930> basically

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
someone defending and that's basically

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.619 
someone defending and that's basically
what<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.890> did<00:02:07.979> here<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.910> was<00:02:09.030> also<00:02:09.149> moving
