 I feel is that they almost revive me from the scare 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.840

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.600
 there are creatures living in the catacombs 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.790
 of monster high and using my power 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.050

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:54.310

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.189
 help him do not have to worry about 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.060
 that reveals his secret because I'm not going to 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:38.020
 stay in monster high 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.689
 I'm too shy to make friends 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.229
 but they are animals I'm more comfortable with 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.229

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.260
 shyness channel school another opportunity 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.760

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.760

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.260
 and that's thanks to my animal friends 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.050
 I feel like I'm starting to make friends with 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.830

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.830
