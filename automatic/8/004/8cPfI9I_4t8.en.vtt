00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.050
 presented by macuto stores 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:14.679
 hello I am Mayan and you see today the welcome 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:14.679
 to maya landscape in outline 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.360
 the perfect Indian is almost impossible to 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.340
 achieve there is nothing perfect life 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.380
 we are asymmetrical one eyebrow other than the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.090
 another a different way the one eye 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.340
 different from the other meets before trans 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.290
 many challenges or clear challenges the eye 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.230
 Human do not notice it so easily 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:38.930
 people see it like that 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:40.700
 so both delineated are exact is 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.350
 a great odyssey because we can not 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.210
 make them perfectly equal 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.040
 because we are not a weird doll all 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.140
 meters but if we can achieve that they look 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.879
 quite similar may you know 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.010
 delineated esplanade of the king that by 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.239
 true he looks like dedicated to them 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.870
 is already available in the channel 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.820
 Youtube 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.320
 and do not forget to participate in the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.949
 trivia for you to take a software 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.960
 virgin and now I will give you a little trick to 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.460
 make an easy and fast drawing up 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.790
 the one who does not know anything about makeup is going to 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.369
 achieve 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.170
 for this you will need a piece of 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.300
 liquid eyeliner a pencil eyeliner 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.190
 First locate the adhesive tape as if 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.720
 you were extending the line of your 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.640
 lower eyelid following the same 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.500
 inclination that leads as if you had 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.390
 even the cic does not turn on a mirror and 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.100
 try to do the same with the other eye 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.600
 the ideal is to do it in front of a mirror 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.700
 big where you can see your face 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.619
 complete now begins to draw a 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.420
 line attached to the tabs uses the 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.039
 pencil to draw a guide lines the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.780
 lattice is good for this because it's more 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.460
 easy to erase if you make mistakes when 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.140
 feel safer going over lines 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.030
 guides with liquid liner not 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.890
 forget to always check in front of 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.930
 the height of both granites so that 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.970
 be as close as possible leave it 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.600
 Dry and remove the adhesive carefully and 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.360
 ready 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.040
