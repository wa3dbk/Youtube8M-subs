00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.170
 hey i'm hannes to read net and we 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.660
 have here the sony reader prs t3 in the 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.429
 Cover with the he delivered together 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.379
 becomes 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.450
 I'll open up, we'll see that one 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.740
 sleep cover that means I shut that up 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.349
 cover and the reader-making on 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.599
 the optics are not dissimilar to the psg two 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.820
 will be down here again a few keys 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.490
 So five pieces to go back before 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.060
 the home button 1 back button and a 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.770
 menu button 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.140
 The device is much smaller 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.579
 become with with one puts a kindle paper 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.969
 Far above it is the other way around 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.399
 there we see that the telepresence t3 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:51.199
 So here is very compact 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.579
 relatively narrow wrinkles on pretty 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.420
 So it is easy with the cover 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.699
 away the 200 grams without cover 160 grams 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.600
 and kilo ready is also a few grams 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.399
 severe 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.880
 even if difference is manageable 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:09.229
 I do it once correctly 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.000
 So user interface naturally 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.979
 relatively little about it relatively little 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.640
 done go in biburg 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:20.110
 who now has a hd display 1024 x 768 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.790
 pixel so no 800 x 600 pixels more 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.479
 can also turn the page or 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.040
 naturally on the buttons below 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.840
 the leaves speed with sony 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.790
 or when indexing the scroll 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.520
 to have made progress 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.250
 it is not that permanent here anymore 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.960
 so invested is this touchscreen 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.630
 the ghosting what you get from reading devices 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.759
 knows sony had to give his own information 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.579
 Optimized in that they barely 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:50.450
 invest more big effects 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.189
 take place what is known to each other 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.840
 and the text editing options so 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.850
 you can create notes 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.380
 you can by handwriting 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.759
 adjustments make the font change 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:09.319
 and something new I go to one 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:11.720
 textstelle and below already the 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.130
 So you enter the net of knowledge 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.140
 German German dictionary by 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.510
 Dudenverlag over 100,000 terms there are 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.970
 here and yes in the principle of the duden lexicon 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.680
 now also on the sony reader a very 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.680
 good offer what in any case 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.269
 is relatively unique but what 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.580
 Here you have to say with current 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.720
 zone of every generation is that there is no 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.290
 Lighting is not integrated 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.930
 Display lighting as we see it behind 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.310
 so have the leds down here 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.300
 the villas are integrated in the sony 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.250
 reader, there is a cover a 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.900

 Illuminate the devices you draw from it 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.850

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.299
 have since, however, is back with a 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.400
 to do indirect lighting yes one 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:56.630
 Unfortunately, lighting is in this case 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:00.380
 not integrated with sony sony 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:03.769
