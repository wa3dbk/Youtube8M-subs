00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
this team why I think that you should

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.949 
this team why I think that you should
expect<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:41.190> great<00:03:41.790> product<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.360> be<00:03:42.540> put<00:03:42.780> on<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
expect a great product to be put on the

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.900 
expect a great product to be put on the
field<00:03:43.319> now<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.890> course<00:03:44.010> it's<00:03:44.489> going<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.760> be<00:03:44.819> our

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
field now of course it's going to be our

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.289 
field now of course it's going to be our
first<00:03:45.180> game<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:46.519> Georgia<00:03:47.519> Southern<00:03:48.000> has

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
first game and Georgia Southern has

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.530 
first game and Georgia Southern has
played<00:03:48.599> together<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.319> be<00:03:49.739> my<00:03:49.890> first<00:03:50.190> time

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
played together and be my first time

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.240 
played together and be my first time
some<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.750> leadership<00:03:52.290> on<00:03:52.859> this<00:03:53.010> program

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
some of the leadership on this program

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.039 
some of the leadership on this program
but<00:03:53.609> I<00:03:53.700> think<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.209> what<00:03:54.359> you<00:03:54.480> can<00:03:54.660> see<00:03:54.870> and

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
but I think that what you can see and

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.840 
but I think that what you can see and
you<00:03:55.530> should<00:03:55.709> expect<00:03:55.980> in<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.280> future<00:03:56.340> and

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
you should expect in the future and

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.060 
you should expect in the future and
hopefully<00:03:57.060> question<00:03:58.019> each<00:03:58.109> quarter<00:03:58.590> goes<00:03:58.769> by

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
hopefully question each quarter goes by

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.280 
hopefully question each quarter goes by
is<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.459> we<00:03:59.760> build<00:04:00.090> that's<00:04:00.989> what<00:04:01.170> we're

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
is that we build that's what we're

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.590 
is that we build that's what we're

motivation okay you know I knew I

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.150 
motivation okay you know I knew I
I've<00:04:29.500> heard<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:29.920> used<00:04:30.160> before<00:04:30.520> but<00:04:31.120> when<00:04:31.750> you

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
I've heard it used before but when you

the<00:04:37.330> history<00:04:37.720> I<00:04:38.020> think<00:04:38.620> that's<00:04:39.040> motivation

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
the history I think that's motivation

the history I think that's motivation
enough<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.300> i<00:04:40.480> think<00:04:41.020> that<00:04:41.260> i<00:04:41.500> know<00:04:41.920> this

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160
