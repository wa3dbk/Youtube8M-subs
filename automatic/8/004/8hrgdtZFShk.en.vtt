00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.690
 i 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.540
 and up to here the fast pixel art 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:39.519
 I have left well enough is enough 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:41.479
 well do not use as many colors as 

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:45.499
 I thought you will use when I saw the 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.869
 image then it shows up close as I said 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:50.689
 from the first pixel closely 

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:53.360
 a milestone that you shit 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:55.760
 far from the changes quite as I said 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.880
 does not use many colors 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.650
 I have used the sand of the new biome 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:07.210
 of the canyon plan dark blue blue clarito 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.210
 black orange red 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.419
 here is the same 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.100
 the color of the body of the mushroom 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.770
 giant 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.370
 the body not of what is being 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.500
 the red of the zeta 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.419
 that I've always liked like 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.240
 Leo's skin color is quite noticeable 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.310
 well and you do not see these points that are 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.080
 between half beige 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.550
 the solution also give an effect of 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.550
 shade to the skin that I like a lot 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.780
 the green white and little more of the color 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.400
 yellow the gold and the white that was 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.340
 thinking instead of using white 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.980
 use him 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.320
 the sand as a yellow color more 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.770
 pale but but it did not convince me of 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.550
 everything done in a part of the video what 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.550
 I tried but I did not 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:06.390
 he did not come to me, he did not tell me to start from 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.639
 the white because already in the 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:12.120
 third transformation 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.050
 hair shines brightly shining effect 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.860
 the strength of 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:20.639
 of the power 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.990
 and leave it white as if it were 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:26.270
 shining and from afar 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.849
 it shows pretty well what I want 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.479
 tell 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:30.479
 you see 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.539
 the effect of brightness is very cool and 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:38.780
 shades of the hair below also not 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:41.330
 It has a lot of shine because I also 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.759
 I used a few colors and there was more 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.939
 there was more shadow for the face according to the 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.939
 image 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:51.680
 but the usual I do not have enough 

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:55.050
 colors to put orange here 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:59.159
 this color there on the face there 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.810
 I was not convinced so I left 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:03.670
 leave it like this and put the shadow darker 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.680
 what is the soul sun 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:08.560
 the lightest shines of white and 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.669
 result station 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:15.850
 very much the truth very cool I like and 

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:19.389
 well up here the pixel fa from 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:23.970
 today soon for more I like to do the 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:23.970
 pixel art and see you in the next
