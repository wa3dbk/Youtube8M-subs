hi I'm windaq half and here another
video<00:00:08.420> space<00:00:09.919> specifically<00:00:10.919> aimed<00:00:11.249> at

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:12.209 
video space specifically aimed at

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.289 
video space specifically aimed at
beginning<00:00:12.959> harmonica<00:00:13.589> plays<00:00:13.830> but<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.459> am<00:00:14.789> sure

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
beginning harmonica plays but I am sure

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.400 
beginning harmonica plays but I am sure
that<00:00:15.740> that<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.900> exercises<00:00:18.900> step<00:00:19.170> in

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
that that the the exercises step in

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.130 
that that the the exercises step in
another<00:00:20.280> video<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.670> will<00:00:20.910> come<00:00:21.240> up<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:21.660> are

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
another video I will come up with are

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.120 
another video I will come up with are
great<00:00:22.590> also<00:00:22.950> for<00:00:23.240> intermediate<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.450> some

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
great also for intermediate and some

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.730 
great also for intermediate and some
advanced<00:00:26.130> players<00:00:26.490> as<00:00:26.760> well<00:00:27.320> well<00:00:28.320> let's

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
advanced players as well well let's

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.060 
advanced players as well well let's
first<00:00:29.670> have<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.030> thought<00:00:30.540> about<00:00:30.650> how<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> play

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
first have a thought about how to play

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.630 
first have a thought about how to play
harmonica<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.780> think<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.739> breaking

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
harmonica I like to think in breaking

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.630 
harmonica I like to think in breaking
down<00:00:36.499> playing<00:00:37.499> harmonica<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:38.219> two<00:00:38.370> very

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
down playing harmonica in two very

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.500 
down playing harmonica in two very
simple<00:00:39.170> basic<00:00:40.170> building<00:00:40.379> blocks<00:00:40.850> those<00:00:41.850> parts

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
simple basic building blocks those parts

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.009 
simple basic building blocks those parts
we<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:43.039> we<00:00:44.039> can<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.699> exercises<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.749> a<00:00:45.780> daily

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
we can we can do exercises on a daily

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.569 
we can we can do exercises on a daily
basis<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:47.190> instance<00:00:47.609> to<00:00:48.269> really<00:00:49.579> gain

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
basis for instance to really gain

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.479 
basis for instance to really gain
control<00:00:51.179> of<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.569> instrument<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.190> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
control of the instrument so as a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.669 
control of the instrument so as a
harmonica<00:00:54.059> player<00:00:54.269> I<00:00:54.479> think<00:00:54.870> there<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.229> three

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
harmonica player I think there are three

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.430 
harmonica player I think there are three
basic<00:00:56.120> movements<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.359> you<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.229> learn

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
basic movements that you have to learn

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.460 
basic movements that you have to learn
to<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.819> control<00:01:00.920> those<00:01:01.920> three<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:03.470> moving

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
to be in control those three are moving

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.859 
to be in control those three are moving
the<00:01:04.800> instrument<00:01:05.280> horizontally<00:01:06.000> from<00:01:06.509> left<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the instrument horizontally from left to

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.600 
the instrument horizontally from left to
right<00:01:11.000> like<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:13.079> press<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.920> slide<00:01:14.340> in

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
right like that then press the slide in

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.779 
right like that then press the slide in
and<00:01:14.729> out<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:18.020> that<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:20.100> third<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.579> is

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
and out like that and the third one is

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:27.910 
and out like that and the third one is
breath<00:01:21.390> movements<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.409> inhale<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.490> exhale

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.670 

like<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.329> so<00:01:30.329> those<00:01:30.630> are<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.960> three<00:01:31.049> basic

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
like that so those are the three basic

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.279 
like that so those are the three basic
movements<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.759> has<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> harmonica<00:01:33.810> player<00:01:33.990> we

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
movements that has a harmonica player we

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.249 
movements that has a harmonica player we
have<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.399> able<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.880> really<00:01:36.479> control<00:01:36.960> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
have to be able to really control in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.959 
have to be able to really control in
detail<00:01:38.090> again<00:01:39.090> horizontal<00:01:39.869> movement<00:01:40.969> slight

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
detail again horizontal movement slight

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.499 
detail again horizontal movement slight
movement<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.920> breath<00:01:43.920> movement<00:01:44.429> so<00:01:45.329> in

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
movement and breath movement so in

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.550 
movement and breath movement so in
separate<00:01:46.049> videos<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.829> will<00:01:47.070> show<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.579> how<00:01:48.560> to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
separate videos I will show you how to

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.279 
separate videos I will show you how to
get<00:01:49.859> control<00:01:50.369> over<00:01:50.579> these<00:01:50.969> aspects<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.750> what

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
get control over these aspects and what

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.910 
get control over these aspects and what
kind<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.619> exercises<00:01:53.270> I<00:01:54.270> suggest<00:01:55.229> for<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.799> to

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
do to become really in control with

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:00.490 
do to become really in control with
those<00:01:59.820> movements

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
those movements

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.600 
those movements
hope<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:01.010> see<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.280> in<00:02:01.400> another<00:02:01.520> video<00:02:01.790> so
