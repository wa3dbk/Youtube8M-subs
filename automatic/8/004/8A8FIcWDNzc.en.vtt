00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.420
 hello girls today I come with a review 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:20.970
 buy yourself this is worth then I tell you 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:25.769
 that I bought 12 neil art well worth 12 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:30.840
 nail art glazes is worth then 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:34.800
 I bought them on the web light in the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.650
 box and they have come to me in a clear little bag 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.100
 and all glazes vertices a music 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.100
 of plastic look these are my enamels 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.220
 12 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.579
 and there really is nothing special about it 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.440
 What happened is that I wanted to buy some 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.480
 equipment were a little better than 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.579
 the ones that I had from the Chinese here 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.820
 well yes it 's true that grandma 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.920
 in the box is a Chinese website but 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.259
 I have read quite good opinion of these 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.090
 enamels mari discount looked at 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.680
 colors there are the basics the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.960
 white and black that are among the most 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.070
 I'm going to use I think are usually the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.420
 which are most used in decorations 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.399
 at least I 'm worth then we have a 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.399
 yellow and orange neon pretty 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:27.560
 singles I like pretty much 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:31.649
 the typical green and blue and a red 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:36.899
 Ok then I have dark pink and pink 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:40.050
 claritos and then with glitter with 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.240
 shine there are three silver and gold and 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.509
 a roll too cute with that is 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.119
 fixing the brand in am the art 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.890
 and well I will transposes that typically 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.229
 you have to keep them clean outside the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.690
 fire and that they want to move the goods 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.880
 continue to shake them before using them to 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.549
 Do not leave too much water 2 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.039
 then I will find you how is each 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.990
 one for example look at the black that I eat 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.269
 I say is the most commonly used are 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.450
 tooway means there are two parts 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.790
 to use them one is typical of the 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.760
 thread 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.890
 As you can see, the screw is removed with its 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.350
 paint brush 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.410
 and the other one is 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.480
 court is worth you to be able to paint more 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.850
 it easily catches my attention because 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.240
 I've seen good I was on ebay 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.040
 looking pretty and I saw them with the 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.750
 hood of this and I was funny I wanted to 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.490
 that was just a plug 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.320
 But look, it's the little needle so I do not know 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.900
 dry that they constantly carry a 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.820
 Once you are finished using it you put it on and 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.650
 good if you avoid obstructing 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.720
 output is worth 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.000
 Well nothing like I say look here I have 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.670
 an example of a tip of a natural for 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.250
 that you see how they were used simply 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.819
 we must rely on the nail we press 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.819
 a little 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.940
 and they can be done 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.850
 or dots 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.010
 OK 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.820
 you can not make drawings for example 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.820
 is trying to do 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.130
 you see 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.130
 a petal of a flower 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:32.510
 and then the part d 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.480
 of the brush 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.849
 Well, I've used them a little but well 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.349
 I liked it a lot at the moment 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.459
 moment does not give me the feeling that I 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:45.530
 give those who buy the Chinese that 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.270
 when you receive them you say my mother what 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.319
 I bought 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.420
 well 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.870
 I'm enjoying this at the moment 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.430
 that's why I'm worth it and here if 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.349
 we try for example the brush of 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.490
 energy prove an acquaintance that you see in 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.270
 red for example 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.270
 my mother 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.090
 has a pretty exquisite brush that 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.590
 some are very thin this is not bad 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.180
 look ok and then nothing is easy to use and 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.220
 pretty brand here it does not look very good 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.100
 true with the tip because you already know that 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.810
 the guy sometimes slips a little but 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.950
 well I am happy for the moment 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.380
 they 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.530
 so nothing girls because what they 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.970
 I wanted to tell you that I will make many designs 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:35.540
 with my new glazes and nothing that 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.249
 I hope you are here to see them worth 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.469
 so 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:43.439

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:46.759

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:46.759
