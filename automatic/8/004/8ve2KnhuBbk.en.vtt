that I if I click it the note would open
up<00:01:42.060> right<00:01:43.060> so<00:01:43.299> that's<00:01:43.569> that<00:01:44.409> can<00:01:44.710> be<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:44.920> useful

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
up right so that's that can be a useful

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.239 
up right so that's that can be a useful
feature<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.149> then<00:01:46.569> here<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.170> know<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:48.009> menu

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
feature and then here you know the menu

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:51.200 
feature and then here you know the menu
bar<00:01:48.520> brings<00:01:49.479> up<00:01:49.719> these<00:01:49.899> different<00:01:50.439> options<00:01:50.829> I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
bar brings up these different options I

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.029 
bar brings up these different options I
think<00:01:52.210> pressing<00:01:52.840> this<00:01:52.990> would<00:01:53.409> take<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:53.859> back

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
think pressing this would take you back

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.760 
think pressing this would take you back
meaning<00:01:54.549> it<00:01:54.700> would<00:01:55.200> take<00:01:56.200> me<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.560> homepage

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:01.389 
let's see if that's correct yeah it

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:03.779 
let's see if that's correct yeah it
takes<00:02:02.170> me<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.499> the<00:02:02.619> homepage<00:02:03.039> because<00:02:03.549> that's

opens up this menu bar and then as I
said<00:02:16.360> earlier<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.720> know<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.930> could<00:02:17.170> change

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
said earlier you know you could change

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.780 
said earlier you know you could change
the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.929 
the
font<00:02:20.209> style<00:02:20.510> etc<00:02:20.629> or<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:22.610> could<00:02:22.790> also

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
font style etc or you could also

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.300 
font style etc or you could also
straight<00:02:23.450> away<00:02:23.659> you<00:02:23.930> know<00:02:24.049> whatever<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.950> let's

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
straight away you know whatever to let's

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.259 
straight away you know whatever to let's
say<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:25.549> want<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.849> go<00:02:25.969> to<00:02:26.409> the<00:02:27.640> cover<00:02:28.640> page<00:02:28.909> and

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
say you want to go to the cover page and

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:37.899 
say you want to go to the cover page and
you<00:02:29.450> would<00:02:29.659> go<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:30.609> cover<00:02:33.400> right<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:36.909> guess

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
you would go to cover right and I guess

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.059 
you would go to cover right and I guess
with<00:02:38.150> certain<00:02:38.569> books<00:02:38.780> not<00:02:39.049> all<00:02:39.319> features<00:02:39.680> are

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
with certain books not all features are

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.610 
with certain books not all features are
available<00:02:40.629> for<00:02:41.629> example<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:44.260> what<00:02:45.260> happens<00:02:45.500> if

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
available for example so what happens if

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.399 
available for example so what happens if
i<00:02:45.739> should<00:02:46.430> go<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.819> same<00:02:47.000> place<00:02:47.150> right<00:02:47.629> so

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
i should go to the same place right so

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.140 
i should go to the same place right so
if<00:02:48.590> i<00:02:49.840> open<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:51.109> and<00:02:51.579> you<00:02:52.579> would<00:02:52.730> see<00:02:52.939> that

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
if i open it and you would see that

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.890 
if i open it and you would see that
table<00:02:53.629> of<00:02:53.720> contents<00:02:54.319> is<00:02:54.409> not<00:02:54.769> selected<00:02:55.069> here

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
table of contents is not selected here

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.530 
table of contents is not selected here
