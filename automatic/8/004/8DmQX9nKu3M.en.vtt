mention something there is a ton of

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.670 
mention something there is a ton of
floaty<00:02:41.030> stuff<00:02:41.480> in<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.110> it's<00:02:42.260> not<00:02:42.440> like

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
floaty stuff in this and it's not like

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.000 
floaty stuff in this and it's not like
yeast<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:43.310> almost<00:02:43.520> looks<00:02:43.760> like<00:02:44.260> like<00:02:45.260> grain<00:02:45.709> or

something<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.340> don't<00:02:46.459> know<00:02:46.520> if<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.640> can<00:02:46.760> see<00:02:46.940> if

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
something I don't know if you can see if

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.400 
something I don't know if you can see if
it's<00:02:47.150> actually<00:02:47.209> coating<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.840> bottle<00:02:48.230> its

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
it's actually coating the bottle its

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.620 
it's actually coating the bottle its
coating<00:02:48.650> all<00:02:48.980> on<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.550> inside<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.420> glass

coating all on the inside of the glass

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.630 
coating all on the inside of the glass
that's<00:02:50.900> not<00:02:51.110> bubble<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:51.620> it's<00:02:51.739> this<00:02:51.860> floaty

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
that's not bubble so it's this floaty

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
coffee milk stout at 4.2 percent I was a

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.310 
coffee milk stout at 4.2 percent I was a
little<00:03:05.000> worried<00:03:05.300> I<00:03:05.420> was<00:03:05.570> just<00:03:05.720> afraid<00:03:05.989> it<00:03:06.230> was

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
little worried I was just afraid it was

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.810 
little worried I was just afraid it was
gonna<00:03:06.380> be<00:03:06.560> watery<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.160> just<00:03:07.310> kind<00:03:07.550> of<00:03:07.610> take

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
gonna be watery and just kind of take

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.699 
gonna be watery and just kind of take
that<00:03:07.850> away<00:03:08.209> it's<00:03:08.720> not<00:03:08.989> at<00:03:09.170> all<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.320> think<00:03:09.560> the

that away it's not at all I think the

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.759 
that away it's not at all I think the
coffee<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.430> lactose<00:03:10.940> being<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:12.080> stout<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.560> just

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
coffee the lactose being a stout it just

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.770 
coffee the lactose being a stout it just
has<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:12.950> big<00:03:13.340> body<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.910> big<00:03:14.180> roasty

there from the lactose to kind of

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.229 
there from the lactose to kind of
bolster<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.800> up<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.190> just<00:03:19.519> works<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:20.090> can
