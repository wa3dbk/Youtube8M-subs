00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.400
 and it seems that my friends have arrived 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:30.219
 hello guys or come dressed up I think 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.989
 what happens because they come like this to the 

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:34.719
 Halloween 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.320
 hear and really know what it means 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.320
 the halloween 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.010
 not then I think you should listen to this 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.559
 the halloween besides not being a 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.090
 Christian tradition is a holiday of 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.160
 satanic origin 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.610
 it might look like something from children with 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:59.350
 costumes and sweets but maybe you guys 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.800
 you know where it comes from, look, I'm going 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.310
 explain October 31 is the day of 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.920
 most important party for groups 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:11.399
 satanists the festivities of Saturday and 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.399
 this stain 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.909
 what is the good samhain, it is the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.470
 party in which the ancient Celts 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.780
 offered sacrifices as a way of 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.720
 thanks to his god for the purpose of 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.729
 the harvest season terrorized 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.039
 the inhabitants who did not want to offer 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.520
 that the evil spirits 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.979
 they would visit and destroy they marked their 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.229
 doors with blood so that bad 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.310
 spirits will identify their houses 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.830
 during the night and they will attack them 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.159
 those who complied with giving a 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.470
 animal or a person put a vegetable 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.750
 hollow inside with a candle 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:01.060
 lit like for example a pumpkin 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.480
 Quiet zucchini if you have goodbye 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.080
 it nothing will happen this did them 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.450
 as a sign that these people 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.319
 offered and should be protected by 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.739
 the evil spirits 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.920
 turn the druids who will be 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.680
 Priests of the Celts should come 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.010
 of animals this to scare away the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.859
 bad spirits after the night 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.780
 imitating their noises and movements to little 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.469
 It does not sound familiar to 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.469
 wear costumes 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.090
 Jesus was clear when he explained what 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.620
 this represents in front of our god 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.090
 the bible says in Matthew 15 3 because 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.700
 you too 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.360
 back you pass the commandment of God for 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.870
 your tradition this people of lips 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.440
 it honors me more his heart is far from 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.710
 doctors 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.080
 so as they see the halloween is a 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.010
 practice with a very different story 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.490
 what they seemed to know that's why they 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.640
 I recommend not doing it at home or with 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.700
 your friends no practice you have 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.150
 what to do with halloween day of the dead ni 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:29.210
 nothing like these traditions is a 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:32.030
 celebration that honors god or not me 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:35.480
 forgot that you too would come good 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:40.780
 Now that lotto and zucchini are going to 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.780
 help explain something true guys
