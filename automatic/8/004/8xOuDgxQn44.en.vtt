00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.320
 from the morphological point of view the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.719
 lived waist and body in two parts 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.369
 that normally do not have a proportion in 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.470
 waist analysis will be the point of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.539
 departure to know what points of the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.190
 body we should highlight and what parts 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.470
 must go more unnoticed 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.830
 we can meet with four types 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.780
 of different waists 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.600
 the small waist would be what 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.280
 we commonly call wasp waist 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.930
 its dimensions are small compared to 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.020
 the upper and lower part of the body 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.600
 this waist creates a figure similar to 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.400
 the number 8 if we find 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.770
 this case but the rest of the body is 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.170
 bulky we must avoid accentuating 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.570
 hips for it never remarking we have the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.640
 waist with tight belts garments 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.070
 of different color or prints in that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.809
 area with something more subtle or colors 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.210
 neutral we will avoid the difference of 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.280
 volumes 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.500
 if we have a belly, it does not have 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.330
 meaning to emphasize the waist for it 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.760
 we'll be for loose shirts of a 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.260
 only color in terms of pants 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.240
 the tweezers will always draw on the 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.100
 waist although we will have to assess if 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.710
 they can stretch their hips too much 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.690
 if we are more dressed the cuts 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.110
 empire or those who do not have waists are 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.110
 ideals 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.630
 there are people who have in the waist 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.829
 so high that body is shorter than 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.020
 legs 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.490
 in that case we will lengthen the body with 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.109
 belts of the same tone as the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.909
 t-shirt and pants flush with the hip 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.130
 on the contrary there are people who have 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.020
 low waist to stand out from the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.869
 legs the belt will always be 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.099
 Same color as the skirt or pants 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.200
 we can choose slacks 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.539
 high but we will never wear shirts 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.069
 short because it would demonstrate the 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.069
 disproportion between body and legs
