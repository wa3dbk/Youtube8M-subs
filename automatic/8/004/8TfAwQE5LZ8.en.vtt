00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.730

 and I hope you like it 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.270
 this game is basically about killing 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.270

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:52.520

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.270
 the bugs 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.400
 here I feel like the king 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.600
 to see if an elephant comes out he hit him 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:26.190
 shot fills me with pride satisfaction goes 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.190
 to load me I can animals of the jungle 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.950

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.110
 younger 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.890
 it is incomplete 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.460
 well I will have passed in a wave or what 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:59.420
 let this be 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.420

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.190

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.010
 and when this starts already 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.010
 that repairs the radio very well 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.550
 where the bugs appear 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.010

 the mouth cat happens to him disappeared this 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.340
 as a matrix the cats are and are not 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.340
 the time 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.770

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.230
 I play the cats 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.879
 pull over there 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.050
 if the rare that deny dead call 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:25.220
 stabbed attack the cats more times 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.220
 the tigers of this 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.870
 fuck 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.870
 that is to say that I have bad aim 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.610
 yes 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.880
 well we do the most aiming take the 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.880
 mouth 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.420
 do not tell me you can not go down here 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.420
 and play 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.069
 come on let's go 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.490
 I need the challenge will be tiger that's going 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.490
 varying 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:09.460
 look over there 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:09.460
 no you are not pulling data 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.510
 run 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.489
 like the gold series have then if I 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.850
 they gave nothing here or something like that 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.050
 I would finish the cats more easily 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.050
 to all animal fauna 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.849
 come on, yes they are going to burst 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.320
 set aside 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.320
 for this mount 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.099
 I do not know what a rocket launcher will say to me here 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.500
 front 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.600
 to the crossbow look but it will not be 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.600
 explosive no 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.210
 I think you created the puff pastry 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:11.469
 a rifle a sniper rifle where 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:13.289
 is not here the cat is not 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:16.370
 dizzy 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:23.900
 look at the radio that I have to fix 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:26.590
 I do not correct the rule that I'm going to 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.590
 10 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.270
 because I see it as blurry 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.180
 the truth 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.180
 the pretty attic 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.990
 I am immortal is that they do not kill me new 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.990
 batch of 13 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:52.470
 l blurred because it looks blurry 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.470
 Well, like I put the pipe from before 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.509
 and out there you hear a dinosaur or 

00:05:57.179 --> 00:06:02.509
 something like that 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.509
 you run 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:08.449
 where 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:17.230
 yes 20 seconds and that come for my masters 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.960
 do not 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.960
 Hello 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:32.720
 a lion that's a lion a black lion 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.720
 pull over there 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:43.139
 dies in all mouths 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:47.060
 Joaquin does not see neither the blood nor anything 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:51.980
 and it does not kill me but fired 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:56.009
 where I make you ran out of time 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:58.379
 I take to the grave was not observed 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:01.469
 well I hope you like the video the 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:02.879
 truth is that games do not have a 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:04.770
 story mode but this was how you 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:07.529
 do, if anything, try the story mode 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:12.080
 to see what if you liked to give 

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:12.080
 I like it and see you soon goodbye
