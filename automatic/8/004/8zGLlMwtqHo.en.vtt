00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.560
 As you can see, it comes in a box that is 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.560
 pretty cool 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.120
 here everything should come apart from the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.960
 helmets 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.960
 let's get it out 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.520
 here is the house of the castros that now 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.520
 I will teach it 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.850
 and in this little box here 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.110
 well I will teach everything 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.810
 comes 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:32.130
 the usb that connects to the helmet is 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.130
 plug in by usb to the play 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.720
 the days to be able to connect it to a 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.550
 mobile for example 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.480
 the usb to load the mÃ¡laga the 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.340
 handset 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.610
 a transport bag that is 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.540
 pretty cool and well this you know what 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.540
 that those are the instructions 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.450
 let's take out the helmets 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.510
 the truth that they weigh nothing but good 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.860
 Now when you remove 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.860
 the plastiki 3a 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.740
 I know I can remove it if not to see how 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.740
 milk 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.950
 I say that now some form of power 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.129
 and break them and I do not want the others 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.520
 to me what 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.520
 you are going to do 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:01.200
 Outside, as you can see, there are enough floors 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.370
 come here the good symbol of the 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.270
 command buttons the symbol of 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:12.920
 playstation here come the buttons this 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.920
 buttons to increase the volume 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.140
 this to activate the 7.1 system 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:28.100
 the mute to leave the micro 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.640
 so you can hear us 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.480
 on the usb connector and the connector of the 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.140
 Jack 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:41.690
 and this little button that you see puts off 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.690
 if I'm not wrong off 1 and 2 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.860
 this seems to me that this will go and we put it 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.900
 in one we have the standard sound and if 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.260
 we put it in two we have the reinforcements 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.790
 of serious 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:59.370
 and here it's sunny and salt, I do not know what 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.890
 will be to raise the volume in the game and 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.470
 I'll upload volume by jumping to an idea or 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.260
 directly I know I do not know I'll have 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.590
 to see it in the cooked instructions 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:14.480
 Well, I hope you like me 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.340
 side 89 with 90 can be folded 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.400
 also on either side for this one by 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.540
 this and everything to save it in the 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.070
 job exchange 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.890
 of transportation that I taught you before 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.840
 so nothing guys I hope you like it 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.920

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.310
