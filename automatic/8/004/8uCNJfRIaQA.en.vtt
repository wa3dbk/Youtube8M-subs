00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.450
 and personnel involved in the cycle and solemar and 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.789
 Today I'm going to answer Pablo's question. 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.640
 bohrz and pablo be the pope 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.589
 here's how to know that tuning 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.460
 use a guitar to fit with the 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.380
 my voice 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.029
 I've seen several people with this 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.890
 kind of doubt to actually find one 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.239
 comfortable for each person is not a 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.970
 very easy task 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.620
 because there are several types of voice 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.090
 there are people who have the most acute voice 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.710
 people who have the most serious voice 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.510
 some people get along so much in the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.380
 graphic is paid for anyway are many 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.820
 variables 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.220
 each case has to be analyzed in 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.420
 separated to suit the voice with the 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.680
 guitar does not mean that we have 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.300
 what to do in wiring 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.980
 it is clear that some bands some 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.620
 singers who play the instruments in 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.810
 other affirmations this galera does this 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.250
 thinking about a specific sonority in 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.950
 a broader result in relation to 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.660
 frogs of music not only because of the singer 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.250
 It's good that in some cases there are people 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.019
 that changes the tuning of the guitar to stay 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.090
 better to sing but this is when the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.400
 person to use some types of accord 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.420
 with loose strings that just roll in tones 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.460
 specific 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.480
 so the only way to get it is 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.460
 changing settings 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.140
 this is not the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.180
 suitable to fit the voice with the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.470
 the best way to find a 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.390
 comfortable way to sing a song 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.760
 It's changing all this music. 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.560
 ideal is to pick up the recording tone and 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.409
 changing according to the need 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.900
 but up from email of 5 at last has to 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.240
 try until you find the right 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.250
 natÃ¡lia sandy that the singing instructor 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.630
 In which one complains he recorded a class only 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.220

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.520
 the ideal tone for each 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.260

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.060

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.580
 help clarify these doubts. 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.190
 respect of others then the question of 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.049
 paid in summary there is no type of 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.010
 tuning of the guitar to fit with each 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.260

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.939
 we can even change the pitch if 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.430
 want to play with some loudness 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.890
 specific to the villain and is only possible with 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.170
 some types of chords but the most 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.659
 suitable for a crazy dog voice is 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.830
