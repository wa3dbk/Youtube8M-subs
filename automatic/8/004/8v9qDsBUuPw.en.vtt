00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
can hear I've got a my voice sounds a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.370 
can hear I've got a my voice sounds a
bit<00:00:26.240> different<00:00:26.630> it's<00:00:26.750> because<00:00:26.990> I've<00:00:27.110> got<00:00:27.350> a

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
bit different it's because I've got a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.069 
bit different it's because I've got a
mic<00:00:28.010> for<00:00:28.040> my<00:00:28.720> for<00:00:29.720> their<00:00:29.840> my<00:00:30.140> videos<00:00:30.500> and

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
mic for my for their my videos and

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.030 
mic for my for their my videos and
probably<00:00:33.079> can't<00:00:33.290> believe<00:00:33.470> this<00:00:33.590> but<00:00:33.800> what<00:00:34.010> I

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
probably can't believe this but what I

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.760 
probably can't believe this but what I
use<00:00:34.250> before<00:00:34.430> is<00:00:35.060> a<00:00:35.120> microphone<00:00:35.750> was<00:00:36.530> the

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
use before is a microphone was the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.979 
use before is a microphone was the
internal<00:00:37.250> microphone<00:00:37.489> on<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.150> ipod<00:00:38.570> on<00:00:38.810> my

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
internal microphone on the ipod on my

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.319 
internal microphone on the ipod on my
ipod<00:00:39.440> so<00:00:40.160> hopefully<00:00:40.640> this<00:00:40.760> sounds<00:00:41.090> a<00:00:41.150> lot

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
ipod so hopefully this sounds a lot

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.810 
ipod so hopefully this sounds a lot
better<00:00:42.399> and<00:00:43.600> hopefully<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:44.899> guys<00:00:45.079> like<00:00:45.350> it<00:00:45.410> um

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.430 
better and hopefully you guys like it um

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
yeah so this is um condenser microphone

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.340 
yeah so this is um condenser microphone
I<00:00:51.740> bought<00:00:52.220> it<00:00:52.370> off<00:00:52.460> ebay<00:00:52.700> for<00:00:52.910> quite<00:00:53.240> cheap<00:00:53.540> but

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
I bought it off ebay for quite cheap but

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.500 
I bought it off ebay for quite cheap but
I<00:00:54.380> didn't<00:00:54.590> want<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:54.770> buy<00:00:54.920> like<00:00:55.160> a<00:00:55.190> blue<00:00:56.030> Yeti<00:00:56.390> or

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
I didn't want to buy like a blue Yeti or

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.840 
I didn't want to buy like a blue Yeti or
something<00:00:56.990> because<00:00:57.160> those<00:00:58.160> costs<00:00:58.520> a<00:00:58.580> lot<00:00:58.700> I

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
something because those costs a lot I

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.480 
something because those costs a lot I
was<00:00:58.970> good<00:00:59.120> thinking<00:00:59.540> of<00:00:59.720> by<00:00:59.900> one<00:01:00.140> but<00:01:00.320> um<00:01:00.620> I'm

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
was good thinking of by one but um I'm

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.830 
was good thinking of by one but um I'm
probably<00:01:01.760> not<00:01:01.910> want<00:01:02.060> to<00:01:02.120> buy<00:01:02.240> one<00:01:02.270> for<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.660> while

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
probably not want to buy one for a while

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.119 
probably not want to buy one for a while
so<00:01:03.230> I'm<00:01:03.320> just<00:01:03.440> going<00:01:03.590> to<00:01:03.650> stick<00:01:03.860> with<00:01:03.890> this

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
so I'm just going to stick with this

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.240 
so I'm just going to stick with this
microphone<00:01:04.610> for<00:01:04.850> now<00:01:05.110> but<00:01:06.110> hopefully<00:01:06.860> it's<00:01:07.159> a

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
microphone for now but hopefully it's a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.850 
microphone for now but hopefully it's a
lot<00:01:07.490> better<00:01:07.640> than<00:01:07.909> my<00:01:07.939> internal<00:01:08.450> microphone

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
lot better than my internal microphone

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.920 
lot better than my internal microphone
but<00:01:09.860> anyway<00:01:10.130> let's<00:01:10.280> get<00:01:10.430> on<00:01:10.549> with<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.759> video

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
but anyway let's get on with the video

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.359 
but anyway let's get on with the video
so<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.470> first<00:01:12.680> rain<00:01:12.950> i'm<00:01:13.040> going<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.220> be<00:01:13.280> doing

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
so the first rain i'm going to be doing

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.950 
so the first rain i'm going to be doing
is<00:01:13.610> all<00:01:14.090> arches<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.229> a<00:01:16.329> bit<00:01:17.329> boring<00:01:17.540> raid<00:01:17.810> by

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
is all arches so a bit boring raid by

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.290 
is all arches so a bit boring raid by
hopefully<00:01:18.260> i<00:01:18.290> find<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.710> base<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.820> ton<00:01:20.150> of

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
hopefully i find a base of the ton of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.270 
hopefully i find a base of the ton of
loop<00:01:20.510> so<00:01:20.810> i<00:01:20.990> can<00:01:21.230> get<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.440> lot<00:01:21.620> of<00:01:21.680> loose<00:01:21.860> I<00:01:22.100> can

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
loop so i can get a lot of loose I can

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.600 
loop so i can get a lot of loose I can
um<00:01:22.750> upgrade<00:01:23.750> one<00:01:24.290> of<00:01:24.409> my<00:01:24.470> arch<00:01:24.740> towers<00:01:25.190> which<00:01:25.490> I

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
um upgrade one of my arch towers which I

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.340 
um upgrade one of my arch towers which I
want<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:25.880> upgrade<00:01:26.270> my<00:01:26.480> second<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.320> last

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
touched our then my next thing I need

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.469 
touched our then my next thing I need
upgrade<00:01:34.820> is<00:01:35.030> my<00:01:35.210> was<00:01:35.390> at<00:01:35.540> hours<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.290> then<00:01:36.740> I

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
upgrade is my was at hours and then I

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.450 
upgrade is my was at hours and then I
think<00:01:38.479> I<00:01:38.630> can<00:01:38.810> then<00:01:39.440> probably<00:01:39.740> wolves<00:01:40.310> and

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
think I can then probably wolves and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.219 
think I can then probably wolves and
stuff<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:41.090> then<00:01:41.540> I<00:01:41.600> probably<00:01:41.750> can<00:01:41.960> upgrade<00:01:42.080> to

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
stuff and then I probably can upgrade to

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.800 
stuff and then I probably can upgrade to

just<00:02:10.909> put<00:02:11.360> arches<00:02:12.140> around<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.830> collectors

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
just put arches around the collectors

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.130 
just put arches around the collectors
and<00:02:14.030> we<00:02:14.090> should<00:02:14.239> hopefully<00:02:14.450> give<00:02:14.659> them<00:02:14.900> all<00:02:15.080> of

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
and we should hopefully give them all of

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.440 
and we should hopefully give them all of
the<00:02:15.409> loot<00:02:15.590> so<00:02:16.489> it's<00:02:16.760> quite<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.030> lot<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.269> loot

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
the loot so it's quite a lot of loot

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.550 
the loot so it's quite a lot of loot
it's<00:02:17.750> I'm<00:02:18.819> pretty<00:02:19.819> easy<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.360> get<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.930> hit<00:02:21.409> the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
it's I'm pretty easy to get the hit the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.650 
it's I'm pretty easy to get the hit the
collectors<00:02:22.010> because<00:02:22.550> in<00:02:22.849> some<00:02:23.000> bases<00:02:23.450> are

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
collectors because in some bases are

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.260 
collectors because in some bases are
like<00:02:23.870> I'm<00:02:24.830> some<00:02:25.190> collectors<00:02:25.550> are<00:02:25.670> inside<00:02:26.090> the

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
like I'm some collectors are inside the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.550 
like I'm some collectors are inside the
base<00:02:26.420> which<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:26.810> really<00:02:27.050> annoying<00:02:27.349> because

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
base which is really annoying because

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.820 
base which is really annoying because
they

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
they

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.720 
they
she<00:02:27.920> quite<00:02:28.100> hard<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:29.090> know<00:02:29.120> get<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.920> yeah

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
she quite hard to you know get so yeah

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.240 
she quite hard to you know get so yeah
this<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:32.000> quite<00:02:32.210> quite<00:02:32.630> an<00:02:32.750> easy<00:02:32.900> easy<00:02:33.560> job<00:02:33.980> to

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
this is quite quite an easy easy job to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.480 
this is quite quite an easy easy job to
do<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.540> I'll<00:02:35.750> just<00:02:35.780> get<00:02:36.320> those<00:02:36.530> army<00:02:37.190> camps

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
do so I'll just get those army camps

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.790 
do so I'll just get those army camps
down<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.000> we<00:02:38.120> can<00:02:38.210> actually<00:02:38.360> focus<00:02:39.320> on<00:02:39.560> the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
down so we can actually focus on the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.590 
down so we can actually focus on the
collectors<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:43.060> hopefully<00:02:44.060> we<00:02:44.150> can<00:02:44.300> get<00:02:44.390> all

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
collectors and hopefully we can get all

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.330 
collectors and hopefully we can get all
that<00:02:44.780> loop<00:02:45.020> because<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.440> is<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.620> lot<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.010> loot

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
that loop because that is a lot of loot

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.040 
that loop because that is a lot of loot
and<00:02:46.550> you<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:46.850> see<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.210> pumps<00:02:47.540> are<00:02:47.660> pretty

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
and you can see the pumps are pretty

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.500 
and you can see the pumps are pretty
much<00:02:48.230> full<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.890> brim<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.150> looks<00:02:50.210> like

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
much full to the brim so it looks like

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.200 
much full to the brim so it looks like
most<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.230> losers<00:02:51.620> in<00:02:51.830> there<00:02:52.100> it<00:02:52.850> might<00:02:53.030> be

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
most of the losers in there it might be

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.880 
most of the losers in there it might be
a<00:02:53.240> few<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.810> few<00:02:54.680> teen<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.400> few<00:02:56.060> thousand<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.630> then

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
a few a few teen a few thousand and then

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.530 
a few a few teen a few thousand and then
storages<00:02:57.890> but<00:02:58.160> looks<00:02:58.580> like<00:02:58.640> most<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.270> is<00:02:59.390> in

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
storages but looks like most of it is in

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.480 
storages but looks like most of it is in
the<00:02:59.630> clintons<00:03:00.080> we'll<00:03:00.740> find<00:03:01.010> out<00:03:01.160> once<00:03:01.310> I've

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
the clintons we'll find out once I've

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.380 
the clintons we'll find out once I've
taken<00:03:01.700> all<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.000> cliq<00:03:02.180> sit<00:03:02.390> down<00:03:02.600> so<00:03:02.930> yeah<00:03:04.390> yeah

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
taken all the cliq sit down so yeah yeah

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.940 
taken all the cliq sit down so yeah yeah
it<00:03:05.450> does<00:03:05.630> look<00:03:05.660> like<00:03:05.870> all<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.590> as<00:03:06.680> in<00:03:06.860> the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
it does look like all of it as in the

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.000 
it does look like all of it as in the
collectors<00:03:07.370> because<00:03:07.930> look<00:03:08.930> there's<00:03:09.740> probably

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
collectors because look there's probably

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.460 
collectors because look there's probably
50<00:03:10.580> thousand<00:03:11.180> deluxe<00:03:11.510> are<00:03:11.720> in<00:03:11.780> there<00:03:11.990> and<00:03:12.230> the

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
50 thousand deluxe are in there and the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.190 
50 thousand deluxe are in there and the
storages<00:03:13.220> maybe<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:13.970> was<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.780> bit<00:03:14.870> more<00:03:15.140> than

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
storages maybe I was a bit more than

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.070 
storages maybe I was a bit more than
that<00:03:15.320> but<00:03:15.860> you<00:03:16.250> know<00:03:16.400> still<00:03:16.480> we<00:03:17.480> got<00:03:17.630> most<00:03:17.870> of

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
that but you know still we got most of

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.470 
that but you know still we got most of
the<00:03:18.320> loot<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:20.120> they'll<00:03:20.450> go<00:03:20.690> for<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.340> gold

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
the loot and they'll go for the gold

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.699 
the loot and they'll go for the gold
collectors<00:03:23.680> or<00:03:24.680> gold<00:03:25.010> mines<00:03:26.200> so<00:03:27.200> yeah<00:03:27.440> um

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
collectors or gold mines so yeah um

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.470 
collectors or gold mines so yeah um
hopefully<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:28.490> get<00:03:28.580> most<00:03:28.820> of<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.090> loop<00:03:29.300> and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
hopefully you get most of the loop and

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.720 
hopefully you get most of the loop and
you'll<00:03:30.380> be<00:03:30.530> pretty<00:03:30.770> awesome<00:03:30.890> right<00:03:31.160> if<00:03:31.430> we<00:03:31.550> get

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
you'll be pretty awesome right if we get

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:41.979 
you'll be pretty awesome right if we get
all<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.720> loot<00:03:39.700> okay<00:03:40.700> so<00:03:41.060> we<00:03:41.239> got<00:03:41.390> we're

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
all the loot okay so we got we're

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.400 
all the loot okay so we got we're
getting<00:03:42.080> most<00:03:42.410> of<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.650> loo<00:03:42.830> um<00:03:44.260> looks<00:03:45.260> like

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
getting most of the loo um looks like

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.940 
getting most of the loo um looks like
this<00:03:45.530> guy's<00:03:46.810> he's<00:03:47.810> definitely<00:03:48.290> active<00:03:48.680> an

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
this guy's he's definitely active an

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.229 
this guy's he's definitely active an
active<00:03:49.489> sorry<00:03:49.700> active<00:03:50.360> so<00:03:51.050> yeah<00:03:51.290> um<00:03:51.560> i<00:03:52.150> wish<00:03:53.150> i

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
active sorry active so yeah um i wish i

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.060 
active sorry active so yeah um i wish i
could<00:03:53.420> find<00:03:53.660> these<00:03:53.930> bases<00:03:54.350> so<00:03:54.590> much<00:03:54.800> easy

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
could find these bases so much easy

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.240 
could find these bases so much easy
because<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.400> takes<00:03:55.850> it<00:03:56.120> took<00:03:56.300> me<00:03:56.420> like<00:03:56.840> half<00:03:57.250> an

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
because it takes it took me like half an

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.770 
because it takes it took me like half an
hour<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.489> find<00:03:58.730> this<00:03:58.910> bait<00:03:59.120> no<00:03:59.330> more<00:03:59.660> than

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
hour to find this bait no more than

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.850 
hour to find this bait no more than
there<00:03:59.900> maybe<00:04:00.160> um<00:04:01.750> 45<00:04:02.750> minutes<00:04:03.110> 45<00:04:03.620> minutes

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
there maybe um 45 minutes 45 minutes

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.640 
there maybe um 45 minutes 45 minutes
find<00:04:04.400> that<00:04:04.550> just<00:04:04.790> this<00:04:05.570> an<00:04:05.780> active<00:04:06.110> base<00:04:06.290> so

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
find that just this an active base so

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.560 
find that just this an active base so
yeah<00:04:06.830> it<00:04:06.980> takes<00:04:07.190> quite<00:04:07.519> a<00:04:07.580> while<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.880> find<00:04:08.239> base

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
yeah it takes quite a while to find base

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.660 
yeah it takes quite a while to find base
like<00:04:08.780> this<00:04:08.989> but<00:04:09.709> it<00:04:09.860> is<00:04:10.010> worth<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.430> in<00:04:10.519> the<00:04:10.550> end

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
like this but it is worth it in the end

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.170 
like this but it is worth it in the end
um<00:04:11.140> but<00:04:12.140> yeah<00:04:12.320> that's<00:04:12.590> this<00:04:13.070> first<00:04:13.459> raid<00:04:13.760> we

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
um but yeah that's this first raid we

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.349 
um but yeah that's this first raid we
got<00:04:14.360> a<00:04:14.650> lot<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.680> loot<00:04:16.040> let's<00:04:16.549> see<00:04:16.729> how<00:04:16.790> much<00:04:16.880> so

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359
