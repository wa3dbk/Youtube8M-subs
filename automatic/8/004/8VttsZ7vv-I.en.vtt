00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:54.309

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.800 

and<00:02:55.250> then<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.459> don't<00:02:55.849> know<00:02:56.030> what<00:02:56.180> note<00:02:56.360> this<00:02:56.540> is

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
and then I don't know what note this is

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.020 
and then I don't know what note this is
but<00:02:57.110> on<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:58.069> d-string

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
but on the d-string

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.309 
but on the d-string
he's<00:02:59.959> on<00:03:00.140> an<00:03:00.260> F<00:03:00.439> note<00:03:00.709> third<00:03:01.069> fret<00:03:01.340> on<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.930> g

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
he's on an F note third fret on the g

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.679 
he's on an F note third fret on the g
string<00:03:03.349> he's<00:03:03.829> on<00:03:03.950> an<00:03:04.069> eighth<00:03:04.280> note<00:03:04.310> in<00:03:04.760> the

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
string he's on an eighth note in the

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.890 
string he's on an eighth note in the
second<00:03:06.019> fret<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:07.370> he<00:03:07.579> also<00:03:07.730> plucks<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.629> B

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
second fret and he also plucks the B

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.640 
second fret and he also plucks the B
string<00:03:09.170> open

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
string open

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.080 
string open
so

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.120 

just<00:03:17.600> slide<00:03:17.870> back<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.200> an<00:03:18.590> anus<00:03:18.950> before

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
just slide back to an anus before

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.860 
just slide back to an anus before
thinking<00:03:19.730> or<00:03:19.970> sustain<00:03:20.390> forth<00:03:20.840> sus4

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:52.430 

so<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.560> sounds<00:03:25.860> like<00:03:25.980> this

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.790 

okay<00:03:53.340> that's<00:03:54.030> pretty<00:03:54.300> much<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.600> song<00:03:54.810> when<00:03:55.770> he

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
okay that's pretty much the song when he

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:07.470 
okay that's pretty much the song when he
gets<00:03:56.040> into<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.370> end<00:03:56.520> part<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:56.970> just

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.030
