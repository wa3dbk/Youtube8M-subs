00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.259
 noon depending on when you do this 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.090
 delta one me3 tutorial on the subject 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.099
 Get a fourth mappack for free 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.720
 Once we have the times mountain 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.730
 download in the description is a 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.500
 link that again a direct link her 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.109
 have just seen it I have the link 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.630
 Once entered and I can do that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.300
 Download the file immediately if you can 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.830
 then downloaded so you have 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.360
 a folder 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.670
 I already have one here 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.510
 downloaded and this opens her 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.830
 but still a folder 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.960
 there is mine and then look for 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.589
 open your advantage tauern mw3 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.930
 folder 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.760
 this is the folder where in the beginning it 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.979
 the two files have been recopied 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.900
 it can also be that you put that in the steam 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:57.000
 folders have done well after that 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.500
 that is still this 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.920
 open here and go first 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.309
 let's go for more then we go in here 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.450
 the rar file also once after 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.280
 clear 2 files we need 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.810
 just wrap up and wrap up 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.590
 I'm already over there 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.909
 available 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.990
 That's why I do not do that, of course 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.090
 again you just have to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.090
 then you go back 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.240
 on now we will also rest 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.579
 then in the folder dlc if it is in folder 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.859
 tlc here is simply no life 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.679
 to create folder in lowercase dlc 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:31.590
 so we go here too in del drag and 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.909
 copy this over here so that 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.829
 I have already done so because of that 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.619
 will also have an error message 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.060
 that I have these files let that 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.399
 I also go away and you can 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.499
 the mappacks in for nature one mp3 also 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.270
 play the fourth mappack if he does 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:47.219
 interested in the first second or 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.539
 third map pack are then looks yet 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.460
 times in the description there are also 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.229
 still left to the tutorials for the first 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.729
 second and third map pack it can 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.340
 also still be that the server 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.990
 citizen the maps of the map name red 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.490
 is colored so with or font 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.939
 is written but that is not 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.740
 bad 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.479
 You can still play the maps anyway 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.770
 I've already tried that that's it 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.329

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.920

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.850
