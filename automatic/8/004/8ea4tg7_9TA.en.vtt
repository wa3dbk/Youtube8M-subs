 noteworthy I hope this video 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.500

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.350
 [music] 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.279
 microsoft undertaking can really 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.599
 feel free to call scale with the release 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.700
 windows 10 corporation intends 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.770
 offer the market a unified software 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.590
 platform for all types of devices 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.020
 whether it is a desktop computer laptop 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.110
 tablet smartphone game console xbox 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.450
 tv or server all these devices 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.190
 will be combined into one common ecosystem 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.440
 with a single app store and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.340
 universal development environment 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.039
 software 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.140
 This means that I wrote the application alone. 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.090
 once developers can provide it 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.949
 a wide audience of users of any 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.230
 device types regardless of their 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.230
 hardware specifications and configurations 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.530
 microsoft has finally heard 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.870
 pleading users for all 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.880
 known in the start menu windows 10 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.990
 microsoft experts have combined 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.360
 classic interface 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.990
 start menu function which were up to 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.970
 sevens 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.130
 with metro interface characteristic for 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.110
 eights now classic start 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.850
 divided into two areas one of which 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.750
 responsible for the classic interface a 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.520
 second for the metro 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.680
 at the same time for the metro interface also 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.020
 the ability to change the order and 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.880
 size of application launch icons except 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.650
 finally the off button and 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.060
 reboot the computer now also 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.430
 available quickly and conveniently 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.560
 from the start menu is worth noting for those who 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.840
 still like the metro interface 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.820
 microsoft company left the opportunity 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.690
 return to visual design from 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.690
 windows 8 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.490
 start button located us button 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.290
 universal search like windows 8 on 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.340
 operating system search is 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.350
 universal 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.960
 looking for a search query among the programs 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.530
 local cloud files as well as 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.530
 the internet 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.260
 microsoft is also working to 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.910
 optimize work with screens with 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.310
 high pixel density 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.770
 screens with a native resolution of 4k that is 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.840
 ultra hd already appearing on the market and 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.910
 some manufacturers are already working on 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.230
 creating 8 to panel feature 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.150
 dynamic size control 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.580
 font depending on pixel 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.670
 density has already been improved in 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.360
 windows 8 and 11 to 710 it will work 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.360
 even better 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.980
 appeared in windows phone version 81 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.290
 centralized notification center 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.330
 migrated windows 10 here will be 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.610
 be a reminder warning 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.860
 notifications that come from the system 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.080
 and from the applications the work of the center remained 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.150
 same compared to windows phone 8 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.020
 and 1 and the notice is grouped by 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.020
 applications 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.600
 card to one of the most convincing 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.670
 evidence of what efforts 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.950
 is making microsoft to promote on 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.170
 mobile front and it will appear in 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.910
 windows 10 is a kind of virtual 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.920
 personal assistant who understands 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.170
 who you are where you are and what you do 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.300
 cortana can be called for consultation 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.010
 on the necessary issue she will provide 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.530
 you will receive the necessary information plan 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.360
 action or even do something for you 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.660
 if you give her the appropriate 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.660
 the rights 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.610
 microsoft did not give up her 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.010
 browser and vice versa windows 10 will be 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.140
 use the new internet version 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.330
 explorer which is worth supporting 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.790
 extension like google chrome and 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.890
 firefox we don't know what it will be for 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.140
 extension how will they appear a 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.150
 also to which i will not serve on us 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.330
 it seems very likely that microsoft 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.430
 going to pay special attention 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.379
 corporate environments given the emphasis on 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.519
 business user which is observed 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:54.560
 lately on April 29, 2015 on 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.840
 conference build was announced that but 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.200
 Browser unknown as other spartan 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.160
 will be called microsoft edge 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.500
 microsoft decided to leave the Internet 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.349
 explorer refusing to add it 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.060
 2 closet and for best performance in 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.230
 microsoft edge added more 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.049
 number of opportunities to create 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.700
 notes from web pages so if your 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.980
 the device has a stylus then you 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.910
 be able to make notes or drawings right 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.039
 on web page 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.280
 to share them with yours 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.280
 friends 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.910
 virtual desktops company 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.280
 microsoft borrowed from others 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.870
 operating systems whose users 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.630
 no longer imagine life without 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.850
 This function works in windows 10 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.650
 quite simple to call the list 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.300
 thumbnails and virtual desktop selection 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.310
 the table you need to click on 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.889
 the corresponding button next to the button 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.020
 search the valley with me of the screen you 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.900
 can see the thumbnails of all running 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.940
 applications on this desktop below 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.460
 A list of desktops will appear on the screen and 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.050
 adding a new button has become at the same time 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.880
 here you can close unnecessary 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.100
 application or desktops 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.470
 It is worth noting that the call to this window 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.620
 can be done with the key combination win + 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.639
 tab add new desktop control 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.669
 + win + d 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.620
 switching between desktops 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:13.760
 implement the combination control + win + 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.760
 left and right arrows 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.539
 on attachment function con applications 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.800
 red screen systems also underwent 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.840
 some changes 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.490
 Now you can not put on the screen 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.069
 only two applications as it were 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.020
 earlier three and even four depending on 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.210
 their needs besides 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.800
 porting gave apps for example in 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.620
 left side on the second part of the screen 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.930
 thumbnails appear remaining programs 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.919
 which can be positioned with one touch 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.919
 on the right side of the display 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.850
 some changes also got 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.670
 file manager in which now 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.860
 there is a ham section of this section 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.750
 we can see the last used 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.210
 files frequently used folders and 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.710
 Favorite shortcuts for how much this feature 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.240
 will be comfortable and popular 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.240
 time will tell users 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.940
 maybe not all users used 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.100
 this program but in windows 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.990
 there is a command line with 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.539
 which you can perform almost any 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.940
 actions with windows operating system 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.190
 10 microsoft company specialists decided 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.319
 add command line standard 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.139
 text processing features such as 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:23.030
 selection copy and paste text 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.830
 perhaps those who use the team 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.160
 line data innovations will fall on 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.160
