part which is a kind of looks like a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.660 
part which is a kind of looks like a
vessel<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.200> that's<00:00:37.410> responsible<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
vessel but that's responsible for the

vessel but that's responsible for the
for<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> base<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> low

for the base you know the low
frequencies<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.489> stuff<00:00:41.670> our<00:00:41.879> distribution

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
frequencies and stuff our distribution

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.750 
frequencies and stuff our distribution
is<00:00:42.570> because<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.219> I'll<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.370> coming<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.610> the

is because of that I'll be coming to the
use<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.149> both<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.480> them<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.379> second<00:00:46.710> but

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
use of both of them in a second but

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.619 
use of both of them in a second but
that's<00:00:47.070> how<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.730> connection<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.329> done<00:00:48.480> which

to<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.079> bottom<00:01:40.409> feet<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.040> snap<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.369> and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to the bottom feet and just snap it and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
to the bottom feet and just snap it and
it<00:01:41.610> should<00:01:41.820> fit<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.570> easily<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.259> it's

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
it should fit really easily and it's

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.460 
it should fit really easily and it's
done<00:01:43.590> via<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.920> pin<00:01:44.399> system<00:01:44.610> yeah<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.350> snaps

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
done via a pin system yeah it just snaps

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.850 
done via a pin system yeah it just snaps
on<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.799> off<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.869> suspended<00:01:48.869> pin<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.350> I

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
on and off it's a suspended pin and I

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.319 
on and off it's a suspended pin and I
think<00:01:50.189> these<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.430> five<00:01:50.640> pin<00:01:50.850> design<00:01:51.149> or

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
think these are five pin design or

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:51.740 
think these are five pin design or
something

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
something

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.630 
something
basically<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.040> works<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.520> well

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
basically like that it works really well

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.880 
basically like that it works really well

the links in the description

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.000 
the links in the description
I<00:02:12.300> think<00:02:12.780> I've<00:02:12.900> read<00:02:13.380> pretty<00:02:13.560> much<00:02:13.650> every

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
I think I've read pretty much every

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.510 
I think I've read pretty much every
single<00:02:14.190> JBL<00:02:14.750> speaker<00:02:15.750> there<00:02:16.320> is<00:02:16.350> pretty<00:02:17.340> much

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
single JBL speaker there is pretty much

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.480 
single JBL speaker there is pretty much
every<00:02:17.760> single<00:02:17.910> one<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:19.350> again<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.740> same

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
every single one and this again is same

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.850 
every single one and this again is same
its<00:02:21.240> sound<00:02:21.510> quality<00:02:22.140> wise<00:02:22.260> they<00:02:22.500> are<00:02:22.650> about

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
its sound quality wise they are about

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.440 
its sound quality wise they are about
the<00:02:23.040> same<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.640> only<00:02:23.700> difference<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.270> will

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
the same the only difference you will

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.870 
the same the only difference you will
notice<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:26.280> know<00:02:26.370> these<00:02:26.520> larger

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
notice that you know these larger

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.980 
notice that you know these larger
speakers<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.510> did<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> rumble<00:02:28.740> JBL<00:02:29.310> Rumble

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
speakers I did a rumble JBL Rumble

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.120 
speakers I did a rumble JBL Rumble
review<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.290> think<00:02:31.320> they<00:02:31.620> sound<00:02:31.950> exactly

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
review and I think they sound exactly

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.610 
review and I think they sound exactly
the<00:02:32.550> same

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
the same

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.680 
the same
the<00:02:34.620> only<00:02:34.830> difference<00:02:35.280> being<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.580> design<00:02:35.880> the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the only difference being the design the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.750 
the only difference being the design the
rumble<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.080> again<00:02:37.320> was<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> basic<00:02:38.070> monster<00:02:38.520> this

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
rumble of again was a basic monster this

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.310 
rumble of again was a basic monster this
guy's<00:02:38.970> again<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> basic<00:02:39.480> monster<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.140> get<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
guy's again a basic monster you get a

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.580 
guy's again a basic monster you get a
lot<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.590> bass<00:02:41.240> and<00:02:42.240> if<00:02:42.960> you<00:02:43.050> want<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.290> use<00:02:43.410> the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
lot of bass and if you want to use the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.220 
lot of bass and if you want to use the
smaller<00:02:43.830> speaker<00:02:44.280> then<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:45.120> know<00:02:45.210> we<00:02:45.600> lose

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
smaller speaker then you know we lose

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.100 
smaller speaker then you know we lose
some<00:02:46.500> bass<00:02:46.710> so<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.760> mean<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.630> could<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.960> could

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
some bass so I mean you could you could

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.110 
some bass so I mean you could you could
equalize<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:49.860> roll<00:02:50.250> out<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.430> bass<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.000> I

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
equalize it and roll out the bass and I

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.690 
equalize it and roll out the bass and I
recess<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.690> bass<00:02:51.840> for<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.500> more<00:02:52.740> better

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
recess the bass for a more better

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.180 
recess the bass for a more better
experience<00:02:54.270> but<00:02:54.450> again<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:56.070> know

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
experience but again that is you know

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.560 
experience but again that is you know
that's<00:02:56.370> something<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.760> got<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:56.940> do<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.420> not

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
that's something you got to do it's not

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.150 
that's something you got to do it's not
going<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.780> happen<00:02:57.900> automatically<00:02:58.530> which<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.130> a

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
going to happen automatically which is a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.810 
going to happen automatically which is a
kind<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.730> bummer<00:03:00.270> in<00:03:00.450> my<00:03:00.810> opinion<00:03:01.820> again

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
kind of a bummer in my opinion again

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.580 
kind of a bummer in my opinion again
snapping<00:03:03.240> on<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.420> stopping<00:03:03.960> off<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.350> really

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
snapping on and stopping off is really

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.960 
snapping on and stopping off is really
easy<00:03:04.740> you<00:03:04.920> can<00:03:05.070> see<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.280> pins<00:03:05.490> really<00:03:05.790> easy

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
easy you can see the pins really easy

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.580 
easy you can see the pins really easy
these<00:03:06.120> are<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.360> contact<00:03:06.780> pins<00:03:06.960> on<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.320> on

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
like that now the main functionality of

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.040 
like that now the main functionality of

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
this while you're on the go for example

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.650 
this while you're on the go for example

a snap off the smallest speaker take it
with<00:03:36.570> you<00:03:36.690> because<00:03:36.840> again<00:03:37.050> it's<00:03:37.290> Bluetooth

your portable players really easily this

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.380 
your portable players really easily this
again<00:03:42.780> fits<00:03:43.020> it's<00:03:43.230> kind<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:43.980> like<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.390> saucer

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
again fits it's kind of like a saucer

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.210 
again fits it's kind of like a saucer
you<00:03:45.570> know<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.780> fits<00:03:45.960> anywhere<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.890> want<00:03:47.070> so

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.340 
you know it fits anywhere you want so
it's<00:03:47.790> very<00:03:47.940> small<00:03:48.330> very<00:03:48.570> compact<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.170> can

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
it's very small very compact so you can

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.020 
it's very small very compact so you can
take<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.560> anywhere<00:03:49.770> you<00:03:49.890> want<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.880> should

take it anywhere you want and it should
fit<00:03:51.210> really<00:03:51.510> easily<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.170> that's<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.130> main

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
fit really easily and that's the main

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.510 
fit really easily and that's the main
advantage<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.630> using<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.770> smaller<00:03:56.040> speaker

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
advantage of using the smaller speaker

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.860 
advantage of using the smaller speaker
and<00:03:56.730> when<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.060> come<00:03:57.240> back<00:03:57.360> home<00:03:57.600> you<00:03:57.630> can

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
and when you come back home you can

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.810 
and when you come back home you can
again<00:03:58.080> plug<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.410> in<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.680> have<00:03:58.980> your<00:03:59.220> full

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
again plug it in and have your full

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.940 
again plug it in and have your full
setup<00:04:00.150> back<00:04:00.960> to<00:04:01.110> normal<00:04:01.380> again<00:04:01.470> which<00:04:01.710> is<00:04:01.830> nice

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
setup back to normal again which is nice

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.800 
setup back to normal again which is nice
again<00:04:02.430> these<00:04:02.670> are<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:02.880> required<00:04:03.240> cables<00:04:03.630> or

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
again these are the required cables or

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.050 
again these are the required cables or
to<00:04:04.530> connect<00:04:04.830> these<00:04:04.950> things<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.430> think<00:04:05.910> that's

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
to connect these things I think that's

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.270 
to connect these things I think that's
uh<00:04:06.270> you<00:04:06.600> know<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:06.720> like<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.230> way<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.710> the<00:04:08.100> brick

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
uh you know I like the way the the brick

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.190
