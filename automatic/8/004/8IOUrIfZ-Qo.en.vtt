00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello I'm a brother this is my first video 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.919
 and today I bring you a tutorial on how 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.849
 edit the host file in windows vista 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.860
 windows are here behind I leave you the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.650
 host 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.320
 without editing anything by the way if you have 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.510
 some problem or whatever it is like to put it 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.410
 in the comments and here are the three 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.410
 solutions 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.260
 well let's start the first 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.350
 solution what we have to do is go 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.460
 at the beginning to look for programs and files and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.460
 let's look for notepad 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.469
 ok when you find it click 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.390
 right execute as administrator this 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.850
 it is a very important part worth 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.050
 we give it that way once the program is open 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.879
 what we have to do is give 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.129
 control 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.230
 and let's find the host file children 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.950
 it depends on what you want we are going to 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:04.270
 windows good windows 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.270
 there are 32 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.150
 here 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.020
 drivers 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.330
 etcetera and here as you see maybe we 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.830
 appears this be to see you any 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.170
 element matches the criteria of 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.430
 search what we have to do is 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.890
 It is easy to hit the little arrow 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:30.010
 all the files and it's already us 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.010
 appears we give it and when to edit it 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.440
 well then we go with the second solution 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.260
 in case it worked for us the first time 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.180
 what we have to do is go to team 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.970
 local disk ce let's go to windows 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.960
 there are 32 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.960
 drivers 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.670
 etcetera and here we have the archives 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.880
 Well, what we have to do is copy 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.200
 and take it to the desk but if you do not 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.480
 you have to move the folder you have to 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.030
 make a copy simply 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.090
 As you can see here we have a file 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.910
 we open it with the notebook or with the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.620
 word what you want and edit it jce a 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.400
 Once finished what we have to do 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.100
 is to cut it and paste it to the folder 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.750
 and what you have to have something out 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.740
 like this and you have to give it to move and 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.740
 replace nothing else 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.280
 and as you see no error 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.990
 well this is the third solution and 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.750
 good is this link that by the way I'm going 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.360
 to leave down in the description the only 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.800
 what you have to do is download this 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.220
 archive 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.350
 once downloaded you get it and for 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.230
 I keep yourselves example what is in the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.820
 desk like me before anything before 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.490
 to open it what you have to do is 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.700
 disable the firewall or the antivirus 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.640
 what do you have done once 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.630
 right click run as administrator 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.200
 will open and as you will see here 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:16.000
 it's a cmd window the only thing you have 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.620
 what to do is give enter to write the s 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.610
 enter and you're done, you do not have to do anything 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.710
 more now what you should should 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.420
 restart to take better the 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.420
 effect in case anything 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.060
