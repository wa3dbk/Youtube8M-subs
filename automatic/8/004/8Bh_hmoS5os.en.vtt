00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
group stage oh yeah the first year was

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.240 
group stage oh yeah the first year was
quite<00:01:39.119> hard<00:01:39.630> quite<00:01:39.960> difficult<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
quite hard quite difficult with the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.980 
quite hard quite difficult with the
point<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.610> get<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.000> think<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:42.450> money<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.840> have

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
point we get I think more money we have

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.249 
point we get I think more money we have
to<00:01:43.140> go<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> second<00:01:44.369> round<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.259> we

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
to go to to to the second round and we

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.710 
to go to to to the second round and we
don't<00:01:46.409> do<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.979> think<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.700> mean<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.390> we

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
don't do that I think I mean like we

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.510
