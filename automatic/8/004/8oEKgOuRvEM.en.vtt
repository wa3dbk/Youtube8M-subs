00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.270 
so offended you're confused by the
premiere<00:07:24.300> show<00:07:24.540> yes<00:07:25.350> well<00:07:25.770> I<00:07:25.800> thought<00:07:26.100> it<00:07:26.190> was

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 
premiere show yes well I thought it was

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.160 
premiere show yes well I thought it was
very<00:07:26.460> bold<00:07:26.730> and<00:07:26.970> inspirational<00:07:27.630> what<00:07:27.810> you<00:07:27.960> did

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.170 
very bold and inspirational what you did

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.960 
very bold and inspirational what you did
showing<00:07:28.680> your<00:07:28.800> real<00:07:28.980> hair<00:07:29.160> I<00:07:29.400> thought<00:07:29.820> it<00:07:29.880> was

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:29.970 
showing your real hair I thought it was

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.030 
showing your real hair I thought it was
very<00:07:30.120> empowering<00:07:30.500> but<00:07:31.500> there's<00:07:31.890> just<00:07:31.950> a

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:32.040 
very empowering but there's just a

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.500 
very empowering but there's just a
little<00:07:32.160> confusion<00:07:32.580> about<00:07:32.730> was<00:07:33.030> it<00:07:33.150> your<00:07:33.270> veal

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:33.510 
little confusion about was it your veal

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.420 
little confusion about was it your veal
or<00:07:33.780> your<00:07:33.930> natural<00:07:34.380> hair<00:07:34.560> because<00:07:35.160> I<00:07:35.250> know<00:07:35.370> you

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.430 
or your natural hair because I know you

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.970 
or your natural hair because I know you
had<00:07:35.670> some<00:07:35.880> women<00:07:36.150> and<00:07:36.360> yeah<00:07:37.200> up<00:07:37.470> on<00:07:37.590> this<00:07:37.680> on

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:37.980 
had some women and yeah up on this on

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.890 
had some women and yeah up on this on
the<00:07:38.160> show<00:07:38.340> touching<00:07:38.760> your<00:07:38.910> hair<00:07:39.120> so<00:07:39.690> it<00:07:39.750> must

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 
the show touching your hair so it must

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.200 
the show touching your hair so it must
have<00:07:39.930> been<00:07:40.080> real<00:07:40.380> but<00:07:40.800> then<00:07:41.010> I<00:07:41.040> read<00:07:41.700> on<00:07:41.850> a<00:07:41.880> blog

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.210 
have been real but then I read on a blog

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.850 
have been real but then I read on a blog
that<00:07:42.240> if<00:07:42.540> it<00:07:42.630> was<00:07:42.750> your<00:07:42.900> natural<00:07:43.320> hair<00:07:43.500> it

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860 
that if it was your natural hair it

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.530 
that if it was your natural hair it
wouldn't<00:07:44.070> have<00:07:44.160> had<00:07:44.280> the<00:07:44.400> relaxer<00:07:45.000> and<00:07:45.270> then

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:45.540 
wouldn't have had the relaxer and then

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.440 
wouldn't have had the relaxer and then
yeah<00:07:45.870> I<00:07:46.200> mean<00:07:46.320> it<00:07:46.500> is<00:07:46.650> 100%<00:07:47.490> absolutely

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:48.450 
yeah I mean it is 100% absolutely

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.200 
yeah I mean it is 100% absolutely
impossible<00:07:48.930> to<00:07:49.560> show<00:07:49.830> what<00:07:50.070> my<00:07:50.220> natural<00:07:50.880> hair

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:51.210 
impossible to show what my natural hair

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.740 
impossible to show what my natural hair
looks<00:07:51.690> like<00:07:51.960> because<00:07:52.410> that<00:07:52.590> would<00:07:53.040> take<00:07:53.750> five

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:54.750 
looks like because that would take five

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.780 
looks like because that would take five
years<00:07:55.170> probably<00:07:55.650> for<00:07:55.830> all<00:07:55.860> my<00:07:56.310> hair<00:07:56.520> to<00:07:56.640> grow

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:56.790 
years probably for all my hair to grow

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.700 
years probably for all my hair to grow
out<00:07:56.880> and<00:07:57.360> for<00:07:57.510> you<00:07:57.570> to<00:07:57.720> see<00:07:57.930> what<00:07:58.140> my<00:07:58.290> natural

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:58.710 
out and for you to see what my natural

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.560 
out and for you to see what my natural
hair<00:07:58.830> looks<00:07:59.070> like<00:07:59.190> without<00:07:59.340> relaxers<00:08:00.300> and<00:08:00.330> the

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:00.570 
hair looks like without relaxers and the

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.630 
hair looks like without relaxers and the
chemicals<00:08:01.020> that<00:08:01.080> I<00:08:01.410> used<00:08:01.920> to<00:08:02.070> straighten<00:08:02.490> my

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:02.640 
chemicals that I used to straighten my

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.810 
chemicals that I used to straighten my
hair<00:08:02.670> so<00:08:03.570> no<00:08:04.050> it<00:08:04.230> wasn't<00:08:04.560> the<00:08:04.680> natural<00:08:05.370> hair<00:08:05.670> of

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:05.820 
hair so no it wasn't the natural hair of

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.990 
hair so no it wasn't the natural hair of
what<00:08:06.060> God<00:08:06.420> gave<00:08:06.990> me<00:08:07.440> in<00:08:07.590> terms<00:08:07.860> of<00:08:08.100> the<00:08:08.250> texture

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 
what God gave me in terms of the texture

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.260 
what God gave me in terms of the texture
but<00:08:09.750> it<00:08:09.990> was<00:08:10.290> the<00:08:10.530> natural<00:08:11.130> is<00:08:11.370> the<00:08:11.550> real<00:08:11.820> hair

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.270 
but it was the natural is the real hair

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.740 
but it was the natural is the real hair
with<00:08:12.960> no<00:08:12.990> tracks
