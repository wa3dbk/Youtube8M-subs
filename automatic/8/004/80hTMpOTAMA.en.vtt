throwing cancels at you guys
the<00:00:18.900> reason<00:00:19.320> being<00:00:20.300> cancels<00:00:21.300> are<00:00:21.570> uber<00:00:22.350> uber

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
the reason being cancels are uber uber

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.640 
the reason being cancels are uber uber
important<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.310> what<00:00:23.519> they<00:00:23.640> offer<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.210> is

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
basically a speed boost

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.410 
basically a speed boost
so<00:00:28.740> that's<00:00:29.340> your<00:00:29.460> tilt<00:00:29.730> cancelling<00:00:30.150> let's<00:00:30.330> see

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
so that's your tilt cancelling let's see

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.519 
so that's your tilt cancelling let's see
if<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.660> get<00:00:30.779> some<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.990> these<00:00:31.050> cancels<00:00:31.439> on

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
if I can get some of these cancels on

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.970 
if I can get some of these cancels on
this<00:00:31.650> guy<00:00:31.769> now<00:00:32.030> let's<00:00:33.030> see<00:00:33.120> if<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.270> good

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
this guy now let's see if I'm good

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.720 
this guy now let's see if I'm good
that<00:00:34.980> moves<00:00:35.190> last<00:00:35.399> forever<00:00:35.579> all<00:00:36.000> right<00:00:36.090> so

that moves last forever all right so
that's<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:38.850> tilt<00:00:39.149> canceling<00:00:39.570> that's<00:00:39.719> your

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
that's your tilt canceling that's your

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.240 
that's your tilt canceling that's your
grab<00:00:39.989> cancelling<00:00:40.530> that's<00:00:40.680> your<00:00:40.800> jump<00:00:40.980> vanish

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
grab cancelling that's your jump vanish

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.770 
grab cancelling that's your jump vanish
cancelling<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.030> know<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.480> oh

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
your tilt cancel oh wow when you block

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.069 
your tilt cancel oh wow when you block
it<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.370> doesn't<00:00:50.520> work<00:00:50.640> though<00:00:51.149> alright<00:00:51.960> let's

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
it it doesn't work though alright let's

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.040

try it again so cancel there we go so
the<00:00:55.440> illusion<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.920> speed<00:00:56.219> well<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.760> even<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
the illusion of speed well not even the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.119 
the illusion of speed well not even the
illusion<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.360> speed<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.960> literal<00:00:58.559> speed<00:00:58.890> is

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
illusion of speed that literal speed is

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.410 
illusion of speed that literal speed is
being<00:00:59.460> given<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.059> um<00:01:01.250> it's<00:01:02.250> completely<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.300> me

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
being given and um it's completely to me

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.990 
being given and um it's completely to me
to<00:01:03.899> me<00:01:04.019> anyway<00:01:04.320> speed<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.010> very<00:01:05.100> necessary<00:01:05.430> for

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
to me anyway speed is very necessary for

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.480 
to me anyway speed is very necessary for
anything<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.080> do<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.619> any<00:01:08.070> game<00:01:10.490> point-blank

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
is I'm gonna try to get a grab cancel on

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.749 
is I'm gonna try to get a grab cancel on
this<00:01:15.479> guy<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:16.409> only<00:01:16.770> remember<00:01:17.280> how<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> grab

look at that grab cancel so all the
cancels<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.670> taught<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.970> guys<00:01:24.119> add<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
cancels that I taught you guys add to

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.719 
cancels that I taught you guys add to
the<00:01:24.840> speed<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.380> things<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.100> do<00:01:26.280> your

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the speed of things that you do your

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.429 
the speed of things that you do your
jump<00:01:26.909> vanish<00:01:27.270> cancels<00:01:27.659> your<00:01:27.750> tilt<00:01:28.020> cancels

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
jump vanish cancels your tilt cancels

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.840 
jump vanish cancels your tilt cancels
your<00:01:30.200> your<00:01:31.200> step<00:01:31.829> cancels<00:01:32.250> let's<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:32.790> I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
your your step cancels let's see if I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.420 
your your step cancels let's see if I
can<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.030> him<00:01:33.119> with<00:01:33.240> some<00:01:33.360> step<00:01:33.540> cancels<00:01:33.930> too

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
can get him with some step cancels too

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.740 
can get him with some step cancels too
you<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.880> sorry<00:01:36.150> dude<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.540> follow

shoe that I've been showing you guys are
actually<00:02:41.680> pretty<00:02:42.160> practical<00:02:42.460> in<00:02:43.330> terms<00:02:43.870> of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
actually pretty practical in terms of

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.210 
actually pretty practical in terms of
step<00:02:44.170> cancelling<00:02:44.590> step<00:02:44.770> cancelling<00:02:45.160> is

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
step cancelling step cancelling is

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.290 
step cancelling step cancelling is
something<00:02:45.490> that<00:02:45.610> is<00:02:45.700> really<00:02:45.970> mainly

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
something that is really mainly

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.330 
something that is really mainly

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
blocking your attack step cancelling can

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.120 
blocking your attack step cancelling can
really<00:02:55.270> come<00:02:55.510> in<00:02:55.630> handy<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:56.110> get<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.740> out<00:02:56.980> of
