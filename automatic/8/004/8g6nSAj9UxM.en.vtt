00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.850
 beasley presents and are welcome to 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.890
 this tutorial of the legend of zelda 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.439
 older more than nintendo 64 is very 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.210
 simple is basically pause the flower it 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.189
 He adjudicate it is not anywhere 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.480
 be in the temples with the final bosses 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.390
 since this mask has that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.040
 restriction that you can use when 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.080
 are you going to fight against some boss of the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.320
 four temples or against the last one that is 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.320
 the oldest now know him and good 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.090
 we basically need to put the mask 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.519
 Sora and refer to more than 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.030
 obviously and well there are several methods 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.680
 I'm going to teach you three methods the way 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.070
 easy normal mode and mode 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.890
 let's say it like that, no, and good in 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.870
 yes what we have to do for the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.399
 Easy easier let's practice 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.340
 easy since this you have to practice 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.550
 so that you leave if not because it is something 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.920
 difficult if it's easy the cliché is a 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.330
 cliché that we are going to make but with 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.490
 practices share that it's pretty easy 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.380
 at the beginning because it confuses you 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.210
 little and you do not know what to do then good 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.010
 here you are transported to wright 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.290
 bay coast and we have to go this 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.080
 small part of the left that is like 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.930
 like an island and what we have 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.409
 what to fix is ​​that the water touches the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.610
 fins of the sun to linz now more or 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.650
 less that level as you are seeing in 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.840
 screen and good we proceed to take ourselves 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.280
 the mask we are going to dive with link and 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.350
 when we touch the bottom we put another 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.549
 time the zone mask after this 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.310
 we started to press the button see 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.990
 repeatedly together with the c button where 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.549
 is the soda mask this is going to do 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.930
 that the b button be made to us as 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.790
 transparent 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.799
 then we swim in 100 front and we do not know 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.770
 makes a button look bright and we put the 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.170
 mask first day where was that of 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.939
 soda and this makes us already put the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.380
 mask without any problem said is something 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.060
 complicated I'm going to leave them all 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.070
 modes down here in the description I'm going 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.229
 written the tutorial in case I did not 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.729
 they understood very well in all this but 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.250
 as they saw I do not know what can also 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.709
 keep watching nothing else the video and good 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.440
 is that is the only disadvantage that has 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.940
 there is that you can not leave from that 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.950
 part then you can not enter the cloud 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.829
 nor to other places so good what 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.200
 we can do here in ends in it then 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.280
 in this one he took this puddle that here 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.530
 it's the same procedure here 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.720
 with lync when it touches the ground we put 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.520
 the soda mask and we started to squeeze 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.650
 the button sees like crazy along with the 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.270
 button I know where the mask is and here 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.520
 we swim across until we are 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.709
 when through the button it looks bright and 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.410
 then we put the firs and others where 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.830
 bullet rope and ready we put it and already 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.959
 we are the first team the lic and good is 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.270
 very very very powerful and it's a link that 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.040
 because the game itself does not leave us not 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.750
 alone does not let us do this but 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.459
 because with this gray we take advantage of it and 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.260
 ready and good that was the normal way 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.959
 the way professional calls more or 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.489
 less to aim the look is it and when 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.380
 you're going to touch the ground start squeezing 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.970
 he will be repeatedly and good will do 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.250
 the same procedures as with 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.769
 us and ready this does not require 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.569
 remove the mask and do not stay 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.760
 that being that link and it's a way 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.500
 as that faster more functional between 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.390
 quotes this is already when you have 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.040
 practiced is not the latter that ends 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.040
 to show I do not recommend it towards 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.330
 any all and good recommendations 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.920
 do not talk to many of the characters 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.940
 since the game was after being 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.069
 stuck when you talk to someone 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.420
 especially it is dwarf that is there the 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.700
 little brother 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.739
 the little dwarf and good also when 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.800
 you start to explode and you can not go out 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.970
 you can not take it off either because 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.650
 well at the end of the video I will say 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.390
 comfortable how do you take off this this glitch 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.190
 never go to talk to the scene 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.349
 scene does not lock the game 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.020
 and I'm not going to save it either 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.750
 save being the feeling unless 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.850
 They want to ruin their super file 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.800
 it's more in this case I have 100% 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.530
 then I would I would if safe 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.870
 It even gives me one thing to do this guy 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.239
 of clichés because I do not know with any 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.540
 then recruit then there and water it not to 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.160
 water with you with you while 64 many 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.319
 they play it in emulator then also 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.150
 emulator also serve his so 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.250
 I make this video many remain in 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.799
 emulator not on the nintendo or even 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.900
 you can also get to play in the 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.790
 wii virtual console and good similiar 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.639
 in this in annals something curious comes out as 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.100
 that the credit that is there but not 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.600
 it does not tell us anything and good also here is 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.820
 a good example of how high is the 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.220
 how they see here in this little house of 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.530
 the fury is quite pretty huge 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.780
 the link and it's very very powerful I do not say is 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.570
 a link that many already know 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.920
 but I also made this video because there 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.870
 many videos that only explain it in 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.940
 English and that also explain it as well as 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.190
 that very slow and the quality of the video does not 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.680
 it's good and then everything to take away 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.480
 said you just have to go where 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.630
 there is a puddle in this case the ocean 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.160
 and he's going to let you put on the mask and nothing 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.410
 so then leave if you want more 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.300
 videos like that and I have some glitches for 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.190
 there of what they are also being 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.460
 ocarina of time and mayas more with the 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.889
 clichés that serve them are are classics 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.230
 these speed reuters that are on your tv 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.090
 and the truth is they are milks that are 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.070
 easy easy ones once practicing the 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.440
 and that allow you to reach places where 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.960
 before the place did not arrive is before 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.000
 time that is they are milks that make a 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.460
 Little fun the game to my liking is 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.870
 but it's about to know then in 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.030
 down here if you want more of this type 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.410
 of clichés or if not because then I do not know 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.690
 but I see everyone especially my 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.419
 channel play in this type of games 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.010
 but this is a great game, including 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.630
 ocarina in silos cells in two cells 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.850
 for me they make me pretty good 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.370
 then do not leave it down here if you 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.070
 they want and then comment subscribe and from 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.270
 Milestones above 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.490
 Thank you 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.710
 comes and comes alone with this that 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.440
 I always bring them then but rather 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.540
 of minutes the account to wish to whom 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.880
 it faces clearer the water radio in 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.800
 60 art has not forgiven will 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.510
 leave us in an environment without this and 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.940
 my level or so that those who are not with 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.010
 its height not killing every garbage 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.610
 novices who presume good have no 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.500
 Cook 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.690
 diego and they back it line a sweet of 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.460
 recipes many lying glasses 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.290
 they want and nine so to see that their 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.080
 brother to see that many fit 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.520
 they have come like you and he does not lower himself 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.440
 it's a good time he started to grab 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.690
 the flights but do not get me wrong 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.920
 always with your feet on the ground help 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.920
 who deserves an effort
