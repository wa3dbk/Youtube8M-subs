00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.380
 aha the ball was in the air could 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.720
 under 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:34.410
 Russell before filing such trouble Benzema 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.410
 blow question 21 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.300
 bamos ramos 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.310
 look again marcela submits again he 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.250
 participating benzema's scoring attack full 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.350
 is not offside by the way, too, Benzema 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.450
 if benzema would have been looking for I can 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.130
 Immediately made the transfer to the frame of the son, too 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.170
 look at benzema two rush 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.140
 the goalkeeper in the corner ie benzema chances 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.250
 score was not much just hit with 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.199
 mad power and horseback or 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.060
 bottom in the most for the left flank come 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.399
 threat like now was benzema squad and 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.500
 Here it turned out that Benzema 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.920
 did not pierce he could only pierce weakly 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.630
 in order not to be semi naked 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.960
 so good transfer gareth bale 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.509
 Watch it again hero goes Rul'e 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.700
 well here it is not so provocative 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.250
 moment in half time when remember 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.250
 ran a hero him steering wheel on karim benzema 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.549
 low gasoline 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.690
 he 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.960
 I think the suit did not believe this at 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.049
 will be scoring but how does kareem fall 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.549
 benzema 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.270
 one such goal 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:59.200
 probably 5 misses on an empty goal 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.710
 can throw away the memory benin from the memory 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.710
