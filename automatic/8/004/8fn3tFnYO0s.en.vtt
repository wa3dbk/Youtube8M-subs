brother's<00:02:51.060> got<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.270> couple<00:02:51.480> parts<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:52.050> one<00:02:52.110> of

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
brother's got a couple parts for one of

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.979 
brother's got a couple parts for one of
these<00:02:52.320> for<00:02:52.950> one<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.190> he<00:02:53.310> had<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.390> think<00:02:54.900> he

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
these for one that he had so I think he

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.710 
these for one that he had so I think he
said<00:02:55.140> he<00:02:55.200> has<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.620> coils<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.850> if<00:02:57.450> set

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
said he has the coils for it so if set

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.000 
said he has the coils for it so if set
I'm<00:02:57.780> going<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.959> try<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.080> swap<00:02:58.410> out<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.620> coils

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
I'm going to try to swap out the coils

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.530 
I'm going to try to swap out the coils
if<00:02:59.310> I'm<00:02:59.519> not<00:02:59.640> getting<00:02:59.790> spark<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.269> see<00:03:00.390> if<00:03:00.450> that

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
if I'm not getting spark to see if that

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.360 
if I'm not getting spark to see if that
fixes<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.930> I'm<00:03:01.830> gonna<00:03:01.920> get<00:03:02.070> all<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.220> plastic

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
fixes it I'm gonna get all the plastic

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.000 
fixes it I'm gonna get all the plastic
off<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.450> tank<00:03:03.660> off<00:03:03.810> actually<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.410> took<00:03:04.769> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
off the tank off actually I took the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.039 
off the tank off actually I took the
tank<00:03:05.190> off<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.370> minute<00:03:05.700> ago<00:03:05.880> so<00:03:06.030> it's<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.209> just

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
tank off a minute ago so it's just just

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.280 
tank off a minute ago so it's just just
sitting<00:03:07.260> here<00:03:07.680> um<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.850> video<00:03:11.780> as<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.959> can<00:03:12.989> see

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
sitting here um the video as you can see

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.400 
sitting here um the video as you can see
here<00:03:13.470> we<00:03:13.560> got<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:15.420> fuel<00:03:15.720> pump<00:03:16.019> for

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
here we got the fuel pump for

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.150 
here we got the fuel pump for
carburetors<00:03:19.410> I'm<00:03:19.530> sure<00:03:19.709> they<00:03:19.829> need<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.070> be

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
carburetors I'm sure they need to be

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.030 
carburetors I'm sure they need to be
cleaned<00:03:20.780> with<00:03:21.780> as<00:03:21.900> promised<00:03:22.290> it's<00:03:22.500> not<00:03:22.650> stuck

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
cleaned with as promised it's not stuck

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.400 
cleaned with as promised it's not stuck
when<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.549> do<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.790> throttle<00:03:24.180> I'm<00:03:25.110> gonna<00:03:25.230> get<00:03:25.350> the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
when I do the throttle I'm gonna get the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.080 
when I do the throttle I'm gonna get the
airbox<00:03:25.650> off<00:03:25.920> if<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.160> can<00:03:26.280> get<00:03:26.400> spark<00:03:26.730> I'm<00:03:26.910> just

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
airbox off if I can get spark I'm just

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.840 
airbox off if I can get spark I'm just
guessing<00:03:27.420> maybe<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.350> little<00:03:29.160> bit<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.310> starter

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
guessing maybe a little bit of starter

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.009 
guessing maybe a little bit of starter
fluid<00:03:30.000> down<00:03:30.269> in<00:03:30.360> there<00:03:30.480> see<00:03:30.630> if<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.720> can<00:03:30.840> get<00:03:30.930> the

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
fluid down in there see if I can get the

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.560 
fluid down in there see if I can get the
things<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:32.030> least<00:03:33.079> stumble<00:03:34.079> or<00:03:34.230> maybe<00:03:34.410> start

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
things to a least stumble or maybe start

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.800 
things to a least stumble or maybe start
to<00:03:36.570> see<00:03:36.750> what's<00:03:36.930> going<00:03:37.140> on<00:03:37.230> but<00:03:37.739> uh<00:03:38.600> my<00:03:39.600> brother

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
to see what's going on but uh my brother

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.569 
to see what's going on but uh my brother
told<00:03:40.049> me<00:03:40.170> that<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.410> should<00:03:40.620> try<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.829> get<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.519> the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
told me that I should try to get on the

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.150 
told me that I should try to get on the
road<00:03:43.760> my<00:03:44.780> goal<00:03:45.780> or<00:03:46.140> something<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:46.920> would<00:03:47.040> like

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
road my goal or something I would like

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.670 
road my goal or something I would like
to<00:03:47.280> do<00:03:47.430> is<00:03:47.640> turn<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.510> into<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.870> four-wheeler<00:03:49.140> or

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
to do is turn it into a four-wheeler or

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.140 
to do is turn it into a four-wheeler or
an<00:03:49.769> ATV<00:03:51.200> like<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.350> see<00:03:52.590> on<00:03:52.620> on<00:03:53.400> YouTube<00:03:53.850> where

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
an ATV like you see on on YouTube where

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.750 
an ATV like you see on on YouTube where
they<00:03:54.269> have<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.420> CBR<00:03:54.870> engine<00:03:55.350> or<00:03:56.040> CBR<00:03:56.640> they

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
they have a CBR engine or CBR they

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.830 
they have a CBR engine or CBR they
turned<00:03:57.000> into<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.239> four-wheeler<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.660> think

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
turned into a four-wheeler I think

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.509 
turned into a four-wheeler I think
that'd<00:03:57.959> be<00:03:57.989> pretty<00:03:58.079> neat<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:59.010> make<00:03:59.190> some<00:03:59.370> good

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
that'd be pretty neat and make some good

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.620 
that'd be pretty neat and make some good
videos<00:04:00.049> making<00:04:02.120> so<00:04:03.120> that's<00:04:03.269> what<00:04:03.390> I<00:04:03.420> got<00:04:03.570> in

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
videos making so that's what I got in

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.789 
videos making so that's what I got in
the<00:04:03.690> back<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.900> my<00:04:03.989> mind<00:04:04.110> now<00:04:04.350> for<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:06.769> anyway<00:04:07.769> I

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
the back of my mind now for it anyway I

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.140 
the back of my mind now for it anyway I
paid<00:04:08.160> 125<00:04:09.030> bucks<00:04:09.239> for<00:04:09.540> it

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
paid 125 bucks for it

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.199 
paid 125 bucks for it
so<00:04:12.150> not<00:04:12.360> not<00:04:12.989> too<00:04:13.379> bad<00:04:13.590> on<00:04:13.769> that<00:04:13.830> so<00:04:14.280> taking<00:04:15.120> it

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
so not not too bad on that so taking it

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.120 
so not not too bad on that so taking it
apart<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:15.690> turn<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.769> into<00:04:16.889> some<00:04:17.190> sort<00:04:17.220> of<00:04:17.459> a

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
apart and turn it into some sort of a

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.700 
apart and turn it into some sort of a
four-wheeler<00:04:20.130> would<00:04:20.609> be<00:04:20.729> a<00:04:21.260> pretty<00:04:22.260> neat<00:04:22.350> and

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
four-wheeler would be a pretty neat and

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.320 
four-wheeler would be a pretty neat and
not<00:04:22.800> cost<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.370> whole<00:04:23.490> lot<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:25.770> then<00:04:26.699> if<00:04:26.880> that

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
not cost a whole lot and then if that

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.430 
not cost a whole lot and then if that
doesn't<00:04:27.389> work<00:04:27.720> that<00:04:27.930> getting<00:04:28.110> something<00:04:28.229> else

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
doesn't work that getting something else

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.240 
doesn't work that getting something else
with<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:28.800> guess

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
with it I guess

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.540 
with it I guess
but<00:04:29.729> uh<00:04:29.760> I<00:04:30.120> don't<00:04:30.810> know<00:04:30.960> if<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.110> really<00:04:31.490> want<00:04:32.490> to

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
but uh I don't know if I really want to

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.810 
but uh I don't know if I really want to
put<00:04:32.639> on<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:32.790> street<00:04:33.000> or<00:04:33.210> not<00:04:37.190> but<00:04:38.190> anyway<00:04:38.610> well

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
put on the street or not but anyway well

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.280 
put on the street or not but anyway well

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
four-wheelers and stuff and he actually

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.010 
four-wheelers and stuff and he actually
had<00:05:14.010> a<00:05:14.039> CBR<00:05:14.370> on<00:05:14.610> there<00:05:14.729> recently<00:05:15.150> and<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:15.840> told

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
had a CBR on there recently and I told

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.260 
had a CBR on there recently and I told
him<00:05:16.260> that<00:05:16.289> I<00:05:16.470> needed<00:05:17.400> to<00:05:17.580> turn<00:05:17.789> it<00:05:17.910> into<00:05:18.000> an<00:05:18.150> 8

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
him that I needed to turn it into an 8

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.659 
him that I needed to turn it into an 8
ATV<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.650> that<00:05:19.860> kind<00:05:20.039> of<00:05:20.070> got<00:05:20.190> me<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.430> idea

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
ATV and that kind of got me the idea

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.469 
ATV and that kind of got me the idea
that<00:05:20.729> I<00:05:20.849> needed<00:05:20.970> to<00:05:21.120> find<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.419> bike<00:05:23.360> similar<00:05:24.360> to

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
that I needed to find a bike similar to

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.680 
that I needed to find a bike similar to
that<00:05:24.599> so<00:05:24.810> I<00:05:24.870> could<00:05:24.930> do<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.169> same<00:05:25.320> thing<00:05:25.380> I

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
that so I could do the same thing I

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.570 
that so I could do the same thing I
don't<00:05:27.690> think<00:05:27.840> that's<00:05:28.020> what<00:05:28.110> he's<00:05:28.200> doing<00:05:28.320> but

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
don't think that's what he's doing but

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.760 
don't think that's what he's doing but
yeah<00:05:29.580> I<00:05:29.849> think<00:05:29.940> it'd<00:05:30.180> be<00:05:30.240> pretty<00:05:30.389> neat<00:05:30.770> but

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
yeah I think it'd be pretty neat but

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.930 
yeah I think it'd be pretty neat but
actually<00:05:32.220> I'm<00:05:32.280> gonna<00:05:32.370> put<00:05:32.550> this<00:05:32.639> on<00:05:32.760> his

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
actually I'm gonna put this on his

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.260 
actually I'm gonna put this on his
channel<00:05:33.180> as<00:05:33.389> a<00:05:33.419> response<00:05:33.919> so<00:05:34.919> he<00:05:35.849> actually<00:05:36.000> had

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
channel as a response so he actually had

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.550 
channel as a response so he actually had
CBR<00:05:36.750> that<00:05:36.840> was<00:05:36.930> running<00:05:37.139> I<00:05:37.200> don't<00:05:37.320> know<00:05:37.380> if<00:05:37.470> he
