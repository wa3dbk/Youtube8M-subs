birds<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.630> basically<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.890> point<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.400> is

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
birds and basically the point of this is

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.020 
birds and basically the point of this is
like<00:02:20.300> in<00:02:20.450> Angry<00:02:20.600> Birds<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:22.550> know<00:02:22.670> launch
