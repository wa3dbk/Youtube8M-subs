00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
okay guys so I've been looking at the

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.919 
okay guys so I've been looking at the
air<00:00:01.740> intake<00:00:02.129> system<00:00:02.520> on<00:00:02.639> this<00:00:02.760> car<00:00:02.970> and<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.840> be

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
air intake system on this car and to be

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.110 
air intake system on this car and to be
honest<00:00:04.200> I'm<00:00:04.350> not<00:00:04.380> really<00:00:04.589> happy<00:00:05.100> with<00:00:05.250> so<00:00:06.000> the

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
honest I'm not really happy with so the

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.810 
honest I'm not really happy with so the
factory<00:00:06.480> intake<00:00:06.810> pipe<00:00:07.140> comes<00:00:08.069> around<00:00:08.429> here<00:00:08.700> in

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
factory intake pipe comes around here in

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.330 
factory intake pipe comes around here in
a<00:00:08.880> 180<00:00:09.269> degree<00:00:09.630> angle<00:00:09.809> so<00:00:10.200> that's<00:00:11.040> not<00:00:11.219> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
a 180 degree angle so that's not the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.039 
a 180 degree angle so that's not the
best<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.670> start<00:00:11.910> off<00:00:12.030> with<00:00:12.210> it's<00:00:12.690> made<00:00:12.840> out<00:00:12.990> of

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
best to start off with it's made out of

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.670 
best to start off with it's made out of
this<00:00:13.230> hard<00:00:14.160> semi<00:00:14.670> flexible<00:00:14.969> plastic<00:00:15.650> which<00:00:16.650> is

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
this hard semi flexible plastic which is

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.939 
this hard semi flexible plastic which is
alright<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:17.550> we've<00:00:18.270> got<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.480> mount<00:00:18.630> this

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
alright but we've got to mount this

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.429 
alright but we've got to mount this
nitrous<00:00:19.949> fogger<00:00:20.240> around<00:00:21.240> six<00:00:21.960> inches<00:00:22.289> away

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
nitrous fogger around six inches away

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.929 
nitrous fogger around six inches away
from<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.830> throttle<00:00:23.130> body<00:00:23.310> okay<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:25.939> you're

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
from the throttle body okay so you're

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.550 
from the throttle body okay so you're
not<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.300> end<00:00:27.570> up<00:00:27.689> with<00:00:27.840> much<00:00:28.019> room<00:00:28.320> here

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
not going to end up with much room here

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.929 
not going to end up with much room here
it's<00:00:28.710> got<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.890> be<00:00:28.980> mounted<00:00:29.340> right<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> back

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
it's got to be mounted right in the back

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.110 
it's got to be mounted right in the back
but<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.840> got<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.019> be<00:00:31.050> mounted<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.560> way<00:00:31.769> so

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
but it's got to be mounted that way so

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.139 
but it's got to be mounted that way so
it<00:00:33.120> sprays<00:00:33.510> towards<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.170> throttle<00:00:34.910> okay<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:35.969> I

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
it sprays towards the throttle okay so I

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.250 
it sprays towards the throttle okay so I
don't<00:00:36.360> think<00:00:36.630> we've<00:00:36.780> got<00:00:36.870> enough<00:00:37.020> material

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
don't think we've got enough material

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.340 
don't think we've got enough material
there<00:00:37.649> really<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.430> work<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.260> I'm

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
there really to work with so what I'm

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.810 
there really to work with so what I'm
thinking<00:00:40.680> about<00:00:40.770> doing<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.489> want<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> get

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
thinking about doing and I want to get

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.639 
thinking about doing and I want to get
some<00:00:42.030> cold<00:00:42.270> air<00:00:42.480> into<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.930> engine<00:00:43.290> anyway

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
some cold air into this engine anyway

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.940 
some cold air into this engine anyway
he's<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.520> through<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> bonnet<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.230> I'll

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
he's going through the bonnet so I'll

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.979 
he's going through the bonnet so I'll
make<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.520> I'll<00:00:47.879> get<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.239> steel<00:00:48.510> pipe<00:00:48.750> I've

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
make up it I'll get this steel pipe I've

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.299 
make up it I'll get this steel pipe I've
got<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.440> okay<00:00:50.070> three<00:00:50.370> inch<00:00:50.489> steel<00:00:50.760> pipe<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
got here okay three inch steel pipe and

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.880 
got here okay three inch steel pipe and
cut<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:54.210> know<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> certain<00:00:55.289> length<00:00:55.500> over

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
cut it you know to a certain length over

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.650 
cut it you know to a certain length over
the<00:00:55.980> rocket<00:00:56.309> cover<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.300> build<00:00:57.539> up

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the rocket cover here and then build up

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660 
the rocket cover here and then build up
a<00:00:57.870> scoop<00:00:58.260> hanging<00:00:58.890> off<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> top<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.370> this

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
a scoop hanging off the top of this

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.110 
a scoop hanging off the top of this
steel<00:01:00.449> pipe<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.430> get<00:01:02.550> some<00:01:02.699> cold<00:01:02.969> air

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
steel pipe so we can get some cold air

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.080 
steel pipe so we can get some cold air
into<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.510> engine<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.350> well<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.700> it

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
into this engine as well and then it

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.390 
into this engine as well and then it
also<00:01:06.360> give<00:01:06.750> me<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> somewhere<00:01:07.560> nice<00:01:07.799> to

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
also give me a somewhere nice to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.219 
also give me a somewhere nice to
position<00:01:09.270> our<00:01:09.450> nitrous<00:01:09.869> fogger

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
position our nitrous fogger

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.710 
position our nitrous fogger
and<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.430> nitrous<00:01:12.030> spraying<00:01:12.360> into<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and get the nitrous spraying into the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.859 
and get the nitrous spraying into the
engine<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> right<00:01:13.409> way<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.860> well<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.970> we'll

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
engine in the right way as well so we'll

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.420 
engine in the right way as well so we'll
have<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.080> double<00:01:16.259> purpose<00:01:16.619> getting<00:01:17.009> cold<00:01:17.250> air

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
have a double purpose getting cold air

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.340 
have a double purpose getting cold air
into<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> engine<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.210> then<00:01:18.540> adding<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
into the engine and then adding the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.679 
into the engine and then adding the
nitrous<00:01:19.500> as<00:01:19.890> well<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> take

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
nitrous as well so it's going to take

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.300 
nitrous as well so it's going to take
some<00:01:21.960> creative<00:01:22.350> thinking<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.860> welding<00:01:23.220> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
some creative thinking and welding and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.080 
some creative thinking and welding and
cutting<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.600> reckon<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.140> do<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
cutting but I reckon we can do it and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.700 
cutting but I reckon we can do it and
yeah<00:01:27.090> probably<00:01:27.689> make<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.140> look<00:01:28.290> half<00:01:28.470> decent

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
yeah probably make it look half decent

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.980 
yeah probably make it look half decent
as<00:01:28.979> well<00:01:29.159> we'll<00:01:29.700> see<00:01:29.880> how<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.090> go

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
as well we'll see how we go

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:40.139 
as well we'll see how we go

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
hey need to get cold air in the engine

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.720 
hey need to get cold air in the engine
and<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.440> easiest<00:02:23.769> way<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.010> do<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.370> for

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
and this is the easiest way to do it for

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.830 
and this is the easiest way to do it for
$0<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:26.200> anyway<00:02:26.940> what<00:02:27.940> I'm<00:02:28.060> gonna<00:02:28.180> have<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.510> do

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
$0 so anyway what I'm gonna have to do

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.949 
$0 so anyway what I'm gonna have to do
I've<00:02:29.739> done<00:02:30.010> some<00:02:30.280> welding<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.269> tacked<00:02:31.690> some

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
I've done some welding and tacked some

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.410 
I've done some welding and tacked some
stuff<00:02:32.200> together<00:02:32.379> but<00:02:32.829> yeah<00:02:33.760> welding<00:02:34.269> this

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
stuff together but yeah welding this

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.960 
stuff together but yeah welding this
stuff<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.750> going<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.900> be<00:02:34.959> pretty<00:02:35.170> hard<00:02:35.349> so

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
stuff is going to be pretty hard so

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.309 
stuff is going to be pretty hard so
figure<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.120> next<00:02:37.420> best<00:02:37.660> thing<00:02:37.840> would<00:02:38.260> be

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
figure the next best thing would be

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.990 
figure the next best thing would be
silver<00:02:39.250> solder<00:02:39.489> so<00:02:41.250> break<00:02:42.250> out<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.549> blowtorch

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
silver solder so break out the blowtorch

00:02:43.000 --> 00:03:11.190 
silver solder so break out the blowtorch
and<00:02:43.420> do<00:02:43.660> some<00:02:43.870> burning

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.610 

both<00:03:11.710> wet<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:12.550> gloomy<00:03:12.880> today<00:03:13.240> and<00:03:13.690> now<00:03:14.470> I've

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
both wet and gloomy today and now I've

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.670 
both wet and gloomy today and now I've
been<00:03:14.800> working<00:03:14.980> on<00:03:15.250> this<00:03:15.430> intake<00:03:16.300> now<00:03:17.020> I<00:03:17.410> know<00:03:17.530> a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
been working on this intake now I know a

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.850 
been working on this intake now I know a
few<00:03:17.950> of<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.310> weren't<00:03:19.090> happy<00:03:19.720> with<00:03:19.900> what<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.680> was

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
few of you weren't happy with what I was

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.430 
few of you weren't happy with what I was
doing<00:03:20.890> but<00:03:21.459> hey<00:03:21.970> we're<00:03:22.690> gonna<00:03:22.780> get<00:03:22.990> cold<00:03:23.260> air

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
doing but hey we're gonna get cold air

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.470 
doing but hey we're gonna get cold air
into<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.800> engine<00:03:24.069> somehow<00:03:24.490> and<00:03:24.730> this<00:03:25.209> seemed

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
into the engine somehow and this seemed

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.810 
into the engine somehow and this seemed
to<00:03:25.569> be<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.840> easiest<00:03:26.140> way<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.380> do<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.770> so<00:03:26.920> anyway

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
to be the easiest way to do it so anyway

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.530 
to be the easiest way to do it so anyway
I've<00:03:28.680> been<00:03:29.680> working<00:03:30.130> hard<00:03:30.370> on<00:03:30.490> it<00:03:30.640> and<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:31.270> think

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
I've been working hard on it and I think

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.520 
I've been working hard on it and I think
we've<00:03:31.660> come<00:03:31.870> up<00:03:31.900> with<00:03:32.140> something<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.500> looks

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
we've come up with something that looks

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.260 
we've come up with something that looks
all<00:03:32.860> right<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:33.459> know<00:03:33.580> it's<00:03:33.730> not<00:03:33.820> fantastic

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
all right you know it's not fantastic

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.050 
all right you know it's not fantastic
but<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.830> should<00:03:36.130> be<00:03:36.160> pretty<00:03:36.370> functional<00:03:36.760> as

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
but it should be pretty functional as

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.160 
but it should be pretty functional as
well<00:03:37.239> so<00:03:38.080> that's<00:03:38.410> okay<00:03:38.680> so<00:03:38.739> there<00:03:39.280> we<00:03:39.310> are

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
well so that's okay so there we are

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.790 
well so that's okay so there we are
great<00:03:41.170> big<00:03:41.350> box<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.890> love<00:03:43.410> now<00:03:44.410> it<00:03:44.560> should<00:03:44.770> be

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
great big box of love now it should be

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.979 
great big box of love now it should be
able<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.100> get<00:03:45.190> a<00:03:45.220> fair<00:03:45.640> bit<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.880> air<00:03:46.150> in<00:03:46.360> via

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
able to get a fair bit of air in via

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.560 
able to get a fair bit of air in via
that<00:03:47.320> I<00:03:47.560> even<00:03:48.340> made<00:03:48.489> a<00:03:48.520> nice<00:03:48.730> little<00:03:48.760> cutout<00:03:49.390> up

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
that I even made a nice little cutout up

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.000 
that I even made a nice little cutout up
the<00:03:49.720> front<00:03:49.930> here<00:03:50.050> so<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:51.220> can<00:03:52.290> undo<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.440> oil<00:03:53.650> cap

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
the front here so I can undo the oil cap

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.449 
the front here so I can undo the oil cap
if<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.280> need<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:56.680> it's<00:03:56.830> pretty<00:03:57.040> solidly

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
if I need to and it's pretty solidly

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.020 
if I need to and it's pretty solidly
mounted<00:03:57.780> that's<00:03:58.780> not<00:03:58.989> going<00:03:59.170> anywhere

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
mounted that's not going anywhere

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.870 
mounted that's not going anywhere
so<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.090> should<00:04:01.269> be<00:04:01.300> able<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.630> contend<00:04:02.110> with

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
so it should be able to contend with

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.310 
so it should be able to contend with
well<00:04:03.880> what<00:04:04.060> we're<00:04:04.239> hoping<00:04:04.390> to<00:04:04.630> be<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:04.930> hundred

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
well what we're hoping to be a hundred

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.550 
well what we're hoping to be a hundred
and<00:04:05.440> ten<00:04:05.650> mile<00:04:05.920> an<00:04:06.130> hour<00:04:06.220> trap<00:04:06.610> speeds<00:04:07.560> you

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
and ten mile an hour trap speeds you

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.780 
and ten mile an hour trap speeds you
know<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:08.890> it<00:04:08.950> should<00:04:09.220> be<00:04:09.340> anywhere<00:04:09.610> between

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
know so it should be anywhere between

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.190 
know so it should be anywhere between
100<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.390> 110<00:04:10.989> mile<00:04:11.230> an<00:04:11.350> hour<00:04:11.470> down<00:04:12.160> a<00:04:12.220> quarter

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
100 and 110 mile an hour down a quarter

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.930 
100 and 110 mile an hour down a quarter
so<00:04:14.200> those<00:04:14.530> straps<00:04:15.190> just<00:04:15.519> coming<00:04:15.790> off<00:04:15.880> the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
so those straps just coming off the

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.130 
so those straps just coming off the
headers<00:04:16.419> there<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:18.250> then<00:04:18.489> out<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.150> back<00:04:19.359> here

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.110 

got<00:04:23.140> our<00:04:23.290> little<00:04:23.620> nitrous<00:04:24.160> fogger<00:04:24.400> she's

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
got our little nitrous fogger she's

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.870 
got our little nitrous fogger she's
pumped<00:04:25.570> straight<00:04:25.780> in<00:04:25.930> they're<00:04:26.080> facing

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
pumped straight in they're facing

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.830 
pumped straight in they're facing
straight<00:04:27.880> into<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.300> throttle<00:04:28.600> body

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
straight into the throttle body

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.629 
straight into the throttle body
now<00:04:30.380> I<00:04:30.410> don't<00:04:30.620> know<00:04:30.800> what<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.100> turbulence

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
now I don't know what the turbulence

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.670 
now I don't know what the turbulence
will<00:04:31.850> do<00:04:32.090> to<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.450> nitrous<00:04:32.900> charge<00:04:33.200> but<00:04:33.560> it

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
will do to the nitrous charge but it

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
will do to the nitrous charge but it
should<00:04:34.070> be<00:04:34.190> fine<00:04:35.770> so<00:04:36.770> I'm<00:04:36.919> about<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.250> cut<00:04:37.520> my

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
should be fine so I'm about to cut my

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.460 
should be fine so I'm about to cut my
hole<00:04:37.940> in<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.150> bonnet<00:04:38.360> so<00:04:38.930> I've<00:04:39.050> drilled<00:04:39.290> up

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
hole in the bonnet so I've drilled up

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.190 
hole in the bonnet so I've drilled up
here<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:39.950> here<00:04:40.270> through<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.480> bonnet<00:04:41.780> I've

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
here and here through the bonnet I've

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.510 
here and here through the bonnet I've
actually<00:04:42.380> got<00:04:42.620> to<00:04:42.680> enlarge<00:04:42.980> them<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.310> little

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
actually got to enlarge them a little

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.070 
actually got to enlarge them a little
bit<00:04:43.639> so<00:04:43.820> I<00:04:43.880> can<00:04:43.940> fit<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.270> jigsaw<00:04:44.630> blade<00:04:44.900> in

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
bit so I can fit the jigsaw blade in

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.400 
bit so I can fit the jigsaw blade in
there

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
there

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.980 
there
