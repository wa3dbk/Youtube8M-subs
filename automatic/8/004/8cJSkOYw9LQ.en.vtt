 I stitched together mice and not 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.569

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.260
 contrary 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.570
 This way it will get more cute, but you 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:25.380
 you can see the difference of what 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:28.690
 That's how it turned out so cute then. 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.350

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:55.900
 from above that is the part that we go 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:58.959
 to follow the next step is to place 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.660
 up and then we'll sew and 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:09.130
 I'll show you 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:12.100

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:20.709
 Let's put the wire here and we'll do the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:27.790
 My Photo 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:29.760
 here and close to the top 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:36.880
 You want it to be top of the line. 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:39.870
 now you will get the part that you are 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.870
 put on 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.860
 You want it that way so stay it's like this. 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.860
 that I stay 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:04.410
 and the little piggy will come in now 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:11.390
 Let's sew this part already with 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:11.390
 turned this part of the culture 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.800
 then this first track 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.220
 you do the same thing with the part in 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.259
 Up since it's underneath is ready you 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.479

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.909
 here for you already champion bike after 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.780

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:37.710

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.500
 I finish that if you prefer and have 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.539
 more iron in my case you can 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.210
 add one that attracts and is close 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:49.169
 So I do not know how to put faith 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:52.080
 wherever you want but I'd rather hit 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:54.090
 more cute like that 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.409
 Now I'm going back to DM to see what 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.830
