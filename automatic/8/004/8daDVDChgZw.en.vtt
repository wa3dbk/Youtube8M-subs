through your mind of course you've seen

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.160 
through your mind of course you've seen
the<00:00:41.790> footage<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.270> pile<00:00:42.480> driver<00:00:42.809> which<00:00:43.050> is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the footage of the pile driver which is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.869 
the footage of the pile driver which is
the<00:00:43.260> cause<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.440> your<00:00:43.680> injury<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.430> what<00:00:44.730> was

the cause of your injury but what was
going<00:00:45.120> through<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.300> mind<00:00:45.420> as<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.840> were

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
going through your mind as you were

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.500 
going through your mind as you were
going<00:00:46.350> through<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.649> table<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.420> know<00:00:48.420> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
going through that table you know I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.330 
going through that table you know I
guess<00:00:48.750> as<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.379> professional<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> put<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.280> all

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
guess as a professional you put it all

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.069 
guess as a professional you put it all
on<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> line<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.030> when<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:51.719> agreed

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
on the line and when I you know agreed

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.069 
on the line and when I you know agreed
to<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> match<00:00:52.530> such<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.940> match<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
to a match such as a match like that the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.580 
to a match such as a match like that the
hollywood<00:00:55.770> street<00:00:56.100> fight<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.610> guess<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.590> go

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
hollywood street fight I guess you go

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.380 
hollywood street fight I guess you go
into<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.980> knowing<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.789> know<00:00:59.820> anything

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
into that knowing that you know anything

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.170 
into that knowing that you know anything
can<00:01:00.600> go<00:01:01.010> but<00:01:02.010> when<00:01:02.160> you're<00:01:02.309> being<00:01:02.340> pile<00:01:02.820> driven

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
can go but when you're being pile driven

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.600 
can go but when you're being pile driven
through<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> table<00:01:04.140> off<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> apron<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
through a table off the apron to the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.270 
through a table off the apron to the
ground<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.869> guess<00:01:07.470> something<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.159> that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
ground I guess something like that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.740 
ground I guess something like that
really<00:01:08.549> doesn't<00:01:08.760> go<00:01:09.000> through<00:01:09.180> your<00:01:09.270> mind<00:01:09.479> that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
really doesn't go through your mind that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.770 
really doesn't go through your mind that
that<00:01:09.869> could<00:01:10.140> actually<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.770> possibility<00:01:11.780> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that could actually be a possibility and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.530 
that could actually be a possibility and
I<00:01:12.869> guess<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.470> mean<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.490> know<00:01:14.549> Adam<00:01:14.880> had<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.390> in

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
I guess I mean I know Adam had it in

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.149 
I guess I mean I know Adam had it in
them<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.930> guess<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.530> want<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.830> think<00:01:17.040> at

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
them but I guess you want to think at

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.350 
them but I guess you want to think at
the<00:01:17.250> bottom<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.640> your<00:01:17.670> heart<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.180> guy<00:01:18.330> like

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the bottom of your heart that a guy like

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.800 
the bottom of your heart that a guy like
that<00:01:18.540> wouldn't<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.549> do<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.580> much<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
that wouldn't really do that much to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.530 
that wouldn't really do that much to
somebody<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:23.400> sport<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:23.880> professional

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
somebody in a sport like professional

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.609 
somebody in a sport like professional
wrestling<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:25.020> know<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.229> always<00:01:25.439> think

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
wrestling you know you always think

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.740 
wrestling you know you always think
about<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> sport<00:01:27.420> we're

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
about that this is a sport we're

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.800 
about that this is a sport we're
sportsmen<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.280> my<00:01:29.850> mind<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.329> not<00:01:30.540> really

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
sportsmen and my mind it's not really

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.230 
sportsmen and my mind it's not really
sportsman<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.549> but<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.579> know<00:01:32.640> Adam<00:01:32.939> will<00:01:33.150> do

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
sportsman like but I know Adam will do

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.300 
sportsman like but I know Adam will do
anything<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.570> keep<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.960> championship<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.040> I
