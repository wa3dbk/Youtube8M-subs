rated<00:00:34.800> games<00:00:34.829> very<00:00:35.190> often<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.640> quickly<00:00:36.059> turned

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
rated games very often I quickly turned

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.660 
rated games very often I quickly turned
it<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.540> red<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.230> bring<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.860> gore<00:00:38.129> the

graphics<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.300> second<00:00:39.660> game<00:00:39.780> were<00:00:39.899> just

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
graphics for the second game were just

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.690 
graphics for the second game were just
awful<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.980> looks<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.370> hasn't<00:00:41.610> been

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
awful it looks like it hasn't been

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.369 
awful it looks like it hasn't been
updated<00:00:41.850> when<00:00:42.329> they<00:00:42.420> first<00:00:42.660> released<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
updated when they first released it and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.290 
updated when they first released it and
that's<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.710> shame<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.399> really<00:00:44.670> made<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.850> unfun

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that's a shame it really made it unfun

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.029 
that's a shame it really made it unfun
to<00:00:45.450> play<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.930> everything<00:00:46.320> looked<00:00:46.500> blocky<00:00:47.010> and

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
to play as everything looked blocky and

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.430 
to play as everything looked blocky and
jaggedy<00:00:47.670> unlike<00:00:48.120> houses<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.570> dead<00:00:48.750> 3<00:00:49.079> which

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
jaggedy unlike houses the dead 3 which

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.170 
jaggedy unlike houses the dead 3 which
while<00:00:49.649> not<00:00:49.860> anywhere<00:00:50.280> near<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.579> Wii<00:00:50.850> games

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
while not anywhere near the Wii games

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.389 
while not anywhere near the Wii games
graphics<00:00:51.840> capability<00:00:52.469> should<00:00:52.530> look<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.160> at

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
graphics capability should look like at

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.860 
graphics capability should look like at
least<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.850> prettier<00:00:54.270> than<00:00:54.300> its<00:00:54.600> ugly

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
least it was prettier than its ugly

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.720 
least it was prettier than its ugly
brother<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.620> controls<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.129> both<00:00:56.280> games<00:00:56.579> were

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
brother the controls for both games were

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.130 
brother the controls for both games were
really<00:00:56.910> good<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> way<00:00:58.109> it

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
really good I really like the way it

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.660 
really good I really like the way it
accurately<00:00:58.649> found<00:00:58.980> where<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.190> was<00:00:59.370> pointing

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
accurately found where I was pointing

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.069 
accurately found where I was pointing
the<00:00:59.699> Wii<00:00:59.850> mode<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.480> made<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.660> much<00:01:00.930> more

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the Wii mode and that made it much more

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.930 
the Wii mode and that made it much more
fun<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.440> play<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.039> controls<00:01:02.399> are<00:01:02.520> as<00:01:02.609> easy<00:01:02.789> as

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
fun to play the controls are as easy as

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.670 
fun to play the controls are as easy as

point-and-shoot to reload you quickly

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.500 
point-and-shoot to reload you quickly
move<00:01:04.830> your<00:01:05.129> Wii<00:01:05.250> mode<00:01:05.460> off<00:01:05.580> screen<00:01:05.939> now<00:01:06.330> this

move your Wii mode off screen now this

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.390

game<00:01:06.720> supports<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> Wii<00:01:07.350> zapper<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.250> most

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
game supports the Wii zapper but as most

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.640 
game supports the Wii zapper but as most
of<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.670> know<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.150> don't<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.900> fact<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.350> think<00:01:10.409> my

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
of you know I don't in fact I think my

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.320 
of you know I don't in fact I think my
wii<00:01:10.830> zapper<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.340> currently<00:01:11.640> located<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
wii zapper is currently located in a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.030 
wii zapper is currently located in a
place<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.750> called<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.260> trash<00:01:13.590> dump

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
place we called the trash dump

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.830 
place we called the trash dump
so<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.280> played<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.700> game<00:01:14.909> using<00:01:15.270> my<00:01:15.390> nerf<00:01:15.570> gun

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
so I played this game using my nerf gun

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.810 
so I played this game using my nerf gun
accessory<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.770> worked<00:01:16.950> great<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.670> can

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
accessory and it worked great you can

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.219 
accessory and it worked great you can
play<00:01:17.909> either<00:01:17.939> title<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.630> two<00:01:18.780> players<00:01:19.020> at

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
play either title with two players at

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.780 
play either title with two players at
once<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.920> think<00:01:20.100> when<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
once and I think when you do that it

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.789 
once and I think when you do that it
made<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> game<00:01:21.090> slightly<00:01:21.659> easier<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.650> only

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
made the game slightly easier but only

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.740 
made the game slightly easier but only
slightly<00:01:23.280> because<00:01:23.850> even<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> easiest

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
slightly because even on the easiest

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.899 
slightly because even on the easiest
setting<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.409> game<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.890> really<00:01:26.130> hard<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
setting this game is really hard the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.429 
setting this game is really hard the
second<00:01:27.240> title<00:01:27.360> was<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> hardest<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> two

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
second title was the hardest of the two

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.749 
second title was the hardest of the two
both<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.040> games<00:01:29.189> only<00:01:29.430> give<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> a

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
both of the games only give you a

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.219 
both of the games only give you a
certain<00:01:29.939> amount<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.329> Hearts<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.689> continues

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
certain amount of Hearts and continues

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.870 
certain amount of Hearts and continues
and<00:01:31.470> after<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.220> game<00:01:32.490> over

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and after that it's game over

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.399 
and after that it's game over
you<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.240> tweaked<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.600> how<00:01:33.720> many<00:01:33.780> hearts<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
you get tweaked with how many hearts and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.380 
you get tweaked with how many hearts and
continues<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.979> get<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:35.579> by<00:01:35.790> much

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
continues you get but not by much

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.760 
continues you get but not by much
you<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.659> unlock<00:01:36.900> different<00:01:37.320> amounts<00:01:37.650> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
you can unlock different amounts to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.960 
you can unlock different amounts to
tweak<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.159> with<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.670> play<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.820> game

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
tweak it with as you play the game

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.700 
tweak it with as you play the game
normally<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:39.900> nowhere<00:01:40.079> near<00:01:40.259> where<00:01:40.619> it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
normally but it's nowhere near where it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.710 
normally but it's nowhere near where it
should<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.400> game<00:01:41.640> was<00:01:41.850> way<00:01:42.090> too<00:01:42.150> stingy

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
should be this game was way too stingy

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.800 
should be this game was way too stingy
on<00:01:42.930> continues<00:01:43.530> 5<00:01:44.070> that's<00:01:44.640> way<00:01:45.000> too<00:01:45.030> low<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
on continues 5 that's way too low for a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.600 
on continues 5 that's way too low for a
rail<00:01:45.990> shooter<00:01:46.350> especially<00:01:46.649> one<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.430> throws

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
rail shooter especially one that throws

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.370 
rail shooter especially one that throws
so<00:01:47.880> many<00:01:47.939> bad<00:01:48.270> guys<00:01:48.479> at<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.840> there<00:01:49.079> was<00:01:49.259> an

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
so many bad guys at you there was an

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.960 
so many bad guys at you there was an
option<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.770> one<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> game<00:01:50.250> modes<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
option in one of the game modes to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.240 
option in one of the game modes to
increase<00:01:51.240> your<00:01:51.420> continues<00:01:51.960> by<00:01:52.140> 2<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.860> still

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
increase your continues by 2 but still

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.249 
increase your continues by 2 but still
that's<00:01:53.460> too<00:01:53.759> low<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.360> will<00:01:54.509> say<00:01:54.810> though<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> did

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that's too low I will say though I did

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.630 
that's too low I will say though I did
get<00:01:55.380> better<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.829> better<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.159> eventually<00:01:56.610> I

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
get better and better and eventually I

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.670 
get better and better and eventually I
got<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.030> level<00:01:57.270> 3<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.659> both<00:01:57.840> games<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:58.530> that's

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
got to level 3 on both games but that's

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.440 
got to level 3 on both games but that's
about<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:58.950> far<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.549> could<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.180> seems

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
about as far as I could get it seems

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.389 
about as far as I could get it seems
wrong<00:02:00.750> they<00:02:00.960> limit<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.590> continues<00:02:02.189> if

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
wrong they limit you on continues if

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.920 
wrong they limit you on continues if
this<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.729> really<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.000> port<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.450> an<00:02:03.540> arcade<00:02:03.630> game

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
this is really a port of an arcade game

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.480 
this is really a port of an arcade game
do<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.560> really<00:02:04.799> think<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.040> people<00:02:05.250> would

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
do you really think that people would

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.850 
do you really think that people would
stop<00:02:05.729> playing<00:02:06.030> after<00:02:06.240> 5<00:02:06.570> quarters<00:02:07.049> no<00:02:07.439> they

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
stop playing after 5 quarters no they

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.010 
stop playing after 5 quarters no they
keep<00:02:08.069> going<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:08.970> limiting<00:02:09.420> us<00:02:09.599> with<00:02:09.869> so

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
keep going but limiting us with so

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.780 
keep going but limiting us with so
little<00:02:10.170> continues<00:02:10.800> takes<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.190> lot<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.459> fun<00:02:11.640> out

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
little continues takes a lot of fun out

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.040 
little continues takes a lot of fun out
of<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.970> game<00:02:12.150> for<00:02:12.330> me<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.660> really

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
of the game for me I really

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.600 
of the game for me I really
joint<00:02:13.230> House<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> Dead<00:02:13.650> overkill<00:02:13.980> and

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
joint House of the Dead overkill and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.980 
joint House of the Dead overkill and
mainly<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.150> was<00:02:15.270> because<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.570> could<00:02:15.870> get

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
mainly that was because I could get

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.270 
mainly that was because I could get
through<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.230> whole<00:02:16.350> game<00:02:16.590> because<00:02:17.010> there<00:02:17.160> was

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
through the whole game because there was

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.920 
through the whole game because there was
unlimited<00:02:17.550> continues<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.450> can<00:02:18.660> enjoy<00:02:18.810> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
unlimited continues I can enjoy the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.240 
unlimited continues I can enjoy the
story<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.410> action<00:02:19.740> without<00:02:19.830> having<00:02:20.190> to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
story in the action without having to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.530 
story in the action without having to
worry<00:02:20.430> about<00:02:20.490> running<00:02:20.880> out<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.060> continues

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
worry about running out of continues

worry about running out of continues
there<00:02:22.080> were<00:02:22.170> different<00:02:22.470> guns<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.860> amel<00:02:23.160> to

there were different guns in amel to
acquire<00:02:23.610> they<00:02:24.030> would<00:02:24.150> really<00:02:24.270> help

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
acquire they would really help

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.360 
acquire they would really help
dispatching<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.230> bad<00:02:25.380> guys<00:02:25.590> quicker<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
dispatching the bad guys quicker the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.590 
dispatching the bad guys quicker the
enemies<00:02:26.670> come<00:02:26.820> in<00:02:26.970> different<00:02:27.090> shapes<00:02:27.450> and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
enemies come in different shapes and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.570 
enemies come in different shapes and
sizes<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.470> was<00:02:28.560> almost<00:02:28.740> always<00:02:29.100> best<00:02:29.460> to

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
sizes and it was almost always best to

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.980 
sizes and it was almost always best to
aim<00:02:29.760> for<00:02:29.940> their<00:02:30.060> head<00:02:30.270> that's<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.750> would<00:02:30.870> take

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
aim for their head that's it would take

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.450 
aim for their head that's it would take
them<00:02:31.140> down<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.440> quickest<00:02:31.860> there<00:02:32.130> were<00:02:32.220> boss

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
them down the quickest there were boss

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.950 
them down the quickest there were boss
fights<00:02:32.760> at<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:32.910> end<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.240> level<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.810> they

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
fights at the end of the level and they

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.900 
fights at the end of the level and they
would<00:02:34.080> be<00:02:34.170> very<00:02:34.320> challenging<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.520> love

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
would be very challenging to do I love

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.250 
would be very challenging to do I love
the<00:02:36.030> boss<00:02:36.210> fights<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.690> third<00:02:36.870> game<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
the boss fights in the third game the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.750 
the boss fights in the third game the
most<00:02:37.440> as<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:38.070> think<00:02:38.280> they<00:02:38.370> were<00:02:38.460> in<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.610> most

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
most as I think they were in the most

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.520 
most as I think they were in the most
clever<00:02:39.000> each<00:02:39.480> title<00:02:39.810> had<00:02:40.050> branching<00:02:40.470> out

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
clever each title had branching out

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.080 
clever each title had branching out
parts<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.070> level<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.700> didn't<00:02:41.970> always

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
parts of the level so you didn't always

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.730 
parts of the level so you didn't always
have<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.330> see<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.570> same<00:02:42.750> areas<00:02:43.140> over<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.560> over

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
have to see the same areas over and over

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.900 
have to see the same areas over and over

good idea and it really added to the
replay<00:02:46.620> factor<00:02:47.130> when<00:02:47.490> you<00:02:47.580> lose<00:02:47.730> all<00:02:47.910> your
