00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.130
 which are very popular now among 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.430

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.140
 between forceps and clamping strand 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.210
 scrolling away from the face on 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.890
 180 degrees due to the fact that straightforward 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.500

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.010
