it really you know when you do gpp
there's<00:03:48.329> so<00:03:48.630> many<00:03:48.750> different<00:03:48.989> ways<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.260> do<00:03:49.739> it

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
there's so many different ways you do it

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.610 
there's so many different ways you do it
I<00:03:50.040> mean<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.970> could<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.600> could<00:03:51.750> do<00:03:51.900> supersets

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
I mean you could you could do supersets

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.160 
I mean you could you could do supersets
you<00:03:53.250> could<00:03:53.430> drag<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:53.670> sled<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.720> could<00:03:54.900> drag<00:03:55.109> a

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
you could drag a sled you could drag a

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.009 
you could drag a sled you could drag a
prowler<00:03:55.829> you<00:03:56.130> can<00:03:56.310> go<00:03:56.459> jog<00:03:56.820> you're<00:03:57.720> not<00:03:57.870> going

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
prowler you can go jog you're not going

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.210 
prowler you can go jog you're not going
to<00:03:58.079> die<00:03:58.290> you're<00:03:58.650> not<00:03:58.769> going<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:58.950> be<00:03:59.040> weak

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
to die you're not going to be weak

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.650 
to die you're not going to be weak
because<00:03:59.579> you<00:03:59.730> run<00:03:59.940> a<00:03:59.970> little<00:04:00.150> bit<00:04:00.359> here<00:04:00.570> and

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
because you run a little bit here and

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.630 
because you run a little bit here and
there<00:04:00.720> now<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.680> start<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.040> implement<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.459> lot

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
there now you start to implement a lot

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.920 
there now you start to implement a lot
of<00:04:02.760> running<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.269> course<00:04:03.570> it's<00:04:03.690> going<00:04:03.720> to

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
of running and of course it's going to

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.390 
of running and of course it's going to
you<00:04:04.200> know<00:04:04.320> there's<00:04:04.470> going<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.650> be<00:04:04.680> sacrificing

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
you know there's going to be sacrificing

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.849 
you know there's going to be sacrificing
strength<00:04:05.549> somewhere<00:04:06.090> but<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.500> can<00:04:07.650> ride<00:04:07.829> your

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
strength somewhere but you can ride your

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.830 
strength somewhere but you can ride your
bike<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.519> mean<00:04:08.850> there's<00:04:09.030> lots<00:04:09.299> of<00:04:09.510> different

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
bike I mean there's lots of different

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.780 
bike I mean there's lots of different
things<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.140> can<00:04:10.230> do<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.920> main<00:04:11.130> thing<00:04:11.400> is<00:04:11.430> stay

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
things you can do the main thing is stay

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.620 
things you can do the main thing is stay
in<00:04:11.850> shape<00:04:12.920> stay<00:04:13.920> in<00:04:14.280> shape<00:04:14.730> this<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.390> you're<00:04:15.540> in

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
the time it this stuff takes a long time

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.379 
the time it this stuff takes a long time
you<00:04:43.710> with<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:43.979> younger<00:04:44.250> kids<00:04:44.280> they've<00:04:45.270> been

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129 
at it for a few years they just started

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.670 
at it for a few years they just started
a<00:04:47.190> little<00:04:47.310> earlier<00:04:47.699> than<00:04:47.819> everybody<00:04:48.090> else<00:04:48.680> but

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
a little earlier than everybody else but

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.589 
a little earlier than everybody else but
uh<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:50.190> better<00:04:50.430> condition<00:04:51.060> that<00:04:51.210> you're<00:04:51.360> in

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
uh the better condition that you're in

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.629 
uh the better condition that you're in
the<00:04:51.870> easier<00:04:52.319> it<00:04:52.440> will<00:04:52.500> be<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:52.770> recover<00:04:53.490> from

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
the easier it will be to recover from

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.619 
the easier it will be to recover from
your<00:04:53.940> workouts<00:04:54.419> so<00:04:55.349> if<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.590> have<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:55.800> better

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:56.629 
your workouts so if you have a better

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.059 
your workouts so if you have a better
get<00:04:57.629> too<00:04:57.810> complicated<00:04:58.020> with<00:04:58.560> this<00:04:58.770> because<00:04:59.039> I

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
get too complicated with this because I

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.770 
get too complicated with this because I
don't<00:04:59.220> even<00:04:59.310> know<00:04:59.550> science<00:05:00.210> behind<00:05:00.330> a<00:05:00.539> lot<00:05:00.690> of

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
don't even know science behind a lot of

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.779 
don't even know science behind a lot of
this<00:05:00.870> crap<00:05:01.110> I<00:05:01.379> don't<00:05:01.889> only<00:05:01.979> pay<00:05:02.219> attention<00:05:02.639> to

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
this crap I don't only pay attention to
