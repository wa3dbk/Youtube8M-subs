00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.760 
immediately said to me look the main
thing<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.300> you<00:01:59.810> walk<00:02:00.020> in<00:02:00.230> here<00:02:00.260> with<00:02:00.620> the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
thing is that you walk in here with the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.520 
thing is that you walk in here with the
energy<00:02:01.190> of<00:02:01.370> like<00:02:01.640> I<00:02:01.820> own<00:02:02.120> this<00:02:02.330> place<00:02:02.540> I<00:02:03.020> own

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
energy of like I own this place I own

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.370 
energy of like I own this place I own
every<00:02:03.950> rock<00:02:04.250> here<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:04.910> own<00:02:05.090> every<00:02:05.390> flower<00:02:05.690> I<00:02:05.900> on

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
every rock here I own every flower I on

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.620 
every rock here I own every flower I on
every<00:02:06.800> blade<00:02:07.040> of<00:02:07.070> grass<00:02:07.250> this<00:02:08.209> is<00:02:08.269> my<00:02:08.719> place

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
every blade of grass this is my place

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.620 
every blade of grass this is my place
and<00:02:10.340> immediately<00:02:11.340> they<00:02:11.670> would<00:02:11.850> come<00:02:12.120> over<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
and immediately they would come over and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.410 
and immediately they would come over and
start<00:02:13.320> jumping<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:13.980> me<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:14.490> pretty<00:02:14.820> much<00:02:14.940> they

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
start jumping on me but pretty much they

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.050 
start jumping on me but pretty much they
were<00:02:15.560> sort<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.620> cautious<00:02:17.250> with<00:02:17.460> Caesar<00:02:17.760> which

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
were sort of cautious with Caesar which

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.910 
were sort of cautious with Caesar which
was<00:02:18.300> very<00:02:18.510> interesting<00:02:18.930> because<00:02:19.380> with<00:02:19.770> other

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
was very interesting because with other

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.830 
was very interesting because with other
people<00:02:20.400> they<00:02:20.550> usually<00:02:20.730> jump<00:02:21.270> on<00:02:21.390> anybody

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
people they usually jump on anybody

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.590 
people they usually jump on anybody
Caesar<00:02:22.560> was<00:02:22.860> working<00:02:23.460> with<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.820> energy<00:02:24.270> and

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
Caesar was working with the energy and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.220 
Caesar was working with the energy and
also<00:02:25.020> he<00:02:25.380> works<00:02:25.650> with<00:02:25.860> physical<00:02:26.400> touch<00:02:26.700> and

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
also he works with physical touch and

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.650 
also he works with physical touch and
with<00:02:28.230> body<00:02:28.500> language<00:02:28.880> Caesar<00:02:29.880> does<00:02:30.180> not<00:02:30.420> work

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
with body language Caesar does not work

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.010 
with body language Caesar does not work
much<00:02:30.960> with<00:02:30.990> words<00:02:31.950> at<00:02:32.400> all<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:33.150> only<00:02:33.330> thing<00:02:33.600> he

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
much with words at all the only thing he

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.160 
much with words at all the only thing he
uses<00:02:34.380> as<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.560> sound<00:02:35.120> what<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.150> really<00:02:36.780> got<00:02:36.990> out<00:02:37.020> of

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
uses as a sound what I really got out of

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.710 
uses as a sound what I really got out of
the<00:02:37.380> session<00:02:37.620> with<00:02:37.950> Cesar<00:02:38.340> Millan<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.480> I

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
the session with Cesar Millan is that I

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.860 
the session with Cesar Millan is that I
first<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.800> all<00:02:40.950> needed<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.940> aware<00:02:42.210> of<00:02:42.270> any

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
first of all needed to be aware of any

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.350 
first of all needed to be aware of any
every<00:02:43.380> bit<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.650> energy<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.550> was<00:02:44.940> having

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
every bit of energy that I was having

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.690 
every bit of energy that I was having
available<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.960> my<00:02:46.140> body<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:47.220> my<00:02:47.250> being

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
available in my body and in my being

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.420 
available in my body and in my being
when<00:02:48.210> I'm<00:02:48.360> around<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.870> dogs<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.530> needed<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.310> be

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
when I'm around the dogs I needed to be

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.590 
when I'm around the dogs I needed to be
more<00:02:50.640> persistent<00:02:51.000> with<00:02:51.840> what<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.080> was<00:02:52.320> doing<00:02:52.740> I

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
more persistent with what I was doing I

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.420 
more persistent with what I was doing I
essentially<00:02:54.600> had<00:02:55.170> gone<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.740> right<00:02:55.980> route

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
essentially had gone the right route

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.640 
essentially had gone the right route
with<00:02:56.880> these<00:02:57.090> dogs<00:02:57.450> but<00:02:57.900> I've<00:02:58.050> never<00:02:58.290> been

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
with these dogs but I've never been

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.310 
with these dogs but I've never been
persistent<00:02:59.520> enough<00:02:59.850> to<00:03:00.420> change<00:03:00.750> them<00:03:01.140> and

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
persistent enough to change them and

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.740 
persistent enough to change them and
even<00:03:01.710> for<00:03:01.950> Caesar<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:02.580> was<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:03.090> very<00:03:03.390> hard

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
even for Caesar this was a very hard

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.680 
even for Caesar this was a very hard
case<00:03:04.110> he<00:03:04.860> said<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.340> me<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:06.150> he<00:03:06.360> would<00:03:06.510> rather

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
case he said to me that he would rather

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.580 
case he said to me that he would rather
work<00:03:07.050> on<00:03:07.260> 20<00:03:08.180> dog<00:03:09.180> aggressive<00:03:09.540> pit<00:03:09.960> bulls<00:03:10.230> than

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
work on 20 dog aggressive pit bulls than

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.640 
work on 20 dog aggressive pit bulls than
another<00:03:10.890> golden<00:03:11.340> retriever<00:03:11.760> that's<00:03:12.060> anxious

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
another golden retriever that's anxious

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.770 
another golden retriever that's anxious
so<00:03:13.650> for<00:03:13.950> Caesar<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.550> was<00:03:14.820> definitely<00:03:15.750> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
so for Caesar this was definitely a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.700 
so for Caesar this was definitely a
challenge<00:03:16.110> as<00:03:16.530> well<00:03:16.710> and<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.510> also<00:03:19.500> made

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
challenge as well and so that also made

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.260 
challenge as well and so that also made
me<00:03:19.890> aware<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.430> we<00:03:20.580> were<00:03:20.730> dealing<00:03:20.940> with<00:03:21.150> a

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
me aware that we were dealing with a

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.990 
me aware that we were dealing with a
behavior<00:03:21.960> that<00:03:22.200> had<00:03:22.470> for<00:03:22.770> some<00:03:22.950> reason

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
behavior that had for some reason

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.580 
behavior that had for some reason
escalated<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.210> point<00:03:24.270> where<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.290> really

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
escalated to a point where I really

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.250 
escalated to a point where I really
needed<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:26.160> lot<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.850> time<00:03:27.240> in<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.750> initial

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
needed a lot of time in the initial

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.410 
needed a lot of time in the initial
meeting<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.890> actually<00:03:29.490> stop<00:03:29.880> that<00:03:30.150> from

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
meeting to actually stop that from

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.230 
meeting to actually stop that from
occurring<00:03:30.990> after<00:03:31.410> Caesar<00:03:31.860> left<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.610> started

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
occurring after Caesar left I started

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.120 
occurring after Caesar left I started
working<00:03:33.510> with<00:03:33.900> all<00:03:34.140> of<00:03:34.320> these<00:03:34.470> dogs<00:03:34.830> on<00:03:35.040> a

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
working with all of these dogs on a

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.910 
working with all of these dogs on a
regular<00:03:35.520> basis<00:03:36.060> basically<00:03:36.570> three<00:03:37.410> times<00:03:37.680> and

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
regular basis basically three times and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.480 
regular basis basically three times and
four<00:03:37.950> times<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.520> week<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:39.200> so<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.620> started<00:03:41.250> using

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
four times a week and so I started using

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.020 
four times a week and so I started using
his<00:03:41.820> method<00:03:42.300> of<00:03:42.390> touch<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.280> also<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.550> energy

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
his method of touch and also the energy

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.530 
his method of touch and also the energy
that<00:03:45.690> he<00:03:46.170> showed<00:03:46.830> me<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.400> was<00:03:48.060> starting<00:03:48.510> to

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
that he showed me I was starting to

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.100 
that he showed me I was starting to
really<00:03:48.900> utilize<00:03:49.550> everyday<00:03:50.550> I<00:03:50.910> really<00:03:51.720> had<00:03:51.930> the

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
really utilize everyday I really had the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.080 
really utilize everyday I really had the
awareness<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.890> what<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:53.280> needed<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.910> do

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
awareness that what I needed to do

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.900 
awareness that what I needed to do
differently<00:03:54.600> was<00:03:55.020> that<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.590> had<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.100> show<00:03:56.370> up<00:03:56.400> as

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
differently was that I had to show up as

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.120 
differently was that I had to show up as
the<00:03:57.330> person<00:03:57.810> who<00:03:58.020> was<00:03:58.200> actually<00:03:58.440> going<00:03:58.830> to

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
the person who was actually going to

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.380 
the person who was actually going to
make<00:03:59.460> a<00:03:59.490> difference<00:04:00.030> here

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
make a difference here

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.140 
make a difference here
I<00:04:00.540> couldn't<00:04:01.200> stop<00:04:01.710> I<00:04:02.100> couldn't<00:04:02.400> give<00:04:02.700> in<00:04:03.120> I

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
I couldn't stop I couldn't give in I

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.660 
I couldn't stop I couldn't give in I
couldn't<00:04:03.780> doubt<00:04:03.990> myself<00:04:04.260> in<00:04:04.860> any<00:04:05.070> way<00:04:05.340> and

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
couldn't doubt myself in any way and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.210 
couldn't doubt myself in any way and
that's<00:04:06.360> really<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:07.020> gift<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.590> got<00:04:07.890> from

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
that's really the gift that I got from

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.420 
that's really the gift that I got from
the<00:04:08.370> session<00:04:08.790> is<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.510> can<00:04:09.810> do<00:04:09.990> it<00:04:10.160> so<00:04:11.160> when

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
the session is that I can do it so when

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.490 
the session is that I can do it so when
I<00:04:11.460> started<00:04:12.000> working<00:04:12.270> with<00:04:12.450> these<00:04:12.750> dogs<00:04:13.050> there

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
I started working with these dogs there

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.560 
I started working with these dogs there
was<00:04:13.650> no<00:04:13.950> doubt<00:04:14.190> in<00:04:14.250> my<00:04:14.670> mind<00:04:14.880> that<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.270> can

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
was no doubt in my mind that I can

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.930 
was no doubt in my mind that I can
change<00:04:15.900> their<00:04:16.410> behavior<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:17.669> can

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
change their behavior and that I can

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.180 
change their behavior and that I can
change<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.479> reality<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:19.260> they<00:04:19.440> had<00:04:19.680> created

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
change the reality that they had created

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.850 
change the reality that they had created
with<00:04:20.340> their<00:04:20.609> families<00:04:21.210> were<00:04:21.810> basically

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
with their families were basically

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.399 
with their families were basically
jaqen<00:04:23.250> Reilly's<00:04:23.610> case<00:04:23.909> they<00:04:24.659> were<00:04:24.719> locked<00:04:25.139> out

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
jaqen Reilly's case they were locked out

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.290 
jaqen Reilly's case they were locked out
of<00:04:25.439> their<00:04:25.800> lives<00:04:26.039> for<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.520> most<00:04:26.759> part<00:04:27.120> because

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
of their lives for the most part because

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.360 
of their lives for the most part because
it<00:04:27.599> was<00:04:27.719> too<00:04:27.960> difficult<00:04:28.469> to<00:04:28.590> be<00:04:28.740> around<00:04:29.039> them

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
it was too difficult to be around them

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.480 
it was too difficult to be around them
so<00:04:29.939> all<00:04:30.180> these<00:04:30.389> dogs<00:04:30.689> are<00:04:30.960> actually<00:04:31.530> having

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
so all these dogs are actually having

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.939 
so all these dogs are actually having
the<00:04:32.759> opportunity<00:04:33.419> now<00:04:33.599> to<00:04:33.659> be<00:04:34.110> different<00:04:34.680> and

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
the opportunity now to be different and

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.640 
the opportunity now to be different and
be<00:04:35.460> more<00:04:35.669> part<00:04:36.000> of<00:04:36.120> their<00:04:36.300> families<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.169> I

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
be more part of their families and I

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.279 
be more part of their families and I
realized<00:04:38.129> what<00:04:38.699> a<00:04:38.729> gift<00:04:39.060> that<00:04:39.360> is<00:04:39.539> to<00:04:40.110> their

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
realized what a gift that is to their

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.920 
realized what a gift that is to their
families<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.099> to<00:04:41.340> them<00:04:41.580> if<00:04:41.879> I<00:04:42.449> can<00:04:42.659> really

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
families and to them if I can really

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.580 
families and to them if I can really
follow<00:04:43.259> through<00:04:43.740> and<00:04:43.949> change
