00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.210
 welcome to this new episode 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.240
 we answer the question why not 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.800
 I can go below f 3.5 or any 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.119
 other value 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.880
 many people ask me this question 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.200
 worrying so that it is because of a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.240
 body malfunction 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.010
 machine or a wrong setting 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.930
 in reality the minimum opening value 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.850
 of the diaphragm does not depend on any 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.440
 a way from the camera body but it is one 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.230
 purely mechanical question of the 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.940
 goals indeed every goal has a 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.350
 minimum aperture value 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.140
 under which he cannot descend 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.059
 simply because they can not 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.540
 diaphragm cannot be opened more than one 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.010
 certain size and if we see in the 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.630
 objectives on the front in 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.250
 general in the nomenclature we find 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.260
 actually the data we are interested in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.270
 to understand what are the values ​​of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.410
 minimum aperture in the case 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.879
 in fact of the zoom lenses 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.340
 especially in the more economic range 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.910
 the aperture value of the diaphragm e 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.100
 minimum varies during zoom 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.740
 yes we are going on focal lengths 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.940
 bigger then actually if 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.280
 let's look at the front 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.490
 of the objective we see in this case 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.149
 I'm looking at the 17 85 mm will be there 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.530
 written 17 80 100 mm 12 points 4 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:25.950
 retains 5,612 points 4 the indent 56 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.590
 indicates the minimum aperture 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.569
 at minimum focal length and at 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.060
 maximum focal length ie it means 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:36.270
 that at 17 mm my opening value 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.690
 of the minimum aperture will be f4 while if 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.399
 I'm going to zoom in on my value to 85 mm 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.259
 minimum aperture will be 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.390
 5.6 so in this with this 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.130
 goal we have a little more face 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.990
 economic compared to those series l 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.420
 minimum aperture opening is 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.899
 varying as I am zooming then 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.179
 between 17 mm 85 mm from the button 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.340
 losing a stop as the minimum value of 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.140
 aperture of the objectives of 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.940
 and more expensive than higher end 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.340
 they have the characteristic of maintaining 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.599
 always the minimum value of 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.209
 opening of the diaphragm and therefore ci 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:10.410
 they take away one more thought 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.440
 and while if we go to see a 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.790
 focal lens sets goals a 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.010
 fixed focal length usually have the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.900
 characteristic of being very bright 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.250
 and we can see it immediately even giving 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.620
 will introduce as we have for example 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.739
 in the case of 28 mm 28 mm 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.840
 m 12 points 2.8 this means that the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.790
 focal length clearly 28 mm 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.670
 while the minimum opening value of the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.739
 diaphragm and 2.8 who know a goal a 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.250
 fixed focal not variation in this 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.870
 meaning is a goal that is the goal 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.860
 which I often recommend that even more 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.940
 bright is the 50mm f 1.8 and in that case 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.810
 there will be written 50 mm 12 points 1.8 in 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.430
 that case we know that with 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.950
 that goal we can go on photo 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.720
 even brighter for this episode 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.069
 that's all if you have any other questions 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.349
