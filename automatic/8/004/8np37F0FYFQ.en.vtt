00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 returned this new twenty-seventh 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.540
 this episode briefing series 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.090
 tiger we will make a faction on a server 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.130
 Italian factions with my writings 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.230
 with three critical months met let's say 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.730
 on the ts of this server thanks to one of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.520
 I found this faction 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.410
 the faction is defended with many territories 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.260
 climati just that if we go to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.140
 press the command f.cio we notice kanno 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.300
 19 clans and 3d power so they are more griffa 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.160
 there and we can practically the tides 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 above the ground because they have more land 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.690
 that power so I could use it very well 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.610
 the command f claim to take the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.620
 territory of this faction even though 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.790
 I wasn't forced guys chosen furrow 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.800
 the easiest way because obviously 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.540
 clone the ground after opening the baskets 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.789
 really a crap but I have to 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.920
 still make a tnt channel and destroy 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.320
 the obsidian with 5 strokes because on this 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.480
 server where I became youtuber as well 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.000
 you pilot you can sign up for 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.980
 destroy the obsidian with 5 strokes of 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.960
 tnt guys i don't know this thing to me 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.640
 instead much for those who follow me 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.100
 they know that I love these servers where 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.140
 obsidian can be broken, say 5 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.060
 tnt shots in american style those 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.890
 guys if you want to pass on this 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.720
 server you pilot found in description 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.520
 and precisely server factions where I play 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.590
 lately so i'll know about the weather 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.689
 free guys I could find myself on this 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.490
 server and returning to live fat boys 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.580
 this faction was full of pro armor 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.470
 2 pro 34 there were also many apple swords 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.479
 can neither of sugar that reality and 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.850
 synthetic cocaine in this serious why 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.829
 practically gives you speed 3 for 15 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.320
 seconds one of sugar and congregations 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.479
 this dinner also goes only to food spooner 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.820
 that in this server with silk touch there is 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.400
 30 percent chance that he pulled 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.770
 well let's say a spoiler and precisely on 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.869
 ten spooner mena troop t4 then the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.700
 40 percent and that means they are 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.200
 was quite lucky and in the video 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.090
 a week ago to guys from 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.090
 series of riffs inc episode 26 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.040
 we have reached about 220 like non 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.619
 I'm really happy but I'm not even 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.540
 so unhappy because the boys 220 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.640
 like calculating all those pauses that 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.380
 I'm done I'm hello in front 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.619
 I hope this video also reaches 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.090
 on the 250 likes even if we say between a 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.160
 month this video most likely 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.229
 will be on the 300 because these videos by 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.069
 this series make many visualizations 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.379
 practically with this series I do 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.430
 really many subscribers and many many 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.139
 new people who don't know me 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.810
 watch the video emit like it then 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:21.249
 no on this video I ask you 300 likes 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.900
 even if we don't get there in this 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.579
 week within a month according to me there 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.230
 we should arrive without problems then 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.420
 guys left a nice thumb up 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.670
 to support this series I will leave the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.290
 channel of all three participants of 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.819
 this video in description why 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.010
 thanks to one of them found precisely 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.079
 this faction without them I would not have 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.280
 let's say this designer then 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.230
 is now leaving the channels of 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.909
 inscriptions I leave them if you want to give us 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.019
 take a look if you want to sign up for one 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.120
 part of subscribers asks me why 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.980
 load very few videos of the series 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.260

 if this video is not the best but 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.199
 it really makes an absurd heat yet 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.180
 difficult to sit and give a 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.799
 fucking videos when they make more than 30 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.180
 degree in the room I wanted to tell you guys 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.519
