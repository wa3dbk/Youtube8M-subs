then<00:02:16.250> figure<00:02:16.550> out<00:02:16.640> what<00:02:16.820> size<00:02:17.000> they<00:02:17.180> are<00:02:17.210> and

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
then figure out what size they are and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.060 
then figure out what size they are and
then<00:02:17.510> tap<00:02:17.900> them<00:02:18.110> whatever<00:02:18.320> bolt<00:02:18.680> size<00:02:18.860> you

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
then tap them whatever bolt size you

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.260 
then tap them whatever bolt size you
want<00:02:19.310> really<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:20.540> did<00:02:20.870> blow<00:02:21.080> out<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> front<00:02:21.470> shock

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
want really I did blow out a front shock

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.050 
want really I did blow out a front shock

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
me see if i can flip right like this

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.090 
me see if i can flip right like this
okay<00:02:51.130> alright<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.640> servo<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:54.440> servo<00:02:54.770> arm

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
okay alright so the servo the servo arm

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.300 
okay alright so the servo the servo arm
was<00:02:55.340> bad<00:02:56.020> well<00:02:57.020> it's<00:02:57.380> not<00:02:57.590> bad<00:02:57.830> let's<00:02:58.040> put<00:02:58.220> it

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
was bad well it's not bad let's put it

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.730 
was bad well it's not bad let's put it
that<00:02:58.370> way<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.820> servos<00:02:59.180> actually<00:03:00.670> still<00:03:01.670> works

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
that way the servos actually still works

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.990 
that way the servos actually still works
it<00:03:03.740> I<00:03:03.920> just<00:03:03.950> stripped<00:03:04.490> let<00:03:04.550> me<00:03:04.640> see<00:03:04.730> if<00:03:04.820> I<00:03:04.850> can

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
it I just stripped let me see if I can

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.910 
it I just stripped let me see if I can
balance<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:05.510> bad<00:03:05.750> boy<00:03:05.960> without<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.530> fallen

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
balance this bad boy without it fallen

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.240 
balance this bad boy without it fallen
and<00:03:07.070> crushing<00:03:07.400> me<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:09.110> servo<00:03:09.470> arms<00:03:09.860> stripped

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
and crushing me the servo arms stripped

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.380 
and crushing me the servo arms stripped
out<00:03:11.020> because<00:03:12.020> it's<00:03:12.170> plastic<00:03:12.710> the<00:03:13.340> servo<00:03:14.150> did

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
out because it's plastic the servo did

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.200 
out because it's plastic the servo did
not<00:03:14.570> it<00:03:14.930> actually<00:03:15.110> held<00:03:15.440> up<00:03:15.590> pretty<00:03:15.770> well<00:03:15.890> so<00:03:16.730> I

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
not it actually held up pretty well so I

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.540 
not it actually held up pretty well so I
just<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.720> didn't<00:03:18.440> have<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.590> serval<00:03:18.950> arm<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:19.400> I<00:03:19.460> to

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
just I didn't have a serval arm so I to

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.600 
just I didn't have a serval arm so I to
put<00:03:19.700> a<00:03:19.730> new<00:03:19.880> servo<00:03:20.240> on<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:21.040> use<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.070> arm

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
put a new servo on and use that arm

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.660 
put a new servo on and use that arm
because<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:23.060> matched<00:03:23.950> that's<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.100> only<00:03:25.400> thing

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
because it matched that's the only thing

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.340 
because it matched that's the only thing
I<00:03:26.000> get<00:03:26.210> that<00:03:26.720> that<00:03:27.250> went<00:03:28.250> wrong<00:03:28.430> other<00:03:28.820> than<00:03:28.880> I

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
I get that that went wrong other than I

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.330 
I get that that went wrong other than I
went<00:03:30.350> a<00:03:30.380> little<00:03:30.410> bit<00:03:30.590> crazy<00:03:30.800> on<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.100> shock<00:03:31.310> and

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
went a little bit crazy on the shock and

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.580 
went a little bit crazy on the shock and
blew<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:31.760> out<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:32.300> just<00:03:32.840> greased<00:03:33.170> all<00:03:33.350> the

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
blew it out I just greased all the

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.700 
blew it out I just greased all the
joints<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.910> knuckles<00:03:35.270> and<00:03:35.450> everything<00:03:35.840> with

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
joints the knuckles and everything with

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.500 
joints the knuckles and everything with
some<00:03:36.890> high<00:03:37.040> temp<00:03:37.340> grease<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:38.290> that's<00:03:40.510> pretty

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
some high temp grease and that's pretty

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.090 
some high temp grease and that's pretty
much<00:03:41.630> it<00:03:44.200> this<00:03:45.200> thing's<00:03:45.410> heavy<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:45.830> probably

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
much it this thing's heavy it probably

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.990 
much it this thing's heavy it probably
weighs<00:03:46.220> about<00:03:46.400> 10<00:03:47.120> pounds<00:03:47.150> now<00:03:47.780> I've<00:03:48.440> got<00:03:48.770> a

pan and tilt or just a pan camera I
didn't<00:03:52.580> need<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.790> tilt<00:03:53.050> so<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.080> got<00:03:54.500> that<00:03:54.680> in

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
didn't need to tilt so I got that in

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.250 
didn't need to tilt so I got that in
there<00:03:57.430> treads<00:03:58.430> on<00:03:58.580> backwards<00:03:59.060> because<00:03:59.300> to<00:04:00.050> me

visually<00:04:00.860> I<00:04:00.890> like<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.430> wait<00:04:01.840> scripts<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.930> car

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
visually I like the wait scripts the car

link i tried i try to use dragon link
with<00:04:42.400> one<00:04:42.639> of<00:04:42.729> my<00:04:42.880> receivers<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:44.520> because<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
with one of my receivers and because the

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.890 
with one of my receivers and because the
the<00:04:46.139> the<00:04:47.139> truck<00:04:47.410> is<00:04:47.560> such<00:04:47.800> a<00:04:47.830> small<00:04:48.900> distance

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
the the truck is such a small distance

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.310 
the the truck is such a small distance
you<00:04:50.800> can't<00:04:51.310> space<00:04:51.610> them<00:04:51.850> out<00:04:51.940> far<00:04:52.419> enough<00:04:52.450> to

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
you can't space them out far enough to

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.320 
you can't space them out far enough to
get<00:04:53.470> any<00:04:54.360> good<00:04:55.360> video<00:04:55.720> so<00:04:55.990> I've<00:04:56.650> got<00:04:57.010> a<00:04:57.700> easy

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
get any good video so I've got a easy

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.540 
get any good video so I've got a easy
UHF<00:04:58.990> on<00:04:59.139> the<00:04:59.229> front<00:04:59.500> for<00:04:59.770> channel<00:05:00.100> i'll

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
UHF on the front for channel i'll

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.360 
UHF on the front for channel i'll
probably<00:05:00.940> put<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.419> H<00:05:01.540> hat<00:05:01.780> on<00:05:01.900> there<00:05:02.280> just<00:05:03.280> so

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
probably put the H hat on there just so

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.159 
probably put the H hat on there just so
I<00:05:03.400> can<00:05:03.520> get<00:05:03.669> more<00:05:03.820> options<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:05.200> then<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:07.660> 1.2

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
I can get more options and then the 1.2

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:15.510 
I can get more options and then the 1.2
back<00:05:08.380> here<00:05:09.960> let's<00:05:10.960> see<00:05:11.229> I<00:05:11.729> got<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:13.740> g<00:05:14.740> OSD

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
back here let's see I got the g OSD

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.300 
back here let's see I got the g OSD
which<00:05:16.419> is<00:05:16.720> alright<00:05:17.139> it<00:05:17.410> tells<00:05:17.710> you<00:05:17.830> volts<00:05:18.190> and

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
which is alright it tells you volts and

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.440 
which is alright it tells you volts and
stuff<00:05:18.550> like<00:05:18.729> that<00:05:19.889> but<00:05:20.889> yeah<00:05:21.370> that's<00:05:22.030> pretty

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
stuff like that but yeah that's pretty

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.440 
stuff like that but yeah that's pretty
much<00:05:22.600> it<00:05:23.050> then<00:05:23.380> that's<00:05:23.560> what<00:05:23.740> I've<00:05:23.860> done<00:05:24.190> I<00:05:24.550> put

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
much it then that's what I've done I put

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.450 
much it then that's what I've done I put
some<00:05:25.660> spacers<00:05:26.380> in<00:05:26.440> here<00:05:26.740> is<00:05:26.800> just<00:05:26.950> to<00:05:27.160> kind<00:05:27.370> of

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
some spacers in here is just to kind of

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.580 
some spacers in here is just to kind of
keep<00:05:28.180> it<00:05:28.360> up<00:05:28.539> if<00:05:28.750> those<00:05:29.020> weren't<00:05:29.200> there<00:05:29.470> it

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
keep it up if those weren't there it

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
keep it up if those weren't there it
would<00:05:29.740> sink<00:05:30.010> all<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:30.250> way<00:05:30.310> to<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.520> bottom

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
would sink all the way to the bottom

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.770 
would sink all the way to the bottom
because<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:32.080> frames<00:05:32.470> too<00:05:33.250> heavy<00:05:33.630> this<00:05:34.630> is

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
because the frames too heavy this is

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.960 
because the frames too heavy this is
actually<00:05:35.139> running<00:05:35.320> on<00:05:35.530> a<00:05:35.590> three<00:05:36.250> self<00:05:36.610> set<00:05:36.849> up

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
actually running on a three self set up

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.460 
actually running on a three self set up
a<00:05:37.120> 5,000<00:05:37.810> milliamp<00:05:38.110> three<00:05:38.380> cell<00:05:40.229> because<00:05:41.229> the

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
a 5,000 milliamp three cell because the

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.339 
a 5,000 milliamp three cell because the
four<00:05:41.800> cell<00:05:42.099> was<00:05:42.310> heavy<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:42.910> too<00:05:43.870> much<00:05:44.050> power

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
four cell was heavy and too much power

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.659 
four cell was heavy and too much power
so<00:05:45.780> reduce<00:05:46.780> the<00:05:46.930> speed<00:05:47.200> and<00:05:47.680> power

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
so reduce the speed and power

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.750 
so reduce the speed and power
consumption<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.840> it<00:05:50.590> works<00:05:51.190> good<00:05:51.400> with<00:05:51.610> all

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
consumption and it works good with all

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.969 
consumption and it works good with all
the<00:05:51.930> video<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:53.229> the<00:05:53.289> camera<00:05:53.620> and<00:05:53.740> stuff<00:05:53.860> like

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
the video and the camera and stuff like

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.529 
the video and the camera and stuff like
that<00:05:54.039> it's<00:05:54.250> just<00:05:54.430> you<00:05:54.970> know<00:05:55.090> 12<00:05:55.900> volts<00:05:57.539> just

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
that it's just you know 12 volts just

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:00.900 
that it's just you know 12 volts just
put<00:05:58.720> 11<00:05:59.169> pack<00:05:59.590> in<00:05:59.740> there<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.460> other<00:06:00.550> spaces

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
put 11 pack in there the other spaces

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.779 
put 11 pack in there the other spaces
for<00:06:01.270> whatever<00:06:01.680> so<00:06:02.680> that's<00:06:03.310> all<00:06:03.430> that's<00:06:03.610> how<00:06:03.760> I

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
for whatever so that's all that's how I

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.900 
run it the full of bashers is this is
pretty<00:06:09.220> sick<00:06:09.520> and<00:06:10.450> for<00:06:11.380> the<00:06:11.500> price<00:06:11.680> i<00:06:12.220> think
