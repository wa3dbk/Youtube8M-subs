why don't we go ahead and fire it up now
you're<00:01:48.649> going<00:01:48.799> to<00:01:48.920> notice<00:01:49.100> my<00:01:49.430> FPS<00:01:49.940> will<00:01:50.149> drop

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
you're going to notice my FPS will drop

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.969 
you're going to notice my FPS will drop
to<00:01:50.780> about<00:01:51.490> 11<00:01:52.490> this<00:01:52.670> activates<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:53.479> here<00:01:53.659> we<00:01:53.780> go

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
to about 11 this activates so here we go

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.210 
to about 11 this activates so here we go
and<00:01:55.119> that's<00:01:56.119> not<00:01:56.360> working<00:01:56.649> because<00:01:57.649> i<00:01:58.039> don't

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
and that's not working because i don't

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.630 
and that's not working because i don't
have<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.399> repeater<00:02:00.069> that<00:02:01.069> was<00:02:01.220> kind<00:02:01.580> of

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
have a repeater that was kind of

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:09.699 
have a repeater that was kind of
anticlimactic<00:02:01.940> home<00:02:03.009> anyway<00:02:06.369> wonderful<00:02:08.679> ok<00:02:09.679> i

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
anticlimactic home anyway wonderful ok i

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:17.730 
anticlimactic home anyway wonderful ok i
can't<00:02:10.160> fly

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.309 

here<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:18.830> go

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.209 

so<00:02:23.980> because<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.730> lags<00:02:24.999> so<00:02:25.390> much<00:02:25.659> it<00:02:26.620> looked

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
so because it lags so much it looked

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.099 
so because it lags so much it looked
like<00:02:27.370> only<00:02:27.730> part<00:02:27.999> of<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> floor<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.629> working

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
like only part of the floor is working

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.280 
like only part of the floor is working
but<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.859> whole<00:02:30.069> floor<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.459> working<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.420> just

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
but the whole floor is working it just

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:42.130 
but the whole floor is working it just
doesn't<00:02:32.590> load<00:02:33.159> I<00:02:33.519> guess<00:02:34.359> you<00:02:34.599> could<00:02:34.930> say<00:02:35.260> that

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.630 

it's<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:43.610> Hugh<00:02:43.940> sla's<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:45.770> can't<00:02:46.010> even<00:02:46.459> enjoy

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
it's so Hugh sla's you can't even enjoy

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.400 
it's so Hugh sla's you can't even enjoy
it<00:02:46.940> oh<00:02:47.390> my<00:02:48.319> gosh<00:02:49.240> model<00:02:50.240> this<00:02:50.420> design<00:02:51.110> always

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
it oh my gosh model this design always

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.080 
it oh my gosh model this design always
reminds<00:02:51.709> me<00:02:51.920> of<00:02:52.010> an<00:02:52.100> aircraft<00:02:52.340> carrier<00:02:52.850> the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
reminds me of an aircraft carrier the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.270 
reminds me of an aircraft carrier the
Titanic<00:02:53.959> that's<00:02:54.319> what<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.590> always<00:02:54.680> think<00:02:55.100> of

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
Titanic that's what I always think of

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.330 
Titanic that's what I always think of
when<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.520> saw<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:57.770> does<00:02:57.980> look<00:02:58.190> like

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
when I saw this so it does look like

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.070 
when I saw this so it does look like
over<00:02:58.550> here<00:02:58.850> you<00:02:58.970> know<00:02:59.090> it's<00:02:59.240> not<00:02:59.420> working<00:02:59.840> but

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
over here you know it's not working but

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.900 
over here you know it's not working but
it<00:03:00.470> is<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:01.070> working<00:03:04.090> it's<00:03:05.090> just<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:07.010> don't

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
it is it is working it's just so I don't

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.520 
it is it is working it's just so I don't
even<00:03:08.450> know<00:03:08.630> how<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.750> would<00:03:08.959> describe<00:03:09.140> it

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
even know how you would describe it

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.470 
even know how you would describe it
there's<00:03:09.800> not<00:03:10.100> more<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.940> big<00:03:11.120> enough<00:03:11.360> to

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
there's not more to big enough to

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
there's not more to big enough to
describe<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:13.840> all<00:03:14.840> right<00:03:14.959> let's<00:03:15.140> turn<00:03:15.350> this

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
describe this all right let's turn this

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.710 
describe this all right let's turn this
thing<00:03:15.560> off<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.130> can<00:03:16.370> actually<00:03:16.790> have<00:03:17.420> more

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
thing off so I can actually have more

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:25.070 
thing off so I can actually have more
than<00:03:17.930> one<00:03:18.170> FPS<00:03:21.580> okay

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.040 

all<00:03:25.620> right<00:03:25.770> there<00:03:26.070> we<00:03:26.220> go<00:03:26.400> look<00:03:27.180> at<00:03:27.330> that<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.780> can

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
all right there we go look at that I can

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.760 
all right there we go look at that I can
fly<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.740> can<00:03:28.920> run<00:03:29.160> around<00:03:30.110> anyway<00:03:31.110> so<00:03:31.170> let's

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
fly and I can run around anyway so let's

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.830 
fly and I can run around anyway so let's
just<00:03:32.070> kind<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.430> go<00:03:32.610> into<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.970> insides<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.600> this

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
just kind of go into the insides of this

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.350 
just kind of go into the insides of this
we've<00:03:34.710> got<00:03:34.920> each<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.400> these<00:03:35.520> floors<00:03:35.940> which<00:03:36.210> is

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
we've got each of these floors which is

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.020 
we've got each of these floors which is
just<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.780> big<00:03:37.080> big<00:03:38.070> plate<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.310> words<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:38.820> so

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
just a big big plate of words and so

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.210 
just a big big plate of words and so
what<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.270> do<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.900> outside<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:41.040> have

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
what you do is on the outside you have

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.430 
what you do is on the outside you have
this<00:03:41.640> this<00:03:42.360> pattern<00:03:42.840> right<00:03:42.960> here<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.290> have

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
this this pattern right here you have

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.990 
this this pattern right here you have
her<00:03:43.560> Peter<00:03:43.830> redstone<00:03:44.280> repeater<00:03:44.550> redstone<00:03:44.970> and

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
her Peter redstone repeater redstone and

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.940 
her Peter redstone repeater redstone and
then<00:03:45.240> you<00:03:45.360> put<00:03:45.570> torque<00:03:45.870> or<00:03:46.260> blocks<00:03:46.680> with

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
then you put torque or blocks with

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.040 
then you put torque or blocks with
torches<00:03:47.250> on<00:03:47.490> them<00:03:47.670> on<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.850> outside<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.780> just

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
torches on them on the outside you just

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.080 
torches on them on the outside you just
keep<00:03:49.200> doing<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.650> over<00:03:49.710> and<00:03:50.070> over<00:03:50.820> again

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
keep doing that over and over again

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.220 
keep doing that over and over again
until<00:03:51.590> finally<00:03:52.590> your<00:03:53.550> plate<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.150> down<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.990> just

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
until finally your plate is down to just

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.490 
until finally your plate is down to just
one<00:03:55.710> there<00:03:55.950> nothing<00:03:56.580> or<00:03:56.700> whatever<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.500> then

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
one there nothing or whatever and then

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.660 
one there nothing or whatever and then
I'd<00:03:59.070> ride<00:03:59.810> there<00:04:00.810> i<00:04:00.840> just<00:04:01.140> used<00:04:01.620> inversions<00:04:02.460> to

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
I'd ride there i just used inversions to

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.280 
I'd ride there i just used inversions to
take<00:04:02.970> all<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.680> circuit<00:04:04.680> down<00:04:05.070> below<00:04:06.290> that's

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
take all the circuit down below that's

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.010 
take all the circuit down below that's
how<00:04:07.490> that's<00:04:08.490> how<00:04:08.700> you're<00:04:09.450> going<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:09.660> build<00:04:09.810> any

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
how that's how you're going to build any

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.100 
how that's how you're going to build any
floor<00:04:10.320> like<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.890> i'll<00:04:10.950> probably<00:04:12.110> do

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
floor like this and i'll probably do

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.199 
floor like this and i'll probably do
something<00:04:13.440> more<00:04:13.800> about<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.850> feature

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
something more about that that feature

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.920 
something more about that that feature
later<00:04:17.239> okay<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:19.190> this<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:21.120> biggest<00:04:21.420> thing

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
later okay so this is the biggest thing

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.630 
later okay so this is the biggest thing
I've<00:04:22.170> probably<00:04:22.440> ever<00:04:22.650> built<00:04:23.070> with<00:04:23.280> redstone

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
I've probably ever built with redstone

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.550 
I've probably ever built with redstone
and<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:24.390> biggest<00:04:24.750> one<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:24.930> probably<00:04:25.200> ever<00:04:25.440> will

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
and the biggest one I probably ever will

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.300 
and the biggest one I probably ever will
build<00:04:25.980> with<00:04:26.160> redstone<00:04:26.540> it's<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:28.650> pointless<00:04:28.920> to

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
build with redstone it's so pointless to

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.909 
build with redstone it's so pointless to
do<00:04:29.460> anything<00:04:29.669> else<00:04:30.090> please<00:04:30.630> don't<00:04:31.350> ask<00:04:31.590> me<00:04:31.800> for

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
do anything else please don't ask me for

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.480 
do anything else please don't ask me for
some<00:04:32.640> Oh<00:04:32.880> build<00:04:33.450> 150<00:04:34.230> 150<00:04:35.010> I'm<00:04:35.100> not<00:04:35.310> I'm<00:04:35.460> not

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
some Oh build 150 150 I'm not I'm not

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.010 
some Oh build 150 150 I'm not I'm not
gonna<00:04:35.820> do<00:04:36.030> that<00:04:36.060> because<00:04:37.700> yeah<00:04:38.700> it's<00:04:39.120> have

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
gonna do that because yeah it's have

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.390 
gonna do that because yeah it's have
them<00:04:40.200> that<00:04:40.350> look<00:04:40.500> like<00:04:40.650> an<00:04:40.800> aircraft<00:04:41.220> carrier

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
them that look like an aircraft carrier

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.700 
them that look like an aircraft carrier
I<00:04:41.790> think<00:04:42.540> so<00:04:42.830> so<00:04:43.830> well<00:04:45.350> exit<00:04:46.350> out<00:04:46.470> of<00:04:46.500> this

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
I think so so well exit out of this

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.050 
I think so so well exit out of this
video<00:04:47.100> with<00:04:47.280> 1<00:04:47.550> FPS<00:04:47.820> and<00:04:49.640> not<00:04:50.640> just<00:04:50.850> look

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
video with 1 FPS and not just look

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.320 
video with 1 FPS and not just look
wonderful

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.520
