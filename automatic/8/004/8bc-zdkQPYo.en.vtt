00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Zetti is the consecration of time that does not 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.010
 It's only São Paulo and it's champion. 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.269
 joão ivete vai player was born to 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:30.150
 serve twice 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:34.290
 hey hey, I think it's true that happens 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.590
 arises is a somewhat unscheduled thing 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.940
 because the goalkeeper no matter how you create 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.540
 The goalkeeper is not 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.719
 You do not know if it's going to be me. 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.390
 speaking this in an age group is not yet 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.160
 young man because his behavior will 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.160
 be professional when it reaches this 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.140
 Professional maturity but for this 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.920
 have to play without having many 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.410
 games 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.750
 regardless of the goal he takes I'll say 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.909
 the goalkeeper lives to take the more goal 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.580
 goals and takes better you stay because this 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.869
 correcting if you continue to take 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.790
 too much goal there because it's wrong but every 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.340
 goal you take you start to react 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.189
 in a different way begins to train more 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.070
 So this one but I think the 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.320
 methodologies that you have in your clubs 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.229
 she does not follow a pattern is not 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.380
 following a Brazilian standard of 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.140
 club of palms the club of sao paulo 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.020
 of Flemish the team trains the same 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.040
 way is not that there is a way to 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.140
 training does not exist then because each 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.850
 goalkeeper coach does the work whom 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.420
 do you think you have to do it? 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.149
 so I think the club clubs do not have 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.220
 a definition that could say so 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.340
 looks CB wants all clubs 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.899
 work that way the guy is 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.140
 better than this 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.590
 it is merit of each individual of each 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.079
 athlete but does not have a pattern 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.690
 a meeting of goalkeeper coaches 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.000
 to switch experience on the contrary 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.210
 one coach does not want to tell the other 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.250
 what are you doing 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.440
 and it seems that the business that the 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.830
 I'm going to lose my job if the other trains. 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.920
 better than me is not so then I 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.110
 what is lacking and if I miss this process I think 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.210
 that I need to approach, I was seeing 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:34.420
 as a coach working at parana 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.310
 doing college in college 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.520
 talking to the fable melo nor the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.370
 Guilherme are the other two also is 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.800
 he's got the idea of it all at 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.980
 people assemble and emerged guarantees believed 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.570
 need to have space only for 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.400
 goalkeepers training the goalkeeper 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.640
 regardless of age 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.620
 If you were an amateur, you'll be a professional. 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.950
 that lacked this started with 10 students 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.090
 there right through that thing that will give 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.040
 It sure does not go suddenly in six months 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.370
 already had almost 80 students 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.350
 today we are running there with 250 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.970
 average 250 students every teacher 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.600
 hence they are not formed do not need 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.300
 necessarily be 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.760
 It is a former goalkeeper right but the guy 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.420
 like soccer knows it's a little 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.880
 The ball can teach us, too. 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.340
 teachers and raise this 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.570
 methodology that we have created and is 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.930
 Clear by class 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.150
 take it by age group and the people in 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.260
 of this methodology we can 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.910
 analyze in the first class 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.420
 the technical and physical level of that student 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:58.190
 No class, we already have one. 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.470
 positioning of how it is 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.780
 on a scale that we have formed 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.050
 What is the scale that it is to be a 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.540
 goalkeeper is not the first time I took 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:14.130
 a ball and it was a glove or if it already has 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.200
 a passage through games to amateur everything 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.830
 but already have a knowledge there is a 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.940
 work there is a technique is nine 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:26.670
 movements that we indicate to which 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.970
 who is a beginner so to play in the goal 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:33.720
 he has to know 9 basic movement is 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.960
 to be able to speak the father or the sound goalkeeper 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.140
 I do not know, I already fell I know how to get the ball. 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:44.070
 I already know how to catch the ground ball, right? 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.350
 goal and make the bed fit that the 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.260
 people call then there are nine movements 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:53.670
 that there is a need you learn 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:56.370
 and of course does not learn one day you have right 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.620
 that gradually working and a 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.600
 thing for goalkeeper is important is the 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.020
 repeat the movement you repeat 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.050
 repeats the movement every time the 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.480
 goalkeeper comes in to do a job he 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.120
 makes these nine moves and has knots 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.390
 we have high yield that are goalkeepers 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.110
 who come from clubs and stayed with 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.440
 11 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.940
 It's absent is the club for the sake of 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.190
 contract 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.160
 is the case of Rubinho rubinho had here 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.980
 keeping the shape after he came back 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.670
 In Brazil there is a working situation . 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.320
 very intense same specific for 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.920
 the one for that category and the 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:41.370
 adults are not at night the adult is the 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.250
 looking for more came to class 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:48.480
 where are all adults playing in 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.850
 weekend in the club and 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.310
 here to improve and maintain the shape 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.310
 Is not this physics very pleasurable?
