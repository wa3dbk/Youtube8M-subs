00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.289
 is 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.910
 the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.310
 no 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.480
 hello friends music lovers well back at 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.209
 usual appointment with the how 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.989
 to play with the beautiful azure roma 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.799
 has the slime 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.580
 the hard thing about this song is 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.810
 follow the riff that practically closes 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:39.900
 the introduction because played on several 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:41.819
 wanting strings you can help yourself with per 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:48.569
 execution using both the pick 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:52.739
 and let the fingers be like this 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:55.739
 in any case it's a riff let's say it's not 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.660
 always easy to do 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.560
 so much so that they too often in 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.670
 live were not flawless other 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.709
 very pretty thing 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.629
 in this passage is the use of the riff 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:13.190
 in the part following the verse that 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.190
 it tastes very hindricks are 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.660
 we have seen a similar thing in the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.510
 in the autoplay episode of the song 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.460
 of hendrix manic depression where precisely 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.650
 there were some ideas of his own 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.600
 this riff very very similar though 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.160
 you wanted to improvise on this piece 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.370
 pay attention to the shade because it can 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.460
 often but not always deceive 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.540
 this case in the demonstration 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.430
 the first agreement does not determine in 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.120
 so let's say precise the tonality of 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.340
 a piece this part onwards I sell for 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.680
 points all 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.959
 the shade from which these are derived 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.390
 agreements should be analyzed 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.879
 harmonica that at the moment is not there 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.830
 would take too long takes us 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.599
 however not on a toning to say 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.489
 higher but on a shade of sol 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.650
 greater then if you wanted to improvise 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.580
 on this track do not use the say scale 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.580
 greater please
