flare here on May Day so what you want

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.580 
flare here on May Day so what you want
to<00:00:09.269> do<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.570> once<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.960> kind<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.200> get<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.500> this

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
to do is once you kind of get to this

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.320 
to do is once you kind of get to this
spawn<00:00:10.920> area<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.759> want<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:11.969> come<00:00:12.120> up<00:00:12.150> these

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
spawn area you want to come up these

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.879 
spawn area you want to come up these
stairs<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.960> it's<00:00:13.080> going<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> bench

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
stairs and it's going to be a bench

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.320 
stairs and it's going to be a bench
right<00:00:14.130> here<00:00:14.160> it's<00:00:14.849> going<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.150> two

right here it's going to be two

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.900 
right here it's going to be two
schematics<00:00:15.900> one<00:00:16.199> for<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> pipe<00:00:16.859> bomb<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.369> one

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
schematics one for the pipe bomb and one

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.849 
schematics one for the pipe bomb and one
for<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.210> sticky<00:00:18.539> flare<00:00:18.810> but<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.470> time<00:00:19.650> we're

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
for the sticky flare but this time we're

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.080 
for the sticky flare but this time we're
going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> be<00:00:20.100> doing<00:00:20.160> these<00:00:20.400> two<00:00:20.640> key<00:00:20.850> flares

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
going to be doing these two key flares

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.490 
going to be doing these two key flares
so<00:00:21.270> once<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.600> pick<00:00:21.720> up<00:00:21.869> your<00:00:21.990> schematic

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
so once you pick up your schematic

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.140 
so once you pick up your schematic
should<00:00:23.039> show<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> bottom<00:00:23.760> left<00:00:24.029> hand

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
should show in the bottom left hand

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.170 
should show in the bottom left hand
corner<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.750> your<00:00:24.840> screen<00:00:25.670> just<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.760> quick<00:00:26.939> note

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
corner of your screen just a quick note

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.470 
corner of your screen just a quick note
to<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> parts<00:00:28.560> are<00:00:28.800> exactly<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> same<00:00:29.880> for

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
to of the parts are exactly the same for

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.150 
to of the parts are exactly the same for
the<00:00:30.570> pipe<00:00:30.750> bomb<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.410> sticky<00:00:31.710> flare<00:00:31.949> is

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the pipe bomb and the sticky flare is

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.010 
the pipe bomb and the sticky flare is
just<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.700> part<00:00:33.090> that's<00:00:33.360> different<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:33.960> i'm

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
just one part that's different so i'm

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.750 
just one part that's different so i'm
going<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> show<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.440> where<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.399> find

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
going to show you where you can find

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.440 
going to show you where you can find
these<00:00:36.000> parts<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:37.160> i<00:00:38.160> guess<00:00:38.430> both<00:00:38.730> items<00:00:39.090> but

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
these parts for i guess both items but

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.209 
these parts for i guess both items but
right<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:39.870> we're<00:00:40.020> focusing<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.860> sticking

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
right now we're focusing on the sticking

store I've already took them out all the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.639 
store I've already took them out all the
parts<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.539> pipe<00:00:45.780> bombs<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.379> I'm<00:00:46.500> not

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
boxes in here and the tool boxes contain

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.979 
boxes in here and the tool boxes contain
parts<00:00:55.230> for<00:00:55.530> buildable<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.750> haven't

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
parts for buildable so if you haven't

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.869 
parts for buildable so if you haven't
built<00:00:58.320> anything<00:00:58.559> else<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.340> room<00:00:59.670> right<00:00:59.820> here

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
used the parts or taking the parts from

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.320 
used the parts or taking the parts from
this<00:01:07.710> room<00:01:07.979> yet<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> room<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.180> here

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
this room yet this is the room up here

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.510 
this room yet this is the room up here
you<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.479> place<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.320> drill<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.830> you're<00:01:11.369> going

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
you can place the drill and you're going

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.609 
you can place the drill and you're going
to<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.909> these<00:01:12.210> toolboxes<00:01:13.110> scattered<00:01:13.530> around

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
to have these toolboxes scattered around

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.460 
to have these toolboxes scattered around
the<00:01:13.830> room<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.340> here's<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:15.240> there's<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.140> fuse

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the room so here's one there's the fuse

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.710 
the room so here's one there's the fuse
and<00:01:16.710> then<00:01:17.490> there's<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.090> another<00:01:18.420> one

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and then there's going to be another one

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.820 
and then there's going to be another one
over<00:01:18.960> here<00:01:20.090> that<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> TNT<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.409> those<00:01:22.619> two

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
over here that is the TNT so those two

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.539 
over here that is the TNT so those two
parts<00:01:23.310> are<00:01:23.490> also<00:01:23.939> required<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.650> pipe

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
parts are also required for the pipe

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.490 
parts are also required for the pipe
bomb<00:01:26.880> now<00:01:27.180> we're<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.479> missing<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.140> part

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
bomb now we're just missing the one part

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.690 
bomb now we're just missing the one part
and<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:29.640> actually<00:01:30.390> found<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.280> toolbox<00:01:32.280> right

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
and I actually found a toolbox right

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.480 
and I actually found a toolbox right
down<00:01:33.000> here<00:01:33.270> actually<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.250> go<00:01:35.340> ahead

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
down here actually so we can go ahead

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.330 
down here actually so we can go ahead
and<00:01:35.610> grab<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.060> last<00:01:36.329> part<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.159> there's<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and grab this last part and there's the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.690 
and grab this last part and there's the
resin<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.329> go<00:01:39.710> all<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.520> do

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
resin and there we go all you have to do

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.210
