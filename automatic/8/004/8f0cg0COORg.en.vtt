00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.700
 then there are different situations that can occur when resolving 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.050
 from the last two center 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.789
 the first thing I can prevent 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:11.809
 is that it appears as if everything has been solved 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:17.710
 only this tweet has yet to be exchanged because god versus anp 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.439
 Rotterdam but not coming 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.439
 photo Ã¯ yes so throws parkkwartier 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.449
 green but that comes on a blue so you have to buy 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.230
 to swap these two center there we use this already happened 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.359
 very sharp drag 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.920
 cape town focus locked 4 2 chelsea 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.280
 you can now see both the Ghent parties 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.060
 it may be easy to see god what all those old people do 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.060
 instead of having to remember real ones 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.200
 Another situation that can happen is this 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.210
 but therefore mainly in the banking sector 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.229
 If you then give good spinning success, the top hat will finish 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:00.130
 in the report 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.000
 that he is someone who needs you then 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 with this moment still in place 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.850
 first the ones that come up on the right must know all the neighborhoods 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.450
 and then use for this makes brand new something with ERP software 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.420
 long 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.630
 sit is both the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.950
 maybe this is also covered why not remember this algorithm 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.530
 look at what the bar is to do on it pull it a little easier to remember 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 this situation 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.370
 is much more 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.490
 a huge opportunity a sport of the skating federation known 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.210
 the first we are going to do is look at what percent a booklet on 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.510
 top right 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.170
 of affairs 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.290
 in my case that is a good thing 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.100
 we are going to view 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.650
 this one 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.840
 click here 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.219
 so the left bar at the top matches the d 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.020
 is that right? 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.490
 well come but also the algorithm very strong 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.410
 decided this 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.929
 ERP software 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.929
 then you see the pair came 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.939
 when that is not the case 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:14.969
 use 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.449
 another high 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:18.799
 and also guus meeuwis 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.189
 very strong 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.709
 and now 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.309
 ERP software 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.219
 and after he entered the cell in ap 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.439
 when both sides have a care group pattern 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.730
 must first see if the one 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.520
 therefore a village on the top right corner is anp 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.520
 rarely is that they are indefinite to a link 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.849
 when that is when it is not in this situation 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.229
 we can run from the upper camp until that work 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.619
 and others must follow possibly brand new 4 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.469
 cape town work 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.529
 after the second too 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.569
 we also have just about every situation 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.749
 here all five subjects have a sort of l on it 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.159
 if this happens 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.539
 we actually know 2 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:08.710
 solved 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.710
 ghosts and two pounds solved prof 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.420
 3 and then we first look at the unresolved beam 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:22.069
 comes on top and delivery via the left 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.899
 the scepter by the cell 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:31.199
 unresolved beam on the right 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.109
 what kind of paste 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.889
 so it should not be good because here have Paris 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.949
 started here 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.949
 but must be purple green 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.969
 if we amstel the clock live we have a pair of shoes niro pair of spades 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.999
 we will then logically run them together 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:57.139
 the star player 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:58.439
 differences 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.669
 we have two beams 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:06.309
 we hope that you will be able to find out the rest yourself, even though the centers 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:09.029
 in the right place 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:13.089
 and when it does not sleep badly then remedied and if you have one like that 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.769
 is 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.359
 then you can proceed to step 2
