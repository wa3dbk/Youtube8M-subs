00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 a presentation of an installation in 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.150
 a jungle trap so and that's at the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.070
 quote concerns the icbm mode survey 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.540
 it allows us to launch missiles and 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.460
 an interesting thing like that in 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.859
 minecraft remotely you doubt it so 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.890
 of the saas and that's the coffee hole at a 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.449
 nuclear missile and also for the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.740
 Radiation is the earth there 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.320
 transforming some evening two skins 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.180
 something that does not move as if they 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.800
 were radioactive and some blocks 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.460
 have turned into cobol I find 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.140
 it's very very successful but I have 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.820
 small but today it's a 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.750
 bomb not very big sex always for 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.620
 the nuclear missile 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.989
 pat the rotrou earlier and if not it's 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.510
 interesting about tree blogs that 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.949
 are gone it's the same so here I go 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.180
 launch i 'm going to go to the facility I 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.110
 will launch a conventional missile 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.710
 first I have to get back the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:03.379
 strings and otherwise he goes too far 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:10.100
 here it's 119 295 in cynicism 195 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.100
 I was fat lag by the very boring 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.380
 the vampire gets used 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.570
 what are people who do not have 6 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.280
 and 1 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.120
 I try 10 minutes with weapons 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.120
 you will understand why 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.890
 So here is the initiation to quillio 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.049
 so I have four auto facilities so 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.049
 each installation requires four 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.670
 blowdown generators and it takes hot 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.929
 fisheries to introduce them to the ragga 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.090
 ska almost hat 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.899
 so here are four coal generators 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.130
 for each for each installation 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.090
 so the body a little infinite 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.640
 so that's the stingy do that you 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.729
 allows to find the coordinates on the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.099
 hand I was going to say what essential me 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.689
 yeah so here's the good radar 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.770
 excuse is enough electricity but 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.910
 soon will see more coal going 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.470
 stop here is pretty interesting so 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.090
 that's really this yellow red to a 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.430
 green blueberry 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.769
 especially since I was russet for better 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.930
 steal it when I 'm leaving 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.390
 this moment there is only one for 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.930
 let's go by then so I pass 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:33.590
 my here the web not on its bases there it is 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:36.090
 I enter the coordinates here less 119 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.489
 295 is perhaps this so here goes here 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.970
 she you see the crises is cursed 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.709
 lodges 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.950
 we are not going to drag their language and 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:48.150
 sharepoint that's obviously 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.340
 ready to launch so once a 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.650
 second time 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.799
 door 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:03:02.909
 and I am I am not to see how 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:02.909
 an idea to see him explode 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.400
 oula oula 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.400
 c 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.269
 Oh 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:21.280
 explosions have not occurred but good in 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:23.739
 big it destroys ie 9 out of 9 blocks me on 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.420
 nine that this model is very useful in 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.860
 multi when you want to make yourself 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.230
 party tea party 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.540
 make your little ones 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.579
 facilities principle you do some 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.920
 ti and so in each team are two 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.560
 scouts a year ago would be a 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.790
 technician the launcher and will illuminate them 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.920
 do not have touch - ups 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.870
 harvested a simple technician who can 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.670
 so scouts him they go 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.769
 look for coordinates of two 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.519
 locations of the opposing team who 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.170
 would be concealed before the launcher in 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.329
 to suffer he is waiting to be given his 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.920
 coordinates and he launches missiles and the 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.150
 first party that destroyed the four 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.530
 amenities 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.500
 the radar and the three launchers of 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:10.440
 the opposing team to win so that's 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.750
 super interesting nor it's super cool 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.879
 afterwards so I advise especially no 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.380
 do facts obviously not you 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.510
 to make discover underground debate 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.789
 like that because new skies and 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.130
 bullets in the air a little too bright of a 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.380
 to taste 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.360
 this is a safe hidden in principle it 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.470
 do not walk from a seat 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.780
 good stamp well 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:37.090
 inseparable croteau so here you go 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.000
 oh yes there is a second piece wants 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.340
 because there are no chicks when 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.800
 caen plays online with that so that's 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.440
 dirty our ammo position or not 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.820
 to have more for each for each 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.370
 part so there are all the sisters 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.680
 home in fact there we do not see 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.599
 gentlemen because that's what it's used for 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.940
 it's the image of a missile except that 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.820
 it's not compatible with this string mode 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.370
 which allows us to store item 7 times 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.210
 more stylish sat and pants 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.979
 the exhibition pants here it is not 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.160
 again we see a lot of types of 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.800
 way missiles 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.000
 everything there is nuclear repetition 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.920
 Nazi crimes 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.880
 it's the mp to destroy the 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.070
 facilities of others who at 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.690
 fragmentation there is also normal the 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.870
 incendiary missiles when sorting which 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:32.280
 is old liu not change the shop that 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.260
 so that's a little sweet see them 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.680
 poured stopped there is everything from wheelwright and 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.270
 dogs to restart 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.040
 so here it was yes but time for 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.780
 this first video of the channel hopes 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.390
 you are not alone and the malted 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.160
 big lag of which I tell you more 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.160
 stimulating video ciao
