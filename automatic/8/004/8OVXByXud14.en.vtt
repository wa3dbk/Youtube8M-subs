 quite a lot of likes and views and in 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.400
 Overall I recently found a very cool 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.380

 I will do in general 1 will fall the shield which you 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.110
 asked to review so the first type 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.600
 called them exactly English 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.660
 Letters are written so they probably are not already 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.180
 45 people wrote that I did a review on 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.550
 this with no i because it is interesting in this 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.300
 I tried it and yes it is interesting 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.269
 let's create the world the way we see it 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.950
 first of all we are actually in 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.060
 village yes let's take it 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:16.360
 let there be some kind of village 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:19.640
 about if in her what it's called 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.700
 Well, in general, where lava is a small loot I 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.100
 I did not find here but the interest in this 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.710
 the village is that we go down here 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.300
 here we go to this well here 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.870
 get down so let's take it right away 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.820
 torch 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.470
 so I think with the name already guessed 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:44.229
 what will be here so dig down to the banks 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:47.420
 and so let's them now so awkward 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.490
 everything is visible as you see here such 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.590
 here are some pebbles that shouldn't 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.540
 you will be here you will not do 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.600
 must appear by themselves that is 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.060
 generated and yes guys this is it so i 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.400
 got out this here is such a place alice 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.650
 how to call it waist lock of some kind 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.659
 underground whether further I do not know in general 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.690
 here if you can walk along to collect 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.009
 loot and here there are chests and also here 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.109
 I think somewhere should be 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.760
 Ender portal but unfortunately does not work 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.709
 since the pact is Yiddish but does not work in 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.389
 general here is such a terrain in general 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.939

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.560

 here there will be but you can not see later 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.069
 they are a little later so we dig down 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.719
 let's take the torch and we will be here 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.999
 such a place here can be like 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:10.730
 on the iron spread new well after all already there 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:14.859
 iron is there but we are interested in digging 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:20.209
 digging digging digging digging 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:22.550
 I 'll put it on let's go and us 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.970
 meets now where is she 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:30.050
 so we still need to dig deep enough 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:34.480
 drip so well so here we meet 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:37.970
 gold to dig further and we appear 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.610
 Well, let's just put all five on here 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.310
 so here is such a thing we have it 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.310
 in general, do now we remove and go to the right 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.950
 here we see gold redstone again 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.620
 we go further here you are wrapping 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.460
 right a little further still here here and 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:00.200
 we find diamonds yes diamonds here 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:04.310
 so here we go back back back 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.010
 so from where i got out i got out guf already 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.440
 forgot where from my from here to 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.300
 from here let's go up there somewhere 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.470
 still had a diamond don't remember exactly where in 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.660
 general need to look 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.459
 I think somewhere here in general there are many 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.549
 enough diamond in my yes somewhere 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.490
 here still smear another look 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.890
 anointed with maz maiden in my opinion yes here still 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.530
 somewhere there was a diamond for accuracy still there 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.990
 I told you I was looking straight for a diamond 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.740
 before that and found diamond here 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.890
 look tel mazda no poma sounds i don't 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.690
 I see general look like and 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.010
 still and minus you on the walls of this 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.320
 sedan and end 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.870
 still very cool thing is always in 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.590
 the tone is that now again I will find a way out 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.340
 where is the exit 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.050
 but I can not find this devil's way out 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.790
 Generally the village about which he spoke there 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.930
 there is the name of a man like that 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.210
 blacksmith or i don't know how exactly 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.190
 called general fly now you will see 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.960
 there is enough normal loot not that 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.090
 straight woman is enough 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.910
 the funniest of teach you sedan i'm 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.070
 tom that's so cool here let's say 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.680
 good yes that is, you can assemble a font 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.520
 believe to gather diamonds to gather in 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.230
 this blacksmiths 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.570
 I 'll call you that 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.620
 but the fact is that as a link to my 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.870
 group in vk 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.970
 so worked but not so go here 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.300
 so also coincided that if you see 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:29.060
 this you will find diamonds and find many 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.580
 gold and find here like this 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.470
