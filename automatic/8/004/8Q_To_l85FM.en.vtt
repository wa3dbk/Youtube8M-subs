like<00:00:54.060> that<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.510> simple<00:00:54.690> enough<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.260> can

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
like that it's simple enough but I can

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.840 
like that it's simple enough but I can
be<00:00:55.530> effective<00:00:55.920> if<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.190> use<00:00:56.220> in<00:00:56.580> the<00:00:56.670> right

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
be effective if you use in the right

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.810 
be effective if you use in the right
scenario<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.500> what<00:00:58.650> it's<00:00:58.830> doing<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.280> when<00:00:59.700> you

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
scenario and what it's doing is when you

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.370 
scenario and what it's doing is when you
create<00:01:00.060> intervals<00:01:00.630> it's<00:01:00.780> between<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.140> first

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
create intervals it's between the first

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.920 
create intervals it's between the first
note<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.830> play<00:01:01.860> and<00:01:02.690> whatever<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
note that you play and whatever the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.210 
note that you play and whatever the
second<00:01:04.229> oh<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.409> gonna<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.009> don't

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
second oh it's gonna be so you don't

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
second oh it's gonna be so you don't
want<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.460> go<00:01:07.070> even<00:01:08.070> though<00:01:08.159> that's<00:01:08.280> great<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
want to go even though that's great it

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.429 
want to go even though that's great it
is<00:01:09.450> brilliant<00:01:09.719> there's<00:01:10.049> nothing<00:01:10.259> wrong<00:01:10.380> with

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
is brilliant there's nothing wrong with

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.319 
is brilliant there's nothing wrong with
maybe<00:01:10.950> changing<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> notes<00:01:11.880> around<00:01:12.149> a<00:01:12.240> little

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
maybe changing the notes around a little

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.840 
maybe changing the notes around a little
bit<00:01:12.509> so<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.710> particular<00:01:14.039> idea<00:01:14.399> is<00:01:14.549> gonna<00:01:14.700> be

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
bit so this particular idea is gonna be
