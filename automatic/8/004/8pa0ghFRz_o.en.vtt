00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.430
 We are looking for the official forum section of the game 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.990

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.810

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:33.979
 quicker and more content 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.420

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.800

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.610
 convenience 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.260
 for example, here's 085 too much erasing 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:03.580

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:03.580

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:37.730
 delete them you can not delete 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:40.620
