here and turn this lever and these these

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.609 
here and turn this lever and these these
electricity<00:01:10.909> things<00:01:11.479> I<00:01:11.750> guess<00:01:11.960> these<00:01:12.350> light

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
electricity things I guess these light

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.820 
electricity things I guess these light
electricity<00:01:13.220> balls<00:01:13.700> basically<00:01:14.659> make<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.439> the

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
electricity balls basically make the the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.980 
electricity balls basically make the the
sludge<00:01:16.130> kind<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.549> stuff<00:01:16.760> go<00:01:16.939> away<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.479> you're

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
sludge kind of stuff go away and you're

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.450 
sludge kind of stuff go away and you're
able<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:18.290> cross<00:01:18.560> it<00:01:18.770> just<00:01:18.920> makes<00:01:19.100> it<00:01:19.220> water

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
able to cross it just makes it water

like a plate on the ground this plate

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.670 
like a plate on the ground this plate
right<00:02:18.700> here<00:02:19.120> it's<00:02:19.450> gonna<00:02:19.569> be<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.750> plate<00:02:20.080> that

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
right here it's gonna be a plate that

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.100 
right here it's gonna be a plate that
you<00:02:20.890> can't<00:02:21.100> get<00:02:21.250> through<00:02:21.459> go<00:02:22.330> ahead<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.750> do

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
you can't get through go ahead and do

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.990 
you can't get through go ahead and do
your<00:02:23.260> soul<00:02:23.500> splitter<00:02:23.860> on<00:02:24.040> top<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.550> this<00:02:24.730> I

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
your soul splitter on top of this I

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.170 
your soul splitter on top of this I
guess<00:02:25.630> this<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:27.160> bigger<00:02:27.400> plate<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:28.060> the

guess this the bigger plate on the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.720 
guess this the bigger plate on the
ground<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.690> then<00:02:29.590> switch<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:29.890> your<00:02:30.069> soul<00:02:30.400> form

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
ground and then switch to your soul form

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.970 
ground and then switch to your soul form
stand<00:02:31.000> on<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.269> other<00:02:31.300> lever<00:02:31.720> run<00:02:32.500> through<00:02:32.830> the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
stand on the other lever run through the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.670 
stand on the other lever run through the
gate<00:02:33.190> cuz<00:02:33.489> now<00:02:33.670> it's<00:02:33.700> open<00:02:34.300> hop<00:02:34.989> up<00:02:35.230> this<00:02:35.380> ledge

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
gate cuz now it's open hop up this ledge

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.670 
gate cuz now it's open hop up this ledge
wrap<00:02:36.640> around<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.480> then<00:02:37.840> touch<00:02:38.079> this<00:02:38.380> switch

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
wrap around and then touch this switch

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.830 
wrap around and then touch this switch
and<00:02:39.040> with<00:02:39.640> those<00:02:39.790> two<00:02:40.030> switches<00:02:40.329> down<00:02:40.630> it

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
and with those two switches down it

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.620 
and with those two switches down it
causes<00:02:41.049> that<00:02:41.470> plate<00:02:41.829> to<00:02:42.190> open<00:02:42.640> up<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.000> now

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
causes that plate to open up and now

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.539 
causes that plate to open up and now

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
similar to when we got death grip

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.199 
similar to when we got death grip
you<00:03:23.890> just<00:03:24.070> want<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.280> keep<00:03:24.400> hitting<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.850> back<00:03:25.030> in
