00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.550
 the encyclopedia marvel with the subtitle 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.309
 the most unlikely of the history of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.050
 editing since it's a reminder so 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.800
 it's the encyclopedia of characters from 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.510
 the marvel universe 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.260
 in case here it was not enough 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.980
 why not stopped this book is published 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.739
 at smic 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.050
 archives we are there for 400 pages and 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.600
 it's obviously a translated edition 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.940
 of a book he says is one by marvel and 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.790
 by kindersley dorling so necessarily 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.200
 in the united states 400 pages with you 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.350
 have guessed it all marvel and the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.840
 1000 miles character 400 pages of 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.869
 pictures everywhere illustrations of 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.369
 high quality and necessarily from the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.580
 first page or almost 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.560
 our friend captain america who are watching 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.680
 on us he is right 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.030
 good a preface of stable y necessarily not 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.409
 can not help but appear in 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.030
 all the marvel movies right now that 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.659
 make a preface here it's a little bit 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.360
 his job 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.220
 kirby jack there was no availability 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.960
 to write this preface so they have 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.970
 let the job stan lee good that's 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.979
 well normal also found like 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.869
 senior collaborator tom of falco who 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.420
 is one of the former editors 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.520
 from marvel so beautiful people to 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.159
 some historians of comics comics 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.290
 and then well we'll be able to get 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.759
 dive then I turn the page the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.369
 I arrive on the first of this 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.049
 encyclopedia on so a kind of 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.820
 model like this one where we will find 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.680
 according to the importance of 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.540
 characters and their recurrence in the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.970
 series and many more articles or 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.940
 less big ranked in order 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.400
 alphabetical characters but in 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.120
 English so versions 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.790
 original do not look for serval for 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.170
 wolverine it will not work well he 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.730
 will have to get by with the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.459
 names in English obviously these names 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.579
 there are translated in parentheses to 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.620
 side with necessarily characters 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.659
 highly unlikely that you 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.109
 find here for example the opponent 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:39.019
 that species of a good that appeared in 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.400
 an episode of x men in 84 so I'm doing 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.319
 no head of course since each 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.450
 notice and you see it as and when 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.930
 measure each each character has a 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.290
 forgiveness with his name his activity 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.760
 its base 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.379
 so yes the basics and why not 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.389
 it's an encyclopedia so we all have to 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.400
 found it's mandatory its size 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.470
 his weight his eyes his hair you when 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.060
 all that is possible to know 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.700
 and then what's interesting when 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.109
 even for you who kivu who wanted 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.769
 dig the marvel universe 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:08.180
 the first appearance of the character 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.970
 in one of the comics good here it's a 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.409
 special page for adventures so 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.400
 for the avengers as it was said to 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.930
 the time we said strange and we're going 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.129
 so really find everyone 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.449
 everyone everyone I looked for 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.739
 the darkest superheroes who 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:28.220
 appear on three boxes in a 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.750
 an old-fashioned encyclopedia that was 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.250
 for example a universe flight that had 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.430
 edited the one that takes place in the years 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.480
 80 we find them here bishop that you 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.819
 see each time with 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.060
 rather current illustrations in all 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.349
 most current case of the characters 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.489
 when some have the chance to 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.459
 to cross the times 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.019
 it is sometimes the case it is sometimes 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.370
 much less the cape and the sword by 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.859
 example here that yves who works with 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.919
 with the x men and the others and especially 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.629
 spider man by the way since 82 but some 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:03.199
 regular appearances make their 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:05.479
 design evolves we find a small 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.579
 summarized a little bit of their activity and 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:09.470
 then sometimes small nuggets goodies 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.810
 like that of the little ones the tab 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.680
 extra where we have more info 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.540
 and even 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.180
 so it's really a book that 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.889
 opens on any page once 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.109
 more doctors little thumbs here 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.850
 why not, and then that will 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.600
 flip through like that really 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.130
 for fun purpose and then why not 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.540
 if you are doing a thesis on the universe 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.600
 de marvel it can still serve 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.790
 you have two times a time a 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.740
 special chapter on a decade a 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.950
 marvel decade or on a big 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.350
 character here the decade 70 with 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.690
 the general atmosphere some convent of 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.390
 the time we still remember 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.500
 the small recitals rectangle narrative with the 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.220
 head or the heads of the characters 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.960
 of this edition's edition 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.340
 So that's always a little fun 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.810
 and then even from time to time I put 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.380
 little bookmarks this time 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.240
 be careful, do not laugh at 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.400
 somewhat beefier illustrations a little 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.740
 more friendly and namor for the blow here who 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.050
 stick with it with this illustration 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.130
 small fish finally by a 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.200
 atmosphere drags to death and then in the 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.300
 things that are awesome and that 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.440
 I wanted to show you in particular 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.720
 up 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:26.930
 hello there is an interesting Wolverine 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.470
 with with here are his true double say 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.590
 that like that 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.910
 father and son you know and if you 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.790
 did not know you had to keep abreast 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.710
 of what was happening in the comic and then 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.590
 interesting also the multi verse 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.720
 so with a summary sent that it's very 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.930
 therefore necessarily illustrated the articles 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.730
 are very summary but variants that 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.600
 have emerged in recent years 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.970
 the zombies for example the variant 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.160
 the universe 1602 finally something like 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.870
 that they give us a bit of an idea 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.610
 from where we are with all these 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.100
 characters obviously there are 1000 1 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.210
 I'm coming back here do not have to 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.490

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.470

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.050
 marvel had a cut that 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.450
 look strangely like his 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.080
