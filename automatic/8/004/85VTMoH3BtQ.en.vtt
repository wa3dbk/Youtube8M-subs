00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.250
 You're taking everything you have inside. 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.130
 Of the eight shots you can actually do 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.930
 eight I did four but our big 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.650
 our environment for 8 you have to 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:14.700
 with tomato sauce already puts it in a 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.700
 adds our stuffing in all of them 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.299
 all without a little you present the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.989
 filling 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:25.750
 before you have to with salt and after 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:30.549
 everyone is with our stuffing 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.010
 We'll add the grated cheese. 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.019
 parmesan in my opinion 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.440
 put the mozzarella cheese light 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.750
 it's also getting tasty, but in 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.510
 recipe said the parmesan and also 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.549
 good but give the one that had melted 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.639
 over riding she was going to be very 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.859
 good also in my opinion so far behind 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.780
 At home, do something different then 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.209
 remembering the recipe for 8 tomatoes in the 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.139
 If I did only four, you would put the 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.599
 tomatoes in a pan greased with olive oil and 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:03.849
 already put in the oven for 20 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.680
 minutes in the 200 degree fire after 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.850
 Ready, you take it out and it's going to be 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.220

 Delicious, have to eat hot. 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.040
 the tomato is very good so it is 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.650
 good not to take too much of the peel of the tomato 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.720
 of the tomato filling and there is a 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.930
 delicious and super light not worth it 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.340
 to experiment 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.500

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.170
