how to size up model like rigged models
because<00:00:28.500> usually<00:00:28.769> what<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:31.579> you<00:00:32.579> be

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
serious with me now just usually when

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.260 
serious with me now just usually when
you<00:00:38.670> would<00:00:38.790> size<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:40.579> maybe<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.090> not

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you would size up maybe it's just not

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.549 
you would size up maybe it's just not
doing<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.780> model<00:00:43.050> Oh

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
doing it to this model Oh

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.729 
doing it to this model Oh
but<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:44.700> usually<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.629> sort<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.050> does<00:00:46.440> go<00:00:46.710> a

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
but what usually it sort of does go a

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.029 
but what usually it sort of does go a
bit<00:00:46.890> funny<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> maybe<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:50.629> here<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:51.780> go

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
bit funny so maybe this one here we go

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.049 
bit funny so maybe this one here we go
it's<00:00:53.039> doing<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.670> once<00:00:53.969> you

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
it's doing it with this one once you

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.450 
it's doing it with this one once you
size<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.690> size<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> down<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.770> does<00:00:56.190> go<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
size it up in size it down it does go a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.000 
size it up in size it down it does go a
bit<00:00:56.640> funny<00:00:57.840> no<00:00:58.020> man<00:00:58.199> should<00:00:58.620> clear

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
bit funny no man should clear

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.240 
bit funny no man should clear

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
slender um so what the way to sort make

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.719 
slender um so what the way to sort make
it<00:01:05.460> bigger<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:06.659> all<00:01:07.229> proportions<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:08.220> all

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
it bigger in all proportions like all

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.420 
it bigger in all proportions like all
exact<00:01:09.229> sort<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.470> don't<00:01:10.650> know<00:01:10.890> how<00:01:11.070> well

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
exact sort of like I don't know how well

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.399 
exact sort of like I don't know how well
you<00:01:11.490> know<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:12.030> don't<00:01:12.420> know<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:13.110> exactly

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
same doubt about it you want to click on

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.630 
same doubt about it you want to click on
it<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.979> want<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> come<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.549> the

it and you want to come to the
coordinates<00:01:18.240> tab<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.200> where<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.409> says<00:01:19.530> s

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
coordinates tab and where it says s

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.350 
coordinates tab and where it says s
that's<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:20.759> size<00:01:20.970> position<00:01:21.750> size<00:01:22.200> rotation

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
that's for size position size rotation

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.090 
that's for size position size rotation
you<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.479> want<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.659> hit<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> size<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.530> XY

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you just want to hit the size up on XY

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.890 
you just want to hit the size up on XY
and<00:01:26.369> z<00:01:26.729> axis<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.570> Z<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.430> want<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.640> do<00:01:29.900> twice

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
and z axis or Z so if I want to do twice

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.700 
and z axis or Z so if I want to do twice
the<00:01:31.079> size<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.890> would<00:01:32.009> double<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the size you would double it and you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.249 
the size you would double it and you
just<00:01:34.770> click<00:01:35.130> enter<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.729> then<00:01:36.720> that's<00:01:36.960> double

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
just click enter and then that's double

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.899 
just click enter and then that's double
size<00:01:37.500> what<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.369> go<00:01:39.049> 1.5

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
size what you can do is you can go 1.5

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.389 
size what you can do is you can go 1.5
you<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.030> go<00:01:42.259> plug<00:01:43.259> my<00:01:45.439> one<00:01:46.439> point<00:01:46.680> five<00:01:47.040> five

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
you can go plug my one point five five

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.850 
you can go plug my one point five five
five<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> little<00:01:48.630> bit<00:01:48.720> bigger<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.229> just

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
five just a little bit bigger and just

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.920 
five just a little bit bigger and just
adjust<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.460> where<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.670> want<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.210> so

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
adjust it to where you want it to so

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.760 
adjust it to where you want it to so
that's<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.500> way<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:53.220> size<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.590> you

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
that's the way you can size it up so you

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.649 
that's the way you can size it up so you
may<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:55.979> may<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.369> help<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.000> group<00:01:57.420> it

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
may it may just help just to group it

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.060 
may it may just help just to group it
and<00:01:57.869> then<00:01:58.560> start<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.369> just<00:02:00.180> Nick<00:02:00.420> is

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
and then start the just Nick is

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.319 
and then start the just Nick is
obviously<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.899> bit<00:02:03.899> more<00:02:04.820> sort<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.880> organizing

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
obviously a bit more sort of organizing

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.710 
obviously a bit more sort of organizing
that's<00:02:06.869> what<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.049> usually<00:02:07.259> do<00:02:07.619> see<00:02:08.580> yes<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:09.030> do

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
that's what I usually do see yes I do

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.860 
that's what I usually do see yes I do
sighs<00:02:10.319> characters<00:02:11.099> up<00:02:11.250> properly

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
sighs characters up properly

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.619 
sighs characters up properly
and<00:02:12.049> keep<00:02:12.739> them<00:02:12.920> all<00:02:13.069> in<00:02:13.190> proportion<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.819> maybe

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
and keep them all in proportion so maybe

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.720 
and keep them all in proportion so maybe
it<00:02:14.780> helped<00:02:15.019> in<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:16.310> I'll<00:02:16.430> see<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.700> next

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
it helped in that and I'll see you next

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.540 
it helped in that and I'll see you next
video<00:02:17.030> peace
