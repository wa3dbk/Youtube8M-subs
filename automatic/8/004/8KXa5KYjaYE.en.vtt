to go back to last year's short program

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and I think it's probably the best

and I think it's probably the best
program<00:01:11.700> they've<00:01:12.060> ever<00:01:12.210> done<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.960> music<00:01:13.409> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
program they've ever done the music and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.399 
program they've ever done the music and
the<00:01:14.010> choreography<00:01:15.049> choreography<00:01:16.049> done<00:01:16.200> by

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the choreography choreography done by

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.600 
the choreography choreography done by
Lee<00:01:16.650> Anne<00:01:16.799> Miller

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:31.200 

that's<00:01:22.610> good<00:01:22.909> unison

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.810 

and<00:01:31.630> watch<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.110> height<00:01:32.380> on<00:01:32.650> this<00:01:32.980> split

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
and watch the height on this split

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.320 
and watch the height on this split
double<00:01:34.300> twist<00:01:34.660> so<00:01:34.990> that's<00:01:35.260> a<00:01:35.410> beauty<00:01:36.330> that's

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
double twist so that's a beauty that's

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.800 
double twist so that's a beauty that's
the<00:01:37.540> best<00:01:37.780> in<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.080> business

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.630 

I<00:01:45.080> think<00:01:46.080> this<00:01:46.229> choice<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.799> music<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
I think this choice of music and the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.980 
I think this choice of music and the
choreography<00:01:48.110> really<00:01:49.110> suits<00:01:49.470> them<00:01:49.740> very<00:01:50.070> well

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
choreography really suits them very well

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.990 
choreography really suits them very well
and<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.290> pounding<00:01:53.009> drumbeat<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.790> think

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and all this pounding drumbeat I think

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.050 
and all this pounding drumbeat I think
emphasizes<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.900> power<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:56.009> has<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.759> team

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
emphasizes the power that has this team

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:06.359 
emphasizes the power that has this team
has<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.690> their<00:01:57.900> skating

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
for the disappointing season injury and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.229 
for the disappointing season injury and
illness<00:02:23.989> Jason<00:02:24.650> dislocated<00:02:25.580> his<00:02:25.700> thumb<00:02:26.060> in

illness Jason dislocated his thumb in
their<00:02:26.360> first<00:02:26.629> competition<00:02:27.050> then<00:02:27.560> had<00:02:27.800> food

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
their first competition then had food

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.869 
their first competition then had food
poisoning<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.390> second<00:02:29.810> one<00:02:30.610> well<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:31.730> is

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
poisoning in the second one well this is

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.270 
poisoning in the second one well this is
an<00:02:32.000> infinitely<00:02:32.450> better<00:02:32.780> program<00:02:33.379> and<00:02:33.680> better

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
an infinitely better program and better

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.100 
an infinitely better program and better
performance<00:02:34.550> than<00:02:35.000> they've<00:02:35.269> had<00:02:35.300> in<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.930> long

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
performance than they've had in a long

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.550 
performance than they've had in a long
time<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:39.730> guess<00:02:40.730> when<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.269> find<00:02:41.780> skaters<00:02:42.530> that

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
time I guess when you find skaters that

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.250 
time I guess when you find skaters that
are<00:02:42.920> very<00:02:43.190> talented<00:02:43.519> you<00:02:44.209> demand<00:02:44.690> more<00:02:44.870> of

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
are very talented you demand more of

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.440 
are very talented you demand more of
them<00:02:45.470> than<00:02:45.799> you<00:02:46.010> do<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.190> lesser<00:02:46.700> skaters<00:02:47.060> who

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
them than you do of lesser skaters who

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.880 
them than you do of lesser skaters who
don't<00:02:47.750> have<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.140> physical<00:02:48.560> talent<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:54.590> there

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
don't have the physical talent and there

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.130 
don't have the physical talent and there
again<00:02:55.160> is<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.519> toe<00:02:56.000> pointing<00:02:56.750> straight<00:02:57.019> up

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
again is that toe pointing straight up

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.170 
again is that toe pointing straight up
if<00:02:57.410> she<00:02:57.590> would<00:02:57.739> just<00:02:58.069> turn<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.549> over<00:02:58.730> what

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
if she would just turn it over what

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.800 
if she would just turn it over what
looks<00:02:59.480> like<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.410> nice<00:03:00.829> long<00:03:01.220> line<00:03:04.480> now<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.660> is

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
looks like a nice long line now this is

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.670 
looks like a nice long line now this is
the<00:03:05.959> hand<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.709> hand<00:03:06.739> loop<00:03:07.489> lift<00:03:07.819> next

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.100 

the<00:03:11.680> man<00:03:12.239> must<00:03:13.239> pick<00:03:13.629> her<00:03:13.840> up

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.710 

a<00:03:16.170> hand-to-hand<00:03:16.920> position<00:03:17.670> which<00:03:18.240> then<00:03:18.510> in

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
a hand-to-hand position which then in

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.470 
a hand-to-hand position which then in
this<00:03:18.930> case<00:03:19.170> turns<00:03:20.010> into<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.370> turning<00:03:20.910> lift<00:03:21.180> and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
this case turns into a turning lift and

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.110 
this case turns into a turning lift and
the<00:03:21.900> flip<00:03:22.140> over<00:03:22.320> back<00:03:22.650> down<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.220> out<00:03:23.370> very

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
the flip over back down and out very

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:39.330 
the flip over back down and out very
difficult<00:03:24.810> very<00:03:25.170> nice

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.839 

a<00:03:39.780> very<00:03:40.780> unusual<00:03:41.410> ending<00:03:41.680> yes<00:03:42.220> nice<00:03:42.459> that<00:03:42.730> it

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:19.810 
this program had a lot of life and I
think<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.090> audience<00:04:10.239> was<00:04:10.750> really<00:04:10.780> into<00:04:11.410> it

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.760 

that's<00:04:20.360> a<00:04:20.480> smile<00:04:20.750> we<00:04:20.990> haven't<00:04:21.320> seen<00:04:21.530> this

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
that's a smile we haven't seen this

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.670 
that's a smile we haven't seen this
season<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:22.310> far<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:22.850> this<00:04:23.660> is<00:04:23.840> a<00:04:23.870> look<00:04:24.230> at<00:04:24.470> the

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
season so far and this is a look at the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.500 
season so far and this is a look at the
height<00:04:25.040> that<00:04:25.280> she<00:04:25.520> gets<00:04:25.760> in<00:04:25.940> this<00:04:26.120> split

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
height that she gets in this split

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.730 
height that she gets in this split
double<00:04:27.140> twist<00:04:28.120> wow<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:30.020> is<00:04:30.140> just<00:04:30.620> spectacular

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
double twist wow it is just spectacular

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.110 
double twist wow it is just spectacular
and<00:04:34.360> now<00:04:35.360> watch<00:04:35.750> this<00:04:36.110> death<00:04:36.350> spiral<00:04:36.940> this<00:04:37.940> is

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
and now watch this death spiral this is

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.180 
and now watch this death spiral this is
a<00:04:38.150> very<00:04:38.540> good<00:04:38.840> death<00:04:39.170> spiral<00:04:39.620> but<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:39.890> would<00:04:40.070> be

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
a very good death spiral but it would be

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.280 
a very good death spiral but it would be
even<00:04:40.610> better<00:04:40.640> if<00:04:41.000> she<00:04:41.420> would<00:04:41.600> turn<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:42.080> toe

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
even better if she would turn the toe

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.100 
even better if she would turn the toe
out<00:04:42.320> it<00:04:42.800> would<00:04:42.950> look<00:04:43.190> like<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:43.850> longer<00:04:44.270> line<00:04:44.690> see

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
out it would look like a longer line see

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.200 
out it would look like a longer line see
how<00:04:45.260> it's<00:04:45.440> it's<00:04:45.740> pointed<00:04:46.280> up<00:04:46.460> to<00:04:46.670> the<00:04:46.700> ceiling

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
how it's it's pointed up to the ceiling

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.180 
how it's it's pointed up to the ceiling
see<00:04:47.720> that<00:04:47.900> so<00:04:48.050> that<00:04:48.230> would<00:04:48.380> improve<00:04:48.680> this<00:04:48.890> move

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
see that so that would improve this move

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.980 
see that so that would improve this move
I<00:04:49.460> mean<00:04:49.730> that's<00:04:50.150> a<00:04:50.270> move<00:04:50.480> that<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.780> proto

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
I mean that's a move that the proto

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.960 
I mean that's a move that the proto
popo's<00:04:51.380> would<00:04:51.620> never<00:04:51.860> have<00:04:52.100> permitted<00:04:52.280> that

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
popo's would never have permitted that

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.820 
popo's would never have permitted that
kind<00:04:53.300> of<00:04:53.390> position<00:04:55.360> there<00:04:56.360> coach<00:04:56.830> Peter

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
kind of position there coach Peter

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.730 
kind of position there coach Peter
burrows<00:04:58.220> and<00:04:59.080> should<00:05:00.080> they<00:05:00.230> move<00:05:00.380> on<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.560> the
