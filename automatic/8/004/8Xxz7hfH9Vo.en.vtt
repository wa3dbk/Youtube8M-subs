 good day and welcome these are 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.330
 the elite and creamy view of the journey 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.880
 and today is Tuesday 9th of June 2015 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.389
 day after the day after being 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.400
 overwhelmed by two hours of a keynote by 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.710
 an official opening presentation 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.960
 of the conference for developers of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.180
 san francisco and of which among others many 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.180
 sessions will also be broadcast 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.550
 in live streaming so if with data 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.340
 an opening to the interesting world 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.630
 yesterday a lot of news that has been 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.679
 given from the point of view of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.510
 developers 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.850
 the fact of the platform on 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.219
 experiments on east 2 and become open 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 source is practically the system with which 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.690
 you can write applications that 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.270
 are valid is at the same time for ios and 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.590
 then for or sx and it is no coincidence that yesterday 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.510
 have been presented 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.430
 while meanwhile the system 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.480
 Apple's new operating is the captain 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.760
 as a bit bizarre and the new system 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.390
 operating for mobile phones then ios 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.129
 9 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 in addition to war horse which is the new system 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.030
 operating for the pole watch and that from 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.680
 yesterday also opened for compilation 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.900
 preparation of native applications 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.049
 so that they turn right on their own 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.080
 on the phone without the clock on the jesus 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.930
 without having to know where to lean on 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.210
 phone here is the news of presented 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.250
 yesterday certainly do not bring anything 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.560
 revolutionary compared to what it is 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.700
 perhaps the most news was introduced 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.540
 important is the landing of pompeii in 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.920
 England the fact that in England 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.860
 make his debut with a number of 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.509
 locations enabled huge 250,000 e 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.220
 all of England with the system of 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.860
 London transport that will accept Apple 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.560
 for this I believe that it is absolutely 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.840
 amazing but the data I think is important 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.790
 of the day yesterday is that apple is in one 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.579
 phase in which it is consolidating is not 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.799
 its own offer and I believe that 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.780
 today we will hear users screaming 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.219
 microsoft that looks like windows from 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.750
 android users who copied the 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.479
 Android feature definitely has 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.119
 introduced few news but in my opinion 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.250
 however useful for 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.870
 better use of the equipment la 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.610
 split screen then multi view 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.260
 screen that is definitely not a novelty 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.360
 on ipad 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.769
 improves the user experience on ipad 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.170
 another feature in my opinion is a lot 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.659
 strong and also that of the keyboard 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.099
 that turns into a touchpad is that 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.470
 it really was the very functional 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.379
 finding first on ipad and it really is 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.329
 very much charge there is to say that the 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.920
 new version of ios software 9 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.930
 compared to past versions is 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.209
 much more stable and from July you can 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.220
 find it with the public beta to come 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.230
 open in July and you can 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.260
 find information on beta precisely 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.609
 at a point com or I would say that I'm up 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.540

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:51.859

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.829

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.810
