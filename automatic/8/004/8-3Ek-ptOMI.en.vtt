this<00:02:26.490> one<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:27.170> much<00:02:28.170> easier<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.650> opens<00:02:28.890> much

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
this one is much easier it opens much

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.950 
this one is much easier it opens much
more<00:02:29.340> widely<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> big<00:02:30.270> complaints<00:02:30.810> on

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
more widely one of the big complaints on

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.930 
more widely one of the big complaints on
the<00:02:31.350> Lenovo<00:02:31.800> bag<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.400> tough<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.850> get

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
the Lenovo bag is that it's tough to get

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.470 
the Lenovo bag is that it's tough to get
the<00:02:33.150> computer<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.140> out<00:02:35.120> because<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.330> only

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
the computer in and out because it only

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.540 
the computer in and out because it only
opens<00:02:36.600> on<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.080> end<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:38.040> have<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.280> slide

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
opens on the end and you have to slide

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.660 
opens on the end and you have to slide
the<00:02:38.730> computer<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:40.140> one<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:41.250> zippers<00:02:41.550> go

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the computer in this one the zippers go

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.000 
the computer in this one the zippers go
all<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.880> way<00:02:41.910> around<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:43.170> bag<00:02:43.350> flaps<00:02:43.770> all

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
all the way around and the bag flaps all

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.700 
all the way around and the bag flaps all
the<00:02:44.130> way<00:02:44.250> open<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.840> it's<00:02:45.990> much<00:02:46.110> easier<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.470> just

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
the way open so it's much easier to just

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.960 
the way open so it's much easier to just
set<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.950> computer<00:02:47.310> down<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.610> there<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.850> other

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
set the computer down in there the other

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.330 
set the computer down in there the other
nice<00:02:48.180> part<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:50.330> can<00:02:51.330> turn<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.630> around<00:02:51.690> and

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
nice part is I can turn this around and

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.610 
nice part is I can turn this around and
now<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.640> use<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.790> as<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> laptop<00:02:54.540> while<00:02:55.440> it's

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
now I can use it as a laptop while it's

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.900 
now I can use it as a laptop while it's
still<00:02:55.800> in<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.010> bag<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.400> can<00:02:56.520> see<00:02:56.670> there's<00:02:56.850> a

strap here strap here and then there's
another<00:02:59.190> one<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.400> goes<00:02:59.550> across<00:02:59.700> right<00:03:00.090> here

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
another one that goes across right here

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
another one that goes across right here
these<00:03:01.080> elastic<00:03:01.650> bands<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.420> hold<00:03:03.930> the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
these elastic bands that I hold the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.860 
these elastic bands that I hold the
tablet<00:03:04.530> into<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.340> back<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:06.330> that's<00:03:06.600> kind<00:03:06.810> of

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
tablet into the back so that's kind of
