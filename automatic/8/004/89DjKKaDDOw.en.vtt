first<00:00:07.520> you<00:00:07.670> turn<00:00:07.880> off<00:00:08.090> the<00:00:08.660> valve<00:00:08.840> here<00:00:09.350> I

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
first you turn off the valve here I

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.950 
first you turn off the valve here I
already<00:00:09.799> turned<00:00:09.980> it<00:00:10.190> so<00:00:10.309> you<00:00:10.400> turn<00:00:10.639> it

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
already turned it so you turn it

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.029 
already turned it so you turn it
perpendicular<00:00:11.960> to<00:00:12.350> the<00:00:12.770> to<00:00:13.670> the<00:00:13.789> line<00:00:15.039> that's

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
perpendicular to the to the line that's

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.200 
perpendicular to the to the line that's
step<00:00:16.309> one<00:00:16.550> step<00:00:17.480> two<00:00:17.539> is<00:00:18.080> turning<00:00:18.830> off<00:00:19.210> the

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
step one step two is turning off the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.600 
step one step two is turning off the
valve<00:00:20.540> to<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.650> tank

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.750 

okay<00:00:25.810> this<00:00:26.810> here's<00:00:27.080> your<00:00:27.260> filter<00:00:27.590> wrench<00:00:27.830> that

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
okay this here's your filter wrench that

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:37.020 
okay this here's your filter wrench that
goes<00:00:28.940> around<00:00:29.150> all<00:00:29.690> of<00:00:29.900> these<00:00:30.430> to<00:00:31.430> open<00:00:31.940> them

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.760 

your<00:00:38.030> unit<00:00:38.450> lifts<00:00:39.050> off<00:00:39.200> of<00:00:39.380> the<00:00:39.500> screws

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
your unit lifts off of the screws

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.979 
your unit lifts off of the screws
there's<00:00:40.280> little<00:00:40.520> holes<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:41.060> it<00:00:41.180> lifts<00:00:41.420> up<00:00:41.570> and

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
there's little holes and it lifts up and

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.450 
there's little holes and it lifts up and
you<00:00:42.140> can<00:00:42.290> lift<00:00:42.440> it<00:00:42.590> out<00:00:42.739> which<00:00:43.040> makes<00:00:43.280> it

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
you can lift it out which makes it

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.030 
you can lift it out which makes it
easier<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:43.850> get<00:00:44.090> to<00:00:44.120> everything<00:00:44.800> and<00:00:45.800> by<00:00:45.980> the

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
easier to get to everything and by the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.180 
easier to get to everything and by the
way<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.760> order<00:00:47.060> they<00:00:47.180> have<00:00:47.480> on<00:00:47.960> here<00:00:48.590> you<00:00:49.040> need

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
way the order they have on here you need

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.450 
way the order they have on here you need
to<00:00:49.309> do<00:00:49.430> something<00:00:49.640> different<00:00:50.149> you<00:00:50.329> need<00:00:51.110> to

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
to do something different you need to

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.299 
to do something different you need to
leave<00:00:52.460> this<00:00:52.730> open<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:53.809> do<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.500> spigot<00:00:54.890> first

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
leave this open and do the spigot first

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.760 
leave this open and do the spigot first
let<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.360> drain<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:56.989> get<00:00:57.110> all<00:00:57.200> the<00:00:57.290> pressure<00:00:57.500> out

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
let it drain to get all the pressure out

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.610 
let it drain to get all the pressure out
so<00:00:58.130> you<00:00:58.190> it's<00:00:58.460> easy<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:59.149> get<00:00:59.300> these<00:00:59.450> off<00:00:59.719> once

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
so you it's easy to get these off once

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.229 
so you it's easy to get these off once
it<00:01:00.800> drips<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:01.340> it's<00:01:01.820> empty

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
it drips and it's empty

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.929 
it drips and it's empty
then<00:01:02.600> you<00:01:02.780> close<00:01:03.140> this<00:01:03.770> by<00:01:04.100> turning<00:01:04.159> it<00:01:04.640> again

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
then you close this by turning it again

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.399 
then you close this by turning it again
perpendicular<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.759> hose<00:01:08.109> and<00:01:09.109> make

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
perpendicular to to the hose and make

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.929 
perpendicular to to the hose and make
sure<00:01:09.530> you<00:01:09.619> have<00:01:09.740> a<00:01:09.829> towel<00:01:10.280> because<00:01:10.670> I'm

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
sure you have a towel because I'm

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:21.060 
sure you have a towel because I'm
getting<00:01:11.149> water<00:01:11.299> already

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.040 

so<00:01:22.070> we<00:01:22.190> dumped<00:01:22.460> everything<00:01:23.030> out<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.360> this<00:01:23.750> and

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
so we dumped everything out of this and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.190 
so we dumped everything out of this and
this<00:01:24.290> is<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.620> new<00:01:24.740> clean<00:01:25.130> pre-filter<00:01:26.200> there's

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
this is the new clean pre-filter there's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.130 
this is the new clean pre-filter there's
a<00:01:27.290> little<00:01:27.650> place<00:01:28.580> here<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.600> sit<00:01:29.930> make

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
a little place here that you sit make

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.760 
a little place here that you sit make
sure<00:01:30.290> this<00:01:30.440> around<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.820> post<00:01:32.410> put<00:01:33.410> this<00:01:33.530> on

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
sure this around the post put this on

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.140 
sure this around the post put this on
and<00:01:34.160> do<00:01:34.670> an<00:01:34.910> initial<00:01:35.090> hand<00:01:35.570> tighten<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:37.150> then

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
and do an initial hand tighten and then

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.630 
and do an initial hand tighten and then
once<00:01:38.690> you<00:01:38.870> get<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.170> pretty<00:01:39.530> tight<00:01:39.860> you<00:01:40.220> can<00:01:40.490> use

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
once you get it pretty tight you can use

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.750 
once you get it pretty tight you can use
your<00:01:40.790> wrench<00:01:41.000> again<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:43.070> go<00:01:43.220> up<00:01:43.280> on<00:01:43.430> it<00:01:43.580> and

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
your wrench again to go up on it and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.430 
your wrench again to go up on it and
going<00:01:44.000> in<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.300> direction<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:44.840> says<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.170> close

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
going in the direction it says to close

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.000 
going in the direction it says to close
left<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.280> right<00:01:46.840> put<00:01:47.840> on<00:01:47.870> that<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:48.440> then<00:01:48.590> make

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
left to right put on that and then make

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.070 
left to right put on that and then make
it<00:01:49.040> snug<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:50.060> not<00:01:50.090> too<00:01:50.390> tight<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:50.870> can<00:01:50.960> get

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
it snug but not too tight so you can get

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.530 
it snug but not too tight so you can get
it<00:01:51.140> back<00:01:51.229> off<00:01:54.460> so<00:01:55.490> all<00:01:55.940> right<00:01:56.060> I'm<00:01:56.150> loosing

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
it back off so all right I'm loosing

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.510 
it back off so all right I'm loosing
this<00:01:56.660> one<00:01:56.900> again<00:01:57.229> be<00:01:57.380> prepared<00:01:57.800> for<00:01:58.040> water<00:01:58.250> to

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
this one again be prepared for water to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.270 
this one again be prepared for water to
come<00:01:58.700> out<00:01:58.729> this<00:01:59.509> is<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.960> middle<00:02:00.650> one<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:01.009> pre

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
come out this is the middle one the pre

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.820 
come out this is the middle one the pre
carbon<00:02:01.759> filter<00:02:04.690> so<00:02:05.690> there<00:02:06.530> we<00:02:06.710> go<00:02:08.290> so<00:02:09.290> we've

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
carbon filter so there we go so we've

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.130 
carbon filter so there we go so we've
dumped<00:02:10.520> all<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:11.060> dirty<00:02:11.239> water<00:02:11.420> out<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.810> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
dumped all the dirty water out of the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.460 
dumped all the dirty water out of the
pre<00:02:12.440> carbon<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.100> we've<00:02:13.850> taken<00:02:14.060> one<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:15.110> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
pre carbon and we've taken one of the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.970 
pre carbon and we've taken one of the
activated<00:02:16.040> carbon<00:02:16.760> blocks<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.800> we're

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
activated carbon blocks and we're

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.040 
activated carbon blocks and we're
putting<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:20.360> have<00:02:20.510> two<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.989> are

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
putting it in you have two that are

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.970 
putting it in you have two that are
exactly<00:02:21.440> alike<00:02:21.830> it's<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.430> two-stage<00:02:22.970> system

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
exactly alike it's a two-stage system

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.759 
exactly alike it's a two-stage system
and<00:02:24.980> then<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:26.260> again<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.440> feels<00:02:27.590> like

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
and then this again it feels like

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.770 
and then this again it feels like
there's<00:02:28.040> another<00:02:28.310> little<00:02:28.550> another<00:02:29.540> little

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
there's another little another little

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.070 
there's another little another little
pipe<00:02:29.989> piece<00:02:30.530> up<00:02:31.489> under<00:02:31.820> here<00:02:32.180> then<00:02:32.989> we're

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
pipe piece up under here then we're

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.300 
pipe piece up under here then we're
going<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.230> make<00:02:33.380> sure<00:02:33.590> it's<00:02:33.709> fitted<00:02:33.980> on<00:02:34.100> make

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
going to make sure it's fitted on make

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.030 
going to make sure it's fitted on make
sure<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.610> whips<00:02:34.790> okay<00:02:35.420> make<00:02:36.320> sure<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:36.620> your

pull<00:03:44.610> out<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.790> tubing<00:03:45.300> yes<00:03:45.830> no<00:03:46.830> that<00:03:47.010> would<00:03:47.130> be

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
pull out the tubing yes no that would be

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.310 
pull out the tubing yes no that would be
this<00:03:47.460> it<00:03:47.790> comes<00:03:48.000> out<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.210> little<00:03:48.420> holder<00:03:48.870> okay

both ends
ah<00:04:15.080> I<00:04:16.080> think<00:04:16.230> so<00:04:16.590> cuz<00:04:16.770> I'm<00:04:16.890> trying<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.130> pull<00:04:17.280> the

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370

other one out it didn't come okay I

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.440 
other one out it didn't come okay I
think<00:04:19.200> would<00:04:19.410> be<00:04:19.530> funny<00:04:19.770> for<00:04:19.860> it<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.130> be<00:04:20.280> um<00:04:20.549> one

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
think would be funny for it to be um one

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.340 
think would be funny for it to be um one
way<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:21.810> not<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.989> other

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
way and not the other

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.680 
way and not the other
yeah<00:04:23.250> that's<00:04:23.490> okay<00:04:23.730> you<00:04:23.970> guys<00:04:24.060> threw<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.510> off

do<00:04:30.580> this<00:04:30.759> one<00:04:30.970> first<00:04:31.500> then<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:33.039> get<00:04:33.460> it<00:04:33.580> to

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
do this one first then to get it to

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.939 
do this one first then to get it to
thread<00:04:34.389> properly<00:04:34.960> so<00:04:35.139> this<00:04:35.259> doesn't<00:04:35.470> unthread

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
thread properly so this doesn't unthread

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.860 
thread properly so this doesn't unthread
take<00:04:36.849> this<00:04:37.150> cable<00:04:37.750> twist<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.919> that<00:04:39.879> way<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.419> way

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
take this cable twist it that way a way

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.529 
take this cable twist it that way a way
I<00:04:41.289> guess<00:04:41.770> from<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:42.159> cabinets<00:04:42.639> several<00:04:43.300> times

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
I guess from the cabinets several times

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.420 
I guess from the cabinets several times
and<00:04:43.990> then<00:04:44.530> when<00:04:44.680> you're<00:04:44.830> putting<00:04:44.979> it<00:04:45.099> on<00:04:45.190> here

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
and then when you're putting it on here

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.149 
and then when you're putting it on here
it<00:04:45.639> will<00:04:45.669> sort<00:04:46.090> of<00:04:46.210> uncurl<00:04:46.870> itself<00:04:47.409> because
