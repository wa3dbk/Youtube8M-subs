00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
smooth and silky the hair was like it

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.440 
smooth and silky the hair was like it
was<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.559> smooth<00:00:44.040> fingers<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.120> run

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
was just so smooth fingers just run

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.630 
was just so smooth fingers just run
right<00:00:45.690> through<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.590> has<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.980> lot<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.250> body

right through it it has a lot of body

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.529 
right through it it has a lot of body
and<00:00:47.789> wait<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:49.399> thought<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.910> would<00:00:51.120> not<00:00:51.180> be

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
and wait I thought that it would not be

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.299 
and wait I thought that it would not be
enough<00:00:51.960> hair<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.620> thought<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.100> hair

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
enough hair because I thought the hair

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.569 
enough hair because I thought the hair
would<00:00:53.550> thin<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.199> more<00:00:56.100> than<00:00:56.160> enough

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
would thin but this is more than enough

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.880 
would thin but this is more than enough
hair<00:00:56.910> actually<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.780> didn't<00:00:58.170> even<00:00:58.350> use<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.590> I

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
hair actually I didn't even use it I

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.400 
hair actually I didn't even use it I
actually<00:00:59.100> only<00:00:59.579> use<00:00:59.969> one<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> half<00:01:00.780> bundles

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
actually only use one and a half bundles

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.789 
actually only use one and a half bundles
I<00:01:01.500> still<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.280> one<00:01:02.809> full<00:01:03.809> bundle<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
I still have one full bundle here and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.000

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
oh that's basically all I did and I am

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.100 
oh that's basically all I did and I am
impressed<00:01:47.159> because<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.570> my<00:01:48.689> first<00:01:48.720> time

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
impressed because this is my first time

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.710 
impressed because this is my first time
making<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.590> straight<00:01:50.009> unit<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.479> did

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
making a straight unit and I think I did

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.249 
making a straight unit and I think I did
a<00:01:51.899> fairly<00:01:52.710> good<00:01:53.040> job<00:01:53.070> only<00:01:54.030> thing<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.869> i<00:01:55.079> think

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
a fairly good job only thing is i think

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.740 
a fairly good job only thing is i think
i<00:01:55.350> should<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.590> measured<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.750> circumference

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
i should have measured the circumference

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.270 
i should have measured the circumference
