00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
pretty nice and chanted book so if you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.789 
pretty nice and chanted book so if you

another<00:01:38.100> reason<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.630> seems

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
another reason to do that and it seems

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.719 
another reason to do that and it seems
like<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> range<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.070> pretty<00:01:41.430> far

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
like the range for this is pretty far

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.670 
like the range for this is pretty far
like<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> real<00:01:42.299> dog<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.990> bloodhound<00:01:43.500> or

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
like a real dog like a bloodhound or

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.770 
like a real dog like a bloodhound or
something<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.130> can<00:01:44.340> hunt<00:01:44.939> skeletons<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
something they can hunt skeletons and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.600 
something they can hunt skeletons and
sniff<00:01:46.170> them<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.560> from<00:01:46.799> very<00:01:47.009> far<00:01:47.189> away<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.399> you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
sniff them out from very far away so you

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.310 
sniff them out from very far away so you
could<00:01:47.820> be<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> surface<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:49.140> can

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
could be on the surface and they can

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.530 
could be on the surface and they can
kind<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.590> see<00:01:49.829> one<00:01:50.040> down<00:01:50.310> below<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.360> not

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
kind of see one down below if it's not

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.840 
kind of see one down below if it's not
too<00:01:51.780> far<00:01:51.990> away<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.710> pretty<00:01:52.920> cool<00:01:53.189> hey<00:01:53.579> little
