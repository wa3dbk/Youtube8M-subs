assess the tolerance I have a low

tolerance so to me I think that might be

what's<00:02:09.560> due

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
both very good as for a super pump oh

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.670 
both very good as for a super pump oh

the<00:02:35.510> levels<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.840> caffeine<00:02:36.250> my<00:02:37.250> recommendation

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
the levels of caffeine my recommendation

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.600 
the levels of caffeine my recommendation
is<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.180> can<00:02:38.450> handle<00:02:38.780> caffeine<00:02:39.530> in<00:02:39.740> any

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
is that you can handle caffeine in any

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.670 
is that you can handle caffeine in any
supplement<00:02:41.060> or<00:02:41.210> handle<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:41.780> general<00:02:42.170> go

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
supplement or handle it in general go

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.130 
supplement or handle it in general go
for<00:02:42.920> or<00:02:43.070> take<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.370> if<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:43.910> can<00:02:44.140> tolerate

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
for or take it if you can tolerate

for or take it if you can tolerate
caffeine<00:02:45.710> do<00:02:45.860> what<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.160> instructions<00:02:46.700> say

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
caffeine do what the instructions say

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.130 
caffeine do what the instructions say
which<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.210> assess<00:02:47.450> their<00:02:47.600> tolerance<00:02:47.960> the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
which is to assess their tolerance the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.190 
which is to assess their tolerance the
lower<00:02:48.260> dose<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.800> succeed<00:02:49.640> from<00:02:49.760> there

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
lower dose and succeed from there

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.270 
lower dose and succeed from there
personally<00:02:51.200> it's<00:02:51.380> been<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.560> few<00:02:51.710> of<00:02:51.860> me<00:02:52.040> not

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
personally it's been a few of me not

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.950 
personally it's been a few of me not
being<00:02:52.460> able<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.850> really<00:02:53.060> deal<00:02:53.360> with<00:02:53.390> the

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
being able to really deal with the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.660 
being able to really deal with the
caffeine<00:02:54.320> or<00:02:54.410> any<00:02:54.560> side<00:02:54.770> effects<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.250> think<00:02:55.580> it

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
caffeine or any side effects I think it

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.070 
caffeine or any side effects I think it
does<00:02:55.850> work<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.210> think<00:02:56.360> it's<00:02:56.480> effective<00:02:56.840> at<00:02:56.960> what

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
does work I think it's effective at what

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.290 
does work I think it's effective at what
it<00:02:57.200> does<00:02:57.380> if<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.370> didn't<00:02:58.700> have<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:58.940> caffeine

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
it does if I didn't have the caffeine

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.070 
it does if I didn't have the caffeine
base<00:02:59.420> side<00:02:59.660> effects

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
base side effects

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.080 
base side effects
I<00:03:00.170> probably<00:03:00.560> recommend<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.190> for<00:03:01.340> people<00:03:01.820> who

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
I probably recommend it for people who

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.810 
I probably recommend it for people who
have<00:03:02.660> low<00:03:03.650> tolerance<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.250> caffeine<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.670> would

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
have low tolerance to caffeine I would

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.000 
have low tolerance to caffeine I would
say<00:03:04.940> don't<00:03:05.540> go<00:03:05.780> for<00:03:05.990> it<00:03:06.020> I<00:03:06.200> totally<00:03:06.860> do

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
say don't go for it I totally do

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.250 
say don't go for it I totally do
recommend<00:03:07.280> any<00:03:07.520> size<00:03:07.730> on<00:03:07.940> great<00:03:08.660> product<00:03:09.110> and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
recommend any size on great product and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.720 
recommend any size on great product and
I<00:03:09.380> also<00:03:09.620> think<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.040> can<00:03:10.130> be<00:03:10.190> taken<00:03:10.340> by

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
I also think that it can be taken by

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.360 
I also think that it can be taken by
itself<00:03:11.060> without<00:03:11.870> as<00:03:12.470> they<00:03:12.680> use<00:03:12.830> for<00:03:13.070> animal

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
itself without as they use for animal

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.470 
itself without as they use for animal
supplement<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:13.850> think<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.180> have<00:03:14.360> even

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
supplement I think that I have even

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.690 
supplement I think that I have even
better<00:03:14.750> pumps<00:03:15.140> when<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.320> look<00:03:15.980> size<00:03:16.190> them<00:03:16.400> this

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
better pumps when I look size them this

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.370 
better pumps when I look size them this
week<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.300> two<00:03:17.450> times<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:17.810> tried<00:03:18.050> it

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
week the two times that I tried it

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.830 
week the two times that I tried it
so<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:19.550> summarize<00:03:19.940> I'm<00:03:20.270> going<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.540> say<00:03:20.630> that<00:03:20.810> I

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
so to summarize I'm going to say that I

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.120 
so to summarize I'm going to say that I
think<00:03:20.989> that<00:03:21.320> through<00:03:21.530> pump<00:03:21.800> is<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.980> good

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
think that through pump is a good

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.090 
think that through pump is a good
product<00:03:22.370> has<00:03:23.000> some<00:03:23.239> side<00:03:23.450> effects<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:23.959> just

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
product has some side effects and just

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.530 
product has some side effects and just
produce<00:03:25.100> good<00:03:25.370> pumps<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:25.880> good<00:03:26.209> energy<00:03:26.330> and

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
produce good pumps and good energy and

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.500

good<00:03:26.750> focus<00:03:27.110> however<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:28.190> do<00:03:28.340> feel<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.820> size

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
good focus however I do feel that size

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.199 
good focus however I do feel that size
on<00:03:29.720> does<00:03:29.900> all<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:30.680> stuff<00:03:30.860> without<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.880> side

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
on does all that stuff without the side

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.729 
on does all that stuff without the side
effects<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:32.900> would<00:03:33.080> even<00:03:33.200> say<00:03:33.470> that<00:03:33.650> it

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
effects and I would even say that it

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.760 
effects and I would even say that it
comes<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.880> just<00:03:35.750> an<00:03:35.930> overall<00:03:36.050> better<00:03:36.410> result

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
comes and just an overall better result

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.330
