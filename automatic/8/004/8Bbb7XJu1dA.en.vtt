00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
going to go for a bunch other with

going to go for a bunch other with
everything<00:00:21.340> they<00:00:21.820> had<00:00:21.970> I<00:00:22.240> think<00:00:22.990> games<00:00:23.650> are

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
everything they had I think games are

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.859 
everything they had I think games are
won<00:00:23.949> and<00:00:23.980> lost<00:00:24.130> in<00:00:24.429> such<00:00:24.670> finite<00:00:25.150> names<00:00:25.449> and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
won and lost in such finite names and

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.560 
won and lost in such finite names and
it's<00:00:26.289> the<00:00:27.009> smallest<00:00:27.400> of<00:00:27.669> details<00:00:27.849> I<00:00:28.300> think<00:00:28.509> you

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
it's the smallest of details I think you

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.480 
it's the smallest of details I think you
see<00:00:28.779> in<00:00:28.929> all<00:00:29.050> our<00:00:29.230> games<00:00:29.410> are<00:00:29.679> penalty<00:00:30.099> corners

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
see in all our games are penalty corners

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.190 
see in all our games are penalty corners
have<00:00:30.609> been<00:00:30.640> really<00:00:31.509> important<00:00:32.050> and

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
have been really important and

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.750 
have been really important and
potentially<00:00:32.289> an<00:00:32.829> outer<00:00:33.010> tuning<00:00:33.460> game<00:00:33.640> we

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
potentially an outer tuning game we

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.729 
potentially an outer tuning game we
could<00:00:33.910> have<00:00:34.030> maybe<00:00:34.210> one<00:00:34.480> more<00:00:34.690> corners<00:00:35.170> that

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
could have maybe one more corners that

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.310 
could have maybe one more corners that
made<00:00:35.950> a<00:00:35.980> mid<00:00:36.340> different<00:00:36.760> result<00:00:37.059> but<00:00:37.320> you

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
made a mid different result but you

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.020 
made a mid different result but you
can't<00:00:38.620> thought<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.070> girls<00:00:39.250> foot<00:00:39.579> for

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
can't thought the girls foot for

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.569 
can't thought the girls foot for
everything<00:00:40.600> that<00:00:40.809> effort<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.289> the<00:00:41.579> tactical

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
everything that effort and the tactical

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.160 
everything that effort and the tactical
approach<00:00:42.879> out<00:00:43.180> as<00:00:43.390> we<00:00:43.539> did<00:00:43.690> it<00:00:43.780> to<00:00:43.899> the<00:00:44.020> letter

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
approach out as we did it to the letter

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.200 
approach out as we did it to the letter
and<00:00:44.590> play<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.039> right<00:00:45.190> game<00:00:45.430> it<00:00:45.760> just<00:00:45.789> wants<00:00:46.120> to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
and play the right game it just wants to

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.119 
and play the right game it just wants to
come<00:00:46.359> out<00:00:46.449> to<00:00:46.660> me<00:00:46.750> it's<00:00:47.170> like<00:00:47.289> a<00:00:47.410> cauldron<00:00:48.039> of

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
come out to me it's like a cauldron of

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.580 
come out to me it's like a cauldron of
noise<00:00:48.340> and<00:00:48.640> it<00:00:49.090> was<00:00:49.239> just<00:00:49.539> the<00:00:49.870> most<00:00:50.320> amazing

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
noise and it was just the most amazing

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.439 
noise and it was just the most amazing
atmosphere<00:00:51.039> was<00:00:51.579> I<00:00:51.699> mean<00:00:52.000> I<00:00:52.030> don't<00:00:52.269> know<00:00:52.359> what

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
atmosphere was I mean I don't know what

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.479 
atmosphere was I mean I don't know what
it's<00:00:52.570> like<00:00:52.600> to<00:00:52.840> be<00:00:53.019> you<00:00:53.109> know<00:00:53.289> a<00:00:53.559> rock<00:00:53.800> star<00:00:54.039> and

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
it's like to be you know a rock star and

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.400 
it's like to be you know a rock star and
sending<00:00:54.910> only<00:00:55.000> know<00:00:55.239> a<00:00:55.269> stage<00:00:55.660> at<00:00:55.989> glastonbury

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
sending only know a stage at glastonbury

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.080 
sending only know a stage at glastonbury
lever<00:00:56.590> but<00:00:57.190> am<00:00:57.340> I've<00:00:57.460> done<00:00:57.609> it's<00:00:57.730> like<00:00:57.879> that

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
lever but am I've done it's like that

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.330 
lever but am I've done it's like that
because<00:00:58.300> it<00:00:58.420> was<00:00:58.899> just<00:00:59.199> this<00:00:59.559> wall<00:00:59.890> of<00:01:00.100> sound

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
because it was just this wall of sound

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.189 
because it was just this wall of sound
and<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:01.239> just<00:01:01.390> lifted<00:01:01.719> you<00:01:01.870> and<00:01:02.019> gave<00:01:02.170> you

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
and it just lifted you and gave you

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.289 
and it just lifted you and gave you
energy<00:01:02.769> and<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:03.429> I<00:01:03.519> think<00:01:03.760> that<00:01:03.969> hopefully

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
energy and and I think that hopefully

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.050 
energy and and I think that hopefully
translated<00:01:05.199> on<00:01:05.470> TV<00:01:05.920> and<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.430> I<00:01:06.460> think<00:01:06.939> that's

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
translated on TV and and I think that's

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.429 
translated on TV and and I think that's
made<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.360> hockey<00:01:07.540> better<00:01:07.869> because<00:01:08.259> it's<00:01:08.380> just

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
made the hockey better because it's just

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.530 
made the hockey better because it's just
really<00:01:08.799> spurred<00:01:09.580> move<00:01:09.729> on<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:10.000> attack<00:01:10.270> more

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
really spurred move on to attack more

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
really spurred move on to attack more
there's<00:01:10.750> been<00:01:10.869> a<00:01:10.900> lot<00:01:11.049> of<00:01:11.080> goals<00:01:11.320> in<00:01:11.500> this

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
there's been a lot of goals in this

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.440 
there's been a lot of goals in this
ornament<00:01:11.979> I<00:01:12.189> think<00:01:12.820> which<00:01:12.909> has<00:01:13.030> made<00:01:13.150> it<00:01:13.299> more

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
ornament I think which has made it more

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.390 
ornament I think which has made it more
exciting<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.170> watchable<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:15.040> Saudi

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
exciting and watchable and Saudi

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.520 
exciting and watchable and Saudi
hopefully<00:01:15.880> lots<00:01:16.060> of<00:01:16.240> people<00:01:16.570> will<00:01:16.720> see<00:01:17.380> how

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
hopefully lots of people will see how

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.980 
hopefully lots of people will see how
the<00:01:17.590> games<00:01:17.829> moved<00:01:18.189> on<00:01:18.340> you<00:01:18.490> know<00:01:18.549> I<00:01:18.610> think<00:01:18.990> here

the games moved on you know I think here

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.569 
the games moved on you know I think here
and<00:01:20.110> there<00:01:20.290> is<00:01:20.409> still<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.799> old<00:01:20.890> looks<00:01:21.159> and<00:01:21.490> it

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
and there is still the old looks and it

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.100 
and there is still the old looks and it
said<00:01:21.790> Trinian's<00:01:22.180> kind<00:01:22.450> of<00:01:22.570> jolly<00:01:22.810> hockey

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
said Trinian's kind of jolly hockey

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.530 
said Trinian's kind of jolly hockey
sticks<00:01:23.350> kind<00:01:24.159> of<00:01:24.250> persona<00:01:25.000> about<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.390> game

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
sticks kind of persona about the game

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.300 
sticks kind of persona about the game
but<00:01:25.720> you<00:01:25.960> know<00:01:26.049> it's<00:01:26.170> changed<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.799> it's<00:01:27.159> a

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
but you know it's changed and it's a
