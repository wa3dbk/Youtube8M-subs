00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.460
 happened yesterday to you 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.460
 38 kilos 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.730
 that's why in these moments of life 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.730
 in the angelo list 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.230
 for years 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.340
 and the other part 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.680
 half 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.680
 now the most great year 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.920
 before I won 2016 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.650
 there are times I have to ask for the ticket 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.930
 totally 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.770
 what I get out of so many kilos to go 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.770
 until the sale 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.710
 the dutch 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.810
 it's quite scary to leave the client 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.100
 no more than 20 of the car I'm the story 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.000
 brought the crisis 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.000
 the enzymes 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.460
 to pass before 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.150
 what they did die four 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.099
 for the closed ball 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.159
 who we see harmed us 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.939
 the recuperators we others are 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.939
 counted 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.170
 Carlos Slim and why 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.920
 and then the things that because he does not have 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.780
 uniform 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.250
 he thanks me as much as I 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.630
 last ones want them 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.630
 notes rhythm and boats 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.060
 because it is divided by the government has 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.959
 the genes 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.959
 to work 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.110
 because the shoes 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:31.080
 is that our collaborators have been very helpful 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:34.280
 also others because they left us alone 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.280
 with the streets thrown away 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.299
 it may not seem like 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.340
 with the theater act where it ends 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.819
 our hands 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.510
 especially for the moves of strong 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.230
 and how is the bridge above the sky 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.230
 follow 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.680
 and the recyclable materials as 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:12.040
 are doing now with prices 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.040
 sorry but this same no 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.510
 and as it is normally 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.520
 when it was normal to not face it because 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.180
 We know the trust and I feel that 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.180
 they managed here 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.709
 this time the posts are paying 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:37.709
 other services 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:45.610
 and incoming time and but it is very difficult 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:48.610
 get to the collection then for what they are 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.610
 do not 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.810
 it's a slope and it's better for 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.680
 recuperators have more recycling or 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.680
 less recycling 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:14.210
 because it's a nice plus for bonus and 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:21.520
 call them and because you have a report and 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:21.520
 she does not have to 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.700
 and who knew 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:31.420
 the chancellors thank you until you forget 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.420
 the stockings 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.850
 telescope number 2 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.330
 number 2 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.880
 they hurt me personally in 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:58.730
 cannon export and overexertion 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.730
 and we would not have where to sell 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.090
 other business for the other intended by 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.470
 example other businesses that 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:10.310
 they would take advantage of us and pay us 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.310
 from the house 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:19.090
 the ministries are quite registered 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.090
 here in the center 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.540
 as for 66 that in several account 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.540
 buildings 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.510
 the hotels 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.380
 several buildings chamber of commerce 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.200
 apartment 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:39.720
 meters how many reservations is to collect 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:42.620
 daily and how rich about 120 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.620
 130 kilos 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:46.620
 they are the first ones that have 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:54.280
 trainings and the other things of the 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.280
 passing cooperatives that would kill 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:10.230
 I think it would not continue what it is 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.230
 so pretty
