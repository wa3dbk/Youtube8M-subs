00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.350 
sidewalls give you a nice traditional

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.140 
sidewalls give you a nice traditional
hole<00:00:17.590> in<00:00:17.710> the<00:00:17.800> hands<00:00:18.130> also<00:00:18.580> it<00:00:18.850> gives<00:00:18.940> you<00:00:19.120> a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
hole in the hands also it gives you a

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.510 
hole in the hands also it gives you a
good<00:00:19.330> lock<00:00:19.540> on<00:00:19.720> the<00:00:19.840> shaft<00:00:20.110> now<00:00:20.920> for<00:00:21.130> enhanced

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
good lock on the shaft now for enhanced

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.040 
good lock on the shaft now for enhanced
comfort<00:00:21.700> they<00:00:22.150> went<00:00:22.330> ahead<00:00:22.420> and<00:00:22.510> added<00:00:22.750> a

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
comfort they went ahead and added a

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.840 
comfort they went ahead and added a
raised<00:00:23.290> texture<00:00:23.800> on<00:00:23.980> the<00:00:24.130> edges<00:00:24.430> here<00:00:24.610> called

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
raised texture on the edges here called

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.370 
raised texture on the edges here called
the<00:00:24.970> cortex<00:00:25.390> crypt<00:00:25.720> as<00:00:25.960> far<00:00:26.170> as<00:00:26.290> the

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
the cortex crypt as far as the

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.440 
the cortex crypt as far as the
construction<00:00:26.800> goes<00:00:27.130> this<00:00:27.430> uses<00:00:27.820> their<00:00:27.970> true

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
construction goes this uses their true

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.810 
construction goes this uses their true
one-piece<00:00:28.960> technology<00:00:29.620> which<00:00:30.160> molds<00:00:30.640> the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
one-piece technology which molds the

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.000 
one-piece technology which molds the
shaft<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:31.360> the<00:00:31.600> blade<00:00:31.840> together<00:00:32.259> so<00:00:32.739> you're

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
shaft and the blade together so you're

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.829 
shaft and the blade together so you're
not<00:00:33.129> getting<00:00:33.370> a<00:00:33.670> fusion<00:00:34.210> point<00:00:34.390> at<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:34.690> bottom

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:34.839 
not getting a fusion point at the bottom

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:36.810 
not getting a fusion point at the bottom
and<00:00:35.140> that<00:00:35.199> in<00:00:35.769> turn<00:00:35.980> just<00:00:36.160> gives<00:00:36.399> you<00:00:36.489> a<00:00:36.519> really

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
and that in turn just gives you a really

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.329 
and that in turn just gives you a really
consistent<00:00:37.480> flex<00:00:37.960> profile<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.679> then<00:00:39.070> it<00:00:39.159> also

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
consistent flex profile and then it also

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.369 
consistent flex profile and then it also
gives<00:00:39.760> it<00:00:39.850> a<00:00:39.940> really<00:00:40.179> nice<00:00:40.420> balance<00:00:40.719> point<00:00:41.140> -

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
gives it a really nice balance point -

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.049 
gives it a really nice balance point -
another<00:00:42.039> great<00:00:42.249> thing<00:00:42.460> that<00:00:42.519> they<00:00:42.730> did<00:00:42.909> with

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
another great thing that they did with

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.910 
another great thing that they did with
the<00:00:43.120> construction<00:00:43.629> is<00:00:43.749> that<00:00:43.780> they<00:00:44.019> use<00:00:44.260> their

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
the construction is that they use their

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.099 
the construction is that they use their
corner<00:00:45.309> impact<00:00:45.789> technology<00:00:46.390> so<00:00:46.899> on<00:00:47.019> the

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
corner impact technology so on the

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.020 
corner impact technology so on the
inside<00:00:47.499> of<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.710> shaft<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.609> corners<00:00:48.909> have

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
inside of the shaft the corners have

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.759 
inside of the shaft the corners have
been<00:00:49.210> reinforced<00:00:49.899> so<00:00:50.199> you're<00:00:50.319> getting<00:00:50.559> twice

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
been reinforced so you're getting twice

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.979 
been reinforced so you're getting twice
the<00:00:51.010> impact<00:00:51.159> strength<00:00:51.670> without<00:00:52.329> adding<00:00:52.839> any

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
the impact strength without adding any

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.169 
the impact strength without adding any
additional<00:00:53.530> weight<00:00:53.739> far<00:00:54.640> as<00:00:54.699> the<00:00:54.760> materials

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
additional weight far as the materials

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.869 
additional weight far as the materials

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
pop out of that too now getting into the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.069 
pop out of that too now getting into the
Flex<00:01:12.549> profile<00:01:12.969> this<00:01:13.390> is<00:01:13.479> gonna<00:01:13.570> have<00:01:13.750> a<00:01:13.780> really

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 
Flex profile this is gonna have a really

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.990 
Flex profile this is gonna have a really
low<00:01:14.380> kick<00:01:14.649> point<00:01:14.860> because<00:01:15.340> of<00:01:15.460> their<00:01:15.579> dagger

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
low kick point because of their dagger

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.660 
low kick point because of their dagger
t2<00:01:16.479> technology<00:01:17.170> now<00:01:17.920> what<00:01:18.100> this<00:01:18.219> does<00:01:18.280> is<00:01:18.640> that

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
t2 technology now what this does is that

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.810 
t2 technology now what this does is that
it<00:01:19.020> aggressively<00:01:20.070> tapers<00:01:21.070> in<00:01:21.219> on<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.579> top

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
it aggressively tapers in on the top

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.850 
it aggressively tapers in on the top
part<00:01:22.090> wears<00:01:22.630> on<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.840> belly<00:01:23.170> or<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.530> bottom

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
part wears on the belly or the bottom

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.950 
part wears on the belly or the bottom
it's<00:01:24.250> not<00:01:24.369> nearly<00:01:24.850> as<00:01:25.030> aggressive<00:01:25.180> at<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.719> top

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
it's not nearly as aggressive at the top

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.679 
it's not nearly as aggressive at the top
what<00:01:26.770> this<00:01:26.979> does<00:01:27.219> the<00:01:27.549> bottom<00:01:27.850> part<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.149> make

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
what this does the bottom part and make

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.690 
what this does the bottom part and make
sure<00:01:28.869> your<00:01:29.140> shaft<00:01:29.500> doesn't<00:01:30.009> twist<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:30.460> torque

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
sure your shaft doesn't twist and torque

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.279 
sure your shaft doesn't twist and torque
on<00:01:30.880> big<00:01:31.090> shots<00:01:31.420> so<00:01:31.810> you're<00:01:31.930> getting<00:01:32.140> some

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
on big shots so you're getting some

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.770 
on big shots so you're getting some
great<00:01:32.469> accuracy<00:01:33.009> and<00:01:33.189> then<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.939> top<00:01:34.180> allows

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
great accuracy and then the top allows

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.139 
great accuracy and then the top allows
you<00:01:35.049> to<00:01:35.229> quickly<00:01:35.590> or<00:01:36.009> more<00:01:36.189> quickly<00:01:36.609> load<00:01:36.969> the

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
you to quickly or more quickly load the

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.209 
you to quickly or more quickly load the
shaft<00:01:37.390> so<00:01:37.869> you<00:01:37.960> can<00:01:38.109> get<00:01:38.289> that<00:01:38.439> shot<00:01:38.710> off<00:01:38.740> even

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
shaft so you can get that shot off even

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.099 
shaft so you can get that shot off even
quicker<00:01:39.430> now<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.240> blades<00:01:40.479> gonna<00:01:40.600> have<00:01:40.869> two

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
quicker now the blades gonna have two

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:42.630 
quicker now the blades gonna have two
big<00:01:41.289> upgrades<00:01:41.710> from<00:01:41.890> what<00:01:42.070> we<00:01:42.159> saw<00:01:42.399> in<00:01:42.609> that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
big upgrades from what we saw in that
