okay<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:06.720> had<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.080> comment<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:09.150> range

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
okay I had a comment that on the range

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.010 
okay I had a comment that on the range
for<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.590> electric<00:00:10.980> car<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.700> should<00:00:12.020> use

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020 
for the electric car that we should use

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.690 
for the electric car that we should use
twelve<00:00:13.440> twelve<00:00:13.860> volt<00:00:14.130> batteries<00:00:14.790> instead<00:00:15.420> of

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
twelve twelve volt batteries instead of

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.019 
twelve twelve volt batteries instead of
twenty<00:00:17.700> six<00:00:18.210> volt<00:00:18.540> batteries<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:20.009> 12<00:00:20.430> volts

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
twenty six volt batteries the 12 volts

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.019 
twenty six volt batteries the 12 volts
12<00:00:21.330> times<00:00:21.750> 12<00:00:22.050> 144<00:00:22.760> volts<00:00:23.869> which<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.080> okay<00:00:26.029> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
12 times 12 144 volts which is okay and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.220 
12 times 12 144 volts which is okay and
six<00:00:27.840> times<00:00:28.170> 20<00:00:28.920> would<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.160> 120<00:00:30.119> volts<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:31.109> it

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
six times 20 would be 120 volts but it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.410 
six times 20 would be 120 volts but it
isn't<00:00:31.560> voltage<00:00:31.980> were<00:00:32.189> concerned<00:00:32.699> about<00:00:32.910> here

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
isn't voltage were concerned about here

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.490 
isn't voltage were concerned about here
its<00:00:34.080> kilowatt<00:00:34.830> hours<00:00:35.449> and<00:00:36.449> kilowatt<00:00:37.140> hours

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
its kilowatt hours and kilowatt hours

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.710 
its kilowatt hours and kilowatt hours
are<00:00:37.979> the<00:00:38.909> voltage<00:00:39.510> times<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.470> amperage<00:00:41.720> this

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
are the voltage times the amperage this

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.439 
are the voltage times the amperage this
is<00:00:42.900> what<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.260> look<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:43.729> so<00:00:44.729> in<00:00:44.850> order<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.269> get

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
is what we look for so in order to get

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.590 
is what we look for so in order to get
the<00:00:45.570> same<00:00:45.839> kilowatt<00:00:46.440> hours<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.250> would<00:00:48.150> have<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
the same kilowatt hours I would have to

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.310 
the same kilowatt hours I would have to
have<00:00:48.780> 16<00:00:49.710> 12<00:00:50.129> volt<00:00:50.489> batteries<00:00:51.210> which<00:00:52.080> would

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
have 16 12 volt batteries which would

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.329 
have 16 12 volt batteries which would
put<00:00:52.589> me<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.940> 192<00:00:53.940> volts<00:00:54.949> that<00:00:55.949> would<00:00:56.129> maybe

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
put me up to 192 volts that would maybe

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.219 
put me up to 192 volts that would maybe
be<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.699> little<00:00:56.970> higher<00:00:57.299> than<00:00:57.629> I'd<00:00:57.780> want<00:00:58.080> to<00:00:58.170> be

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
be a little higher than I'd want to be

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:05.160 
be a little higher than I'd want to be
and<00:00:58.769> most<00:00:59.400> controllers<00:01:00.030> won't<00:01:00.269> go<00:01:00.540> that<00:01:00.809> high

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.760 

okay<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.670> make<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.700> comparison<00:01:08.600> between<00:01:09.140> six

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
okay to make a comparison between six

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.760 
okay to make a comparison between six
and<00:01:09.920> twelve<00:01:10.220> volt<00:01:10.520> batteries<00:01:11.320> we<00:01:12.320> need<00:01:12.590> to

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
and twelve volt batteries we need to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.370 
and twelve volt batteries we need to
compare<00:01:14.080> kilowatt<00:01:15.080> hours<00:01:15.470> if<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:16.610> look<00:01:16.880> here

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
compare kilowatt hours if you look here

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.990 
compare kilowatt hours if you look here
I've<00:01:18.380> highlighted<00:01:18.740> this<00:01:19.220> it<00:01:19.430> doesn't<00:01:19.729> show<00:01:19.850> up

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
I've highlighted this it doesn't show up

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.630 
I've highlighted this it doesn't show up
very<00:01:20.180> much<00:01:20.270> but<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.899> t105<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:22.159> a<00:01:22.190> six<00:01:22.549> volt

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640

kilowatt hours on it are 1.86 okay and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.100 
kilowatt hours on it are 1.86 okay and
it<00:01:59.390> weighs<00:01:59.690> about<00:02:00.850> 78<00:02:01.850> pounds<00:02:02.299> it's<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.840> little

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
it weighs about 78 pounds it's a little

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.639 
it weighs about 78 pounds it's a little
bit<00:02:05.500> heavier<00:02:06.610> okay<00:02:08.049> but<00:02:09.049> there's<00:02:09.229> not<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.410> lot

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
bit heavier okay but there's not a lot

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.970 
bit heavier okay but there's not a lot
of<00:02:09.679> difference<00:02:10.310> in<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:11.690> kilowatt<00:02:12.560> hours

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
of difference in the kilowatt hours

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.710 
of difference in the kilowatt hours
between<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.730> two<00:02:13.910> batteries<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:15.079> if<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.410> use<00:02:15.620> 12

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
between the two batteries so if I use 12

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:25.150 
between the two batteries so if I use 12
12<00:02:17.720> volt<00:02:18.280> deep-cycle<00:02:19.280> batteries<00:02:20.470> or<00:02:23.859> 26<00:02:24.859> volt

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
12 volt deep-cycle batteries or 26 volt

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.910 
12 volt deep-cycle batteries or 26 volt
deep-cycle<00:02:26.000> batteries<00:02:26.690> let's<00:02:27.680> make<00:02:27.890> a

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
deep-cycle batteries let's make a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.319 
deep-cycle batteries let's make a
comparison<00:02:28.609> and<00:02:28.940> find<00:02:29.209> out<00:02:29.450> exactly<00:02:30.260> what<00:02:31.329> the

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
comparison and find out exactly what the

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.130 
comparison and find out exactly what the
kilowatt<00:02:32.810> hours<00:02:33.170> would<00:02:33.440> be<00:02:33.620> on<00:02:35.140> okay

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
kilowatt hours would be on okay

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.810 
kilowatt hours would be on okay
hopefully<00:02:36.380> this<00:02:36.890> little<00:02:37.160> sheet<00:02:37.400> will<00:02:37.609> make

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
hopefully this little sheet will make

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.620 
hopefully this little sheet will make
sense<00:02:38.890> let's<00:02:39.890> go<00:02:40.040> over<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.280> top<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:40.850> if<00:02:41.239> I

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
sense let's go over the top of this if I

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.520 
sense let's go over the top of this if I
use<00:02:41.810> 6<00:02:42.109> volt<00:02:42.380> batteries<00:02:42.980> there<00:02:43.280> 1.5<00:02:44.530> kilowatt

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
use 6 volt batteries there 1.5 kilowatt

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.460 
use 6 volt batteries there 1.5 kilowatt
hours<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.609> use<00:02:46.910> 20<00:02:47.329> of<00:02:47.480> them<00:02:47.720> I'll<00:02:47.840> get<00:02:48.049> 30

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
hours and I use 20 of them I'll get 30

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.560 
hours and I use 20 of them I'll get 30
kilowatt<00:02:49.160> hours<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:49.760> that's<00:02:49.910> total<00:02:50.390> power

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
kilowatt hours and that's total power

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.240 
kilowatt hours and that's total power
remember<00:02:50.930> voltage<00:02:51.530> times<00:02:51.799> average<00:02:52.150> is

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
remember voltage times average is

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.849 
remember voltage times average is
kilowatts<00:02:55.250> if<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.450> use<00:02:56.720> 12<00:02:57.400> volt<00:02:58.480> there<00:02:59.859> 1.86

kilowatt hours per battery I would need
16<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.720> get<00:03:06.880> 29.8<00:03:07.880> kilowatt<00:03:08.480> hours<00:03:08.870> which<00:03:09.109> is

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
16 to get 29.8 kilowatt hours which is

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.870 
16 to get 29.8 kilowatt hours which is
essentially<00:03:09.799> it<00:03:09.890> would<00:03:09.980> be<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.250> same<00:03:10.519> as<00:03:10.730> the

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
essentially it would be the same as the

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.569 
essentially it would be the same as the
20<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:14.750> 6<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.290> 12<00:03:15.470> volt<00:03:15.739> batteries<00:03:16.220> are<00:03:16.400> about

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
20 the 6 and 12 volt batteries are about

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.320 
20 the 6 and 12 volt batteries are about
the<00:03:16.760> same<00:03:16.970> size

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.300 

what<00:03:20.330> that<00:03:20.540> means<00:03:20.870> is<00:03:21.230> because<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.739> 12-volt

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
what that means is because the 12-volt

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.130 
what that means is because the 12-volt
batteries<00:03:22.880> got<00:03:23.060> twice<00:03:23.330> as<00:03:23.390> many<00:03:23.599> cells

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
batteries got twice as many cells

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.449 
batteries got twice as many cells
meaning<00:03:24.470> as<00:03:24.620> two<00:03:24.920> or<00:03:25.099> two<00:03:25.250> point<00:03:25.520> two<00:03:25.959> volts

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
meaning as two or two point two volts

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.370 
meaning as two or two point two volts
per<00:03:28.459> cell<00:03:28.819> it's<00:03:29.150> got<00:03:29.300> six<00:03:29.750> or<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.880> six<00:03:31.880> bolt

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
per cell it's got six or the six bolt

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.300 
per cell it's got six or the six bolt
only<00:03:33.380> has<00:03:33.590> three<00:03:35.080> now<00:03:36.080> that<00:03:36.380> it's<00:03:36.920> kind<00:03:37.250> of

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
only has three now that it's kind of

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.920 
only has three now that it's kind of
important<00:03:37.880> because<00:03:38.170> these<00:03:40.660> plates<00:03:41.660> being

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
important because these plates being

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.199 
important because these plates being
closer<00:03:42.290> together<00:03:42.650> like<00:03:43.160> this<00:03:43.459> they're<00:03:44.090> gonna

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
closer together like this they're gonna

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.800 
closer together like this they're gonna
warp<00:03:44.599> easier<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.790> they<00:03:46.790> warp<00:03:47.120> because<00:03:47.630> they

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
warp easier and they warp because they

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.710 
warp easier and they warp because they
overheat<00:03:48.560> when<00:03:49.310> we're<00:03:49.550> under<00:03:49.880> high<00:03:50.090> discharge

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
overheat when we're under high discharge

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.080 
overheat when we're under high discharge
now<00:03:51.319> these<00:03:51.500> things<00:03:51.739> discharge<00:03:52.310> fairly<00:03:52.760> fast

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
now these things discharge fairly fast

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.610 
now these things discharge fairly fast
when<00:03:53.420> you<00:03:53.510> run<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.840> car<00:03:54.019> especially<00:03:54.170> if

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
when you run the car especially if

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.920 
when you run the car especially if
you're<00:03:54.799> accelerating<00:03:55.280> or<00:03:55.760> going<00:03:56.000> uphill<00:03:56.120> and

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
you're accelerating or going uphill and

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.949 
you're accelerating or going uphill and
if<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.160> plates<00:03:58.430> warp<00:03:58.850> they<00:03:59.180> break<00:03:59.569> and<00:03:59.900> they

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
if the plates warp they break and they

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.479 
if the plates warp they break and they
fall<00:04:00.350> apart<00:04:01.120> so<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:03.170> 12<00:04:03.470> volt<00:04:03.709> battery<00:04:04.160> being

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
fall apart so the 12 volt battery being

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.470 
fall apart so the 12 volt battery being
about<00:04:04.849> the<00:04:05.180> same<00:04:05.989> physical<00:04:06.650> size<00:04:06.980> as<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.640> six

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
about the same physical size as a six

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.030 
about the same physical size as a six
volt<00:04:08.569> it's<00:04:09.049> not<00:04:09.260> going<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:09.470> dissipate<00:04:09.980> the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
volt it's not going to dissipate the

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.600 
volt it's not going to dissipate the
heat<00:04:10.190> as<00:04:10.580> easily<00:04:11.349> so<00:04:12.349> six<00:04:12.709> volt<00:04:12.950> batteries

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
heat as easily so six volt batteries

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.449 
heat as easily so six volt batteries
make<00:04:14.000> sense<00:04:14.450> in<00:04:15.070> this<00:04:16.070> case<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.709> kilowatt

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
make sense in this case you the kilowatt

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.680 
make sense in this case you the kilowatt
hours<00:04:20.019> is<00:04:21.019> what<00:04:21.380> you're<00:04:21.560> looking<00:04:21.709> for<00:04:22.479> now<00:04:23.479> if

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
hours is what you're looking for now if

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.909 
hours is what you're looking for now if
I<00:04:23.810> did<00:04:24.169> as<00:04:24.500> this<00:04:25.419> as<00:04:26.419> this<00:04:26.840> shows<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:27.650> get<00:04:27.770> the

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
I did as this as this shows to get the

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.600 
I did as this as this shows to get the
same<00:04:28.130> kilowatt<00:04:28.700> hours<00:04:29.180> out<00:04:29.600> of<00:04:30.310> these<00:04:31.310> both

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
same kilowatt hours out of these both

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.400 
same kilowatt hours out of these both
these<00:04:31.820> battery<00:04:32.210> packs<00:04:32.539> so<00:04:32.780> that<00:04:32.930> six<00:04:33.169> volt

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
these battery packs so that six volt

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.409 
these battery packs so that six volt
would<00:04:33.650> be<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.860> hundred<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:34.400> twenty<00:04:34.789> volts<00:04:34.820> and

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
would be a hundred and twenty volts and

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:43.630 
would be a hundred and twenty volts and
the<00:04:36.080> 12<00:04:36.410> volt<00:04:36.800> would<00:04:37.280> be<00:04:40.030> 192<00:04:41.979> if<00:04:42.979> you<00:04:43.250> can<00:04:43.430> use

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
the 12 volt would be 192 if you can use

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.520 
the 12 volt would be 192 if you can use
192<00:04:44.630> it's<00:04:45.050> okay<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:46.000> lot<00:04:47.000> of<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.210> motors<00:04:47.600> are

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
192 it's okay a lot of the motors are

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.000 
192 it's okay a lot of the motors are
really<00:04:48.919> designed<00:04:49.310> for<00:04:49.430> that<00:04:49.550> higher<00:04:49.910> voltage

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
really designed for that higher voltage

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.590 
really designed for that higher voltage
and<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.460> higher<00:04:52.639> the<00:04:52.820> voltage<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.450> more

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
and the higher the voltage the more

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.230 
and the higher the voltage the more
problems<00:04:54.050> with<00:04:54.110> brushes<00:04:54.590> you<00:04:54.770> have<00:04:55.030> you<00:04:56.030> need

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
problems with brushes you have you need

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.990 
problems with brushes you have you need
voltage<00:04:56.660> we<00:04:56.990> need<00:04:57.139> voltage<00:04:57.560> to<00:04:57.800> push<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.669> amps

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
voltage we need voltage to push the amps

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.219 
voltage we need voltage to push the amps
through<00:04:59.380> but<00:05:01.479> that's<00:05:02.479> maybe<00:05:02.720> a<00:05:02.870> little<00:05:02.930> bit

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
through but that's maybe a little bit

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.700 
through but that's maybe a little bit
high<00:05:03.410> for<00:05:03.440> a<00:05:03.770> lot<00:05:04.010> of<00:05:04.360> applications<00:05:05.360> I<00:05:05.710> hope

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
high for a lot of applications I hope

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.409 
high for a lot of applications I hope
this<00:05:06.889> makes<00:05:07.130> sense

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.700 

that's<00:05:11.419> that<00:05:11.630> kilowatt<00:05:12.050> hours<00:05:12.410> is<00:05:12.530> what

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
that's that kilowatt hours is what

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.659 
that's that kilowatt hours is what
you're<00:05:12.860> looking<00:05:13.160> for

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
you're looking for

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.960 
you're looking for
and<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:15.530> get<00:05:15.740> that<00:05:15.889> same<00:05:16.250> kilowatt<00:05:16.760> hours

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
and to get that same kilowatt hours

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.590 
and to get that same kilowatt hours
you're<00:05:17.930> gonna<00:05:18.020> have<00:05:18.380> to<00:05:18.620> use<00:05:19.060> more<00:05:20.060> batteries

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
you're gonna have to use more batteries

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.219 
you're gonna have to use more batteries
with<00:05:20.810> six<00:05:21.080> volt<00:05:21.639> then<00:05:22.639> you<00:05:22.789> do<00:05:22.970> a<00:05:23.000> 12<00:05:23.419> volt<00:05:23.750> but

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
with six volt then you do a 12 volt but

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.800 
with six volt then you do a 12 volt but
because<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.650> batteries<00:05:25.100> are<00:05:25.130> larger<00:05:25.849> they

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
because the batteries are larger they

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.330 
because the batteries are larger they
will<00:05:26.990> dissipate<00:05:27.500> heat<00:05:27.970> faster<00:05:30.159> when<00:05:31.159> they're

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
will dissipate heat faster when they're

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.020 
will dissipate heat faster when they're
discharged

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
discharged

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.430 
discharged
or<00:05:32.120> even<00:05:32.570> when<00:05:32.720> they're<00:05:32.840> charged<00:05:33.200> it's<00:05:33.350> the

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
or even when they're charged it's the

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.210 
or even when they're charged it's the
same<00:05:33.650> same<00:05:34.430> situation<00:05:35.320> so<00:05:36.320> that's<00:05:36.920> why<00:05:37.040> we<00:05:37.190> use

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
same same situation so that's why we use

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.930 
same same situation so that's why we use
six<00:05:37.580> volt<00:05:38.800> doesn't<00:05:39.800> mean<00:05:39.920> you<00:05:40.010> can't<00:05:40.340> use<00:05:40.610> 12

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
six volt doesn't mean you can't use 12

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.000 
six volt doesn't mean you can't use 12
volt<00:05:41.180> I've<00:05:41.360> seen<00:05:41.570> guys<00:05:41.720> do<00:05:42.050> it<00:05:42.170> and<00:05:42.380> it<00:05:42.830> does

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
volt I've seen guys do it and it does

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.280 
volt I've seen guys do it and it does
work<00:05:43.340> and<00:05:43.700> some<00:05:44.600> of<00:05:44.660> the<00:05:44.750> more<00:05:44.930> expensive

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
work and some of the more expensive

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
batteries let us a batteries what I'm

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.830 
batteries let us a batteries what I'm
talking<00:05:50.570> about<00:05:51.550> some<00:05:52.550> of<00:05:52.670> those<00:05:52.840> actually

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
talking about some of those actually

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.170 
talking about some of those actually
work<00:05:54.350> fairly<00:05:54.650> well<00:05:55.070> but<00:05:55.370> there's<00:05:55.610> so<00:05:55.910> much

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
work fairly well but there's so much

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.990 
work fairly well but there's so much
more<00:05:56.240> expensive<00:05:57.190> than<00:05:58.190> your<00:05:58.460> golf<00:05:58.730> cart

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
more expensive than your golf cart

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.080 
more expensive than your golf cart
batteries<00:05:59.540> that<00:06:00.170> it<00:06:00.620> may<00:06:01.010> be<00:06:01.070> an<00:06:01.340> issue<00:06:01.520> when

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
batteries that it may be an issue when

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.960 
batteries that it may be an issue when
you're<00:06:02.650> trying<00:06:03.650> to<00:06:03.770> build<00:06:03.890> a<00:06:04.070> car<00:06:04.340> I<00:06:05.470> think<00:06:06.470> my

you're trying to build a car I think my

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.110 
you're trying to build a car I think my
battery<00:06:07.970> pack<00:06:08.000> cost<00:06:08.690> around<00:06:09.620> I<00:06:10.310> believe<00:06:10.580> it

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
battery pack cost around I believe it

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.370 
battery pack cost around I believe it
was<00:06:11.770> $1600<00:06:13.750> and<00:06:14.750> if<00:06:14.930> I<00:06:15.080> was<00:06:15.290> to<00:06:15.440> use<00:06:17.380> high-end

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
was $1600 and if I was to use high-end

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.280 
was $1600 and if I was to use high-end
let<00:06:19.250> acid<00:06:19.640> batteries<00:06:20.150> I'd<00:06:20.480> be<00:06:20.780> looking<00:06:20.960> at

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.290 
let acid batteries I'd be looking at

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.370 
let acid batteries I'd be looking at
maybe<00:06:21.560> two<00:06:22.070> to<00:06:22.850> three<00:06:23.060> times<00:06:23.240> that<00:06:23.450> much<00:06:23.720> so

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
maybe two to three times that much so

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.150 
maybe two to three times that much so
that's<00:06:25.100> why<00:06:25.370> it's<00:06:25.580> done<00:06:25.820> that<00:06:26.000> way<00:06:26.740> you<00:06:27.740> cannot

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
that's why it's done that way you cannot

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.940 
that's why it's done that way you cannot
increase<00:06:28.610> range<00:06:29.090> simply<00:06:29.870> by<00:06:30.050> using<00:06:30.110> 12<00:06:30.680> volt

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
increase range simply by using 12 volt

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.770 
increase range simply by using 12 volt
batteries<00:06:31.430> because<00:06:32.030> you<00:06:32.180> won't<00:06:32.390> have<00:06:32.570> the

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
batteries because you won't have the

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.800 
batteries because you won't have the
kilowatt<00:06:33.170> hours<00:06:33.470> if<00:06:33.620> I<00:06:33.770> used<00:06:34.150> a<00:06:35.150> smaller

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
kilowatt hours if I used a smaller

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.860 
kilowatt hours if I used a smaller
number<00:06:36.080> of<00:06:36.230> batteries<00:06:36.890> a<00:06:36.920> 12<00:06:37.400> volt<00:06:37.790> that<00:06:38.660> would

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
number of batteries a 12 volt that would

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.510 
number of batteries a 12 volt that would
not<00:06:39.080> mean<00:06:39.350> that<00:06:39.620> I<00:06:39.950> would<00:06:40.220> get<00:06:40.370> the<00:06:40.490> same

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
not mean that I would get the same

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.980 
not mean that I would get the same
kilowatt<00:06:41.120> hours<00:06:41.420> I<00:06:41.770> hope<00:06:42.770> it<00:06:42.920> makes<00:06:43.100> sense<00:06:43.990> but

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
kilowatt hours I hope it makes sense but

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.790 
kilowatt hours I hope it makes sense but
that's<00:06:45.470> my<00:06:45.740> explanation<00:06:46.130> on<00:06:46.610> it<00:06:47.530> okay<00:06:48.530> before

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
that's my explanation on it okay before

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.940 
that's my explanation on it okay before
I<00:06:48.980> leave<00:06:49.310> this<00:06:49.490> thing<00:06:49.820> I<00:06:50.030> wanted<00:06:50.420> to<00:06:50.920> make<00:06:51.920> a

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
I leave this thing I wanted to make a

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.570 
I leave this thing I wanted to make a
comparison<00:06:52.670> these<00:06:53.030> battery<00:06:53.990> weights<00:06:54.410> so<00:06:55.220> if<00:06:55.430> I

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
comparison these battery weights so if I

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.050 
comparison these battery weights so if I
had<00:06:55.820> six<00:06:56.360> volt<00:06:57.110> batteries<00:06:57.860> and<00:06:58.310> I<00:06:58.610> was<00:06:58.790> using

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
had six volt batteries and I was using

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.130 
had six volt batteries and I was using
twenty<00:06:59.750> there's<00:07:00.200> 62<00:07:00.650> pounds<00:07:01.100> of<00:07:01.490> piece<00:07:01.820> so<00:07:02.720> 20

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:03.140 
twenty there's 62 pounds of piece so 20

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.870 
twenty there's 62 pounds of piece so 20
times<00:07:03.320> 62<00:07:04.010> is<00:07:04.070> 1240<00:07:05.290> the<00:07:06.290> F<00:07:06.410> I<00:07:06.620> had<00:07:06.890> 12<00:07:07.460> volt

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:07.880 
times 62 is 1240 the F I had 12 volt

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.620 
times 62 is 1240 the F I had 12 volt
batteries<00:07:08.690> they<00:07:09.560> weigh<00:07:09.770> 78<00:07:10.580> pounds<00:07:11.030> and<00:07:11.570> I

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
batteries they weigh 78 pounds and I

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.990 
batteries they weigh 78 pounds and I
would<00:07:11.840> need<00:07:11.990> 16<00:07:12.680> to<00:07:12.920> get<00:07:13.010> the<00:07:13.160> same<00:07:13.400> kilowatt

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 
would need 16 to get the same kilowatt

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.200 
would need 16 to get the same kilowatt
hours<00:07:15.070> so<00:07:16.070> I<00:07:16.100> end<00:07:16.430> up<00:07:16.610> with<00:07:16.910> 12<00:07:17.240> 48<00:07:18.760> so<00:07:19.760> I<00:07:19.790> really

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.210 
hours so I end up with 12 48 so I really

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.620 
hours so I end up with 12 48 so I really
don't<00:07:20.420> have<00:07:20.480> a<00:07:20.750> lot<00:07:21.020> of<00:07:21.050> difference<00:07:21.620> in<00:07:24.100> weight

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:25.630 
don't have a lot of difference in weight

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:31.450 
don't have a lot of difference in weight
per<00:07:26.920> kilowatt<00:07:27.920> hours<00:07:28.960> and<00:07:29.960> I<00:07:30.710> don't<00:07:31.070> think<00:07:31.310> you

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:31.460 
per kilowatt hours and I don't think you

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.410 
per kilowatt hours and I don't think you
would<00:07:31.670> really<00:07:32.060> gain<00:07:32.990> anything<00:07:33.380> by<00:07:34.420> putting

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:35.420 
would really gain anything by putting

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.720 
would really gain anything by putting
smaller<00:07:36.170> numbers<00:07:36.650> of<00:07:36.680> batteries<00:07:37.340> in<00:07:37.520> there

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:37.730 
smaller numbers of batteries in there

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.870 
smaller numbers of batteries in there
because<00:07:38.090> you<00:07:38.210> simply<00:07:38.540> lose<00:07:38.930> the<00:07:39.880> kilowatt

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 
because you simply lose the kilowatt

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.590 
because you simply lose the kilowatt
hours<00:07:41.860> so<00:07:42.860> that's<00:07:43.280> pretty<00:07:43.640> much<00:07:43.820> it<00:07:44.090> on<00:07:44.120> the

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:44.600 
hours so that's pretty much it on the

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.890 
hours so that's pretty much it on the
batteries

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:46.900 
batteries

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.400 
batteries
and<00:07:47.900> why<00:07:48.620> were<00:07:48.889> using<00:07:49.160> what<00:07:49.490> we're<00:07:49.669> using<00:07:50.410> and

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:51.410 
and why were using what we're using and

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.240 
and why were using what we're using and
