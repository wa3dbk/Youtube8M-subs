00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 and, um, beauty galley just received 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.830
 time the pokémon y cartridge of generation x 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.440
 ye decided to make this channel here to 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.660
 make the lawsuit of the game but before that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.280
 video I'm going to do a boxing of cartridges 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.369
 did not let change change fast 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:24.689
 then go to the cane and see if he 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:28.590
 comes thus living a one box of paper 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.550
 and cool paper packaging that is well 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.740
 best 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.200
 I hope he provides it right and mine. 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.210
 camera does not have it but then it has 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.920
 that I turn around with what I have 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.040
 besides this piece of paper 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.120
 with a pack of 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:01:02.539
 plastic I open here a little bit 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:01:10.710
 now it comes out easier on the front 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:13.189
 and from behind a lot of information to play with 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.189
 cartridge 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.960
 this is one of the cool things in the games 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.810
 of nintendo is that the nintendo that leaves it 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.259
 many inserts come always very 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.470
 thing always comes the instruction thing that 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.820
 some companies it is simply 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.479
 Stop doing it, okay? Then let me. 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.479

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.530
 here it's like a little manual 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.380
 who has also said some care 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.030
 you have to be careful with the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.290
 care that should be taken care of 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.520
 huh 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:58.079
 Genius, well, what are you talking about? 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.280
 seven years of age actually talking about 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.890
 repetitive motion problems 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.300
 some some home sickness problems 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.770
 of the 3 d who have already spoken of the event of the 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.180
 launch event 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:21.340

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:26.129

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.870

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.849
 here also see a liter of code 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.680

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.730
 back part 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.359
 I thought I had nothing, because the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:50.769
 page you have to show this one in the 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:58.239
 back and clear the cartridge well 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:03:00.939

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:18.400
 One day after the budget because it has 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.799
 to enter and render etc. and 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.010
 You're probably okay, at least. 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.090
 the first ten minutes of the game 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.000
 I do not know if I can do much 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:33.669
