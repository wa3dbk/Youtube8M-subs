00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.930
 today we are going to prepare chapels and 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.230
 latches are 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:19.370
 of the mass type of the dumplings for 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:23.610
 make them carry the wheat flour wheat 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:26.540
 white normal paprika 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.010
 we are going to put some pipes on top 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.830
 the salt 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.280
 the egg to spread 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.360
 above beer the same amount of 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.090
 beer than oil 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.610
 and that's it, it's a bit of flour 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.980
 which has set aside half kilo I 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.770
 paragraph one put here then without fail 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.980
 then go adding 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.980
 in the sand you have to put it in a bowl 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.070
 metal than plastic because 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.520
 it can burn because the oil has to be 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.720
 put it very hot I put a 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.740
 spoonful of paprika and moves 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.740
 very encouraging 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.010
 to the sand 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.140
 this is already prepared, it mixes well 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.230
 so that the paprika when milk the 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.420
 hot oil do not burn because if not 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.020
 then this looks like a stir-fry is not a 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.900
 empanada since it is all mixed 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.280
 then the oil is brought to the fire and 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.870
 it gets to heat that they are very 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.960
 hot and you put the oil heated 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.220
 and it has to be very hot to 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.220
 put it to the flour 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.829
 when the oil is already hot, let's go 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.829
 to try and see how it is 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:02.610
 It is already pouring hot going to the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:06.810
 flour this is called jumping the sand 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.399
 what is the hot oil as already 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.790
 you see here 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.349
 with the flour or discard them this 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.769
 makes the dough then be more 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.060
 crunchy when this is good 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:24.090
 extended 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.180
 Well, now the beer gets 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.069
 that as I said carry the same 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.049
 amount of beer than oil 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.200
 you have to put a little more flour 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:39.170
 because the dough is a bit softer better 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.010
 so it's not hard then it's gone 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.219
 doing by hand as seen is caught and 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.409
 for the center and with the fist country and with 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:52.200
 his hands are digging his fingers 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:56.010
 so that the mass comes out well understood 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.890
 as you can see the mass is already ready to 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.210
 start 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.910
 to work it stays that is not sticky 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.060
 you can throw it away 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.720
 and now you have to cut portions and 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.060
 informing the circles of the pines 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.080
 this is running by budding and you 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.620
 they are working and with a roller they 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.910
 stretch 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.800
 for one side and then for the other 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.200
 A) Yes 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.200
 so that the mass that end 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.890
 It had a thin dough that does not break 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.930
 you have to help him a bit like that with your hand 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.740
 well help and for more or less 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.190
 come out all the same take a plate or 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.650
 any measure this part a bit the 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.760
 measure is bigger than 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.890
 the campillo is then caught he gets 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.780
 brand 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.090
 but it is cut 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.550
 and that's it 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.810
 well, we have it 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.810
 it takes off a bit 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.860
 and they are already put in a mold to 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.549
 put it now in the next then 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.720
 and to all the same 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.850
 as I have made the dough is easy to 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.010
 prepare 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.010
 and it 's so good in flavor 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:35.139
 remember 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.979
 it gets going 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.979
 it is cut 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.650
 It can be done with a plate with a cup 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.780
 with any 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.990
 more or less utensil that you have in 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.990
 home 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.060
 they get like this and that's it 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.860
 and the same and all the mold 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.770
 It is peeled 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.270
 this is 5 minutes that takes a lot 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.870
 care that in the oven are made 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.870
 right away 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.990
 do not stick 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.520
 nation 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.520
 dt 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.430
 give it shine 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.380
 two 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.380
 and now it's been given for the time 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.570
 this always likes children a lot 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.570
 greater 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:00.490
 I'm going to put some pipes over it 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.490
 sunflower 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:06.060
 You can also put them without pipes if you 

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:09.889
 want 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.889
 the oven while it is heating 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.880
 right away they will take 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.760
 is ready and ready to go 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:34.770
 pippa is lit with fire up and 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.779
 down but without turbo while preparing 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.340
 another round for when you take out 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:42.180
 put another and so they are going to overtake 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:44.909
 tevez is then already pulled out that leads 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.849
 to neglect what is going to be and then 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:50.699
 it is caught and it gets into the others and when 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:54.330
 cool because they are already taking off as 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:57.029
 you see take to see that oven for more and 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.669
 that more and below that also and 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:04.320
 up also and they'll be getting in 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:07.520
 a tray and then until they are all 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.350
 plastic bag hold several days 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.590
 crunchy 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:15.140
 as you have seen is a snack or 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:18.820
