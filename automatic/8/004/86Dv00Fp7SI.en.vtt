united<00:00:32.399> we<00:00:32.640> play<00:00:33.270> Chelsea<00:00:33.980> I<00:00:38.809> think<00:00:39.809> Austin

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
united we play Chelsea I think Austin

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.650 
united we play Chelsea I think Austin
was<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> team<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.520> play<00:00:41.700> well<00:00:41.879> together<00:00:42.120> we're

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
was a team we play well together we're

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.150 
was a team we play well together we're
not<00:00:42.690> being<00:00:42.989> consistent<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.649> season<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.070> I

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
not being consistent this season and I

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.799 
not being consistent this season and I
think<00:00:44.190> that's<00:00:44.550> where<00:00:44.760> we've<00:00:45.000> different<00:00:45.690> this

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
think that's where we've different this

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.299 
think that's where we've different this
year<00:00:45.870> from<00:00:46.200> previous<00:00:46.590> seasons<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.100> think

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
year from previous seasons I think

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.060 
year from previous seasons I think
previous<00:00:48.120> seasons<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.660> play<00:00:48.870> well<00:00:49.440> not

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
previous seasons we play well not

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.170 
previous seasons we play well not
brilliantly<00:00:50.460> we're<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.760> best<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
brilliantly we're not the best in the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.520 
brilliantly we're not the best in the
country<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.570> we<00:00:51.780> play<00:00:51.960> well<00:00:52.140> moving<00:00:52.410> forward

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
country but we play well moving forward

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.970 
country but we play well moving forward
we<00:00:53.340> need<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.610> take<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:54.030> look<00:00:54.300> at<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> likes<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
we need to take a look at the likes of

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
we need to take a look at the likes of
Barcelona<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> Spanish<00:00:56.489> teams<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.879> look

players<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.809> think<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.379> shame<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
players I just think it's a shame that

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.429 
players I just think it's a shame that
English<00:01:03.059> football<00:01:03.390> isn't<00:01:03.629> moving<00:01:03.750> forward<00:01:04.320> as

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
English football isn't moving forward as

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.350 
English football isn't moving forward as
far<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.010> say<00:01:05.189> Spain<00:01:05.519> or<00:01:05.790> Brazil<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> way

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
far as to say Spain or Brazil the way

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.030 
far as to say Spain or Brazil the way
they<00:01:06.510> train<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.530> completely<00:01:07.890> different

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
they train it's completely different

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.770 
they train it's completely different

Manchester United on such a universe so

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.260

I'm<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.650> upset<00:01:35.930> performance<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.110> Saturday

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290

against<00:01:37.710> Manchester<00:01:38.159> United

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
against Manchester United

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.460 
against Manchester United
I've<00:01:38.670> always<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.970> bit<00:01:39.119> lackluster<00:01:39.470> performance

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
I've always a bit lackluster performance

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.200 
I've always a bit lackluster performance
I<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.189> boys<00:01:41.340> didn't<00:01:41.640> shower<00:01:41.820> gas

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
I think the boys didn't shower gas

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.289 
I think the boys didn't shower gas
except<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:42.630> jet<00:01:42.810> Rocha<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.470> ask<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.299> point

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
except for jet Rocha and ask this point

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.399 
except for jet Rocha and ask this point
of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.540> all-round<00:01:45.780> performance<00:01:45.930> when

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
of the all-round performance when

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.660 
of the all-round performance when
getting<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.009> play

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.520 
getting to do the play
jet<00:01:48.270> whooshes<00:01:48.630> sending-off<00:01:49.080> did<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.350> think

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
jet whooshes sending-off did you think

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.130 
jet whooshes sending-off did you think
it<00:01:49.710> was<00:01:49.830> warranted<00:01:50.460> not<00:01:50.910> really<00:01:51.690> I<00:01:51.720> thought<00:01:51.960> if

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
it was warranted not really I thought if

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.840 
it was warranted not really I thought if
the<00:01:52.230> only<00:01:52.380> one<00:01:52.560> showing<00:01:52.830> any<00:01:53.040> enthusiasm<00:01:53.190> he

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
disappointing night in minutes obviously

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.240 
disappointing night in minutes obviously
three<00:03:37.769> minutes<00:03:38.069> in<00:03:38.239> Van<00:03:39.239> Persie<00:03:40.040> first<00:03:41.040> steps

of<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.400> ball<00:03:42.290> over<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.409> scoring<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.780> was<00:03:45.989> a

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
of the ball over the scoring so it was a

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.659 
of the ball over the scoring so it was a
straight<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.650> game<00:03:46.859> like<00:03:47.069> following<00:03:47.370> Arsenal

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
straight in game like following Arsenal

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.759 
straight in game like following Arsenal
for<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:47.970> long<00:03:48.209> used<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.139> is<00:03:49.319> classic

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
for so long used to that is classic

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.369 
for so long used to that is classic
battles<00:03:50.099> between<00:03:50.340> us<00:03:50.700> for<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:50.970> menu<00:03:51.329> but<00:03:51.840> I

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
battles between us for the menu but I

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.940 
battles between us for the menu but I
think<00:03:53.310> they<00:03:53.400> dominated<00:03:53.849> us<00:03:54.379> large<00:03:55.379> chunks<00:03:55.859> of

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
think they dominated us large chunks of

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.929 
think they dominated us large chunks of
the<00:03:56.010> game<00:03:56.689> but<00:03:58.189> so<00:03:59.189> over<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.459> nights<00:03:59.669> it<00:03:59.879> was

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
the game but so over the nights it was

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.349 
the game but so over the nights it was
frustrating<00:04:00.209> but<00:04:01.159> I'm<00:04:02.159> not<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.699> know<00:04:02.729> I'm<00:04:02.970> not

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359
