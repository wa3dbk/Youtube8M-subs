newbie to this hobby I have embarked on
a<00:01:00.329> lot<00:01:00.540> of<00:01:00.570> different<00:01:00.960> projects<00:01:01.470> I've<00:01:01.710> built

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
a lot of different projects I've built

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.390 
a lot of different projects I've built
kits<00:01:02.640> I've<00:01:02.970> rebuilt<00:01:03.860> most<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> vehicles

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
kits I've rebuilt most of the vehicles

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.910 
kits I've rebuilt most of the vehicles
that<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.119> own<00:01:06.300> and<00:01:06.930> all<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.170> good<00:01:07.350> stuff

I<00:01:07.950> understand<00:01:08.820> how<00:01:09.000> steering<00:01:09.720> assemblies

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
I understand how steering assemblies

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.310 
I understand how steering assemblies
operate<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.729> every<00:01:12.000> now<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.330> then<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.750> come

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
operate but every now and then I come

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.050 
operate but every now and then I come
across<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> project<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.640> makes<00:01:14.850> me

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
across a project it just makes me

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.270 
across a project it just makes me
scratch<00:01:15.390> my<00:01:15.420> head<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.259> think<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.890> really

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
scratch my head and I think you really

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.540 
scratch my head and I think you really
truly<00:01:17.880> cannot<00:01:18.330> learn<00:01:18.690> about<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> specific<00:01:19.890> area

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
truly cannot learn about a specific area

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.389 
truly cannot learn about a specific area
until<00:01:21.420> you've<00:01:21.690> broken<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.440> or<00:01:22.740> until<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.160> no

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
until you've broken it or until it's no

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.490 
until you've broken it or until it's no
longer<00:01:23.430> functioning<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.600> should<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.140> in

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
longer functioning like it should so in

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.889 
longer functioning like it should so in
a<00:01:25.740> way<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:26.039> kind<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.280> excited<00:01:26.640> about<00:01:27.000> this

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
a way I'm kind of excited about this

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.160 
a way I'm kind of excited about this
because<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> challenge<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:30.960> let's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
because this is a challenge so let's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.310 
because this is a challenge so let's
walk<00:01:31.320> through<00:01:32.060> real<00:01:33.060> quickly<00:01:33.330> kind<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.140> what

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
walk through real quickly kind of what

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.779

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
symptom here is that it's got bad slop

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.820 
symptom here is that it's got bad slop
so<00:01:39.330> let's<00:01:39.539> take<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> look<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.289> mean<00:01:40.440> really

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
understand what I mean unfortunately I

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.130 
understand what I mean unfortunately I
don't<00:01:44.789> have<00:01:44.970> anyone<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.330> film<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.810> me<00:01:45.929> someone

don't have anyone to film for me someone
have<00:01:46.289> to<00:01:46.320> rig<00:01:46.619> something<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:47.160> but<00:01:47.910> you'll<00:01:48.179> get

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
have to rig something up but you'll get

00:01:48.360 --> 00:02:07.810 
have to rig something up but you'll get
an<00:01:48.479> idea<00:01:48.539> just<00:01:49.289> watch<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.369> front<00:01:50.550> tires

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:19.480 

I<00:02:17.230> realized<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:18.320> was<00:02:18.470> hard<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.740> see<00:02:18.950> it's

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
I realized that was hard to see it's

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.400 
I realized that was hard to see it's
much<00:02:19.730> more<00:02:19.940> pronounced<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.480> person<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.260> can

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
much more pronounced in person you can

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:29.080 
much more pronounced in person you can
even<00:02:21.530> watch<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.860> wheel<00:02:22.010> here<00:02:27.850> same<00:02:28.850> with<00:02:28.970> this

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
even watch the wheel here same with this

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.120 
even watch the wheel here same with this
one<00:02:29.709> see<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.800> way<00:02:30.890> it's<00:02:31.040> like<00:02:31.190> shaking<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:34.040> if

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
one see the way it's like shaking so if

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.940 
one see the way it's like shaking so if
I<00:02:34.190> turn<00:02:34.250> hard<00:02:38.470> put<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.590> into<00:02:39.800> perspective

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
I turn hard put this into perspective

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.890 
I turn hard put this into perspective
the<00:02:40.489> last<00:02:40.670> time<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:40.910> was<00:02:41.090> at<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.330> track<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:41.780> was

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
the last time I was at the track I was

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.260 
the last time I was at the track I was
up<00:02:42.050> on<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.230> stand<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:43.520> this<00:02:43.670> other<00:02:43.790> guy<00:02:43.970> could

every<00:02:54.620> single<00:02:54.980> piece<00:02:55.820> that<00:02:56.660> plays<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.320> role<00:02:57.680> in

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
every single piece that plays a role in

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.229 
every single piece that plays a role in
the<00:02:58.459> steering<00:02:58.760> assembly

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
the steering assembly

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.050 
the steering assembly
I<00:02:59.420> took<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.200> completely<00:03:00.290> apart<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.160> rebuilt

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
I took it completely apart and rebuilt

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.170 
I took it completely apart and rebuilt
it<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.720> servo<00:03:03.080> saver<00:03:03.320> took<00:03:04.160> that<00:03:04.310> apart<00:03:04.670> even

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
it the servo saver took that apart even

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.600 
it the servo saver took that apart even
change<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.840> bearings<00:03:06.170> on<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:06.530> reposted<00:03:07.489> it

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
change the bearings on it reposted it

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.840 
change the bearings on it reposted it
all<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.540> links<00:03:09.019> everything<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.280> I've

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
all the links everything and I've

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.320 
all the links everything and I've
concluded<00:03:11.860> that<00:03:12.860> everything<00:03:13.820> on<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.060> looks

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
concluded that everything on it looks

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.570 
concluded that everything on it looks
fine<00:03:14.600> it's<00:03:15.110> tight<00:03:15.530> there's<00:03:16.100> a<00:03:16.160> little<00:03:16.400> bit<00:03:16.489> of

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
fine it's tight there's a little bit of

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.830 
fine it's tight there's a little bit of
play<00:03:16.820> here<00:03:17.480> in<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.780> in<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.110> servo<00:03:18.500> saver

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
play here in the in the servo saver

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.009 
play here in the in the servo saver
that's<00:03:20.840> normal<00:03:21.320> or<00:03:21.549> at<00:03:22.549> least<00:03:22.580> I<00:03:23.060> checked<00:03:23.690> all

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
that's normal or at least I checked all

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.539 
that's normal or at least I checked all
of<00:03:24.079> my<00:03:24.440> other<00:03:24.530> cars<00:03:24.829> and<00:03:25.040> they<00:03:25.130> all<00:03:25.250> have<00:03:25.400> that

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
of my other cars and they all have that

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.319 
of my other cars and they all have that
same<00:03:25.579> amount<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:26.060> play<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:28.700> what<00:03:29.209> I've

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
same amount of play so what I've

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.600 
same amount of play so what I've
concluded<00:03:29.480> is<00:03:30.079> it<00:03:30.260> has<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.709> do<00:03:30.829> something<00:03:31.250> with

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
concluded is it has to do something with

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.680 
concluded is it has to do something with
the<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:33.079> wheels<00:03:34.030> okay<00:03:35.030> because<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.480> the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
the the wheels okay because the the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.440 
the the wheels okay because the the
further<00:03:35.989> out<00:03:36.230> from<00:03:36.260> here<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.100> get<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:38.269> more

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
further out from here you get the more

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.729 
further out from here you get the more
loose<00:03:38.660> it<00:03:38.870> is<00:03:38.930> it's<00:03:39.140> hard<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.320> do<00:03:39.440> with<00:03:39.470> one

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
loose it is it's hard to do with one

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.940 
loose it is it's hard to do with one
hand<00:03:39.769> but<00:03:40.160> I<00:03:40.250> can<00:03:40.280> actually<00:03:40.790> hold<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.860> you

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
hand but I can actually hold it and you

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.699 
hand but I can actually hold it and you
can<00:03:43.100> see<00:03:43.400> it's<00:03:44.150> like<00:03:44.390> it's<00:03:44.570> wiggling<00:03:45.260> on<00:03:45.440> the

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
can see it's like it's wiggling on the

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.280 
can see it's like it's wiggling on the
on<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.790> steering<00:03:47.060> though<00:03:47.239> so<00:03:47.959> at<00:03:48.019> first<00:03:48.140> I

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
on the steering though so at first I

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.810 
on the steering though so at first I
thought<00:03:48.380> okay<00:03:48.590> maybe<00:03:48.799> it's<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.100> wheels<00:03:49.310> I've

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
thought okay maybe it's the wheels I've

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.270 
thought okay maybe it's the wheels I've
tried<00:03:50.120> various<00:03:50.480> wheels<00:03:50.750> on<00:03:50.959> here<00:03:51.200> same<00:03:51.890> result

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
tried various wheels on here same result

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.610 
tried various wheels on here same result
the<00:03:52.820> hub<00:03:53.000> bearings<00:03:53.329> are<00:03:53.450> on<00:03:53.510> here<00:03:53.780> tight<00:03:54.019> and

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
the hub bearings are on here tight and

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.050 
the hub bearings are on here tight and
then<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:54.829> thought<00:03:55.010> okay<00:03:55.190> well<00:03:55.220> perhaps<00:03:55.549> it's

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
then I thought okay well perhaps it's

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.699 
then I thought okay well perhaps it's
there's<00:03:56.989> something<00:03:57.320> wrong<00:03:57.440> with<00:03:57.590> the

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
there's something wrong with the

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.400 
there's something wrong with the
threading<00:03:58.190> on<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:58.720> but<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.870> threading<00:04:00.320> is

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
threading on it but the threading is

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.069 
threading on it but the threading is
fine<00:04:00.680> I'm<00:04:00.950> able<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.910> know<00:04:02.030> on<00:04:02.450> both<00:04:02.750> wheels

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
fine I'm able to you know on both wheels

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.900 
fine I'm able to you know on both wheels
and<00:04:03.440> that's<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.769> thing<00:04:03.950> both<00:04:04.400> of<00:04:04.579> them<00:04:04.700> are

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
and that's the thing both of them are

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.750 
and that's the thing both of them are
exhibiting<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.570> exact<00:04:05.989> same<00:04:06.290> behavior<00:04:06.760> which

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
exhibiting the exact same behavior which

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.330 
exhibiting the exact same behavior which
is<00:04:07.940> very<00:04:08.180> very<00:04:08.299> puzzling<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:09.100> thought<00:04:10.100> okay

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
is very very puzzling I thought okay

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.780 
is very very puzzling I thought okay
perhaps<00:04:10.549> it's<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.500> hub<00:04:12.500> carriers<00:04:12.920> because

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
perhaps it's the hub carriers because

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.520 
perhaps it's the hub carriers because
there's<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.660> little<00:04:14.870> bit<00:04:14.989> of<00:04:15.079> movement<00:04:15.260> right

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
there's a little bit of movement right

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.740 
there's a little bit of movement right
here<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:15.889> can<00:04:16.070> see

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
here you can see

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.350 
here you can see
so<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.530> put<00:04:17.980> on<00:04:18.010> new<00:04:18.610> hub<00:04:18.820> carriers<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.299> I'll

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 
so I put on new hub carriers and I'll

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.020 
so I put on new hub carriers and I'll
get<00:04:19.480> into<00:04:19.600> that<00:04:19.959> a<00:04:20.200> little<00:04:20.350> bit<00:04:20.500> later<00:04:21.030> but

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
get into that a little bit later but

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.900 
get into that a little bit later but
it's<00:04:22.180> something<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.630> do<00:04:22.780> with<00:04:23.490> this<00:04:24.490> area

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
it's something to do with this area

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.270 
it's something to do with this area
right<00:04:25.060> here<00:04:25.320> because<00:04:26.320> once<00:04:26.560> it's<00:04:26.770> affixed<00:04:27.190> on

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
right here because once it's affixed on

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.820 
right here because once it's affixed on
there<00:04:27.610> get<00:04:27.940> really<00:04:28.480> really<00:04:28.630> shakes<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.320> checked

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
there get really really shakes I checked

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.400 
there get really really shakes I checked
that<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.190> hub<00:04:30.820> pin<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.960> goes<00:04:31.990> into<00:04:32.260> the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
that the hub pin that goes into the

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.960 
that the hub pin that goes into the
shaft<00:04:32.650> is<00:04:32.920> flush<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:33.250> here's<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.640> tapings

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
shaft is flush and here's the tapings

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.580 
shaft is flush and here's the tapings
just<00:04:34.150> get<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.270> tee<00:04:34.480> wrench<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:35.290> put<00:04:35.410> it<00:04:35.500> on

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
just get a tee wrench and put it on

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.280 
just get a tee wrench and put it on
there<00:04:35.830> if<00:04:36.490> it<00:04:36.670> goes<00:04:36.790> on<00:04:36.970> it's<00:04:37.300> flush<00:04:37.570> so<00:04:38.110> here's

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
there if it goes on it's flush so here's

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.130 
there if it goes on it's flush so here's
another<00:04:38.500> tyre<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.190> J<00:04:39.490> concept<00:04:40.140> seven-halves

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
another tyre the J concept seven-halves

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
thing the Wolfe retire but if I even if

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.310 
thing the Wolfe retire but if I even if
I<00:04:45.760> hold<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:46.240> camber<00:04:46.720> link<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.080> steering

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
I hold the camber link and the steering

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.960 
I hold the camber link and the steering
link<00:04:47.590> stationary<00:04:48.190> it's<00:04:48.370> kind<00:04:48.520> of<00:04:48.550> hard<00:04:48.700> to<00:04:48.790> see

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
link stationary it's kind of hard to see

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.270 
link stationary it's kind of hard to see
or<00:04:49.270> do<00:04:49.450> with<00:04:49.600> one<00:04:49.750> hand<00:04:50.050> you<00:04:50.770> can<00:04:50.890> see<00:04:51.100> there's

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
or do with one hand you can see there's

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.840 
or do with one hand you can see there's
just<00:04:51.340> a<00:04:51.550> lot<00:04:51.760> of<00:04:51.790> movement<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:54.430> I<00:04:54.490> don't<00:04:54.670> see

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
just a lot of movement so I don't see

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.390 
just a lot of movement so I don't see
how<00:04:54.970> it's<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.420> the<00:04:55.870> wheels<00:04:56.140> especially<00:04:56.950> since

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
how it's the the wheels especially since

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.190 
how it's the the wheels especially since
it<00:04:57.550> didn't<00:04:57.940> do<00:04:58.060> this<00:04:58.180> when<00:04:58.390> I<00:04:58.420> first<00:04:58.660> got<00:04:58.990> it

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
it didn't do this when I first got it

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.080 
it didn't do this when I first got it
the<00:04:59.530> only<00:04:59.710> thing<00:04:59.860> I<00:04:59.950> can<00:05:00.130> think<00:05:00.160> at<00:05:00.730> this<00:05:00.850> point

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
the only thing I can think at this point

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.770 
the only thing I can think at this point
is<00:05:01.680> maybe<00:05:02.680> it<00:05:02.830> wore<00:05:03.700> itself<00:05:04.060> out<00:05:04.270> or<00:05:04.480> something

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
is maybe it wore itself out or something

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.120 
is maybe it wore itself out or something
so<00:05:04.930> let's<00:05:05.050> go<00:05:05.230> ahead<00:05:05.290> and<00:05:05.440> try<00:05:05.530> wheel<00:05:05.830> but<00:05:06.010> I've

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
so let's go ahead and try wheel but I've

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.300 
so let's go ahead and try wheel but I've
never<00:05:06.280> driven<00:05:06.670> on<00:05:06.940> this<00:05:07.090> proline<00:05:07.750> taser<00:05:08.310> Sam

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
never driven on this proline taser Sam

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.340 
never driven on this proline taser Sam
result

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.090 

and<00:05:13.350> once<00:05:13.530> again<00:05:13.650> it's

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
and once again it's

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.950 
and once again it's
really<00:05:14.280> hard<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:14.490> do<00:05:15.060> why<00:05:15.480> can't<00:05:15.780> it's

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
really hard to do why can't it's

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.850 
really hard to do why can't it's
impossible<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.500> do<00:05:16.850> while<00:05:17.850> filming<00:05:18.150> but<00:05:19.080> if<00:05:19.650> it

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
impossible to do while filming but if it

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.800 
impossible to do while filming but if it
with<00:05:19.980> the<00:05:20.100> wheel<00:05:20.310> off<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:20.880> if<00:05:21.330> I<00:05:21.450> hold<00:05:21.630> this

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
with the wheel off and if I hold this

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.380 
with the wheel off and if I hold this
down<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.650> play<00:05:22.890> is<00:05:23.040> not<00:05:23.250> there<00:05:23.520> so<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.850> place

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
down the play is not there so the place

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.690 
down the play is not there so the place
seems<00:05:24.720> to<00:05:24.810> definitely<00:05:25.200> be<00:05:25.320> once<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:26.340> wheel<00:05:26.520> is

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
seems to definitely be once the wheel is

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.760 
seems to definitely be once the wheel is
on<00:05:26.850> there<00:05:27.120> it's<00:05:27.390> just<00:05:27.660> it's<00:05:27.990> not<00:05:28.140> snug<00:05:30.710> okay<00:05:31.710> so

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
on there it's just it's not snug okay so

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.620 
on there it's just it's not snug okay so
I<00:05:31.980> believe<00:05:32.250> I'm<00:05:32.580> onto<00:05:32.910> something<00:05:33.240> here

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
I believe I'm onto something here

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.530 
I believe I'm onto something here
I<00:05:33.660> just<00:05:34.380> changed<00:05:34.860> out<00:05:35.040> the<00:05:35.070> hubs<00:05:35.430> between<00:05:36.000> took

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
I just changed out the hubs between took

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.090 
I just changed out the hubs between took
us<00:05:36.690> one<00:05:37.080> off<00:05:37.200> the<00:05:37.320> back<00:05:37.470> and<00:05:37.770> put<00:05:37.860> it<00:05:37.950> on<00:05:38.010> the

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
us one off the back and put it on the

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.130 
us one off the back and put it on the
front<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.460> vice<00:05:38.550> versa<00:05:38.940> and<00:05:39.120> I'm<00:05:39.960> already

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
front and vice versa and I'm already

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.680 
front and vice versa and I'm already
seeing<00:05:40.440> a<00:05:40.680> big<00:05:40.890> difference<00:05:41.340> so<00:05:42.210> you<00:05:42.300> can<00:05:42.480> see

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
seeing a big difference so you can see

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.170 
seeing a big difference so you can see
it's<00:05:43.020> still<00:05:43.200> moving<00:05:43.620> but<00:05:43.880> that's<00:05:44.880> actually

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
it's still moving but that's actually

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.600 
it's still moving but that's actually
just<00:05:45.300> part<00:05:45.570> of<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.980> again<00:05:46.980> if<00:05:47.100> I<00:05:47.190> hold<00:05:47.370> it

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
just part of the again if I hold it

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.570 
just part of the again if I hold it
there's<00:05:48.300> a<00:05:48.390> big<00:05:48.800> difference<00:05:49.800> between<00:05:52.580> the

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
there's a big difference between the

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.820 
there's a big difference between the
tires<00:05:53.850> it<00:05:54.270> appears<00:05:54.630> and<00:05:54.990> then<00:05:55.170> back<00:05:55.320> here<00:05:55.560> same

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
tires it appears and then back here same

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.570 
tires it appears and then back here same
thing<00:05:55.860> you<00:05:56.250> can<00:05:56.400> see<00:05:56.490> this<00:05:56.670> one<00:05:58.340> seems<00:05:59.340> to<00:05:59.430> have

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
thing you can see this one seems to have

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.810 
thing you can see this one seems to have
more<00:05:59.790> shake<00:06:00.740> than<00:06:01.740> this<00:06:01.860> one<00:06:02.100> and<00:06:02.250> I<00:06:02.760> think

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
more shake than this one and I think

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.610 
more shake than this one and I think
it's<00:06:03.000> just<00:06:03.120> that<00:06:03.360> little<00:06:03.690> extra<00:06:03.930> shake<00:06:04.380> that's

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
it's just that little extra shake that's

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.270 
it's just that little extra shake that's
causing<00:06:04.920> it<00:06:05.190> when<00:06:05.610> I<00:06:05.670> Drive<00:06:05.940> to<00:06:06.680> do<00:06:07.680> bad<00:06:07.920> things

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
causing it when I Drive to do bad things

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.530 
causing it when I Drive to do bad things
so<00:06:08.730> what<00:06:08.820> I'm<00:06:08.880> going<00:06:09.030> to<00:06:09.060> do<00:06:09.210> is<00:06:09.300> I'm<00:06:09.390> going<00:06:09.420> to

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.750 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
switch<00:06:09.660> out<00:06:09.900> these<00:06:10.170> two<00:06:10.440> and<00:06:10.680> then<00:06:11.370> we'll<00:06:11.640> give

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
switch out these two and then we'll give

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.070 
switch out these two and then we'll give
it<00:06:11.790> a<00:06:11.910> test<00:06:12.060> okay<00:06:12.240> so<00:06:12.360> I<00:06:12.480> just<00:06:12.510> swapped<00:06:12.900> out<00:06:13.050> the

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
it a test okay so I just swapped out the

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.590 
it a test okay so I just swapped out the
front<00:06:13.530> and<00:06:13.770> back<00:06:13.950> this<00:06:14.610> one<00:06:14.820> still<00:06:15.120> has<00:06:15.300> a

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
front and back this one still has a

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.050 
front and back this one still has a
little<00:06:15.840> bit<00:06:15.990> of<00:06:16.340> movement<00:06:17.340> to<00:06:17.610> a<00:06:17.730> little<00:06:18.000> bit

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
little bit of movement to a little bit

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.780 
little bit of movement to a little bit
of<00:06:18.120> play<00:06:18.330> this<00:06:18.960> front<00:06:19.410> left<00:06:19.590> one<00:06:19.830> the<00:06:20.640> first

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
of play this front left one the first

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.870 
of play this front left one the first
one<00:06:20.970> I<00:06:21.000> did<00:06:21.150> is<00:06:21.270> fine<00:06:21.560> so<00:06:22.560> what<00:06:23.220> I'll<00:06:23.340> do<00:06:23.520> is<00:06:23.550> I'm

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
one I did is fine so what I'll do is I'm

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.710 
one I did is fine so what I'll do is I'm
going<00:06:23.970> to<00:06:24.030> take<00:06:24.180> it<00:06:24.270> out<00:06:24.330> and<00:06:24.480> run<00:06:24.630> it

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
going to take it out and run it

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.030 
going to take it out and run it
definitely<00:06:25.260> keep<00:06:25.350> an<00:06:25.470> eye<00:06:25.560> on<00:06:25.590> this<00:06:25.800> front

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
definitely keep an eye on this front

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.790 
definitely keep an eye on this front
right<00:06:26.220> one<00:06:26.490> if<00:06:27.210> the<00:06:27.360> front<00:06:27.600> left<00:06:27.960> one<00:06:28.170> the

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
right one if the front left one the

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.130 
right one if the front left one the
problem<00:06:29.100> solved<00:06:29.520> and<00:06:29.700> this<00:06:30.450> one<00:06:30.660> still<00:06:30.990> has

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
problem solved and this one still has

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.810 
problem solved and this one still has
that<00:06:31.290> issue<00:06:31.500> what<00:06:31.860> I'm<00:06:31.950> gonna<00:06:32.040> do<00:06:32.250> then<00:06:32.460> is

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
that issue what I'm gonna do then is

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.750 
that issue what I'm gonna do then is
