okay<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.840> our<00:00:49.260> self<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:51.840> these<00:00:52.590> are

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
okay so this is our self and these are

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.660 
okay so this is our self and these are
the<00:00:53.220> clarifies<00:00:53.900> plant<00:00:54.900> cell<00:00:55.290> this<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the clarifies plant cell this is the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.119 
the clarifies plant cell this is the
cell<00:00:56.790> wall<00:00:57.050> this<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.110> the<00:00:58.350> song<00:00:58.559> my<00:00:58.739> brain<00:00:58.980> it's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
cell wall this is the song my brain it's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.939 
cell wall this is the song my brain it's
blue<00:00:59.850> so<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.150> can<00:01:00.360> distinguish<00:01:00.930> them<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.739> is

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
blue so you can distinguish them this is

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.750 
blue so you can distinguish them this is
the<00:01:02.129> vacuole<00:01:04.040> this<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the vacuole this this is the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.660 
the vacuole this this is the
mitochondria<00:01:06.660> and<00:01:07.050> these<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.340> little

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
mitochondria and these and a little

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:42.520 
mitochondria and these and a little
ribosomes<00:01:09.660> and<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.350> cytoplasm

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.520 

everybody<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.370> was<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:45.260> I'm<00:01:46.260> putting<00:01:46.410> you

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
everybody so I was like I'm putting you

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.270 
everybody so I was like I'm putting you
off<00:01:46.650> on<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> inside

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.170 

you<00:01:50.280> realize<00:01:50.520> I'm<00:01:50.640> gonna<00:01:50.790> see<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.060> you're
