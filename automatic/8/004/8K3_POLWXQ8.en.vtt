00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.400
 welcome to another video I'm the louse of 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.109
 pokemon and good this time I bring 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.390
 a very interesting video the truth 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.340
 a very personal video because in 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.190
 this time we will talk about a theory 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.250
 that there is a theory here in the channel 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.810
 I have a theory about the possible 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.150
 story that may occur in pokemon 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.220
 ruby or mega and sapphire alpha these coming 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.740
 games that are coming out this month of 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.690
 November and well this story good to me 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.820
 I would like to forgive this theory for 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.710
 saying it occurred to me while I was watching 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.960
 some images while I was watching 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.790
 the trailers I do not know if someone already has 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.930
 commented or not but I want to clarify that 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.750
 at least I have not seen him 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.610
 absolutely nobody and obviously I do not 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.590
 I'm confirming absolutely nothing 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.790
 I'm just giving some theory and 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.350
 a hypothesis 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.510
 also know that whatever 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.030
 have the comments to put 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.649
 anything that you fancy but 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.960
 well now let's talk more thoroughly 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.270
 of this little theory that I have and the 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.489
 theory that I have is that inside the 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.920
 game of pokÃ©mon ruby or mega and sapphire 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.290
 alpha there will be some small part where 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.129
 we can travel to the past as well 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.430
 say it 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.740
 a small cave of some small island 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.220
 something that can guide us to another 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.659
 different place from the region of young and 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.579
 well that's what makes me say everything 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.700
 this you will wonder then good 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.799
 my theory a thousand hypotheses is based on what 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.799
 next first that nothing else exists 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.840
 will remember the first official trailer 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.420
 so to speak they did not show us a 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.840
 little story bringing it to live in 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.759
 I live so to speak in people 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.950
 pokemon ruby or mega and sapphire alpha the 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.420
 which came out just a few days ago 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.640
 inside this trailer we can see that 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.490
 there was a little Japanese child who 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.110
 directed to some cave and in this cave 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.149
 arrived at certain certain images 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.119
 inscriptions so to speak where 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.340
 we could see a glow done fell and see and 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.590
 we could see them in their natural habitat 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.140
 in its primal form so to speak 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.810
 when only they were just them 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.119
 two creating the sea and the good land 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.099
 because there was that little trailer there 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.079
 it follows obviously we made a little 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:08.179
 analysis in the channel in which 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.520
 shows these two pokemon fighting 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.080
 with each other obviously its primal form 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.730
 and obviously in this fight 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.370
 it would be that they are creating absolutely 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.930
 everything here is a first the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.410
 first thing I did not understand from a 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.660
 principle because it is that 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.340
 of good rather than because in 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.590
 where what was inside the story 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.800
 original inside an email filter like 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.480
 they have been raising nintendo meter 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.250
 to these two pokemon where that would have 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.350
 inside the story poke a couple of 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.480
 pokemon that are primal so to speak 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.120
 Well, really, nowhere is there 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.730
 no better thing indicates that we 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.470
 you can say that inside a remake 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.720
 original a complete remake like no 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.980
 they have been raising can give us the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.170
 possibility that any of these 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.850
 pokemon can come to have a way 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.590
 primary but in this trailer no 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.480
 But they are not shows I do not know if it's something 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.550
 purposely or simply been something for 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.040
 decorate the trailer and make it see a 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.360
 little bit more interesting the truth but 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.340
 after that here comes one of the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.680
 biggest beginnings that I have about the 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.530
 topic first of all here we can see 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.080
 A small map of the left on the map 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.600
 you can see that it is practically the same 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.090
 town town root absolutely 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.400
 all the same acropolis does not change 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.230
 absolutely nothing but nevertheless if 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.360
 they divert their eyes a little more towards 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.640
 above you can see in this little 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.740
 red box that I put that I really know 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.930
 that is very sorry but 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.640
 I do not have a pulse so good inside this 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.430
 pen of this little picture can see 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.280
 something different you can see that there is a 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.620
 small island that should not be a 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.660
 island that you can see that is completely 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.490
 black I do not know, it's just been 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.160
 something to decorate the map which does not 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.080
 I think because there is absolutely nothing 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.750
 more than change inside the map that is 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.490
 little black island I do not know if you what 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.290
 you can notice I think it's something pretty 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.730
 notorious in the truth that in fact 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.520
 I also commented when I was analyzing 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.980
 these images or something that stays with me 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.370
 head to make this island here though 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.100
 simply be a drawing on a tree 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.600
 I think they are called equally within 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.280
 these trees always come to put 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.080
 hidden things that can happen 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.310
 inside the game and you can see that in 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.980
 this little image that I am 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.260
 showing how I am commenting this 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.570
 small is the black one causes me a little 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.990
 conflict in the original game if I do not 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.550
 wrong this island should not appear and 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.920
 If this island is there, it means that there is 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.620
 something extra there and there is something that could 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.660
 take to another place well then now 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.660
 here we go to the next image which 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.760
 it also increases my 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.950
 suspicions here you can see a small 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.320
 image of this maximum the champion of this 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.420
 region can see that I was seeing a 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.270
 pair of images some hieroglyphics of 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.680
 grow a callus done and gere 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.960
 respectively these images are 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.690
 completely official nintendo 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.300
 these images are 100% real they are not 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.950
 face or nothing are images that will be 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.070
 inside the game and you can see that in 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.450
 these images would not fit inside the 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.580
 original game since this does not appear 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.340
 most likely these images where 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.520
 is seeing this maximum be within 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.470
 is isolated that there should not be a 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.390
 new island that could take us 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.240
 including somewhere where we could 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.370
 discover the primal stone of croydon and 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.100
 the decayed view to access us to 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.470
 this way primo genia so I think 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.240
 and my theory is my hypothesis is that 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.830
 within the game especially within 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.160
 this island that I just showed you 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.440
 something new will appear very likely 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.720
 It will be some trip in another time 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.360
 say it and they will send us to some time 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.979
 where he was just creating the world 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.050
 you will find that it will rain against grondona 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.599
 fighting and we will have to have the fight 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.479
 or something like that or just be 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:50.300
 an extra cave where we could 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.159
 find your primal stone really not 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.620
 I'm so sure the truth I think and 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:57.050
 I want it to be a small trip to 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.759
 another era that would be pretty good and 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.800
 another thing that makes me think that there will be 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.870
 different times or different things that 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.610
 do not correspond to the game is that already of 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.129
 beforehand we know that in this game 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.319
 there may be pokemon of both types 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:11.110
 fairy like the other pokemon of all 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.789
 generations so imagine yourself 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.129
 really the adam type and if you want 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.169
 they existed in third generation so 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.759
 where they got them and whoever 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.889
 have put all these things these 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:25.189
 little hidden kittens that have 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:27.469
 given they make me think that we're really going 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:29.240
 to be able to travel or go to other locations 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:31.639
 that really inside the original game 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.889
 within a full remake could not 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.569
 exist and well I do not know that they have 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.789
 seemed this little theory this 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:40.699
 small completely personal hypothesis 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:42.139
 obviously as I'm clarifying I do not know if 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:44.060
 and someone has ever commented 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.870
 or have not said but really I do not know 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.270
 the view to anyone 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.310
 that comes like this and suddenly 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.230
 I hope you liked it, you know that in 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.640
 the description best said in the 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.410
 comments have to comment 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.840
 whatever they are with me are in my 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.400
 against they have some opinion a bit 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.140
 different I do not know anything this 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.450
 leave it in the comments that I will be 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.950
 quite proud to read them but good 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.990
 it will be all for this moment we will see you 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.490
 until next time please do not forget 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.950
 support us with a like in this video and 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.020
 that really help a lot to 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:15.910
 channel would be all for this moment we 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.910
 we see until the next and goodbye
