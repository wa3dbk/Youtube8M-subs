00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
scoop and a half of this protein here

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.480 
scoop and a half of this protein here
most<00:01:36.480> of<00:01:36.570> cage<00:01:36.750> nutrition<00:01:37.230> this<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> flavor

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
to make sure that i got my fiber intake

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.220 
to make sure that i got my fiber intake
exactly<00:05:46.330> where<00:05:46.450> it<00:05:46.510> needs<00:05:46.540> to<00:05:46.660> be<00:05:46.720> so<00:05:46.930> now<00:05:47.080> i'm

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
exactly where it needs to be so now i'm

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.070 
exactly where it needs to be so now i'm
currently<00:05:47.470> at<00:05:47.740> 30<00:05:48.610> grams<00:05:48.880> exactly<00:05:49.540> so<00:05:49.780> that

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
currently at 30 grams exactly so that

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.960 
currently at 30 grams exactly so that
put<00:05:50.260> me<00:05:50.380> up<00:05:50.500> to<00:05:50.530> where<00:05:50.860> I<00:05:50.890> need<00:05:51.100> to<00:05:51.130> be<00:05:51.220> 250

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
rest of the day so again that makes the

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.920 
rest of the day so again that makes the
fourth<00:06:09.280> meal<00:06:09.520> for<00:06:09.850> today<00:06:10.090> so<00:06:10.150> I<00:06:10.360> mean<00:06:10.600> my<00:06:10.750> last

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:14.920
