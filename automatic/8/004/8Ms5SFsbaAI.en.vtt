00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.059
 alex we recorded with another video of this 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.090
 I'll be making it available through the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.390
 designers accompanying the channel in pec 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.920
 lava texture exactly the one that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.070
 I used it last time I liked the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.770
 felicity that is the texture of there you go 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.570
 extract the files are here to O 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.550
 you will need to do is open and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.909
 tighten on pec will open at the cinema 4 gave 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.890
 r 13 It's all you do not need to do 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.760
 nothing just animation 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.219
 if you want or not to render or be it 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.789
 it is very cool 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.679
 if you want to have a boleto looks that is 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.960
 the most important of which is the plan and 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:03.899
 paid I will not leave the institution anything 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:09.200
 My technique is very cool and it will 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:12.329
 makes available all six and I go back and 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.130
 leaving a direct link in the description 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.229
 you just press there it will start to 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.000
 download automatically 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.729
 It's very cool and if you download and give a 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.579
 liquid is not very helpful. 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.920
 I think it's going to be very cool this 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.869
 idea that I had to be 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.500
 making it available because today 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.229
 youtube is very difficult, I think I'll give it 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.350
 a hero for you to see and put in the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:50.640
 pocket never bag it here in jotapeg 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:55.920
 only here as video save i work 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:02:00.310
 You understand me very quickly. 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.159
 no not forgetting that this pec is free 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:08.709
 You do not have to pay anything, I'll open it. 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:11.230
 what a medical planet looks about me to 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.340
 image I just saved from work 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.560
 which can veto indemnifying has many 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.780
 effects of time that you make your 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.540
 Hindus comment on what you think of this 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.910
 idea is important by polemizing others 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.370
 pected to do or teaching to do the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.850
 texture you customize your 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.280
 texture or this fall time doing 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.280
 often legal 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.340
 few people post this kind of video 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.709
 on youtube making the pecs available 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.220
 lava that is a very long time thing 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:51.610
 To get today, I'll leave you, I'm alone. 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.470
 You simply open here, there are others. 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.590
 very cool effects 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.570
 So I think the video was that right. 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.700
 There's nothing more to talk about than just extracting 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.450
 open and edit 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.100
 how can you see here that you 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.940
 put another texture that has a lot 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:17.079
 that you come here apply in the material 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:21.340
 of a range and the coast up to another 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:26.519
 ready after you put comes 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:34.870
 down here projection and puts the club 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:37.329
 now gives a beneficial time leader to 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.280

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.519

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.799

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:49.180
 favor 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:51.340
 both the crew and the video and comment 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:57.180

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.180
