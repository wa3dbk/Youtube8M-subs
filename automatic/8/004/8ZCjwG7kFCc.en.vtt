00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.580

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:18.039
 to a character to a person entered into 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.349
 years and that has something very interesting 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.999
 to tell you from the 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.999
 canfranc plaza plaza 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:39.620
 we know that blasa knew the videos 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:42.850
 how was it that they knew Japan the 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.850
 centripetal relationship 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.650
 if the hens that enter by 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.620
 those that come out 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.620
 what they already have was a test with t 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.820
 he was good the beatles 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.250
 he met the beatles 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.880
 so then yes before and now yes 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.000
 this 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.920
 the best thing is that before and maybe it is 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.920
 that before yes and now not 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.549
 this I think you start to know 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.110
 to the beatles right in the 60s 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.450
 when the videos go to india but 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.360
 that are going to india that are going those 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.899
 they are liars of people lie do not know 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.840
 they go to india they come to the cafre to me 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.939
 town there and that's where they stay 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.299
 in the garden they have about five months 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:54.380
 there it is loading and tearing swirls 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:59.030
 and then that's when they make up the album 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.340
 Sergeant Pepper white and good what 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.490
 yes it is something that is the theme that today we 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.959
 occupy is that you say that the myths 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.959
 they copied songs of his 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.280
 had to say in its proper term 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.280
 I did not say anything I said something not 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.260
 you can say you can not say it 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.409
 can you think if I do not explain myself 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.210
 because he copied the exact one for the craving 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:34.150
 broken by the craving 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.450
 in the anxiety the craving because paul 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.500
 McCartney did not have enough everything for me 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.450
 and one day I took it there the cupboard I took it 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.200
 putting his hand to clear chorizos him 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.210
 I liked the killing a lot if we were 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.460
 no charito I know that he had taken the 9 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.260
 to 10 sausages in a bag that I say for 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.260
 what an old man 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.750
 If they are going to make you feel bad and that's why 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.300
 once in full tour that I do not know by 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.560
 what worked so much Paul McCartney did 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.090
 the mister and the magic tour and nobody from 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.069
 his colleagues told him not that we have already 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.189
 worked hard not to come back for more 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.989
 the value here is something else and it's the 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:21.409
 judgment that you had with yoko ono 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:25.670
 because he said that yoko ono was not 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:29.409
 Japanese yoko ono that will be Japanese 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.409
 era of albacete operas 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.090
 We stop go to what is the subject of 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.489
 the songs for example names of 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.060
 songs I have here that says that the 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:45.200
 obladi oblada song laxi the song 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.599
 double silver video that I copied that 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.390
 they know that they copied me speak 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.610
 and they talk like I did not know Spanish 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.819
 they understood something of what I was saying 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.100
 my husband is not speaking or speaking is 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:02.220
 I speak habit 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.300
 the shirt that I put on the chair and 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.040
 life there 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.890
 we run out of time the direct the 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.880
 television and I think you are coming 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.880
 accompanied by a document 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.440
 It reflects very well the video that I recorded 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.680
 of the spoken life 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.100
 the true version in video 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.100
 beautiful 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.729
 my deceased I have not seen again 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:39.330
 man more tired and belongs 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:42.439
 with an action shirt with an average 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:48.180
 until I did not iron it I did not have bread 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:52.560
 I saw her tested in a chair 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.980
 the iron applies to you and when the 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.200
 also in the chair 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.200
 the meat lec to the cinema 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:09.900
 being all his thread told me is still 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:13.930
 wrinkled if it is to twist the 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.680
 stretcher and you had to leave in 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.680
 tortilla 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:25.600
 with your hand 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:33.070
 red hot ironed and he was bent 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:38.010
 with the stain marked as a network that 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.010
 just tyler silver side
