00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.319
 what should I ask myself the question 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.509
 what is a knife I since what must be a 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.910
 can knife 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.559
 it has to be able to cut and everything 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.559
 others are another bonus 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.220
 what I care about in a survival 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.529
 a knife should be a survival knife for 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.399
 me personally always an extension 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.290
 be my hand 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.610
 and so should feel like too 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.550
 I pick up my hand if I already 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.399
 alone attack and it feels 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.290
 it has something weird for me 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.480
 at least that feeling and transmits 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.280
 feel the security and 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.960
 limits me then already by my 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.940
 fearfulness in many things I do 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.670
 Maybe many people could do it 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.760
 would say now that the raptor is theirs 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.020
 is too heavy with its 3 131 grams mag 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.710
 for one or the other something 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.570
 be on it 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.059
 but for me it has the advantage of me 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.340
 this is mine in my own weight 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.600
 memory effect of the muscles plays that 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.460
 means for me I am a bit 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.830
 used to be a bit bigger 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.330
 I also do coarser things and me 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.080
 just need a bit of steam and 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.360
 weight behind it as soon as possible 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.350
 my goal to come whether something 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.930
 cut through 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.509
 to carve that or something similar for everyone 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.180
 which I like for the specific 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.490
 Exact details actually not that way 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.710
 very interesting speak how is that 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.100
 exact consistency is everything that is there 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.810
 just how is it how it is for 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.049
 me is just important that is little 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.850
 use it clear it works 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.310
 There are certain differences whether it is more 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.890
 carbon in it or less 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.079
 the difference if I suggest it 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.880
 if I can starter of magnesium fire 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.220
 to ignite such 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.799
 stories or how stable the knife 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.719
 Surface is a little bit of work 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.060
 always meaning this knife has one 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.060
 Curing 58 hotmail and consists of 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.759
 so-called beads instead of steel has the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.190
 Advantage that it is even in salt water 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.810
 does not start to rust and so can 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.350
 her the knife around the world always 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.050
 bring to use 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.780
 without us taking a great care of that 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.000
 Steel must bring along differently 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.550
 You always set rusty ones 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.030
 a little bit of oil needs a bit of it 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.280
 It has to respect the whole thing 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.020
 Durable remains that raptor though it does 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.180
 overall very big very cheap 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.700
 it still looks like one 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.660
 So blade length to reach our 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.060
 tip only 11.5 cm and is therefore for the 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.280
 German market wonderfully suited to the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.900
 reminding shape of the entire knife 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.750
 somehow to a pay of one 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.380
 dinosaurs and so is the whole thing 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.840
 thought the knife has a yes one here 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.420
 finger the here a kind guard 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.780
 forms and when the knife in the 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.240
 Hand puts it around and it just 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.420
 just lets loose it slips one 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.610
 really right in the hand and comes like that 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.410
 in the perfect holding position for the 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.590
 knife the knife is ideal 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.410
 balanced and the total weight of 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.930
 3,131 grams fall like that when you put it 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.040
 really does not stop at it anymore 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.350
 that it's beautiful on the left and right 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.470
 Balanced is the wonderful 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.680
 Lead and clean the knife 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.040
 will be delivered with a small one 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.230
 patients on it 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.160
 which is wonderfully suited to the 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.530
 to introduce little finger behind 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.850
 grab behind and achieved with the 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.700
 chopping wood for example one 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.380
 incredible that just that 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.470
 addressed casual or the small one 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.580
 make axles superfluous 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.950
 In addition, the knife comes in one 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.450
 kalex sheath big back with a 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:56.090
 big techno on the back 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:58.550
 the secured against this is the 27 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.180
 squeezing and then the whole thing 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.510
 open 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.570
 here you have the possibility of the size 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.200
 the gap for the belt loop 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.950
 adjust 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.410
 just by putting these little ones here 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.390
 plug off and then adjust it here 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.700
 on his belt around the whole then 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.500
 stable to fix that he is not around 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.320
 flatten rom works even if one 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.660
 a little bit on the way is who that 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.610
 whole after when the knife is in it 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.039
 on the belt 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.210
 Hanging too deep can be natural here 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.550
 at any time by the 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.319
 adjustment I the gaps 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.120
 you just have a kalex 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.099
 extension so a small plate on it 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.990
 Glock Munchen said above 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.409
 start and that would be the problem 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.520
 solved and everything works wonderfully 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:49.270
 also attached back there is the hammer 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.009
 so integrated into the mold with that no matter 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.240
 how you hold the master up or you 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:56.669
 around and start to hit something 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.860
 to collect something 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.710
 that you are always out of the 90 degrees 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.270
 meet wonderful angles with your hand 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.180
 can you work you can do it here 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.759
 not big in the wrist anyway 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.919
 start with something else or something similar 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.229
 Over work then only problems 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.819
 In the country lived the wrist can give 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.419
 and then just hurts 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:21.430
 and here it is really nicely adjusted 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.129
 by the form that I always exactly 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.289
 with 90 degrees down you can see that 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:28.150
 the processing of the knife very much 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.389
 High quality is just endl Jordan 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.089
 really done a great job 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:36.509
 it's not just wonderful in the 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:40.089
 application but also to look at 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:43.270
 that the steel has a strength of 5 7 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:45.849
 millimeter and of course, too 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.909
 a huge gap effect and one 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:51.129
 extreme longevity because of longevity 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.029
 to get that broken there you have 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:53.080
 then I believe a real one 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.120
 knight's cross order 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.419
 I'm going to you from another raptor 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.610
 you can see some pictures from close by and 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.250
 still refers to the facebook page 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.199
 Germany's sometimes magazine or 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.009
 the survival book spox like me too 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.439
 like to call
