craft and I'm going to show you how to
take<00:00:14.710> a<00:00:15.009> bucket<00:00:15.969> plug-in<00:00:16.509> that<00:00:16.720> you<00:00:16.779> of<00:00:17.290> your

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
take a bucket plug-in that you of your

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.580 
take a bucket plug-in that you of your
choice<00:00:17.710> and<00:00:18.630> decompile<00:00:19.630> it<00:00:19.840> basically<00:00:20.230> take

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
choice and decompile it basically take

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.920 
choice and decompile it basically take
the<00:00:20.739> code<00:00:20.950> put<00:00:21.309> it<00:00:21.430> into<00:00:21.730> eclipse<00:00:22.300> change<00:00:22.779> it

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
the code put it into eclipse change it

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.769 
the code put it into eclipse change it
around<00:00:23.110> to<00:00:23.259> make<00:00:23.290> your<00:00:23.529> own<00:00:23.680> plug-in<00:00:24.779> you'll

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
around to make your own plug-in you'll

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.380 
around to make your own plug-in you'll
need<00:00:26.140> just<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.829> basics<00:00:27.520> of<00:00:27.669> java<00:00:28.000> to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
need just the basics of java to

need just the basics of java to
decompile<00:00:29.200> you<00:00:29.739> need<00:00:29.919> JT<00:00:30.340> GUI<00:00:30.880> eclipse<00:00:31.570> and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
decompile you need JT GUI eclipse and

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.910 
decompile you need JT GUI eclipse and
the<00:00:32.169> bucket<00:00:32.770> plug-in<00:00:33.100> of<00:00:33.190> your<00:00:33.309> choice<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
the bucket plug-in of your choice the

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.410 
the bucket plug-in of your choice the
first<00:00:36.309> thing<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:36.580> need<00:00:36.700> to<00:00:36.760> do<00:00:37.000> is<00:00:37.120> create<00:00:37.300> a

a PvP and it's only made up of one class
which<00:01:31.270> holds<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:32.079> code<00:01:32.350> that<00:01:32.679> makes<00:01:32.889> the<00:01:33.039> plug

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
which holds the code that makes the plug

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:37.230 
which holds the code that makes the plug
and<00:01:33.429> do<00:01:33.549> what<00:01:33.670> it's<00:01:33.819> supposed<00:01:34.149> to<00:01:34.240> do<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:36.240> you

can edit it primarily in here so you but
you<00:01:41.200> can<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:42.520> just<00:01:42.909> drag<00:01:43.859> your<00:01:44.859> mouse<00:01:44.920> all

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
you can like just drag your mouse all

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.269 
you can like just drag your mouse all
the<00:01:45.520> way<00:01:45.579> to<00:01:45.639> the<00:01:45.759> bottom<00:01:47.189> highlighting<00:01:48.189> the

the way to the bottom highlighting the

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:51.749 
the way to the bottom highlighting the
code<00:01:48.459> as<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:48.819> go<00:01:48.939> down<00:01:50.249> once<00:01:51.249> you<00:01:51.340> reach<00:01:51.520> the

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
code as you go down once you reach the

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.099 
code as you go down once you reach the
bottom<00:01:51.939> you<00:01:52.659> can<00:01:53.520> copy<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.700> going<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.779> eclipse

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
bottom you can copy it going to eclipse

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:03.179 
bottom you can copy it going to eclipse
and<00:01:56.619> make<00:01:57.249> a<00:01:57.279> new<00:01:57.520> package<00:01:58.029> called<00:01:58.420> me<00:01:59.409> dot<00:02:02.189> you

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
and make a new package called me dot you

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.430 
and make a new package called me dot you
to<00:02:03.569> touch<00:02:04.569> loam<00:02:05.549> enter<00:02:06.779> you<00:02:07.779> can<00:02:07.810> add<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.050> class

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
to touch loam enter you can add a class

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.089 
to touch loam enter you can add a class
and<00:02:08.950> call<00:02:09.490> it<00:02:09.700> main<00:02:09.940> just<00:02:10.479> like<00:02:10.660> they<00:02:10.929> did<00:02:11.170> with

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
and call it main just like they did with

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.729 
and call it main just like they did with
their<00:02:12.310> plugins<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.329> then<00:02:13.629> just<00:02:13.900> ctrl<00:02:14.290> V<00:02:14.560> the

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
their plugins and then just ctrl V the

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.580 
their plugins and then just ctrl V the
code<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.069> there<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:16.120> are<00:02:16.150> going<00:02:16.659> to<00:02:16.900> get<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.349> lot

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
code in there you are going to get a lot

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.470 
code in there you are going to get a lot
of<00:02:17.799> errors

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
of errors

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.960 
of errors
but<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:21.370> just<00:02:21.580> rename<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:23.970> change

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
but you just rename this to change

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.690

not right to do if you do make your own
like<00:05:01.119> if<00:05:01.300> you're<00:05:01.479> using<00:05:01.509> this<00:05:02.169> you<00:05:02.379> should

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
then that's pretty much it so I have a

then that's pretty much it so I have a
good<00:05:10.569> one
