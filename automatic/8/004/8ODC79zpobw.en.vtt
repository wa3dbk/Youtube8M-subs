00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
set of wheels so these were originally

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.660 
set of wheels so these were originally
quite<00:01:29.900> scraped<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.170> they've<00:01:31.740> been<00:01:31.920> smashed<00:01:32.460> up

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
an accident so now we've got our base

down<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:41.600> on<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.960> settings<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.770> gun<00:01:44.100> I've

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
down of on the settings on this gun I've

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.810 
down of on the settings on this gun I've
found<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.689> fluid<00:01:46.170> into<00:01:46.649> about<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.729> a

just<00:02:00.509> real<00:02:00.840> slightly<00:02:01.790> another<00:02:02.790> good<00:02:03.060> tip<00:02:03.329> when

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
just real slightly another good tip when

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.959 
just real slightly another good tip when
doing<00:02:04.049> wheels<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.799> with<00:02:05.340> many<00:02:05.490> spikes

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
doing wheels like this with many spikes

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.650 
doing wheels like this with many spikes
in<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.950> being<00:02:07.950> there<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.340> prone<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.239> running

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
in it being there so prone to running

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.720 
in it being there so prone to running
because<00:02:10.200> you're<00:02:10.379> trying<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.679> get<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.099> spray<00:02:11.700> gun

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
because you're trying to get a spray gun

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.610 
because you're trying to get a spray gun
it<00:02:12.629> sprays<00:02:12.930> straight

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
it sprays straight

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.550 
it sprays straight
into<00:02:14.190> those<00:02:14.340> all<00:02:14.700> those<00:02:14.879> different<00:02:15.360> angles<00:02:15.560> a

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
into those all those different angles a

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.970 
into those all those different angles a
good<00:02:16.980> trick<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.550> thin<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.720> Claire<00:02:19.650> out<00:02:19.769> a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
good trick is to thin the Claire out a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.910 
good trick is to thin the Claire out a
little<00:02:20.190> bit<00:02:20.340> more<00:02:20.519> than<00:02:20.700> usual<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.920> they

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
little bit more than usual so they

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.880 
little bit more than usual so they
recommend<00:02:23.550> usually<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.510> go<00:02:24.900> ten<00:02:25.170> percent<00:02:25.590> but

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
recommend usually you go ten percent but

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.009 
recommend usually you go ten percent but
when<00:02:26.340> doing<00:02:26.580> meals<00:02:26.849> I'll<00:02:27.300> probably<00:02:27.750> go<00:02:27.959> to

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
when doing meals I'll probably go to

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.390 
when doing meals I'll probably go to
about<00:02:28.349> 15<00:02:28.860> percent<00:02:29.069> reducer<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:31.010> use<00:02:32.010> fast

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
about 15 percent reducer and use fast

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.180 
about 15 percent reducer and use fast
hard<00:02:32.760> enough<00:02:33.060> ice<00:02:33.450> producer<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.500> there's

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
hard enough ice producer and there's

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.330 
hard enough ice producer and there's
also<00:02:35.340> some<00:02:35.940> products<00:02:36.569> on<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> market<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:38.220> one

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
also some products on the market the one

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.820 
also some products on the market the one
that<00:02:38.400> we<00:02:38.640> use<00:02:38.879> is<00:02:39.330> called<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:40.349> just<00:02:40.500> buy<00:02:40.769> to

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
that we use is called you just buy to

that we use is called you just buy to
you<00:02:41.280> for<00:02:41.610> brand<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.420> polled<00:02:42.720> brand<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.440> it's

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
you for brand you polled brand and it's

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.059 
you for brand you polled brand and it's
called<00:02:44.730> paint<00:02:45.090> rocket<00:02:45.630> if<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.650> start<00:02:46.950> to

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
called paint rocket if you start to

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.039 
called paint rocket if you start to
paint<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.370> lot<00:02:47.549> of<00:02:47.670> wheels<00:02:47.849> that<00:02:48.090> are<00:02:48.450> they're<00:02:48.720> a

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
paint a lot of wheels that are they're a

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.039 
paint a lot of wheels that are they're a
great<00:02:49.709> thing<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.190> buy<00:02:51.090> because<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.840> just

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
great thing to buy because it just

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.640 
great thing to buy because it just
speeds<00:02:52.709> up<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.510> drying<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.870> paint

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
speeds up the drying of the paint

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.350 
speeds up the drying of the paint
basically<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.400> do<00:02:56.549> anything<00:02:56.849> you<00:02:57.120> can<00:02:57.329> to

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
basically you do anything you can to

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.270 
basically you do anything you can to
speed<00:02:57.840> up<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.079> drying<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.620> paint<00:02:58.890> because

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
speed up the drying of the paint because

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.020 
speed up the drying of the paint because
I'm<00:02:59.579> less<00:03:00.420> prone<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.750> running<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:02.000> close<00:03:03.000> that

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
I'm less prone to running and close that

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.650 
I'm less prone to running and close that
up<00:03:03.629> a<00:03:03.660> little<00:03:03.870> bit<00:03:04.019> on<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> gun<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.660> you

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
up a little bit on the gun and you

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.880 
up a little bit on the gun and you
really<00:03:06.989> also<00:03:07.170> don't<00:03:07.799> want<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.390> overload<00:03:09.890> terms

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
really also don't want to overload terms

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.920 
really also don't want to overload terms
you<00:03:11.040> don't<00:03:11.069> too<00:03:11.459> much<00:03:11.489> material<00:03:11.970> on<00:03:12.599> wheels

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
you don't too much material on wheels

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.420 
you don't too much material on wheels
that's<00:03:13.290> another<00:03:13.560> reason<00:03:13.980> why<00:03:14.099> you<00:03:14.129> want<00:03:14.370> to

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
that's another reason why you want to

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.309 
that's another reason why you want to
spin<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.640> out<00:03:14.849> of<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.150> too

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
spin it out of it too

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.300 
spin it out of it too
you're<00:03:17.250> not<00:03:17.370> going<00:03:17.819> for<00:03:18.329> dead<00:03:19.230> flat<00:03:19.560> finish<00:03:20.010> on

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
you're not going for dead flat finish on

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.280 
you're not going for dead flat finish on
a<00:03:20.370> set<00:03:20.639> of<00:03:20.670> wheels<00:03:20.880> just<00:03:21.420> need<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:22.170> get

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
a set of wheels just need to just get

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.740 
a set of wheels just need to just get
the<00:03:22.380> pain<00:03:22.590> I'll<00:03:22.799> just<00:03:23.010> get<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.190> clear<00:03:23.519> run<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.940> I

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
the pain I'll just get a clear run and I

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.280 
the pain I'll just get a clear run and I
still<00:03:25.139> put<00:03:25.350> two<00:03:25.500> coats<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.359> but<00:03:27.359> you're<00:03:28.170> not

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
still put two coats on but you're not

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.830 
still put two coats on but you're not
really<00:03:28.530> going<00:03:28.859> for<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.370> stick<00:03:29.880> pick<00:03:30.599> wet

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
really going for the stick pick wet

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.020 
really going for the stick pick wet
finish<00:03:31.260> on<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.500> set<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.769> wheels<00:03:31.950> because<00:03:32.579> um

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
finish on the set of wheels because um

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.699 
finish on the set of wheels because um
once<00:03:33.389> they<00:03:33.599> if<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.230> end<00:03:34.349> up<00:03:34.500> getting

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
once they if you end up getting

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.680 
once they if you end up getting
scratches<00:03:35.160> which<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.639> usually<00:03:36.060> do<00:03:36.269> you're

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
scratches which I usually do you're

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.479 
scratches which I usually do you're
always<00:03:36.810> going<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:37.170> get<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.349> scratch<00:03:37.650> it's<00:03:38.340> got

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
always going to get a scratch it's got

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.289 
always going to get a scratch it's got
to<00:03:38.609> start<00:03:39.150> flaking<00:03:39.510> off<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.200> big<00:03:40.760> big<00:03:41.760> sections

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
to start flaking off in big big sections

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.140 
to start flaking off in big big sections
if<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.599> do<00:03:42.780> put<00:03:43.019> too<00:03:43.230> much<00:03:43.380> material<00:03:43.590> on<00:03:44.130> that

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.440 

what<00:03:48.150> else<00:03:48.299> can<00:03:48.599> we<00:03:48.720> cover<00:03:50.030> yeah<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.299> we'll

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
what else can we cover yeah so we'll

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.520 
what else can we cover yeah so we'll
basically<00:03:51.739> always<00:03:53.180> just<00:03:54.180> do<00:03:54.359> one<00:03:54.720> side<00:03:55.079> of

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
basically always just do one side of

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.190 
basically always just do one side of
these<00:03:55.859> vents<00:03:56.310> right<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.269> then<00:03:57.630> you'll<00:03:57.810> turn

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
these vents right and then you'll turn

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.009 
these vents right and then you'll turn
back<00:03:58.470> around<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:59.069> then<00:03:59.340> do<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.419> other<00:04:00.450> side

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
back around and then do the other side

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.699 
back around and then do the other side
as<00:04:01.260> events<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:01.889> walking<00:04:02.430> around<00:04:02.549> in<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.269> circle

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
as events and walking around in a circle

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.309 
as events and walking around in a circle
a<00:04:04.709> good<00:04:05.220> way<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.940> not<00:04:06.690> get<00:04:06.959> lost

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
a good way to not get lost

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.259 
a good way to not get lost
you<00:04:08.469> got<00:04:08.650> any<00:04:08.890> circles<00:04:09.400> look<00:04:09.609> away<00:04:09.819> not<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.150> get
