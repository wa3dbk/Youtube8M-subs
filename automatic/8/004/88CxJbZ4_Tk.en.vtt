00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.370
 happy saturday today for this afternoon 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.430
 for your snack of yours 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.510
 children or for pleasure to eat a 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:19.320
 sweet in the company of friends 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:22.360
 we are going to prepare my age for milk 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.090
 for the slow hurry we will need 4 eggs 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:31.390
 whole 60 g of flour 10 grams of honey 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.360
 about an abundant teaspoon 80 g of 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.559
 sugar a touch of vanillin a 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.420
 spoon of water 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.989
 this for the biscuit 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.050
 we will need two sheets for the filling 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:51.149
 of isinglass a spoonful of honey 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:56.350
 still we will need condensed milk e 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.929
 250 of ml of cream no. 350 of 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.920
 liquid cream let's go to prepare 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.659
 let's put in a bowl 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.659
 our willingly capacious 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.130
 4 whole eggs we also put the Swiss 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:21.680
 granulated sugar and begin to whisk 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.010
 with the stars 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.460
 let's add 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.460
 tomorrow 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.520
 the spoon of honey eggs with lo 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.520
 sugar 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.620
 front 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.620
 and let's also add 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.930
 at this point for me 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.930
 we will go to mount 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.650
 Only now 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.370
 aiming 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.730
 the thieves budget the 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.730
 the bowl 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.220
 obviously for those who had a 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.470
 planetary or a robot to assemble 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.319
 you wanted your eggs you can help 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.750
 surely this is the result 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.860
 the eggs must be mounted so and 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.600
 I assure you that they are mounted 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.510
 quietly with electric whips 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.910
 by hand at this point we go to put 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.280
 in twice or in three times the mad 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.739
 because if we go to dust the flour 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.580
 goes to deflate the air bubbles that 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:40.670
 they were formed by mounting the place 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.120
 ok or better to admit twice 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.330
 ok and mix very gently 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.910
 gently our compound this 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.739
 it is the flour we finish incorporating it into the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.280
 meanwhile you will have prepared yours 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:58.640
 oven tray with paper coated 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:04.130
 oven and you will have started to heat the 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:07.100
 200 degree oven is static ok then 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.100
 we incorporate the flour well and go 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.810
 then to 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.380
 place it on the oven paper we are 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:20.600
 putting our our compound 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:26.000
 on the baking paper you can anyway 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:29.990
 put in the mixture instead of 60 g 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.020
 of flour you can put 35 grams of 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.860
 flour and 25 grams of cocoa powder 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:42.830
 I did n't put up because we like it 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:45.950
 more clearly, however, yes 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.060
 they can make this change 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.690
 let's spread the dough well with 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.690
 delicacy 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.800
 ok 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.830
 this then will go once cooked divided 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:08.880
 in two so that it will be a layer the 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.940
 Part below is shown the upper part 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.010
 of our milk slice 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.079
 we try to level it in the best way 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.010
 possible and work as little as possible 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.209
 but to bake at 200 degrees static for 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.370
 7 8 minutes 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.040
 be careful you don't have to find out a 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.640
 this point while our biscuit st 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.770
 paul's we prepare our filling 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.010
 with our cream we put the glue of 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.510
 fish soaked in cold water 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.260
 here are two sheets of isinglass in 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.200
 soak in cold water 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:46.220
 let's take 50 g of cream and go to 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.310
 heat it in the microwave 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:53.190
 look forward to our condensed milk 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.400
 not everything had to put 180 grams 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.110
 200 of condensed milk I 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.270
 I also put 250 because at my home the 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.100
 condensed milk really like it anyway 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.310
 then you will find all the ingredients 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.650
 precisely written 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.940
 at the bottom then we go to put the 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.360
 condensed milk the honey we will succeed 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.090
 to make him go down on his own pull up one 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.690
 isinglass the wring well and 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.750
 go and melt it in hot cream 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.940
 always check the oven 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.950
 your cookie does not go to burn 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.110
 and I recommend a thing check 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.320
 always yours the cooking because not 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.570
 all ovens are the same so if in the 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.750
 my form takes 7 8 minutes maybe 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.850
 in yours it takes six or ten 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:47.460
 ok so i give you the directions i give you 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:51.990
 they are always quite approximate 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:55.710
 so now let's go to put the non 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:58.560
 the other cream in condensed milk where 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:03.750
 we have already put honey in wait 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:06.140
 a pin of vanillin and while the 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.430
 electric whips work 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.409
 let's incorporate 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.800
 the first that the schalke 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:13.800
 isinglass 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.120
 we have to 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:24.490
 mix 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.490
 or deadly for at least 5 6 minutes 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:30.620
 this is our dr biscuit 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.600
 this color will now have to hurry 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.900
 boasted we go to put in 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.820
 refrigerator for at least 45 minutes an hour 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.770
 in the meantime the biscuit will be 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.360
 cooled and we go to compose the 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.960
 our past our past ours 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:49.100
 biscuit we are going to cut the edges into 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.490
 so that it appears paro then we will remove it 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.490
 in half 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.490
 is 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.440
 gently move it to a 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:08.170
 tray ok our cream over the cream 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.170
 above the sponge cake 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.370
 then before covering it or putting it in 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.370
 refrigerator for at least a couple of hours 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:24.150
 we are going to cover the remaining part ok 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:25.449
 privately we go 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:29.199
 level 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:33.249
 the edges with the cream if necessary 

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:36.089
 we can cut it just right 

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:36.089
 to equalize it 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:45.389
 in many delicate we put to rest in 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.100
 refrigerator better to prepare them daily 

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:48.780
 first for the next day because this is it 

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:52.220
