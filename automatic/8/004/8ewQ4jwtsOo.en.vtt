00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:04.599
 we see an Audi a8 SVO grief fifth borrowed here 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.830
 and the special thing about these vehicles is that it adds water as an additive and 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.309
 fuels 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.309
 when I open the proform flap now 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:20.249
 is on the left side 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.069
 behind the cover 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:25.789
 an electrolysis cell 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.769
 This electrolysis cell produces hydrogen 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.070
 under the moto outperform hoses is supplied 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.180
 this cell worked 3 asked in the test what have and has a power consumption of 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.250
 5 on the 4th 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.150
 right there is a water tank 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.120
 um for the corresponding 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.140
 To provide water 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.010
 With a liter of water driving this car pulled were 5000 kilometers 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.760
 It will save fuel by optimizing the tracking of 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.230
 even reached 30 percent 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.400
 The cell does not start working until I stare at the pilot 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.020
 what I do now 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.370
 we see 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.110
 the water turns milky 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.980
 Here is now decomposed water into its constituents that is 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.580
 Hydrogen and oxygen 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.230
 we see is our im 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.090
 Cell with 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.000
 Water level sensor 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.970
 an electronics 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.970
 as well as the corresponding with methods 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.130
 lead the electronics so 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.970
 the optimal 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 to do optimal business of drug trafficking 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.400
 a total of 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.700
 but the edition is maintenance-free 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.700
 that's enough 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.089
 Here we can now look at the exhaust behavior 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:53.209
 we will see 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.319
 we are nothing 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.909
 this means 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.229
 if I stick to a stick now white paper 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:03.609
 stop at the exhaust 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.609
 that would normally be sparrow 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.059
 nothing happened 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:23.809
 the Co Bertele refer to zero point zero so carbon monoxide comes nothing 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.279
 more out 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.979
 the stock will 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.929
 that is all other toxic exhaust gases refer to the workroom 0 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.609
 Co2 emissions are reduced 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.189
 in the relationship as the strength athlete fabric saving is present 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.429
 that is to say 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:45.169
 30 percent 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.169
 so Kober Hallwag also presses some gas 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:51.469
 even at 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:53.719
 Buren speed 1 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.719
 nothing should happen 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.659
 Goalie summer 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.120
 absolute 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.120
 a US but i outed 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:31.599
 so try it now because the cell has to stop working when 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.080
 or modest 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.080
 over 70 percent 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.949
 exactly for security reasons 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.949
 There she will now produce one more hydrogen 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.340
 With this electronic cell, everyone can change 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.319
 and to reduce its fuel consumption accordingly 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.270
 You can see more information on our website at 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.800
 www point 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.629
 as before 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.819
 Energy Point is therefore ahead of Queen Energy Hydro 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.889
 so everyone can see that it's red on the hand 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.080
 because now with the cell 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.069
 up soon 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:57.559
 there
