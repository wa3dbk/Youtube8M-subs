apple's supremacy for real the XPS 13

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.169 
apple's supremacy for real the XPS 13
actually<00:00:23.380> is<00:00:23.470> a<00:00:23.499> 13.3<00:00:24.279> inch<00:00:24.460> display<00:00:24.939> and

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:25.179 
actually is a 13.3 inch display and

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.720 
actually is a 13.3 inch display and
starts<00:00:25.720> at<00:00:25.810> only<00:00:26.310> $799<00:00:27.310> for<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.550> baseline

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
starts at only $799 for the baseline

solid state drive now Apple meanwhile

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.790 
solid state drive now Apple meanwhile
doesn't<00:00:36.460> even<00:00:36.550> have<00:00:36.850> a<00:00:37.170> $799<00:00:38.170> MacBook<00:00:38.590> Air

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
doesn't even have a $799 MacBook Air

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.130 
doesn't even have a $799 MacBook Air
option<00:00:39.280> not<00:00:39.670> even<00:00:39.910> in<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.120> 11<00:00:40.450> inch<00:00:40.570> category

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
option not even in the 11 inch category

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.170 
option not even in the 11 inch category
so<00:00:41.620> an<00:00:41.710> apples-to-apples<00:00:42.070> spec<00:00:42.670> comparison

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
so an apples-to-apples spec comparison

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.630 
so an apples-to-apples spec comparison
isn't<00:00:43.360> possible<00:00:43.900> here<00:00:44.350> plus<00:00:44.950> every<00:00:45.280> macbook

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
isn't possible here plus every macbook

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.060 
isn't possible here plus every macbook
air<00:00:45.760> does<00:00:45.940> include<00:00:46.210> a<00:00:46.300> core<00:00:46.540> i5<00:00:46.690> CPU<00:00:47.380> versus

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
air does include a core i5 CPU versus

air does include a core i5 CPU versus
the<00:00:48.190> core<00:00:48.400> i3<00:00:48.520> inside<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.240> baseline<00:00:49.420> XPS<00:00:50.140> 13

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
the core i3 inside the baseline XPS 13

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.830 
the core i3 inside the baseline XPS 13
so<00:00:51.400> with<00:00:51.520> that<00:00:51.610> said<00:00:51.850> in<00:00:52.210> this<00:00:52.390> video<00:00:52.540> I'm

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
so with that said in this video I'm

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
so with that said in this video I'm
actually<00:00:52.900> going<00:00:53.200> to<00:00:53.350> talk<00:00:53.560> more<00:00:53.800> about

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
actually going to talk more about

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.360 
actually going to talk more about
