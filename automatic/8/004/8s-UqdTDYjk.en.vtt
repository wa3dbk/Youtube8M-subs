00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
open my mouth for him and he couldn't

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.670 
open my mouth for him and he couldn't
look<00:02:00.180> around<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:00.780> today<00:02:01.110> they<00:02:01.320> looked<00:02:01.560> in

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
look around but today they looked in

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.179 
look around but today they looked in
there<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.310> they<00:02:02.969> realized<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.630> was<00:02:03.750> actually

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
there and they realized it was actually

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.910 
there and they realized it was actually
the<00:02:05.189> bracket<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.759> my<00:02:06.000> very<00:02:06.719> back<00:02:07.110> bottom<00:02:07.530> molar

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the bracket on my very back bottom molar

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.889 
the bracket on my very back bottom molar
was<00:02:08.489> one<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.819> them<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.090> had<00:02:09.239> fallen<00:02:09.420> off<00:02:09.690> and

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
was one of them that had fallen off and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.930 
was one of them that had fallen off and
so<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.110> wire<00:02:10.349> was<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.890> back<00:02:11.129> there<00:02:11.340> poking<00:02:11.760> me

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
so the wire was is back there poking me

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.640 
so the wire was is back there poking me
which<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.110> didn't

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
which I didn't

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.009 
which I didn't
this<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.099> it<00:02:14.310> might<00:02:14.819> be<00:02:15.030> because<00:02:15.360> my<00:02:15.510> cheek<00:02:15.810> is

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
this and it might be because my cheek is

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.899 
this and it might be because my cheek is
still<00:02:16.349> actually<00:02:16.829> a<00:02:16.860> little<00:02:17.099> numb<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.640> there

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
still actually a little numb in there

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.020 
still actually a little numb in there
but<00:02:18.659> either<00:02:19.170> way<00:02:19.409> they<00:02:19.650> clipped<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.730> wire

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
but either way they clipped that wire

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.110 
but either way they clipped that wire
and<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:22.170> don't<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.920> bracket<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.549> my<00:02:23.730> back

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
and so I don't have a bracket on my back

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.080 
and so I don't have a bracket on my back
tooth<00:02:24.360> but<00:02:24.659> it's<00:02:25.019> not<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> big<00:02:25.470> deal<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.010> then<00:02:26.819> I

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
tooth but it's not a big deal and then I

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.099 
tooth but it's not a big deal and then I
also<00:02:27.599> have<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.110> gap<00:02:28.379> right<00:02:28.829> here<00:02:29.930> but<00:02:30.930> they

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
also have this gap right here but they

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.599 
also have this gap right here but they
say<00:02:31.319> they're<00:02:31.530> not<00:02:31.709> really<00:02:31.859> gonna<00:02:32.069> start<00:02:32.430> on

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
say they're not really gonna start on

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.729 
say they're not really gonna start on
the<00:02:32.760> orthodontia<00:02:33.420> like<00:02:33.720> pulling<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.349> my<00:02:34.500> teeth

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
gap right here and I never stopped I

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.880 
gap right here and I never stopped I
mean<00:06:05.610> never<00:06:06.120> started<00:06:06.570> I<00:06:06.810> stopped<00:06:07.230> talking<00:06:07.410> and

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
mean never started I stopped talking and

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.030 
mean never started I stopped talking and
didn't<00:06:08.220> continue<00:06:08.370> about<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:08.910> gap<00:06:09.060> but<00:06:09.540> um

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
didn't continue about the gap but um

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.440 
didn't continue about the gap but um
this<00:06:11.040> gap<00:06:11.370> even<00:06:11.820> though<00:06:11.910> they<00:06:12.060> don't<00:06:12.180> want<00:06:12.390> to

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
this gap even though they don't want to

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:13.580 
this gap even though they don't want to
do<00:06:12.510> it<00:06:12.600> was<00:06:12.720> an<00:06:12.840> honor<00:06:12.990> to<00:06:13.050> work<00:06:13.140> on<00:06:13.410> it<00:06:13.560> right

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
do it was an honor to work on it right

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.590 
do it was an honor to work on it right
now<00:06:13.710> it<00:06:14.070> was<00:06:14.190> actually<00:06:14.610> kind<00:06:14.850> of<00:06:14.940> a<00:06:15.090> lifesaver

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
now it was actually kind of a lifesaver

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.110 
now it was actually kind of a lifesaver
during<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.800> two<00:06:17.010> weeks<00:06:17.220> of<00:06:17.400> the<00:06:17.520> liquid<00:06:17.910> diet

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
during the two weeks of the liquid diet

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.950 
during the two weeks of the liquid diet
because<00:06:18.780> it<00:06:19.520> was<00:06:20.520> really<00:06:20.850> hard<00:06:21.150> to<00:06:21.420> eat

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
because it was really hard to eat

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.180 
because it was really hard to eat
because<00:06:22.260> I<00:06:22.320> could<00:06:22.470> only<00:06:22.500> suck<00:06:22.920> the<00:06:23.040> liquid

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
because I could only suck the liquid

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.010 
because I could only suck the liquid
through<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.610> back<00:06:23.850> of<00:06:23.880> my<00:06:24.180> mouth<00:06:24.390> because<00:06:24.660> the

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
through the back of my mouth because the

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.590 
through the back of my mouth because the
splint<00:06:25.350> filled<00:06:26.280> the<00:06:26.520> cracks<00:06:27.090> between<00:06:27.360> my

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
splint filled the cracks between my

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.440 
splint filled the cracks between my
teeth<00:06:27.810> and<00:06:28.050> so<00:06:28.290> this<00:06:28.500> gap<00:06:28.770> was<00:06:29.700> a<00:06:29.730> lifesaver<00:06:30.330> I

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
teeth and so this gap was a lifesaver I

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.600 
teeth and so this gap was a lifesaver I
could<00:06:30.720> kind<00:06:30.960> of<00:06:31.080> like<00:06:31.230> drink<00:06:31.590> through<00:06:31.860> it<00:06:31.950> so<00:06:32.340> I

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
could kind of like drink through it so I

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.030 
could kind of like drink through it so I
mean<00:06:32.880> it<00:06:32.970> all<00:06:33.060> kind<00:06:33.300> of<00:06:33.390> worked<00:06:33.570> out<00:06:33.720> but<00:06:34.680> um

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
mean it all kind of worked out but um

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.250 
mean it all kind of worked out but um
