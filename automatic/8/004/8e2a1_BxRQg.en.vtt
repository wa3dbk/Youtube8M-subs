think<00:00:51.329> Portable<00:00:51.690> 3rd<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.559> little<00:00:53.039> bit<00:00:53.129> easy

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
think Portable 3rd is a little bit easy

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.250 
think Portable 3rd is a little bit easy
it<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> game<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.690> consider<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:55.079> just

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
it is a game that you consider with just

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.170 
it is a game that you consider with just
button<00:00:56.010> mash<00:00:56.190> your<00:00:56.370> weight<00:00:56.489> or<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.789> little<00:00:57.059> bit

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
button mash your weight or a little bit

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.729 
button mash your weight or a little bit
I<00:00:57.390> mean<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.809> almost<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.230> game<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.649> not

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
I mean it's almost a game so it's not

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.310 
I mean it's almost a game so it's not
easy<00:00:59.070> easy<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.670> compared<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.570> game<00:01:01.170> it's

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
easy easy but compared to this game it's

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.569 
easy easy but compared to this game it's
not<00:01:01.500> quite<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> same<00:01:01.920> level<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.399> brutality

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
not quite the same level of brutality

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.600

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.370 
chicken looking thing and he was quite a
new<00:03:20.340> player<00:03:20.609> back<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:20.940> day<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.380> without

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
new player back in the day so without

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:31.790 
new player back in the day so without
further<00:03:22.650> ado<00:03:22.950> let's<00:03:23.669> crack<00:03:24.000> right<00:03:24.269> into<00:03:24.630> it

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.990 

I'm<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.310> little<00:03:32.400> bit<00:03:32.580> spares<00:03:32.760> with<00:03:32.910> these

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
I'm a little bit spares with these

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.220 
I'm a little bit spares with these
controls<00:03:33.180> I'm<00:03:33.510> used<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.870> Japanese

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
controls I'm used to the Japanese

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.900 
controls I'm used to the Japanese
versions<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.680> games<00:03:34.860> where<00:03:35.100> are<00:03:35.460> always

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
versions of the games where are always

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.210 
versions of the games where are always
select<00:03:36.180> NX<00:03:36.480> is<00:03:36.570> back<00:03:36.810> whereas<00:03:37.440> understand

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
select NX is back whereas understand

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.310 
select NX is back whereas understand
it's<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.490> opposite<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.120> if<00:03:39.210> I<00:03:39.330> keep<00:03:40.170> it

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
it's the opposite so if I keep it

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.750 
it's the opposite so if I keep it
exiting<00:03:40.650> out<00:03:40.740> in<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:40.980> newest<00:03:41.190> unexpectedly

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
exiting out in the newest unexpectedly

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.050 
exiting out in the newest unexpectedly
then<00:03:41.970> that's<00:03:42.150> why<00:03:43.490> that<00:03:44.490> also<00:03:44.610> haven't<00:03:44.940> played

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
then that's why that also haven't played

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.850 
then that's why that also haven't played
this<00:03:45.150> game<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.510> long<00:03:45.780> time<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:46.410> if<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.590> get<00:03:46.650> to

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
this game a long time so if I get to

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.010 
this game a long time so if I get to
this<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.220> know<00:03:47.640> Island<00:03:48.420> then<00:03:48.690> that's<00:03:48.870> why

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
this you know Island then that's why

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.610 
this you know Island then that's why
it's<00:03:49.170> deuce

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
it's deuce

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.740 
it's deuce
now<00:03:50.310> these<00:03:50.430> graphics<00:03:50.790> aren't<00:03:51.360> necessarily

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
now these graphics aren't necessarily

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.200 
now these graphics aren't necessarily

released this is revolutionary stuff one

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.070 
released this is revolutionary stuff one
of<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.820> reasons<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.330> um<00:04:03.660> first<00:04:03.870> game

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
of the reasons that this um first game

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.510 
of the reasons that this um first game
is<00:04:04.260> hard<00:04:04.440> as<00:04:04.500> well<00:04:04.680> as<00:04:04.830> a<00:04:04.980> lot<00:04:05.130> of<00:04:05.160> stuff<00:04:05.400> like

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
is hard as well as a lot of stuff like

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.920 
is hard as well as a lot of stuff like
this<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.760> can<00:04:05.940> see<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.330> vegetation<00:04:06.840> is

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
this you can see that the vegetation is

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.810 
this you can see that the vegetation is
so<00:04:07.080> thick<00:04:07.380> it's<00:04:07.950> actually<00:04:08.280> really<00:04:08.490> hard<00:04:08.670> to

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
so thick it's actually really hard to

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.530 
so thick it's actually really hard to
see<00:04:08.970> anything

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
see anything

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.610 
see anything
oh<00:04:09.570> this<00:04:10.110> good<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.870> it's<00:04:12.990> little<00:04:13.230> things<00:04:13.440> as

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
oh this good and it's little things as

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.990 
oh this good and it's little things as
well<00:04:13.770> like<00:04:13.950> they<00:04:14.160> weren't<00:04:14.310> really<00:04:14.550> any<00:04:14.790> good

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
well like they weren't really any good

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.340 
well like they weren't really any good
armor<00:04:15.270> skills<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.690> mean<00:04:15.840> you<00:04:16.109> could<00:04:16.260> get

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
armor skills I mean you could get

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.870 
armor skills I mean you could get
sharpness<00:04:16.709> +1<00:04:16.739> but<00:04:17.190> there's<00:04:17.340> no<00:04:17.430> such<00:04:17.640> thing

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
sharpness +1 but there's no such thing

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.330 
sharpness +1 but there's no such thing
as<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.620> football<00:04:19.620> sharpness<00:04:19.950> so<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.130> best<00:04:20.280> you

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
as a football sharpness so the best you

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.520 
as a football sharpness so the best you
could<00:04:20.489> get<00:04:20.580> is<00:04:20.670> white<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.299> little<00:04:22.200> white<00:04:22.320> is<00:04:22.500> a

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
could get is white and little white is a

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.460 
could get is white and little white is a
pretty<00:04:22.710> meager<00:04:22.950> boost<00:04:23.960> there<00:04:24.960> one<00:04:25.110> press<00:04:25.320> is

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
pretty meager boost there one press is

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.659 
pretty meager boost there one press is
intense

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.760 

next<00:04:32.389> foot<00:04:32.569> trip<00:04:32.780> damage<00:04:33.020> of<00:04:33.139> something<00:04:33.469> else

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
next foot trip damage of something else

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.809 
next foot trip damage of something else
I<00:04:35.740> mean<00:04:36.740> people<00:04:36.860> talk<00:04:36.949> about<00:04:37.219> fake<00:04:37.400> decoding

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
I mean people talk about fake decoding

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.339 
I mean people talk about fake decoding
in<00:04:37.879> a<00:04:37.939> series<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.419> there<00:04:38.840> is<00:04:38.930> that<00:04:39.080> to<00:04:39.199> some

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
in a series and there is that to some

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.379 
in a series and there is that to some
extent<00:04:39.379> but<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.370> guess<00:04:40.610> without<00:04:40.789> it<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.210> sort

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
extent but I guess without it the sort

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.580 
extent but I guess without it the sort
of<00:04:41.419> it<00:04:41.569> adds<00:04:41.719> a<00:04:41.810> lot<00:04:41.900> of<00:04:41.960> flavor<00:04:42.199> to<00:04:42.259> the<00:04:42.409> game

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
of it adds a lot of flavor to the game

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.830 
of it adds a lot of flavor to the game
and<00:04:42.800> I<00:04:43.580> mean<00:04:43.699> Portable<00:04:44.120> 3rd<00:04:44.150> is<00:04:44.449> missing<00:04:44.719> it

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
and I mean Portable 3rd is missing it

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.320 
and I mean Portable 3rd is missing it
and<00:04:44.990> a<00:04:45.229> little<00:04:45.349> respect<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:46.069> it's<00:04:46.879> not<00:04:47.090> quite

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
and a little respect and it's not quite

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.839 
and a little respect and it's not quite
the<00:04:47.449> same<00:04:47.629> with<00:04:47.810> it<00:04:47.900> I<00:04:47.990> mean<00:04:48.080> it's<00:04:48.639> it's<00:04:49.639> nice

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
the same with it I mean it's it's nice

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:50.950 
the same with it I mean it's it's nice
not<00:04:49.999> to<00:04:50.120> have<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.270> do<00:04:50.419> what<00:04:50.569> they're<00:04:50.689> so<00:04:50.900> the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
not to have to do what they're so the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.559 
not to have to do what they're so the
rubbish<00:04:51.379> stuff<00:04:51.560> all<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.800> time<00:04:51.830> but<00:04:52.539> when<00:04:53.539> it

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 
rubbish stuff all the time but when it

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.040 
rubbish stuff all the time but when it
one<00:04:53.840> game<00:04:54.050> is<00:04:54.169> too<00:04:54.379> easy<00:04:54.409> then<00:04:55.039> it<00:04:55.419> loses<00:04:56.419> a<00:04:56.810> lot

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
one game is too easy then it loses a lot

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.209 
one game is too easy then it loses a lot
of<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.259> input<00:04:57.529> lore<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.889> things<00:04:58.069> that

00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:58.219 
of the input lore of the things that

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:07.159 
of the input lore of the things that
make<00:04:58.340> one<00:04:58.490> sound<00:04:58.639> fun<00:04:58.939> in<00:04:59.180> my<00:04:59.300> opinion

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.559 

so<00:05:07.979> for<00:05:08.069> this<00:05:08.129> let's<00:05:08.340> play<00:05:08.460> um<00:05:08.699> the<00:05:09.090> goals<00:05:09.300> art

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 
the arena but but I'm doing the rank of

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.940 
the arena but but I'm doing the rank of
propia<00:07:17.210> key<00:07:17.330> I<00:07:17.360> think<00:07:17.600> it<00:07:17.720> might<00:07:17.930> be<00:07:18.169> a<00:07:18.650> little

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:18.950 
propia key I think it might be a little

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.230 
propia key I think it might be a little
bit<00:07:19.190> more<00:07:19.990> challenging<00:07:20.990> than<00:07:21.050> I<00:07:21.229> can<00:07:21.380> sort<00:07:21.530> of

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
bit more challenging than I can sort of

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.370 
bit more challenging than I can sort of
do<00:07:23.240> it<00:07:23.479> properly<00:07:23.780> that<00:07:23.840> there's<00:07:24.080> none<00:07:24.169> but<00:07:24.290> you

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 
do it properly that there's none but you

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.610 
do it properly that there's none but you
know<00:07:24.500> we'll<00:07:24.620> see<00:07:24.650> how<00:07:24.800> we<00:07:24.860> go<00:07:26.200> but<00:07:27.200> one<00:07:27.470> of<00:07:27.500> the

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 
know we'll see how we go but one of the

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.390 
know we'll see how we go but one of the
diode<00:07:28.280> you<00:07:28.370> break<00:07:28.520> on<00:07:28.610> the<00:07:28.700> base<00:07:28.820> a<00:07:28.850> bit<00:07:30.400> so

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
diode you break on the base a bit so

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.530 
diode you break on the base a bit so
yeah<00:07:31.550> I<00:07:31.580> hope<00:07:31.729> you<00:07:31.790> guys<00:07:31.940> enjoy<00:07:32.180> this<00:07:32.270> I<00:07:32.390> hope
