00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
you that the Sun's core that's the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.280 
you that the Sun's core that's the
center<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:17.100> blistering<00:01:17.820> 5<00:01:18.270> million<00:01:19.080> degrees

Celsius but how hot is the sun's surface

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.830 
Celsius but how hot is the sun's surface
is<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.590> 1.5<00:01:25.590> billion<00:01:26.040> degrees<00:01:26.369> Celsius<00:01:27.150> be

degrees Celsius mmm
I<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.939> no<00:01:36.150> idea<00:01:36.540> they<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:36.990> sound<00:01:37.290> quite<00:01:37.619> warm

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
I have no idea they all sound quite warm

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.999 
I have no idea they all sound quite warm
to<00:01:38.280> me<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.600> think<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.259> must<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.680> bit

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
to me but I think it must be a bit

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.330 
to me but I think it must be a bit
cooler<00:01:41.460> than<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.090> core<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.869> I'm<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.159> go

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
cooler than the core so I'm going to go

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.060 
cooler than the core so I'm going to go
for<00:01:44.700> 1.5<00:01:45.600> million<00:01:46.259> degrees

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
for 1.5 million degrees

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.280 
for 1.5 million degrees
okay<00:01:47.640> well<00:01:47.909> we'll<00:01:48.210> find<00:01:48.450> out<00:01:48.689> if<00:01:48.869> you're<00:01:49.049> right

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
okay well we'll find out if you're right

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.249

to<00:01:55.680> discover<00:01:56.130> what<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> Sun<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.000> made<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:58.130> it's

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
to discover what the Sun is made of it's

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.510 
to discover what the Sun is made of it's
just<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.399> big<00:01:59.549> ball<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.790> gas<00:02:00.290> and<00:02:01.290> we<00:02:02.159> measure<00:02:02.399> it

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
just a big ball of gas and we measure it

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.330 
just a big ball of gas and we measure it
it's<00:02:03.299> made<00:02:03.540> mostly<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.869> hydrogen<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:05.100> it's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
it's made mostly of hydrogen so it's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.490 
it's made mostly of hydrogen so it's
roughly<00:02:05.549> 90<00:02:05.939> percent<00:02:06.240> hydrogen<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:07.229> maybe

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
roughly 90 percent hydrogen it's maybe

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.070 
roughly 90 percent hydrogen it's maybe
eight<00:02:07.619> percent<00:02:08.009> helium<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.599> rest<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.929> its

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
eight percent helium and the rest of its

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.050 
eight percent helium and the rest of its
made<00:02:10.289> up<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.649> things<00:02:10.890> like<00:02:11.129> iron<00:02:11.489> carbon

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
made up of things like iron carbon

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.170 
made up of things like iron carbon
oxygen<00:02:12.560> nickel

oxygen nickel

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.089 
oxygen nickel
so<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.360> main<00:02:15.540> gas<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.989> hydrogen<00:02:16.349> which

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
so the main gas is hydrogen which

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.320 
so the main gas is hydrogen which
accounts<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:17.730> 90%<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.440> sun's<00:02:19.680> matter<00:02:20.580> now

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
and hydrogen creates all the sun's

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.229 
and hydrogen creates all the sun's

we're going to hear now from professor
of<00:03:32.639> physics<00:03:33.090> Yvonne<00:03:33.569> Ellsworth<00:03:34.049> what<00:03:34.799> does

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
of physics Yvonne Ellsworth what does

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.129 
of physics Yvonne Ellsworth what does
she<00:03:35.130> say<00:03:35.370> about<00:03:35.400> how<00:03:35.910> long<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.389> Sun<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:36.900> going

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
she say about how long the Sun is going

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.970 
she say about how long the Sun is going
to<00:03:37.260> stay<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.709> same<00:03:38.720> in<00:03:39.720> terms<00:03:40.109> of<00:03:40.349> its<00:03:40.530> current

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
to stay the same in terms of its current

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.659 
to stay the same in terms of its current
lifestyle<00:03:41.910> it's<00:03:42.389> here<00:03:42.630> for<00:03:42.870> as<00:03:43.230> long<00:03:43.260> again<00:03:43.739> so

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
lifestyle it's here for as long again so

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.460 
lifestyle it's here for as long again so
we're<00:03:44.760> about<00:03:44.849> halfway<00:03:45.090> through<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.720> then<00:03:46.290> it

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
we're about halfway through and then it

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.930 
we're about halfway through and then it
becomes<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:46.889> different<00:03:47.250> sort<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.549> star<00:03:47.819> it

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
becomes a different sort of star it

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.759 
becomes a different sort of star it
becomes<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.359> giant<00:03:48.720> star<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.319> that's<00:03:49.590> probably

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
becomes a giant star and that's probably

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.150 
becomes a giant star and that's probably
curtains<00:03:50.280> for<00:03:50.519> us<00:03:50.609> actually<00:03:51.799> it'll<00:03:52.799> get<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.069> bit

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
curtains for us actually it'll get a bit

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.699 
curtains for us actually it'll get a bit
warm<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.090> bit<00:03:54.120> toasty<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:55.380> we'll<00:03:55.530> get

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
warm a bit toasty and we'll get

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.140 
warm a bit toasty and we'll get
enveloped<00:03:56.190> in<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.400> Sun<00:03:56.609> and<00:03:56.849> it<00:03:56.910> won't<00:03:57.030> be

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
enveloped in the Sun and it won't be

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.920 
enveloped in the Sun and it won't be
nice<00:03:58.280> so<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.639> Sun<00:03:59.910> is<00:04:00.060> going<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.480> stay<00:04:00.750> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
nice so the Sun is going to stay the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.770 
nice so the Sun is going to stay the
same<00:04:01.230> for<00:04:01.829> another<00:04:02.209> four-and-a-half<00:04:03.209> billion

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
same for another four-and-a-half billion

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.589 
same for another four-and-a-half billion
years<00:04:03.989> but<00:04:04.919> the<00:04:05.069> professor<00:04:05.579> also<00:04:06.060> says<00:04:06.389> that

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
years but the professor also says that

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.650 
years but the professor also says that
the<00:04:06.930> Sun<00:04:07.200> will<00:04:07.500> change<00:04:08.010> when<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.090> becomes<00:04:09.450> a

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
the Sun will change when it becomes a
