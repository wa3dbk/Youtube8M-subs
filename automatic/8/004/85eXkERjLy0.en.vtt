for<00:01:36.659> these<00:01:36.869> guys<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.470> mean<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.369> Darnell

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
for these guys I mean just like Darnell

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.660 
for these guys I mean just like Darnell

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
Darnell field

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.460 
Darnell field
spring<00:01:40.479> down<00:01:40.720> then<00:01:40.869> would<00:01:40.990> have<00:01:41.080> gotten<00:01:41.200> you

spring down then would have gotten you

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.350 
spring down then would have gotten you
know<00:01:41.500> a<00:01:41.619> couple<00:01:41.799> hundred<00:01:42.009> reps<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.670> have<00:01:43.330> a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
know a couple hundred reps you have a

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.060 
know a couple hundred reps you have a
thousand<00:01:43.780> reps<00:01:43.960> on<00:01:44.110> top<00:01:44.320> of<00:01:44.470> that<00:01:44.619> here's<00:01:44.979> the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
thousand reps on top of that here's the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.170 
thousand reps on top of that here's the
guy<00:01:45.220> that's<00:01:45.430> really<00:01:45.670> improved<00:01:46.030> and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
guy that's really improved and

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.510 
guy that's really improved and
understand<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:47.070> fundamental<00:01:48.070> aspects<00:01:48.460> of

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
understand the fundamental aspects of

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.679 
understand the fundamental aspects of
what<00:01:48.640> we're<00:01:48.790> trying<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.060> do<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.390> scheme<00:01:49.659> of

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
what we're trying to do the scheme of

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.980 
what we're trying to do the scheme of
things<00:01:49.840> so<00:01:50.320> I<00:01:50.590> think<00:01:51.399> it's<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.729> win-win<00:01:52.210> you

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
things so I think it's a win-win you

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.480 
things so I think it's a win-win you
know<00:01:53.110> a<00:01:53.140> lot<00:01:53.290> of<00:01:53.320> talking<00:01:53.649> about<00:01:53.920> injuries<00:01:54.310> but

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
know a lot of talking about injuries but

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.039 
know a lot of talking about injuries but
I<00:01:54.549> think<00:01:54.759> it's<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.970> lot<00:01:55.149> of<00:01:55.210> positives<00:01:55.720> come<00:01:55.930> out

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
I think it's a lot of positives come out

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.380 
I think it's a lot of positives come out
of<00:01:56.170> those<00:01:56.259> things<00:01:56.470> yes<00:01:57.250> he<00:01:57.399> made<00:01:57.580> I<00:01:57.850> made<00:01:57.880> that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
of those things yes he made I made that

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.779 
of those things yes he made I made that
much<00:01:58.479> of<00:01:58.539> an<00:01:58.690> impression<00:01:58.899> on<00:01:59.140> you<00:01:59.289> I<00:01:59.860> think<00:02:00.670> he

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
much of an impression on you I think he

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.820 
much of an impression on you I think he
asks<00:02:01.149> I<00:02:01.270> think<00:02:01.539> he<00:02:01.630> certainly<00:02:01.930> has<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.500> mean

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
asks I think he certainly has I mean

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.899 
asks I think he certainly has I mean
there's<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.189> there's<00:02:03.220> no<00:02:03.460> question<00:02:03.789> he's

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
there's and there's no question he's

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.700 
there's and there's no question he's
been<00:02:04.060> there<00:02:04.210> guess<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.140> can<00:02:05.229> call<00:02:05.380> him<00:02:05.560> the

been there guess you can call him the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.009 
been there guess you can call him the
