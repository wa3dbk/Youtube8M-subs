00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.480
 are hereby in the event of the diabetes present consisted of venhorst is 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.900
 so syrian with an ant matches and the fishing training everyone who is minister 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.960
 say the american form of dressage 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.110
 the difference with normal dressage is already a first dress 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.470
 and you saddle the issue and then as far as driving is concerned 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.390
 you drive everything on one hand so you have to make a lot of sense 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.200
 keep this may not change 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.200
 which states that the best thing is that moment loose tiles 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.130
 May 2012 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.390
 de and ingrid niches are paired and that is what michael schumacher can do 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.960
 which is a very large range to see and switzerland and last year wants the tail 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.940
 hold a competition for full length first tower 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.810
 and then came the question what do you want to participate well, of course, does that 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.620
 we had the event going 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.510
 and then I thought yes why should I actually stop and I just think it is 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.380
 very nice to be busy with those with those animals and that is real 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.380
 they relax wonderfully 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 the loan so you get some of the mandatory figures 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.510
 and thirteen points they did that tool party different studies 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.070
 I just see it as food 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.470
 all curves are states that only occur in a different order 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.420
 the riders of the food and that means you 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.350
 logged in through the middle 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.960
 then later an outdoor drive made at the end then the closure stops 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.430
 stopping a tank spectacular 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.480
 then you do that is called a roll so think of running on the spot 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.920
 distinguish the other way 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.970
 you actually do the same 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.680
 and so it stops at the place to turn that saying and then you go back and then you stop 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.130
 and then you go back and a seat ants 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.290
 then you must 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.630
 the spiders 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.640
 but not being able to race on the track if your horse spins inside mystique 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.810
 right 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.350
 4 and a quarter left winter I finally resisted the jury 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.649
 gladly damn in the serco section that is it is this time left off 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:13.799
 the biggest 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.719
 Silicon speed of the small circle that must then slowly make a large circle 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:22.479
 change gurp at speed no less after the second major circuit 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.579
 then you go to the right now too big small money 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.019
 now again successful has been incorporated in a semicircle there he made in a straight 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.019
 align the match as long as I stop 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.839
 not nice to not feel like driving through the week bit 0 score is very 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.069
 very miss going 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.419
 but s 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.049
 no I had a fight this morning 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.659
 and with September 25 has shifted to the Greeks not done so wrong 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:51.749
 after the fixed value 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.749
 also in number
