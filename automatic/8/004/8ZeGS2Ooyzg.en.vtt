00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
what I like to call it a sentry hell I

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.599 
what I like to call it a sentry hell I
think<00:00:18.930> what<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.289> called<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.800> Centurion

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
think what it is called is Centurion

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.300

death<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.630> as<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.960> will<00:00:22.050> see<00:00:22.289> when<00:00:22.830> anyone

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
death so as you will see when anyone

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.880 
death so as you will see when anyone
dies<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.910> most<00:00:24.539> cases<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.019> high<00:00:25.289> percentage<00:00:25.769> of

dies in most cases a high percentage of

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.359 
dies in most cases a high percentage of
the<00:00:25.980> time<00:00:26.220> they<00:00:26.490> will<00:00:26.670> spawn<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.359> sentry<00:00:28.019> gun

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
the time they will spawn a sentry gun

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.320 
the time they will spawn a sentry gun
wherever<00:00:29.369> they<00:00:29.490> died<00:00:29.640> if<00:00:29.789> they're<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.119> midair

wherever they died if they're in midair
a<00:00:30.510> sentry<00:00:31.080> gun<00:00:31.230> will<00:00:31.410> spawn<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.679> midair<00:00:32.009> you

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
a sentry gun will spawn in midair you

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.330 
a sentry gun will spawn in midair you
can<00:00:32.790> choose<00:00:33.120> as<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:34.020> run<00:00:34.230> your<00:00:34.410> server<00:00:34.680> to

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
can choose as you run your server to

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.819 
can choose as you run your server to
either<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.180> century<00:00:36.600> spawn<00:00:36.960> as<00:00:37.260> level<00:00:37.710> 1

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
either have a century spawn as level 1

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.190 
either have a century spawn as level 1
level<00:00:37.860> 2<00:00:38.100> level<00:00:38.219> 3<00:00:38.460> or<00:00:38.790> random<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.629> for

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
level 2 level 3 or random so for

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.799 
level 2 level 3 or random so for
starters<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.040> thought<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.430> would<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.670> making<00:00:42.540> it

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
starters I thought it would be making it

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.220 
starters I thought it would be making it
makes<00:00:43.079> sense<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.980> start<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.690> level<00:00:46.110> 1

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
makes sense to start with just level 1

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.500 
makes sense to start with just level 1
centuries<00:00:46.739> because<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.550> everything<00:00:48.300> was

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
centuries because if everything was

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.540 
centuries because if everything was
spawning<00:00:48.809> random<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.829> probably<00:00:50.340> would<00:00:50.520> just

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
spawning random it probably would just

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.490 
spawning random it probably would just
be<00:00:50.760> very<00:00:51.030> very<00:00:51.390> confusing<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.350> guys

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
be very very confusing so if you guys

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.580 
be very very confusing so if you guys
want<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.890> see<00:00:53.039> more<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.610> century<00:00:54.480> hell<00:00:54.690> let<00:00:55.440> me

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
want to see more of century hell let me

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.040 
want to see more of century hell let me
know<00:00:55.739> because<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.640> really<00:00:57.539> don't<00:00:57.840> know

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
know because I just really don't know

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.139 
know because I just really don't know
just<00:00:58.350> an<00:00:58.410> example<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.160> shooting<00:00:59.940> a

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
just an example of just shooting a

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.810 
just an example of just shooting a
soldier<00:01:00.660> he<00:01:01.350> spawns<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.770> century<00:01:02.100> good<00:01:02.280> it's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
soldier he spawns a century good it's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.320 
soldier he spawns a century good it's
it's<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:04.049> played<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.769> lakeside<00:01:05.280> final<00:01:05.939> before

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
it's we played a lakeside final before

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.140 
it's we played a lakeside final before
this<00:01:06.570> round<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.770> came<00:01:08.010> down<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> whichever

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
this round and it came down to whichever

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.590 
this round and it came down to whichever
team<00:01:09.600> could<00:01:10.229> pretty<00:01:10.470> much<00:01:10.770> hold<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.970> mid<00:01:12.210> area

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
team could pretty much hold the mid area

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.510 
team could pretty much hold the mid area
and<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.350> died<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.979> was<00:01:14.070> fine<00:01:14.340> because

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and if they died that was fine because

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.370 
and if they died that was fine because
their<00:01:14.820> sentry<00:01:15.240> guns<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> hold<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> area<00:01:16.170> it's

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
their sentry guns to hold the area it's

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.260 
their sentry guns to hold the area it's
pretty<00:01:16.439> much<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.650> whoever<00:01:17.580> could<00:01:17.790> push<00:01:18.030> up

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
pretty much just whoever could push up

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.210 
pretty much just whoever could push up
first<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.840> kind<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.170> control<00:01:20.009> that

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
first and it kind of just control that

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.090 
first and it kind of just control that
and<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.520> die<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.299> point<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.750> was<00:01:21.780> yes<00:01:22.530> it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
and like die on the point it was yes it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.160 
and like die on the point it was yes it
was<00:01:23.280> very<00:01:23.520> very<00:01:23.700> strange<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.630> Laura<00:01:24.869> I'm

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
was very very strange and the Laura I'm

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.550 
was very very strange and the Laura I'm
using<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.939> direct<00:01:27.479> hit<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.049> way<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.409> can

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
using is the direct hit that way we can

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.130 
using is the direct hit that way we can
take<00:01:28.740> out<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> centuries<00:01:29.520> probably<00:01:30.420> best<00:01:30.930> out

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
take out the centuries probably best out

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.600 
take out the centuries probably best out
of<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> rocket<00:01:31.710> launchers<00:01:32.070> our

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
of all the rocket launchers our

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.399 
of all the rocket launchers our
secondary<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.360> course<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> battalions

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
secondary of course is the battalions

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.120 
secondary of course is the battalions
backup<00:01:34.829> because<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.310> get<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.610> 50%<00:01:36.079> century

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
backup because we get that 50% century

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.480 
backup because we get that 50% century
damage<00:01:38.130> resistance<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.960> overall<00:01:40.070> 35%<00:01:41.070> damage

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
damage resistance and overall 35% damage

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.280 
damage resistance and overall 35% damage
reduction<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.329> that's<00:01:42.479> kind<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.750> nice<00:01:42.990> and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
reduction so that's kind of nice and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.770 
reduction so that's kind of nice and
just<00:01:44.009> helps<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> team<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.939> when<00:01:45.600> you're

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
just helps out the team and when you're

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.230 
just helps out the team and when you're
playing<00:01:45.899> sentry<00:01:46.439> hell<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.890> think<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.909> it's

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
playing sentry hell I think that it's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.620 
playing sentry hell I think that it's
probably<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.689> good<00:01:48.869> idea<00:01:49.880> with<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.060> 35%

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
probably a good idea with that 35%

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.050 
probably a good idea with that 35%
damage<00:01:52.350> reduction<00:01:52.649> from<00:01:53.009> all<00:01:53.250> other<00:01:53.579> sources

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
damage reduction from all other sources

damage reduction from all other sources
I<00:01:54.299> really<00:01:54.810> do<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> battalions<00:01:55.799> backup

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
I really do think the battalions backup

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.789 
I really do think the battalions backup
is<00:01:56.340> probably<00:01:56.820> your<00:01:57.000> best<00:01:57.210> choice<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.930> running

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
is probably your best choice and running

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.590 
is probably your best choice and running
soldier<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.430> general<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.969> direct<00:02:00.240> hit<00:02:00.450> is

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
soldier in general to direct hit is

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.780 
soldier in general to direct hit is
probably<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.200> best<00:02:01.409> way<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> go<00:02:01.979> since

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
probably the best way to go since

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.030 
probably the best way to go since
centuries<00:02:03.149> will<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.930> rip<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.469> if<00:02:04.740> you're

point where it completely breaks the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
game possibly on payload it would but

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.620 
game possibly on payload it would but
it's<00:03:16.560> still<00:03:16.799> playable<00:03:17.400> like<00:03:18.000> people<00:03:18.420> aren't

kind<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.739> interesting<00:03:26.040> but<00:03:26.190> yeah<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.760> don't

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
kind of interesting but yeah I don't

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.420 
kind of interesting but yeah I don't
know<00:03:27.390> it's<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.840> just<00:03:28.590> saw<00:03:28.769> this<00:03:29.010> I'm<00:03:29.250> like

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
know it's I just saw this I'm like

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.979 
know it's I just saw this I'm like
there's<00:03:29.670> no<00:03:29.819> way<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:29.970> works<00:03:30.269> this<00:03:30.600> has<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.900> be

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
there's no way this works this has to be

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.199 
there's no way this works this has to be
completely<00:03:31.350> broken<00:03:31.470> no<00:03:32.310> way<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.760> will<00:03:32.880> notice

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
completely broken no way you will notice

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.849 
completely broken no way you will notice
that<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.450> centuries<00:03:33.870> do<00:03:34.079> shoot<00:03:34.410> from<00:03:34.680> like

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
that the centuries do shoot from like

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.740 
that the centuries do shoot from like
the<00:03:35.220> bottom<00:03:35.609> of<00:03:35.850> where<00:03:36.090> they<00:03:36.239> are<00:03:36.359> then<00:03:36.569> really

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
the bottom of where they are then really

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.599 
the bottom of where they are then really
shoo<00:03:36.930> outside<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.350> turret<00:03:37.650> probably<00:03:38.430> cuz

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
shoo outside the turret probably cuz

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.699 
shoo outside the turret probably cuz
they're<00:03:38.760> not<00:03:38.790> like<00:03:39.150> legitimate<00:03:39.930> sentry<00:03:40.470> guns

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
they're not like legitimate sentry guns

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.220 
they're not like legitimate sentry guns
built<00:03:41.160> properly<00:03:41.609> yadda<00:03:42.450> yadda<00:03:42.569> yadda<00:03:42.840> that

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
built properly yadda yadda yadda that

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.410 
built properly yadda yadda yadda that
kind<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.500> thing<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:43.920> do<00:03:43.980> not<00:03:44.160> think<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:45.209> you

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
kind of thing I do not think that you

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.420 
kind of thing I do not think that you
can<00:03:45.600> do<00:03:45.840> many<00:03:46.170> centuries<00:03:46.500> over<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.100> century

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
can do many centuries over the century

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.490 
can do many centuries over the century
guns<00:03:47.639> because<00:03:48.060> I'm<00:03:48.540> pretty<00:03:48.720> sure<00:03:48.840> star<00:03:49.319> we

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
guns because I'm pretty sure star we

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.660 
guns because I'm pretty sure star we
just<00:03:49.650> have<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.799> terrible<00:03:49.980> time<00:03:50.310> everyone's

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
like ships you got an invite started

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.830 
like ships you got an invite started
this<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:52.950> get<00:03:53.609> them<00:03:53.730> all<00:03:53.819> many<00:03:54.030> centuries<00:03:54.299> to

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
this like get them all many centuries to

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.000 
this like get them all many centuries to
fight<00:03:55.019> him<00:03:55.170> over<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.530> we'll<00:03:55.650> have<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.799> great

time<00:03:56.190> like<00:03:56.459> he<00:03:56.730> probably<00:03:57.209> would<00:03:57.660> not<00:03:57.870> enjoy

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
time like he probably would not enjoy

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.309 
time like he probably would not enjoy
that<00:03:58.410> so<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.639> don't<00:04:00.000> know<00:04:00.239> star<00:04:01.019> would<00:04:01.200> you

it's<00:04:47.940> spread<00:04:48.240> out<00:04:48.270> enough<00:04:48.690> that<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.080> have

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
it's spread out enough that you have

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.379 
it's spread out enough that you have
your<00:04:49.650> own<00:04:49.680> intimate<00:04:50.370> battles<00:04:50.789> on<00:04:51.030> each
