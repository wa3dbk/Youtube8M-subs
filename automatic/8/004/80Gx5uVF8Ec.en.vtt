00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.080
 I'm happy to be back with 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.879
 you and now bringing you a 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.509
 super cool application that I'm 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:15.159
 talking about a super mega emulator 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.190
 great a little bit cooler than the 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:21.700
 previous that I mentioned 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.100
 and the truth and I tried it I liked it and 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.620
 I speak of my boy 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.080
 the my boy what things do they have 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.280
 super cool I'll give you a demonstration 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.280
 with a game of pokÃ©mon 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:40.010
 and good as you can see here 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.010
 is 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.440
 showed him emulator and I'll show you the 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:51.090
 options as you know then there is what 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.570
 load save game this one even go a 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.150
 little bit faster the game codes 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.590
 settings 'squeeze out' reset and close and 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.090
 well then let's see the options 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.010
 good as you can see here we have in 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.280
 audio video input light 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.979
 mix advance and wood that is like type the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.840
 good application information in 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.710
 video is to have a no 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.380
 move anything 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.560
 here only in screen size we can 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.010
 move the controls to accommodate them 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.010
 our taste 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.240
 to the screen equal to propose here and 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.009
 here here where I want and until the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.909
 I can change size as you can 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.539
 they can give an account 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:40.159
 and good is this emulator I 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.850
 I recommend more for tablets than for 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.040
 cell phones 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.430
 the previous application that I gave them is like this 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.470
 I recommend it for cell phones because it's 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.840
 the most suitable for those devices 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.970
 and good and my boy I recommend them for 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.710
 tablets since we can accommodate the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.240
 controls to our taste our way 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.060
 to be able to play 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.130
 and good audio for there is nothing that 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.170
 to say almost has nothing in impulse in 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.830
 the controls all equally accommodate 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.040
 your way and you will say 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.379
 in which there is nothing to say either 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.810
 and good and others I recommend that 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.970
 do not do anything the truth the controls are 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.650
 super cool 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.000
 and you can 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.650
 and check it 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.530
 and well I do not remember remember forgiveness 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.480
 this subscribe to the big amount like and 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.210
 Well, I'll leave you a page where you can 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.880
 download the games and also them 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.520
 I'll pass the link to download this 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.280
 application because it is already a shock not 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.010
 I went up to app videos and it's 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.290
 great to play our games 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.450

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.150

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.860
