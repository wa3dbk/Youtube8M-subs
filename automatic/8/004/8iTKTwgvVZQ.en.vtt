00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
or maybe a little bit less it's only a

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.929 
or maybe a little bit less it's only a
little<00:04:07.230> bit<00:04:07.409> less<00:04:07.560> though<00:04:07.799> so<00:04:08.459> if<00:04:08.819> you<00:04:08.909> think

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
little bit less though so if you think

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.539 
little bit less though so if you think
about<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.299> that<00:04:09.540> way<00:04:09.599> it's<00:04:10.079> good<00:04:10.530> also<00:04:11.250> the
