have had a ton of people asking me what
I<00:00:26.970> think<00:00:27.060> about<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.630> video<00:00:27.900> quality<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.590> this

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
I think about the video quality of this

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.410 
I think about the video quality of this
camera<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.929> don't<00:00:31.320> know<00:00:31.500> yet<00:00:31.940> the<00:00:32.940> original

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
camera and I don't know yet the original

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.150 
camera and I don't know yet the original
unboxing<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.440> did<00:00:34.590> five<00:00:34.829> minutes

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
unboxing that I just did five minutes

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.310 
unboxing that I just did five minutes
ago<00:00:35.309> we're<00:00:36.180> horribly<00:00:36.570> wrong<00:00:36.809> because<00:00:37.170> I

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
ago we're horribly wrong because I

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.220 
ago we're horribly wrong because I
screwed<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:39.090> admittedly<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:39.930> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
screwed up and in admittedly so it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.260 
screwed up and in admittedly so it
doesn't<00:00:40.649> seem<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.190> difficult<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:42.030> use

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
doesn't seem to be that difficult to use

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.020 
doesn't seem to be that difficult to use
if<00:00:42.870> you're<00:00:43.110> not<00:00:43.260> retarded<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.860> myself<00:00:44.100> but

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
if you're not retarded like myself but

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.410 
if you're not retarded like myself but
but<00:00:45.539> anyway<00:00:45.930> um<00:00:46.280> this<00:00:47.280> unboxing<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.149> also

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
going to be the unveiling of the quality

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.260 
going to be the unveiling of the quality

recording when I wasn't recording so but
but<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.530> know<00:03:55.560> in<00:03:55.769> my<00:03:55.920> defense<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.459> think

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
but I you know in my defense I think

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.250 
but I you know in my defense I think
that<00:03:56.820> would<00:03:56.940> would<00:03:57.359> be<00:03:57.390> pretty<00:03:57.720> easy<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:58.140> do

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
that would would be pretty easy to do

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.330 
that would would be pretty easy to do
with<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.470> first<00:03:58.650> time<00:03:58.769> you've<00:03:58.950> ever<00:03:59.010> tried<00:03:59.280> it

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
with the first time you've ever tried it

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.009 
with the first time you've ever tried it
the<00:03:59.820> only<00:04:00.030> thing<00:04:00.180> i'm<00:04:00.299> not<00:04:00.329> sure<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.720> i<00:04:00.870> guess

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
the only thing i'm not sure and i guess

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.259 
the only thing i'm not sure and i guess
i'll<00:04:01.170> find<00:04:01.200> this<00:04:01.560> out<00:04:01.739> is<00:04:01.980> i'm<00:04:02.609> actually<00:04:02.850> off

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
i'll find this out is i'm actually off

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.199 
i'll find this out is i'm actually off
the<00:04:03.299> side<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.140> camera<00:04:04.500> now<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.940> i<00:04:06.180> don't

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
the side of the camera now and i don't

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.940 
the side of the camera now and i don't
know<00:04:06.480> how<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.690> audio<00:04:07.079> quality<00:04:07.140> is<00:04:07.590> going<00:04:07.859> to

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
know how the audio quality is going to

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.009 
know how the audio quality is going to
be<00:04:08.040> because<00:04:08.190> i'm<00:04:08.459> not<00:04:08.549> facing<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.090> camera<00:04:09.299> but

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
be because i'm not facing the camera but

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.920 
be because i'm not facing the camera but
hopefully<00:04:11.010> it's<00:04:11.130> decent<00:04:11.609> if<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:12.329> is<00:04:12.480> i<00:04:12.510> may<00:04:12.900> use

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
hopefully it's decent if it is i may use

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.830 
hopefully it's decent if it is i may use
