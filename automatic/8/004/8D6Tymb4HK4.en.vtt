00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
to let it drop and flip this packet back

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.219 
to let it drop and flip this packet back
over<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.350> let<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.470> drop<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:39.270> then<00:01:39.479> stick<00:01:40.200> your

finger in here and then you lift up this

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.100 
finger in here and then you lift up this
packet<00:01:45.439> gonna<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:47.340> kind<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.820> drop<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.899> drop
