00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 Sergey, please tell me why in this 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.400
 small product volume is so 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.259
 many useful nutrients 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.759
 that is, it is the replacement of a full meal 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.600
 Well that is really important question, and 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.910
 interesting and for many people it seems 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.330
 magic up that little box 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.740
 contains as many vitamins as well 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.330
 for example, a two week supply of food 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.270
 we all know very well what came in 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.340
 shop and immediately buy whole bags in 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.620
 huge trolley rides up 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.870
 and here is one small jar for these 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.480
 let's try to figure out why it became 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.399
 possible for example one of these 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.210
 products that this of course is kiwi 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.879
 Kiwi contains a huge amount 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.570
 various beneficial substances 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.059
 but we see that most of all kiwi 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.289
 contains a huge amount of vitamin c 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.409
 and 100 grams of kiwi contains more 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.600
 one and a half daily norms of vitamin c however 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.790
 if we take a look at this 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.170
 huge big kiwi 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.979
 actually contains 84 percent 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.310
 water in reality is all beneficial 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.500
 substances much less that is she 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.799
 just 16 percent take another example 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.430
 for all of us 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.439
 known carrot is known that carrot 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.409
 this beautiful source of beta carotene and 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.240
 vitamin a contains a huge amount 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.979
 besides this a huge number of others 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.930
 substances found in carrots 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.210
 with all this carrot contains 88 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.159
 percent water and that means that 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.840
 of the nutrients it contains there 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:55.640
 just 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.640
 12 percent that is like this and finally 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.220
 very important and nutrition element is 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.070
 cellulose 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.760
 in large quantities not found in 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.800
 cabbage 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.750
 besides this cabbage is a wonderful source 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.750
 vitamins and trace elements but fiber 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.900
 in this case, the most important 4 grams 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.920
 fiber per 100 grams is a lot for 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.870
 fruits and vegetables 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.300
 but 90 percent of the cabbage volume and this 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.020
 water and that means only 10 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.910
 percent 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.080
 is a really useful part 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.030
 if we take these 16 percent these 12 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.620
 percent these ten percent will collect 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.470
 together we will get with you 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.510
 relatively small jar in which 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.520
 will contain a huge amount 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.680
 nutrients simply due to the fact that 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.680
 we removed the excess moisture from there
