00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:11.420
 I 'm Koji Koji I 'm not this time 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:17.960
 Introducing logicool wireless combo mk 270 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:24.079
 This item mouse and keyboard is a commodity that has become set 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:26.570
 Since there is no hassle of wiring in the fact that wireless is in something Toka women of recommended items 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:32.390
 I wonder what 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.950
 I want to operate a laptop while grumbling on the bed like this 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.450
 Has done 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.920
 I think that came from one certainly including tax 2,400 yen 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:46.720
 As a feature 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.990
 With the reliable 2.4 GHz wireless feature 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:57.410
 Up to a range of 10 meters 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:01:03.050
 It seems that high-speed, high-reliability connection is possible without self-description or omission 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:07.580
 I think it might be a shop 10m is true 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.870
 Also about this keyboard and mouse wireless 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.620
 Requires 2 AAA batteries 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:18.080
 Its battery life is 24 months with the keyboard 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:24.980
 December with mice 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:29.360
 It seems to be characterized by long life and also has a power on / off function and turns off the power 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.850
 It seems that there is also a feature that the life can be further extended by 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.500
 It says laden earth for months 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.010
 It is also a little question to have so much 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:45.340
 The best point to choose the keyboard is this 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:51.310
 I think the layout of the keyboard is very important . 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.670
 Laptop Toka's cheap keyboard and sequences are said to be insanely sound transformation jellyfish 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.670
 Ne 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.490
 If there is an array of keyboard 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.840
 What general 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.500
 Kiner That 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.369
 Enter and ended up messing something a little packed in rather than an array of keyboard 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.950
 What to do 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:09.050
 I sell in the world, but this keyboard has a very basic arrangement to the basics 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.940
 There is no more numeric keypad 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.480
 I bought this because I thought that this compact seems to be easy to use 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:21.500
 In I think I want to open immediately 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.250
 Yes it's been a long time since I met a keyboard, so I'm looking forward to it 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.610
 First of all 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.230
 Contains aus 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.530

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:47.800
 I feel that I feel pretty thin I feel as thin as 1 centimeter 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.910
 Also this blue and black design is a little fashionable and good- 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.300

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.280

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.750
 Well high end Tsu receiver in this man had entered 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:06.050
 The receiver is 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:06.050
 Also it comes with quite a large receiver I'd such was written and tricks 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.689
 Then I think I want to take out the stick of the keyboard 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.590
 Bach 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.580
 It is such a keyboard feeling 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.670
 I take out a little bag 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.600

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.370

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.510
 See you this compared to it is a small ordinary keyboard 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:42.129
 The back is blue by the design with France 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:45.200
 Black Megumi's Nemu print is also a little blue child 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:49.220
 Isn't it good for me? 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.420
 Wonder Nante or rather than this blue Hatsune Mikukara 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.550

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.710
 Yeah very fashionable 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.710
 Behind the keyboard and mouse respectively 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:07.110
 There is place to put battery in here with keyboard 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:11.900
 Once connected, just plug this small receiver into your PC for one-touch connection 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.900
 It was written in the manual that it could be used 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:21.020
 Well I think that I want to do something a little sure 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.020
 Is it recognized by haste 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:33.760
 There Ah want Weiss is sealed in now 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.760
 I'm tired just inserting it 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.290
 Yes 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:50.749
 Yes , both the keyboard and the mouse will recognize the beekeeping just by inserting one receiver 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:53.610
 This is a pretty It is an excellent person one receiver 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:58.310
 Listen to two sounds simultaneously 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.310

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.169
 Yes 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:13.080
 Ne The keyboard Anochotto 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:17.639
 You can see and see the height is a bit lower than a normal keyboard . 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.270
 He is a little higher than PC, though 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:25.280
 That ordinary keyboard 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.600
 z There is a height like this, I say, I say this, but a little bit height 1 cm 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.960
 Is not there enough height 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.470
 If you are accustomed to this one 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.960
 Height is 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:39.240
 To think the opposite and I think we that too low that it is people who are hitting the laptop about elderly 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:46.980
 I think it's easy to hit if there is height 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:51.460
 Though it is my own selfish impression, the height of some keys is higher than the keyboard of the laptop computer 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:56.710
 It is easy to hit if there Saga pot of ordinary personal computer large 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:59.500
 The height of the key is slightly lower than that, but I do not feel that it is difficult to hit 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:03.490
 Yeah that a fine 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.910
 It is ease of use 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:10.850
 Yes 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:12.740

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.900
