morning<00:00:18.920> what<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> magnetic<00:00:20.730> field<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.180> why

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
morning what is a magnetic field and why

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.170 
morning what is a magnetic field and why
do<00:00:21.510> we<00:00:21.630> study<00:00:21.900> them<00:00:22.170> well<00:00:23.070> when<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.550> stick<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
do we study them well when you stick a

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.720 
do we study them well when you stick a
magnet<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.900> refrigerator<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.920> happens

magnet to a refrigerator that happens

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.120 
magnet to a refrigerator that happens
because<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.660> invisible<00:00:28.410> field<00:00:28.740> called<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
because of this invisible field called a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.150 
because of this invisible field called a
magnetic<00:00:29.580> field<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.420> Sun<00:00:30.750> has<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.590> magnetic

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
magnetic field the Sun has a magnetic

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.360 
magnetic field the Sun has a magnetic
field<00:00:32.340> also<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:34.559> sun's<00:00:34.860> magnetic<00:00:35.130> field

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
field also and the sun's magnetic field

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.549 
field also and the sun's magnetic field
is<00:00:35.700> incredibly<00:00:36.360> complicated<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.260> dynamic

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
is incredibly complicated and dynamic

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.389 
is incredibly complicated and dynamic
and<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:39.000> drives<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.530> activity<00:00:41.190> that

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
and it drives all of the activity that

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.639 
and it drives all of the activity that
happens<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> Sun<00:00:42.270> space<00:00:43.020> weather<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
happens on the Sun space weather and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.130 
happens on the Sun space weather and
solar<00:00:43.860> storms<00:00:44.059> so<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.180> want<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.480> understand

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
solar storms so we want to understand

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.170 
solar storms so we want to understand
these<00:00:46.350> magnetic<00:00:46.829> fields<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.030> can

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
these magnetic fields so that we can

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.049 
these magnetic fields so that we can
understand<00:00:48.870> these<00:00:49.500> storms<00:00:50.070> why<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:50.550> happen

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
understand these storms why they happen

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.569 
understand these storms why they happen
and<00:00:51.920> how<00:00:52.920> powerful<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.670> could<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:55.579> what

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and how powerful they could be what

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.900 
and how powerful they could be what
causes<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.210> sun's<00:00:57.449> magnetic<00:00:57.660> field<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.469> flip

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
causes the sun's magnetic field to flip

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.270 
causes the sun's magnetic field to flip
well<00:00:59.910> inside<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.020> Sun<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.010> solid

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
well inside the Sun it's not a solid

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.789 
well inside the Sun it's not a solid
body<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.510> rotates<00:01:03.719> at<00:01:04.110> different<00:01:04.500> speeds

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
body so it rotates at different speeds

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.450 
body so it rotates at different speeds
at<00:01:05.070> different<00:01:05.100> places<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.479> generates

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
at different places and this generates

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.370 
at different places and this generates
magnetic<00:01:08.460> field<00:01:08.790> via<00:01:09.570> something<00:01:10.020> called<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
magnetic field via something called a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.490 
magnetic field via something called a
solar<00:01:10.680> dynamo<00:01:11.250> these<00:01:12.030> magnetic<00:01:12.510> fields<00:01:13.200> are

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
solar dynamo these magnetic fields are

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.980 
solar dynamo these magnetic fields are
generated<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:14.610> their<00:01:14.880> increase<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.630> strength

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
generated and their increase in strength

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.530 
generated and their increase in strength
rising<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> surface<00:01:16.979> giving<00:01:17.549> us<00:01:17.790> sunspots

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
rising to the surface giving us sunspots

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.140 
rising to the surface giving us sunspots
and<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.560> gives<00:01:19.890> us<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.130> solar<00:01:20.490> activity

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
and this gives us the solar activity

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.719 
and this gives us the solar activity
that<00:01:21.450> we're<00:01:21.570> talking<00:01:21.960> about<00:01:22.220> this<00:01:23.220> whole

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that we're talking about this whole

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.690 
that we're talking about this whole
process<00:01:24.290> happens<00:01:25.290> over<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.009> timescale<00:01:26.549> of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
process happens over a timescale of

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.920 
process happens over a timescale of
roughly<00:01:27.420> 11<00:01:28.020> years<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.740> call<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.490> solar

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
roughly 11 years we call this the solar

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.710 
roughly 11 years we call this the solar
cycle<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:32.040> solar<00:01:32.369> cycle<00:01:32.729> goes<00:01:33.210> from<00:01:33.509> being

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
cycle the solar cycle goes from being

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.819 
cycle the solar cycle goes from being
very<00:01:34.470> weak<00:01:35.030> with<00:01:36.030> low<00:01:36.270> activity<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:37.439> high

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
very weak with low activity to high

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.730 
very weak with low activity to high
activity<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:39.240> back<00:01:39.509> down<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.930> low<00:01:40.110> activity

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
activity then back down to low activity

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.550 
activity then back down to low activity
but<00:01:41.430> what's<00:01:41.640> exciting<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.540> us<00:01:42.570> right<00:01:42.840> now<00:01:42.899> is

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
but what's exciting for us right now is

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.370 
but what's exciting for us right now is
that<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.579> near<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.360> peak<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.229> activity

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that we are near this peak of activity

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.120 
that we are near this peak of activity
and<00:01:47.130> what<00:01:47.820> also<00:01:48.060> happens<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.500> that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and what also happens with that is that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.880 
and what also happens with that is that
the<00:01:50.369> orientation<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.200> sun's<00:01:52.560> magnetic

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the orientation of the sun's magnetic

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.410 
the orientation of the sun's magnetic
field<00:01:54.890> reverses<00:01:55.890> itself<00:01:56.280> switches<00:01:57.270> places

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
field reverses itself switches places

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.530 
field reverses itself switches places
and<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.369> what's<00:01:59.610> happening<00:02:00.210> right

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and so this is what's happening right

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.200 
and so this is what's happening right
now<00:02:00.600> because<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.979> are<00:02:02.009> near<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.790> solar

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
now because we are near this solar

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.160 
now because we are near this solar
maximum<00:02:03.719> period<00:02:05.600> what<00:02:06.600> does<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.899> mean<00:02:07.140> for

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
maximum period what does this mean for

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.540 
maximum period what does this mean for
the<00:02:07.439> earth

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
