00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.819
 let's make flowers we have thrown two 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.580
 milk glasses and now for each glass 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.830
 we throw two tablespoons of sugar if it is 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.799
 showing four tablespoons and now 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.110
 let's also take two tablespoons of 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.370
 flour one for each glass of milk and two 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:24.130
 eggs an egg for each glass and we beat 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.470
 we beat so that the lumps of flour 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.260
 dissolve if it stays too loose 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.110
 we put a tad more than flour we have 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.550
 a flower mold that likes to 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.730
 we have doubled a bit because we like it 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.620
 more do so click is worth this 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.020
 mold what we are going to do is temper it 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.090
 in a hot oil that we have already 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.890
 since we have put it in a 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.050
 casserole but in theory you would have 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.710
 put it in a pan because we shake it 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.800
 we heat it at the same time as the oil 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.690
 we put in our mixture and to the pan 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.670
 in our case casserole because here not 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.000
 we have time with a knife and 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.280
 fork quoted we took off from the lateral and 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.850
 we take out with the skimmer 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.720
 when we take out it is soft it hardens 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.299
 then hardens afterwards and nothing else 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.680
 take out what we do is sprinkle with 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.670
 a little sugar 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:25.130
 we heat our flower now we pass 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.020
 for the mixture and the pan if it is 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.160
 all very hot our mold 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.800
 hot the oil there is no 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.810
 problem is loose we turn around with 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.410
 be careful with the fork and we take out because 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.450
 As you can see, it 's very kind as if it were 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.850
 an omelette but then hardens the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.890
 dry it is better to take out with a 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.450
 skimmer and now what we do is 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.450
 take a little sugar 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.660
 We give in the dough and we go to the pan 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.020
 we turn around and then we take out what 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.760
 we do once we take it out when 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.160
 we take softly sprinkle with 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.539
 sugar glas our new first to 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.950
 beginning leave regular then little to 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.030
 little go well when it goes 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.030
 heating the oil
