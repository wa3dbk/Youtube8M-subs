00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
bathroom for an RV there's a few other

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.049 
bathroom for an RV there's a few other
brand<00:00:37.800> names<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.280> I've<00:00:38.399> not<00:00:38.610> personally

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
brand names that I've not personally

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.060 
brand names that I've not personally
tested<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.899> desiccant<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.800> me<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.040> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
tested but a desiccant to me is a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.770 
tested but a desiccant to me is a
desiccant<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> think<00:00:41.940> any<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.450> them<00:00:42.629> would

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
desiccant so I think any of them would

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.139 
desiccant so I think any of them would
probably<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.620> trick<00:00:43.739> there's<00:00:44.610> dry<00:00:44.940> it

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
probably do the trick there's dry it

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.580 
probably do the trick there's dry it
there's<00:00:45.420> damp<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.870> there's<00:00:46.079> quite<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> few<00:00:46.500> of

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
there's damp it there's quite a few of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.650 
there's damp it there's quite a few of
them<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> market<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.460> actually<00:00:47.910> use<00:00:48.360> one

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
them on the market I actually use one

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.910 
them on the market I actually use one
that<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.870> actually<00:00:49.140> bought<00:00:49.469> at<00:00:49.649> one<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
that I actually bought at one of the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
that I actually bought at one of the
big-box<00:00:50.309> stores<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.660> replaceable

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
big-box stores and it's a replaceable

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.650 
big-box stores and it's a replaceable
desiccant<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.100> comes<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.660> little

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
desiccant that comes with a little

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.740 
desiccant that comes with a little
self-contained<00:00:55.730> container<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.510> it

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
self-contained container that as it

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.540 
self-contained container that as it
absorbs<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> moisture<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.890> actually<00:00:59.219> stores

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
absorbs the moisture it actually stores

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.580 
absorbs the moisture it actually stores
the<00:00:59.789> water<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.359> do<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> periodically

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
the water I do have to periodically

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590 
the water I do have to periodically
empty<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.520> doesn't<00:01:02.670> spill<00:01:03.030> over<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.449> we

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
empty it so it doesn't spill over as we

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.539 
empty it so it doesn't spill over as we
travel<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> bottom<00:01:04.920> line<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.369> does

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
travel but the bottom line is it does

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.240 
travel but the bottom line is it does
work<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:05.880> any<00:01:06.240> type<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.510> desiccant<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.380> extreme

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
work so any type of desiccant in extreme

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.910 
work so any type of desiccant in extreme
situations<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.960> may<00:01:10.170> need<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> purchase<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
situations you may need to purchase a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.190 
situations you may need to purchase a
dehumidifier<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.510> don't<00:01:12.689> say<00:01:12.869> where<00:01:13.080> you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
dehumidifier and you don't say where you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.350 
dehumidifier and you don't say where you
live<00:01:13.439> Suzy<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:13.950> I'm<00:01:14.010> not<00:01:14.159> sure<00:01:14.369> what<00:01:14.549> your<00:01:14.790> your

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
atmosphere would be like in your area

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.130 
atmosphere would be like in your area
but<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.820> some<00:01:21.030> cases<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.750> real<00:01:21.930> moist

but in some cases in a real moist

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.440 
but in some cases in a real moist
climate<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.490> might<00:01:23.759> need<00:01:23.970> an<00:01:24.150> actual

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
climate you might need an actual

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.590 
climate you might need an actual
dehumidifier<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.640> periodically<00:01:26.640> remove<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
dehumidifier to periodically remove the

dehumidifier to periodically remove the
moisture<00:01:27.780> from<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.350> there<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.890> obviously<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
moisture from in there and obviously the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.819 
moisture from in there and obviously the
big<00:01:29.909> thing<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.560> good

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
big thing is to is to have a good

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.730 
big thing is to is to have a good
ventilation<00:01:32.189> throughout<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> RV<00:01:33.650> even<00:01:34.650> in

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the cold winter time it's not a bad idea

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.100 
the cold winter time it's not a bad idea
to<00:01:36.600> leave<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.110> roof<00:01:37.590> vent<00:01:37.619> open<00:01:38.220> pop<00:01:39.110> preferably

products there's a lot of wood products

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.670 
products there's a lot of wood products
in<00:02:55.909> an<00:02:56.030> RV<00:02:56.359> and<00:02:56.510> that<00:02:56.959> just<00:02:57.290> acts<00:02:57.469> like<00:02:57.590> a

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
in an RV and that just acts like a

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.979 
in an RV and that just acts like a
sponge<00:02:58.159> and<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.969> soaks<00:02:59.180> up<00:02:59.419> that<00:02:59.599> moisture

sponge and it soaks up that moisture

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.470 
sponge and it soaks up that moisture
making<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.409> more<00:03:00.620> difficult<00:03:00.829> for<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.549> to<00:03:01.579> to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
making it more difficult for it to to

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.530 
making it more difficult for it to to
dry<00:03:02.750> out<00:03:02.959> later<00:03:03.650> on<00:03:03.889> so<00:03:04.579> dehumidifier<00:03:05.359> if
