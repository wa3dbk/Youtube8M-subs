00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the UFOs all seem to be robots and you

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.649 
the UFOs all seem to be robots and you
get<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> lot<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.710> same<00:01:11.010> types<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.939> parts<00:01:12.450> in

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
get a lot of the same types of parts in

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.719 
get a lot of the same types of parts in
these<00:01:12.869> let<00:01:13.320> these<00:01:13.560> little<00:01:13.799> angle<00:01:14.159> pieces<00:01:14.520> with

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
these let these little angle pieces with

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.929 
these let these little angle pieces with
the<00:01:14.850> UFO<00:01:15.330> pattern<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> lot<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.490> trends

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the UFO pattern get a lot of the trends

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.249 
the UFO pattern get a lot of the trends
neon<00:01:18.360> he<00:01:19.170> goes<00:01:19.350> neon<00:01:19.830> green<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:21.110> think<00:01:22.110> that's

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
neon he goes neon green I think that's

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.830 
neon he goes neon green I think that's
the<00:01:22.380> color<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.880> basically<00:01:24.210> he's<00:01:24.509> got<00:01:24.689> this

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the color so basically he's got this

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.700 
the color so basically he's got this
little<00:01:25.020> Rover

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
little Rover

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.590 
little Rover
he's<00:01:26.220> got<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> little<00:01:26.700> container<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.330> back

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
he's got a little container in the back

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.530 
he's got a little container in the back
that<00:01:27.869> has<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:31.579> here's<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> little<00:01:32.790> tile<00:01:33.030> with

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
that has the here's a little tile with

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.929 
that has the here's a little tile with
this<00:01:33.689> control<00:01:34.110> panel<00:01:34.350> maybe<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.400> what's

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
this control panel maybe that's what's

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.520 
this control panel maybe that's what's
making<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.390> go<00:01:36.570> or<00:01:36.840> maybe<00:01:37.020> that's<00:01:37.259> what<00:01:37.409> he

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
making it go or maybe that's what he

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.460 
making it go or maybe that's what he
stole<00:01:37.799> from<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.479> lego<00:01:39.479> astronauts<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> that's

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
stole from the lego astronauts so that's

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.840 
stole from the lego astronauts so that's
what<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> back<00:01:43.950> looks<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.700> there's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
what the back looks like so there's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.300 
what the back looks like so there's
really<00:01:47.970> nothing<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:49.020> get<00:01:49.619> some<00:01:49.799> thrusters

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
really nothing to it get some thrusters

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.920 
really nothing to it get some thrusters
in<00:01:50.490> there<00:01:50.990> some<00:01:51.990> 1<00:01:52.229> by<00:01:52.380> 1<00:01:52.560> round<00:01:52.799> bricks<00:01:53.399> there

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
in there some 1 by 1 round bricks there

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.039 
in there some 1 by 1 round bricks there
this<00:01:54.930> piece<00:01:55.259> goes<00:01:56.159> up<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.840> guess<00:01:57.840> those<00:01:57.990> are

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
this piece goes up I guess those are

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.870 
this piece goes up I guess those are
back<00:01:58.439> up<00:01:58.680> control<00:01:59.070> panels<00:01:59.460> because<00:01:59.549> he's<00:01:59.729> got

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
back up control panels because he's got

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.530 
back up control panels because he's got
two<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.090> them

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
two of them

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.749 
two of them
beside<00:02:01.079> there<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.159> think<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.460> finding

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
beside there but I think it's finding

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.670 
beside there but I think it's finding
the<00:02:02.820> way<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.930> lay<00:02:04.110> him<00:02:04.259> all<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.560> way

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
the way you have to lay him all the way

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.869 
the way you have to lay him all the way
back<00:02:04.759> just<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:05.850> he's<00:02:06.030> taking<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.450> nap<00:02:07.879> when

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
back just like he's taking a nap when

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.130 
back just like he's taking a nap when
he's<00:02:09.000> driving

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
he's driving

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.520 
he's driving
so<00:02:11.140> let's<00:02:11.440> take<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.950> drawing<00:02:12.550> look<00:02:12.850> at<00:02:13.030> it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
so let's take the drawing look at it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.340 
so let's take the drawing look at it
okay<00:02:14.530> here's<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.010> blue<00:02:15.250> Droid<00:02:16.110> he<00:02:17.110> almost

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
okay here's the blue Droid he almost

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.530 
okay here's the blue Droid he almost
looks<00:02:17.650> mismatched<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.670> even<00:02:18.910> get<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.390> right

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
looks mismatched I even get the right

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.030 
looks mismatched I even get the right
figure<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:21.660> tell<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.440> just<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.800> weird

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
figure I tell you it's just a weird

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.559 
figure I tell you it's just a weird
hodgepodge<00:02:24.400> of<00:02:25.240> color<00:02:25.870> there<00:02:27.209> guess<00:02:28.209> it<00:02:28.360> looks

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
hodgepodge of color there guess it looks

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.930 
hodgepodge of color there guess it looks
neat<00:02:28.780> take<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.380> back

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
neat take it to the back

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.100 
neat take it to the back
except<00:02:30.940> for<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.150> blue<00:02:31.300> head<00:02:31.569> you<00:02:31.840> couldn't

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
except for the blue head you couldn't

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.990 
except for the blue head you couldn't
tell<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.290> was<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.770> Ratan<00:02:33.280> person<00:02:33.880> or

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
tell that was like a Ratan person or

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.309

crazy<00:02:44.230> about<00:02:44.530> this<00:02:44.830> theme<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.190> mean<00:02:45.519> there<00:02:45.700> are

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
crazy about this theme I mean there are

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.479

some<00:02:45.910> good<00:02:45.970> details<00:02:46.660> or<00:02:47.110> some<00:02:48.040> things<00:02:48.250> that

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
some good details or some things that

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.610 
some good details or some things that
look<00:02:48.640> very<00:02:48.820> colorful<00:02:49.570> about<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.410> is

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
look very colorful about it and this is

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.520 
look very colorful about it and this is
a<00:02:50.650> colorful<00:02:51.040> minifigure<00:02:51.880> but<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.440> don't<00:02:53.440> think

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
a colorful minifigure but I don't think

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.030 
a colorful minifigure but I don't think
it<00:02:53.680> has<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:53.950> appeal<00:02:55.620> because<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.830> don't<00:02:56.980> know

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
it has the appeal because I don't know

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.970 
it has the appeal because I don't know
if<00:02:57.100> we<00:02:57.190> can<00:02:57.340> relate<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.700> them<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.739> mean<00:02:59.739> if<00:02:59.860> it

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
if we can relate to them I mean if it

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.580 
if we can relate to them I mean if it
was<00:03:00.130> like<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.310> Martian<00:03:00.880> or<00:03:01.120> something<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:02.500> way

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
was like a Martian or something the way

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.199 
was like a Martian or something the way
people<00:03:02.920> would<00:03:02.980> depict<00:03:03.250> Martians<00:03:03.819> somebody

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
people would depict Martians somebody

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.370 
people would depict Martians somebody
might<00:03:04.330> like<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.720> but<00:03:05.019> just<00:03:05.440> this<00:03:05.620> droid<00:03:06.010> it's

I'm<00:03:08.380> just<00:03:08.590> not<00:03:08.739> crazy<00:03:08.920> about<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:09.730> it's

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
nothing fancy there and then get the

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.199 
nothing fancy there and then get the
same<00:03:42.700> with<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.690> box<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.530> shows<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:45.700> alternate

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
same with the box it shows the alternate

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.800 
same with the box it shows the alternate
builds<00:03:46.840> doesn't<00:03:47.709> show<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.040> other<00:03:48.190> sets<00:03:48.810> but

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
builds doesn't show the other sets but

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.750 
builds doesn't show the other sets but
that<00:03:50.170> is<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.380> UFO<00:03:50.980> set<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:53.019> raid<00:03:53.260> on<00:03:53.549> rover<00:03:54.549> I

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
guess that's what the little device he

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.640 
guess that's what the little device he
has<00:03:57.220> in<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.910> back<00:03:58.090> was<00:03:58.420> for<00:03:58.930> looking<00:03:59.290> for
