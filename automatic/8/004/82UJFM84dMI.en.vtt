00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
a vampiric state and this whole word

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.250 
a vampiric state and this whole word
discrepancy<00:02:25.239> between<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.599> healing<00:02:26.140> and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
discrepancy between is healing and

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.449 
discrepancy between is healing and
everything<00:02:26.680> that's<00:02:26.800> put<00:02:27.010> out<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.250> see<00:02:27.400> is

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
everything that's put out you see is

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.820 
everything that's put out you see is
affected<00:02:27.880> by<00:02:28.000> sunlight<00:02:28.540> now<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.080> basically

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
affected by sunlight now and basically

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.720 
affected by sunlight now and basically
what<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.099> thought<00:02:30.250> was<00:02:30.370> happening<00:02:30.670> is

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
what I thought was happening is

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.520 
what I thought was happening is
happening<00:02:30.870> showing<00:02:31.870> more<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.110> his<00:02:32.230> vampire

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
happening showing more of his vampire

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.290 
happening showing more of his vampire
traits<00:02:32.739> but<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.980> destination<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.700> he<00:02:34.090> is

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
traits but the destination that he is

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.729 
traits but the destination that he is
because<00:02:34.599> he<00:02:34.720> relied<00:02:35.019> on<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.200> healing<00:02:35.590> power

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
because he relied on the healing power

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.680 
because he relied on the healing power
too<00:02:36.010> much<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.790> he<00:02:36.910> was<00:02:37.030> always<00:02:37.360> trust<00:02:37.599> her

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
too much that he was always trust her

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.330 
too much that he was always trust her
into<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.050> state<00:02:38.260> because<00:02:38.650> he<00:02:38.980> needed<00:02:39.250> to

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
into that state because he needed to

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.440 
into that state because he needed to

his timeline he has been relying heavily

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.309 
his timeline he has been relying heavily
on<00:02:57.090> his<00:02:58.090> vampiric<00:02:58.510> abilities<00:02:58.569> but<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:58.989> kind<00:02:59.290> of

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
on his vampiric abilities but I kind of

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.630 
on his vampiric abilities but I kind of
think<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.590> explanation<00:03:00.069> is<00:03:00.160> half<00:03:00.310> as<00:03:00.489> it

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
think the explanation is half as it

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.830 
think the explanation is half as it
makes<00:03:00.790> sense<00:03:00.940> within<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.360> world<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.599> motive

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
makes sense within the world of motive

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.170 
makes sense within the world of motive
