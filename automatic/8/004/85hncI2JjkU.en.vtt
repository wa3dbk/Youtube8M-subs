00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
the pivoting action so the next thing I

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.910 
the pivoting action so the next thing I
do<00:01:08.029> is<00:01:08.389> just<00:01:08.600> push<00:01:08.810> it<00:01:08.959> out<00:01:09.109> as<00:01:09.319> far<00:01:09.560> as<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:09.740> can

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
do is just push it out as far as you can

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.039 
do is just push it out as far as you can
till<00:01:10.189> you<00:01:10.340> kind<00:01:10.549> of<00:01:10.639> see<00:01:10.880> a<00:01:10.909> free<00:01:11.299> space<00:01:11.630> here

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
till you kind of see a free space here

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.349 
till you kind of see a free space here
and<00:01:12.439> it's<00:01:13.039> important<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.549> kind<00:01:13.759> of<00:01:13.909> pull<00:01:14.119> from

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:14.359 
and it's important to kind of pull from

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.419 
and it's important to kind of pull from
the<00:01:14.450> middle<00:01:14.749> on<00:01:14.869> this<00:01:15.139> so<00:01:15.439> I<00:01:15.469> kind<00:01:16.009> of<00:01:16.039> use<00:01:16.219> this

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
the middle on this so I kind of use this

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:19.359 
the middle on this so I kind of use this
little<00:01:16.789> locking<00:01:17.689> mechanism<00:01:18.319> as<00:01:18.469> a<00:01:18.529> guide<00:01:18.859> and

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
little locking mechanism as a guide and

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.300 
little locking mechanism as a guide and
just<00:01:19.670> pull<00:01:20.029> right<00:01:20.060> at<00:01:20.420> that<00:01:20.569> point<00:01:20.990> or<00:01:21.679> push<00:01:22.099> I

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
just pull right at that point or push I

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.589 
just pull right at that point or push I
guess<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:22.819> you're<00:01:22.969> what<00:01:23.060> you're<00:01:23.209> doing<00:01:23.479> is

00:01:23.589 --> 00:01:23.599 
guess and you're what you're doing is

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:25.089 
guess and you're what you're doing is
you're<00:01:23.749> pushing<00:01:24.109> the<00:01:24.229> window<00:01:24.529> around<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.069> that

00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:25.099 
you're pushing the window around so that

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:28.089 
you're pushing the window around so that
the<00:01:25.369> inside<00:01:25.819> is<00:01:26.179> on<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:26.990> outside<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.709> now<00:01:28.039> you

00:01:28.089 --> 00:01:28.099 
the inside is on the outside and now you

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:29.739 
the inside is on the outside and now you
can<00:01:28.429> wash<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.999> outside<00:01:29.029> from<00:01:29.599> the<00:01:29.719> inside

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
can wash the outside from the inside

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:31.809 
can wash the outside from the inside
it's<00:01:30.649> really<00:01:31.009> very<00:01:31.130> simple

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
gonna pull that back again line it back

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.080 
gonna pull that back again line it back
