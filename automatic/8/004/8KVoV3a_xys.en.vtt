while we're only expecting a tenth of an
inch<00:00:51.390> up<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.410> want<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> couple

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
inch up here it want to be a couple

inch up here it want to be a couple
tenths<00:00:53.399> immense<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> very<00:00:54.360> dangerous

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
tenths immense of and a very dangerous

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.959 
tenths immense of and a very dangerous
situation<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> icing<00:00:56.070> before<00:00:56.789> that

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
situation of here the icing before that

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.610 
situation of here the icing before that
changed<00:00:57.239> over<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.539> snow<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.530> have

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
changed over to snow and then we have

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.229 
changed over to snow and then we have
another<00:00:58.649> round<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.129> precipitation<00:00:59.550> coming<00:01:00.090> in

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
another round of precipitation coming in

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.639 
another round of precipitation coming in
for<00:01:00.420> our<00:01:00.510> southern<00:01:00.780> areas<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.469> did

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
for our southern areas here like we did

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.910 
for our southern areas here like we did
expect<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.190> did<00:01:02.430> did<00:01:02.910> come<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:04.229> expected

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
expect this did did come in as expected

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.399 
expect this did did come in as expected
here<00:01:05.330> so<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.570> one<00:01:06.750> area<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.020> worked<00:01:07.260> out

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
here so that is one area that worked out

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.630 
here so that is one area that worked out
would<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.650> never<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.950> couple<00:01:08.220> tenths<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.520> an

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
would you never a couple tenths of an

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.550 
would you never a couple tenths of an
inch<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.939> ice<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> know<00:01:10.170> freezing

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
inch of ice and if you know freezing

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560 
inch of ice and if you know freezing
rain<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.830> sleet<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.640> didn't<00:01:11.939> end<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.270> snow

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
rain and sleet that didn't end up a snow

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.899 
rain and sleet that didn't end up a snow
before<00:01:13.200> ending<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.950> inside<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.549> cut<00:01:14.700> some

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
before ending here inside to cut some

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.850 
before ending here inside to cut some
coatings<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.570> an<00:01:15.810> inch<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.590> down<00:01:16.740> in

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860

expected here what happened with this

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.960 
expected here what happened with this
system<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.439> or<00:01:22.560> why<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:23.310> starved

area here so this was over Virginia when
this<00:01:47.399> happened<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.939> sort<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.149> blowing<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:48.509> up

this happened is sort of blowing up up

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.440 
this happened is sort of blowing up up
in<00:01:48.869> here<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.409> was<00:01:49.439> expected<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.329> we<00:01:51.329> would

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
in here like it was expected to we would

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.359 
in here like it was expected to we would
have<00:01:51.540> had<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> lot<00:01:51.840> more<00:01:51.869> snow<00:01:52.259> up<00:01:52.439> here<00:01:52.470> as

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
have had a lot more snow up here as

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.670 
have had a lot more snow up here as
projected<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.210> northeast<00:01:54.659> PA<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:54.990> that's<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
projected in northeast PA so that's the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.399 
projected in northeast PA so that's the
deal<00:01:55.799> with<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.040> let's<00:01:56.790> move<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.409> the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
snow here along the coastline that's

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.229 
snow here along the coastline that's
actually<00:03:16.830> modern<00:03:17.280> snowfall<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.940> New<00:03:18.060> York

actually modern snowfall to New York

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.470 
actually modern snowfall to New York
City<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:19.290> it's<00:03:19.650> starting<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.040> bring<00:03:20.250> in<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.820> if<00:03:21.330> I

City so it's starting to bring in a if I

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.970 
City so it's starting to bring in a if I
starting<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.870> give<00:03:21.959> up<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.320> idea<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.709> there

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
starting to give up the idea that there

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.800 
starting to give up the idea that there
could<00:03:23.040> be<00:03:23.190> some<00:03:23.489> snow<00:03:23.760> here<00:03:24.030> on<00:03:24.239> Thursday<00:03:24.720> and

could be some snow here on Thursday and

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.690 
could be some snow here on Thursday and
some<00:03:24.930> coastal<00:03:25.320> enhancement<00:03:25.950> as<00:03:26.040> well<00:03:26.250> so

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
some coastal enhancement as well so

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.170 
some coastal enhancement as well so
we're<00:03:27.690> looking<00:03:27.810> at<00:03:28.140> mostly<00:03:28.860> mostly<00:03:29.640> area<00:03:30.000> gets

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
we're looking at mostly mostly area gets

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.440 
we're looking at mostly mostly area gets
a<00:03:30.300> 12<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.780> 1<00:03:31.140> 2<00:03:31.230> 3<00:03:31.260> inch<00:03:31.680> type<00:03:31.920> snowfall<00:03:32.459> we're

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
a 12 to 1 2 3 inch type snowfall we're

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.640 
a 12 to 1 2 3 inch type snowfall we're
going<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.600> watch<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:34.019> coastal<00:03:34.410> development

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
going to watch this coastal development

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.350 
going to watch this coastal development
here<00:03:35.100> for<00:03:35.400> areas<00:03:35.700> along<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.910> coast<00:03:36.180> here

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
here for areas along the coast here

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.520 
here for areas along the coast here
could<00:03:36.600> bump<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> little<00:03:37.230> bit<00:03:37.290> higher<00:03:37.500> than

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
could bump that a little bit higher than

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.170 
could bump that a little bit higher than
three<00:03:37.980> inches<00:03:38.070> could<00:03:38.370> be<00:03:38.459> some<00:03:38.640> four<00:03:38.850> or<00:03:38.880> five

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
three inches could be some four or five

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.570 
three inches could be some four or five
inch<00:03:39.390> amounts<00:03:39.630> if<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.080> were<00:03:40.260> correct<00:03:40.650> but

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
inch amounts if this were correct but

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.340 
inch amounts if this were correct but
we're<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> little<00:03:42.090> bit<00:03:42.299> too<00:03:42.540> early<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:43.019> jump<00:03:43.230> the

should be Saturday night and sun

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.480 
should be Saturday night and sun
day<00:04:25.419> here<00:04:25.810> in<00:04:25.990> this<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.349> looks<00:04:27.099> like<00:04:27.250> could<00:04:27.400> be

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
day here in this I looks like could be

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.800 
day here in this I looks like could be
another<00:04:27.699> another<00:04:28.090> system<00:04:28.419> that<00:04:28.569> could<00:04:28.660> be

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
another another system that could be

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.990 
another another system that could be
developing<00:04:29.440> right<00:04:30.099> along<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.400> coastline<00:04:30.849> now

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
developing right along the coastline now

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.400 
developing right along the coastline now
this<00:04:31.210> one<00:04:31.449> actually<00:04:31.660> does<00:04:31.870> look<00:04:31.930> like<00:04:32.169> much

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
this one actually does look like much

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.899 
this one actually does look like much
here<00:04:32.590> in<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.740> models<00:04:33.069> right<00:04:33.190> now<00:04:33.250> but<00:04:33.520> i<00:04:33.580> think

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
here in the models right now but i think

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.969 
here in the models right now but i think
this<00:04:34.090> one<00:04:34.150> actually<00:04:34.509> might<00:04:35.500> have<00:04:35.680> a<00:04:35.710> better

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
this one actually might have a better

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.249 
this one actually might have a better
opportunity<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.940> produce<00:04:37.120> then<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.020> first

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
opportunity to produce then the first

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.159 
opportunity to produce then the first
one<00:04:38.500> did<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.039> that's<00:04:39.639> because<00:04:40.020> when<00:04:41.020> that

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
one did and that's because when that

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.460 
one did and that's because when that
system<00:04:41.530> goes<00:04:41.710> up<00:04:41.919> into<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:43.750> you<00:04:44.229> know<00:04:44.349> after

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
system goes up into the you know after

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.469 
system goes up into the you know after
kit<00:04:44.830> blows<00:04:45.159> up<00:04:45.340> in<00:04:45.460> this<00:04:45.550> big<00:04:45.759> storm<00:04:46.060> it's<00:04:46.270> just

south of boston here and heads up to the

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.510 
south of boston here and heads up to the
northeast<00:04:49.180> it<00:04:49.479> might<00:04:50.080> actually<00:04:50.289> be<00:04:50.860> doing<00:04:51.250> so

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
northeast it might actually be doing so

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.189 
northeast it might actually be doing so
quick<00:04:51.789> enough<00:04:52.090> here<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.360> allow<00:04:52.690> this<00:04:52.900> one<00:04:53.110> to

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
quick enough here to allow this one to

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.790 
quick enough here to allow this one to
slow<00:04:53.500> down<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:54.009> dig<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.340> little<00:04:54.520> bit<00:04:54.669> more<00:04:54.970> and

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
slow down and dig a little bit more and

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.010 
slow down and dig a little bit more and
allow<00:04:56.800> a<00:04:57.129> block<00:04:57.669> to<00:04:57.699> form<00:04:58.240> so<00:04:58.569> if<00:04:58.720> that's<00:04:58.900> the

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
allow a block to form so if that's the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.260 
allow a block to form so if that's the
case<00:04:59.229> so<00:04:59.560> this<00:04:59.710> is<00:04:59.800> being<00:05:00.009> way<00:05:00.159> out<00:05:00.310> here<00:05:00.759> you

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
case so this is being way out here you

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.820 
case so this is being way out here you
could<00:05:01.419> have<00:05:01.509> something<00:05:01.840> sitting<00:05:02.050> right<00:05:02.349> here

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
could have something sitting right here

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.580 
could have something sitting right here
and<00:05:03.039> very<00:05:03.159> strong<00:05:03.699> and<00:05:04.090> phased<00:05:04.630> because<00:05:05.259> this

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
and very strong and phased because this

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.710 
and very strong and phased because this
you<00:05:06.250> know<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:06.460> storm<00:05:06.699> that<00:05:06.819> was<00:05:07.090> moving

is set upon by a fifty-fifty low or a
block<00:05:12.210> for<00:05:13.210> this<00:05:13.360> next<00:05:13.569> system<00:05:13.780> something

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
block for this next system something

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.990

going to be watching here but there's a
very<00:05:16.090> good<00:05:16.300> opportunity<00:05:16.599> for<00:05:16.960> that<00:05:17.199> to<00:05:17.259> happen

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
very good opportunity for that to happen

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.100 
very good opportunity for that to happen
and<00:05:18.699> actually<00:05:19.000> like<00:05:19.180> this<00:05:19.360> system<00:05:19.690> on<00:05:19.810> Sunday

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
and actually like this system on Sunday

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.930 
and actually like this system on Sunday
a<00:05:20.139> little<00:05:20.380> bit<00:05:20.469> better<00:05:20.560> than<00:05:20.830> I<00:05:20.889> do<00:05:20.949> the<00:05:21.729> one<00:05:21.909> on

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
a little bit better than I do the one on

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.430 
a little bit better than I do the one on
Thursday<00:05:22.419> for<00:05:22.569> this<00:05:22.659> coastal<00:05:22.990> development<00:05:23.199> i

you know this area here you know what
this<00:05:54.190> the<00:05:54.340> way<00:05:54.430> to<00:05:54.460> say<00:05:54.759> the<00:05:55.330> couple<00:05:55.539> different

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
this the way to say the couple different

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:56.760 
this the way to say the couple different
things<00:05:55.960> were<00:05:56.110> going<00:05:56.229> to<00:05:56.289> look<00:05:56.380> at<00:05:56.529> for<00:05:56.650> the

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
things were going to look at for the

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.170 
things were going to look at for the
next<00:05:56.949> couple<00:05:57.099> days<00:05:57.370> here<00:05:57.610> to<00:05:57.759> determine<00:05:57.940> that

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
next couple days here to determine that

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.089 
next couple days here to determine that
right<00:05:58.360> now<00:05:58.509> I'm<00:05:58.569> leaning<00:05:58.690> against<00:05:59.289> that

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
right now I'm leaning against that

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.309 
right now I'm leaning against that
happening<00:06:00.460> for<00:06:00.669> thursday<00:06:01.060> but<00:06:01.779> sunday<00:06:02.289> is

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319

happening for thursday but sunday is
still<00:06:02.620> in<00:06:02.710> the<00:06:02.830> game<00:06:02.979> for<00:06:03.400> something<00:06:03.789> like

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
still in the game for something like

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.249 
still in the game for something like
that<00:06:04.060> happened<00:06:04.419> especially<00:06:04.539> a<00:06:04.870> thursday

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259 
that happened especially a thursday

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:06.809 
that happened especially a thursday
system<00:06:05.590> that's<00:06:05.740> up<00:06:05.889> to<00:06:06.039> block<00:06:06.340> sets<00:06:06.639> of<00:06:06.759> a

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:06.819 
system that's up to block sets of a

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.719 
system that's up to block sets of a
block<00:06:07.300> up<00:06:07.539> here<00:06:07.960> for<00:06:08.710> the<00:06:08.860> next<00:06:09.009> system<00:06:09.310> and

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
block up here for the next system and

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.959 
block up here for the next system and
that<00:06:10.419> would<00:06:10.539> be<00:06:10.659> in<00:06:10.750> this<00:06:10.870> sunday<00:06:11.699> time<00:06:12.699> frame

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
and then we're going to be looking at

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.230 
and then we're going to be looking at
yet<00:06:14.259> another<00:06:14.409> system<00:06:15.190> coming<00:06:15.250> in<00:06:15.639> here<00:06:15.909> in<00:06:16.090> the

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
yet another system coming in here in the

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.159 
something that's just the cuts in it

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:32.580 
something that's just the cuts in it
gives<00:06:30.310> us<00:06:30.430> mixed<00:06:30.699> precipitation<00:06:30.940> or<00:06:31.599> you<00:06:32.500> know

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:36.219 
going over to a mixer or even range so

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:37.019 
going over to a mixer or even range so
there's<00:06:36.430> a<00:06:36.460> lot<00:06:36.580> of<00:06:36.610> different<00:06:36.880> possibilities
