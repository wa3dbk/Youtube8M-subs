00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.560 
all the way up to x 4 and that just
multiplies<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.740> money<00:01:29.009> even<00:01:29.280> more<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.729> so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
multiplies your money even more and so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.359 
multiplies your money even more and so
you<00:01:31.109> can<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.560> about<00:01:31.649> three<00:01:31.740> times<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
you can do this about three times in a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.410 
you can do this about three times in a
row<00:01:32.399> before<00:01:32.609> you<00:01:32.789> have<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.180> repair

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
row before you have to go to a repair

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.849 
row before you have to go to a repair
shop<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.840> something<00:01:33.930> like<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
shop or something like that and the

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.200 
shop or something like that and the
reason<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.189> chose<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.399> place<00:01:35.700> guys<00:01:35.969> is

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
reason I chose this place guys is

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.639 
reason I chose this place guys is
because<00:01:36.479> there's<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> repair<00:01:37.049> shop<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.530> down

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
because there's a repair shop just down

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.770 
because there's a repair shop just down
the<00:01:37.920> road<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.340> about<00:01:38.520> 0.3<00:01:39.329> miles<00:01:39.509> away

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the road it's about 0.3 miles away

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.209 
the road it's about 0.3 miles away
something<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.740> after<00:01:40.859> you<00:01:41.009> take

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
something like that so after you take

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.099 
something like that so after you take
the<00:01:41.340> cop<00:01:41.520> out<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:41.939> third<00:01:42.149> try<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.960> just

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
the cop out for your third try you just

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.169 
the cop out for your third try you just
going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.469> the<00:01:43.619> repair<00:01:43.890> shop<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> fix

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
going to go to the repair shop so to fix

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.999 
going to go to the repair shop so to fix
your<00:01:45.329> damage<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.929> full<00:01:46.140> again<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.590> then

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
your damage to get a full again and then

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.109 
your damage to get a full again and then
you<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.189> want<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.399> refill<00:01:47.729> your<00:01:47.759> pursuit

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
you just want to refill your pursuit

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.429 
you just want to refill your pursuit
text<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.659> come<00:01:48.780> back<00:01:48.929> and<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.259> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
text so you can come back and do it and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.080 
text so you can come back and do it and
after<00:01:49.710> three<00:01:49.890> tries<00:01:50.100> you're<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.399> about<00:01:50.820> I

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
after three tries you're out about I

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.660 
after three tries you're out about I
think<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.719> about<00:01:51.780> 300<00:01:52.289> in<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.920> 80<00:01:53.159> 2<00:01:53.369> grand

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
think it's about 300 in like 80 2 grand

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.999 
think it's about 300 in like 80 2 grand
so<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.960> more<00:01:55.170> than<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> quarter<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
so a little more than a quarter of a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.800 
so a little more than a quarter of a
million<00:01:56.219> dollars<00:01:56.609> and<00:01:56.820> speed<00:01:57.329> points<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
million dollars and speed points and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.480 
million dollars and speed points and
then<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.560> do<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.189> or<00:01:59.280> two<00:01:59.369> more

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
then you can do like one or two more

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.639 
then you can do like one or two more
times<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.119> up<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.390> half<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.749> million<00:02:00.960> but

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
times to get up to half a million but

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.709 
times to get up to half a million but
then<00:02:01.799> other<00:02:02.070> cops<00:02:02.490> start<00:02:02.759> coming<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.299> don't

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
then other cops start coming I don't

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.270 
then other cops start coming I don't
know<00:02:03.840> how<00:02:04.049> or<00:02:04.289> why<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.469> must<00:02:04.740> because<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
know how or why it must because of the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.219 
know how or why it must because of the
random<00:02:05.670> cars<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.299> just<00:02:06.450> drive<00:02:06.719> by<00:02:06.960> they

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
random cars that just drive by they

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.870 
random cars that just drive by they
bring<00:02:07.409> coughs<00:02:07.679> along<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.490> get<00:02:08.610> them<00:02:08.759> on

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
bring coughs along and you get them on

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.240 
bring coughs along and you get them on
them<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.300> uh<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.470> get<00:02:10.710> about<00:02:10.890> half<00:02:11.160> a

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
them so uh you just get about half a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.559 
them so uh you just get about half a
million<00:02:11.460> and<00:02:11.700> then<00:02:11.850> you<00:02:11.970> drive<00:02:12.180> at<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.360> safe
