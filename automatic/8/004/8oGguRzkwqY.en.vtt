00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
when he came on for Liverpool he I think

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.170 
when he came on for Liverpool he I think
he<00:04:31.500> must<00:04:31.800> have<00:04:32.010> grown<00:04:32.280> lads<00:04:32.610> he<00:04:32.760> must<00:04:33.090> have

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
he must have grown lads he must have

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.450 
he must have grown lads he must have
grown<00:04:33.360> because<00:04:33.510> he<00:04:34.050> looked<00:04:34.800> tool<00:04:35.100> for

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
grown because he looked tool for

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.340 
grown because he looked tool for
like<00:04:35.610> a<00:04:35.760> senator<00:04:36.180> Kim<00:04:36.300> midfielder<00:04:36.810> I<00:04:36.990> thought

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
like a senator Kim midfielder I thought

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.520 
like a senator Kim midfielder I thought
it<00:04:37.500> looked<00:04:37.620> taller<00:04:37.860> than<00:04:38.070> Henderson<00:04:38.810> so<00:04:39.810> yeah

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
it looked taller than Henderson so yeah

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.260 
it looked taller than Henderson so yeah
I'm<00:04:40.920> not<00:04:41.100> too<00:04:41.250> sure<00:04:41.460> I<00:04:41.490> think<00:04:41.790> he<00:04:41.880> must<00:04:42.060> have

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
I'm not too sure I think he must have

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.020 
I'm not too sure I think he must have
grown<00:04:42.510> at<00:04:42.750> 59<00:04:43.380> thing<00:04:43.740> is<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.860> bit<00:04:44.070> of<00:04:44.130> a<00:04:44.190> lie<00:04:44.430> to

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
grown at 59 thing is a bit of a lie to

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.630 
grown at 59 thing is a bit of a lie to
