00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
up for the final day so I came in to get

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.600 
up for the final day so I came in to get
some<00:00:18.320> sample<00:00:18.770> shots<00:00:18.980> before<00:00:19.190> they<00:00:19.460> get

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
some sample shots before they get

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.120 
some sample shots before they get
overwhelmed<00:00:19.910> with<00:00:20.270> crowds<00:00:20.600> with<00:00:21.290> the<00:00:21.470> d800

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
overwhelmed with crowds with the d800

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.150 
overwhelmed with crowds with the d800
and<00:00:22.190> d800e<00:00:22.900> now<00:00:23.900> I<00:00:23.930> wanted<00:00:24.440> to<00:00:24.530> do<00:00:24.740> some

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
and d800e now I wanted to do some

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.610 
and d800e now I wanted to do some
comparisons<00:00:25.850> between<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.210> d4<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:26.780> the<00:00:26.840> d800

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:27.620 
comparisons between the d4 and the d800

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.560 
comparisons between the d4 and the d800
in<00:00:27.860> high<00:00:28.130> ISO<00:00:28.640> tests<00:00:28.970> I<00:00:29.060> know<00:00:29.120> people<00:00:29.480> are

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
in high ISO tests I know people are

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.820 
in high ISO tests I know people are
really<00:00:29.660> interested<00:00:29.960> in<00:00:30.230> that<00:00:30.440> one<00:00:30.590> so<00:00:30.740> I'll

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
really interested in that one so I'll

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.369 
really interested in that one so I'll
just<00:00:31.040> do<00:00:31.190> some<00:00:31.430> simple<00:00:31.960> side-by-side<00:00:32.960> tests

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
just do some simple side-by-side tests

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.619 
just do some simple side-by-side tests
and<00:00:33.530> then<00:00:33.980> also<00:00:34.190> in<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:34.910> second<00:00:35.300> video<00:00:35.510> I'm

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
and then also in the second video I'm

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.509 
and then also in the second video I'm
going<00:00:35.809> to<00:00:35.870> do<00:00:36.019> a<00:00:36.050> comparison<00:00:36.410> between<00:00:36.710> 800<00:00:37.489> and

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
going to do a comparison between 800 and

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.520 
going to do a comparison between 800 and
880<00:00:38.269> you<00:00:38.510> can<00:00:38.660> click<00:00:38.839> through<00:00:39.019> on<00:00:39.140> that<00:00:39.320> link

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
880 you can click through on that link

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.450 
880 you can click through on that link
to<00:00:39.620> see<00:00:39.890> that<00:00:40.100> one

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
to see that one

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.489 
to see that one
so<00:00:40.940> first<00:00:41.179> up<00:00:41.329> I'll<00:00:41.539> get<00:00:41.719> the<00:00:41.839> same<00:00:42.019> lens<00:00:42.260> to

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:42.499 
so first up I'll get the same lens to

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:44.529 
so first up I'll get the same lens to
use<00:00:42.620> on<00:00:42.829> both<00:00:43.010> of<00:00:43.190> these<00:00:43.309> then<00:00:43.820> just<00:00:44.030> take<00:00:44.510> a

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
use on both of these then just take a

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.809 
use on both of these then just take a
series<00:00:45.230> of<00:00:45.350> shots<00:00:45.589> of<00:00:45.769> different<00:00:45.800> ISO<00:00:46.489> and

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:46.819 
series of shots of different ISO and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.180 
series of shots of different ISO and
I'll<00:00:47.179> Boise<00:00:47.629> over<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.140> images<00:00:48.499> for<00:00:48.710> you

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
I'll Boise over the images for you

hey guys flash-forward a couple of days

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.200 
hey guys flash-forward a couple of days
and<00:00:51.440> I'm<00:00:51.620> now<00:00:51.829> editing<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.550> shots<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.120> I'm

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
and I'm now editing the shots and I'm

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.529 
and I'm now editing the shots and I'm
going<00:00:53.449> to<00:00:53.510> present<00:00:53.979> side<00:00:54.979> by<00:00:55.249> side<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:56.030> full

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
going to present side by side the full

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.610 
going to present side by side the full
image<00:00:57.079> just<00:00:57.559> output<00:00:58.249> it<00:00:58.370> at<00:00:58.690> 1920<00:00:59.690> and<00:00:59.899> then

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
image just output it at 1920 and then

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.219 
image just output it at 1920 and then
full<00:01:00.920> res<00:01:01.399> crops<00:01:01.969> as<00:01:02.269> well<00:01:02.539> now<00:01:02.749> the<00:01:02.809> reason

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
full res crops as well now the reason

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.499 
full res crops as well now the reason
I'm<00:01:03.350> doing<00:01:03.679> the<00:01:03.859> whole<00:01:04.070> image<00:01:04.640> side<00:01:05.030> by<00:01:05.269> side

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
I'm doing the whole image side by side

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.810 
I'm doing the whole image side by side
as<00:01:05.689> well<00:01:05.869> is<00:01:06.049> people<00:01:06.740> talked<00:01:07.009> a<00:01:07.130> lot<00:01:07.280> about<00:01:07.430> how

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
as well is people talked a lot about how

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.959 
as well is people talked a lot about how
the<00:01:07.880> d800<00:01:08.719> being<00:01:08.899> so<00:01:09.170> much<00:01:09.320> higher<00:01:09.590> resolution

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
the d800 being so much higher resolution

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.510 
the d800 being so much higher resolution
once<00:01:10.969> you<00:01:11.180> scaled<00:01:11.509> it<00:01:11.750> back<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.290> d4<00:01:12.770> it<00:01:13.009> was

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
once you scaled it back to the d4 it was

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.130 
once you scaled it back to the d4 it was
going<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:13.820> be<00:01:13.909> in<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.119> same<00:01:14.299> league<00:01:14.600> in<00:01:14.899> terms

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
going to be in the same league in terms

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.440 
going to be in the same league in terms
of<00:01:15.320> ISO<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:15.950> in<00:01:16.070> that<00:01:16.219> casing<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:16.880> full<00:01:17.180> image

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
of ISO so in that casing the full image

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.039 
of ISO so in that casing the full image
and<00:01:17.899> what<00:01:18.469> noise<00:01:18.710> is<00:01:19.479> evidenced<00:01:20.479> at<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.840> same

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
and what noise is evidenced at the same

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.100 
and what noise is evidenced at the same
size<00:01:21.439> even<00:01:21.950> though<00:01:22.219> the<00:01:22.969> file<00:01:23.329> size<00:01:23.659> is<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:23.930> lot

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
size even though the file size is a lot

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.740 
size even though the file size is a lot
bigger<00:01:24.259> on<00:01:24.469> the<00:01:24.590> d800<00:01:25.280> gives<00:01:25.939> another<00:01:26.420> way<00:01:26.689> to

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
bigger on the d800 gives another way to

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.719 
bigger on the d800 gives another way to
compare<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.469> so<00:01:27.860> let's<00:01:28.070> jump<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:28.490> I'm<00:01:28.610> gonna

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
compare it so let's jump in I'm gonna

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.520 
compare it so let's jump in I'm gonna
run<00:01:28.969> through<00:01:29.149> each<00:01:29.329> of<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.659> different<00:01:29.689> ISO<00:01:30.469> s

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
run through each of the different ISO s

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.020 
run through each of the different ISO s
and<00:01:30.799> show<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.130> bunch<00:01:31.369> of<00:01:31.520> different<00:01:31.850> side

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
and show you a bunch of different side

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.099 
and show you a bunch of different side
by<00:01:32.210> sides<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:32.840> let's<00:01:33.289> see<00:01:33.439> how<00:01:33.560> they<00:01:33.740> look

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
by sides and let's see how they look

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.690 
by sides and let's see how they look
okay<00:01:36.109> now<00:01:36.289> these<00:01:36.469> first<00:01:36.770> ones<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:37.460> haven't

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
okay now these first ones I haven't

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.249 
okay now these first ones I haven't
corrected<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.299> white<00:01:38.479> balance<00:01:38.719> and<00:01:39.140> they

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
corrected the white balance and they

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.410 
corrected the white balance and they
just<00:01:39.439> outputted<00:01:40.130> at<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.609> full<00:01:40.820> size<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:41.329> you

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
just outputted at the full size so you

00:01:41.420 --> 00:02:14.699 
just outputted at the full size so you
can<00:01:41.539> compare<00:01:41.899> them<00:01:42.079> one<00:01:42.259> against<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.710> next

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.319 

okay<00:02:15.709> next<00:02:15.980> up<00:02:16.219> let's<00:02:16.370> see<00:02:16.640> them<00:02:16.819> side<00:02:17.090> by<00:02:17.120> side

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
okay next up let's see them side by side

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.959 
okay next up let's see them side by side
but<00:02:17.900> again<00:02:18.019> their<00:02:18.709> crops<00:02:19.099> but<00:02:19.459> at<00:02:19.609> the<00:02:19.760> full

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:19.969 
but again their crops but at the full

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:31.130 
but again their crops but at the full
res

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.070 

okay<00:02:32.140> next<00:02:32.380> up<00:02:32.560> these<00:02:32.739> are<00:02:32.920> 100%<00:02:33.670> crops<00:02:34.390> side

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
okay next up these are 100% crops side

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.870 
okay next up these are 100% crops side
by<00:02:35.319> side<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.860> have<00:02:36.130> white<00:02:36.430> balance

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
by side and I have white balance

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.000 
by side and I have white balance
corrected<00:02:37.450> them<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:38.230> any<00:02:38.470> difference<00:02:38.860> you're

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
corrected them so any difference you're

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.800 
corrected them so any difference you're
seeing<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.430> how<00:02:39.610> differently<00:02:40.120> they<00:02:40.270> mean<00:02:40.569> it<00:02:40.720> I

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
seeing is how differently they mean it I

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.270 
seeing is how differently they mean it I
had<00:02:40.989> them<00:02:41.140> sent<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.590> same<00:02:41.830> exposure

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
had them sent to the same exposure

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:51.830 
had them sent to the same exposure
compensation

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.360 

okay<00:02:52.840> obviously<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.470> default<00:02:53.890> keeps<00:02:54.160> on

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
okay obviously the default keeps on

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.940 
okay obviously the default keeps on
going<00:02:54.790> beyond<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.300> d800<00:02:55.960> so<00:02:56.140> here<00:02:56.440> we<00:02:56.530> go<00:02:56.710> all

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
going beyond the d800 so here we go all

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.400 
going beyond the d800 so here we go all
the<00:02:57.070> way<00:02:57.100> up<00:02:57.340> through<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:57.990> admittedly<00:02:58.990> these

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
the way up through and admittedly these

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.870 
the way up through and admittedly these
are<00:02:59.620> starting<00:02:59.830> to<00:03:00.040> look<00:03:00.160> pretty<00:03:00.370> rubbish

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
are starting to look pretty rubbish

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.360 
are starting to look pretty rubbish
especially<00:03:01.480> at<00:03:01.720> two<00:03:02.530> hundred<00:03:02.920> thousand

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
especially at two hundred thousand

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.390 
especially at two hundred thousand
that's<00:03:03.520> unusable<00:03:04.270> completely<00:03:05.110> unusable<00:03:05.470> but

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
that's unusable completely unusable but

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.370 
that's unusable completely unusable but
I<00:03:06.670> went<00:03:07.150> back<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.480> double-checked<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:08.140> here

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
I went back and double-checked and here

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.880 
I went back and double-checked and here
we<00:03:08.470> go

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
we go

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.560 
we go
that's<00:03:09.070> comparing<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:09.610> d4<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.180> hundred

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
that's comparing the d4 and a hundred

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.450 
that's comparing the d4 and a hundred
thousand<00:03:11.050> and<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.260> d800<00:03:11.830> at<00:03:11.950> twenty<00:03:12.280> five

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
thousand and the d800 at twenty five

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.880 
thousand and the d800 at twenty five
thousand<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.600> think<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:13.990> d4<00:03:14.380> still<00:03:14.680> looks

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
thousand and I think the d4 still looks

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.770 
thousand and I think the d4 still looks
better<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.310> is<00:03:15.430> holding<00:03:15.790> up<00:03:15.910> in<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.210> blacks<00:03:16.480> a

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
better and is holding up in the blacks a

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.020 
better and is holding up in the blacks a
lot<00:03:17.020> better<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.130> assertion<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.670> the

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
lot better so the assertion that the

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.570 
lot better so the assertion that the
d800<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.080> pretty<00:03:20.350> much<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.770> same<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.190> think<00:03:21.400> is

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
d800 is pretty much the same I think is

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.330 
d800 is pretty much the same I think is
off<00:03:21.820> it's<00:03:22.360> at<00:03:22.540> least<00:03:22.750> two<00:03:23.110> stops<00:03:23.380> behind<00:03:23.620> hope

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
off it's at least two stops behind hope

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.920 
off it's at least two stops behind hope
that's<00:03:24.550> hopeful<00:03:24.910> guys<00:03:25.060> this<00:03:25.330> is<00:03:25.450> Mike<00:03:25.600> Ranger
