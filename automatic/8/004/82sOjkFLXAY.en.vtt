00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
and he's as good as there is on tour

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.510 
and he's as good as there is on tour
bulls<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:33.050> go<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.470> left<00:02:33.710> for<00:02:33.920> him<00:02:34.160> it's

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
bulls that go to the left for him it's

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.950 
bulls that go to the left for him it's
just<00:02:34.790> when<00:02:35.090> they<00:02:35.180> go<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.510> right<00:02:35.660> he<00:02:35.840> has

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
just when they go to the right he has

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.870 
just when they go to the right he has
trouble<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:36.890> think<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.220> leaves<00:02:37.520> him<00:02:37.730> a

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
trouble and so I think that leaves him a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.030 
trouble and so I think that leaves him a
little<00:02:38.270> bit<00:02:38.420> of<00:02:38.510> an<00:02:38.630> incomplete<00:02:39.050> for<00:02:39.410> me<00:02:39.530> he's

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
little bit of an incomplete for me he's

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.560 
little bit of an incomplete for me he's
got<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.280> fix<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:41.000> be<00:02:41.120> able<00:02:41.210> to<00:02:41.360> really

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
got to fix that to be able to really

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.380 
got to fix that to be able to really
