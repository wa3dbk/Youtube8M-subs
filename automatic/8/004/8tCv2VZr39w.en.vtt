let's of a ride to this chocobo now to
start<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> controls<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> bit<00:00:44.040> weird

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
start with the controls are a bit weird

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.060 
start with the controls are a bit weird
on<00:00:44.520> these<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.789> how<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.059> control<00:00:45.770> to<00:00:46.770> say<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
on these I how to control to say the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.029 
on these I how to control to say the
least<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.670> mean<00:00:48.390> even<00:00:48.510> hives<00:00:48.780> good<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.829> like

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
least I mean even hives good it's like

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.090 
least I mean even hives good it's like
him<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.579> believe<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.210> chicken<00:00:51.980> skeleton<00:00:52.980> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
him I believe it's a chicken skeleton of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.220 
him I believe it's a chicken skeleton of
scallion<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.610> modified<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.480> changed<00:00:54.660> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
scallion like modified and changed I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.110 
scallion like modified and changed I
mean<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.039> does<00:00:56.309> need<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> lot<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.670> work<00:00:56.850> i<00:00:57.090> mean

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
mean it does need a lot of work i mean

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.229 
mean it does need a lot of work i mean
the<00:00:57.930> feathers<00:00:58.350> especially<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.430> back<00:00:59.699> they

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the feathers especially on the back they

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.840 
the feathers especially on the back they
need<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> be<00:01:00.840> added<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:02.280> face<00:01:02.520> needs<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
need to be added and the face needs a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.359 
need to be added and the face needs a
lot<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.059> work<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.420> well<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:05.250> gets

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
lot of work as well but if this gets

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.950 
lot of work as well but if this gets
improved<00:01:05.670> textures<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.299> such<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.510> look

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
improved textures and such just look

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.740 
improved textures and such just look
amazing<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:08.070> one<00:01:08.430> thing<00:01:08.610> also<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> legs<00:01:09.479> move

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
amazing but one thing also the legs move

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.980 
amazing but one thing also the legs move
too<00:01:09.930> fast<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.310> me<00:01:11.570> chocobos<00:01:12.570> legs

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
too fast if you have me chocobos legs

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.870 
too fast if you have me chocobos legs
are<00:01:13.290> slower<00:01:13.740> than<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
are slower than that and the more the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.660 
are slower than that and the more the
glide<00:01:15.150> morphing<00:01:15.869> else<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:17.549> hard

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
glide morphing else like like it's hard

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.910 
glide morphing else like like it's hard
to<00:01:17.729> describe<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.390> mean<00:01:18.750> go<00:01:18.869> watch<00:01:19.080> clips<00:01:19.380> I'm<00:01:19.560> in

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
to describe I mean go watch clips I'm in

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.890 
to describe I mean go watch clips I'm in
the<00:01:20.460> Final<00:01:20.759> Fantasy<00:01:20.850> games<00:01:21.210> walking<00:01:21.720> around

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the Final Fantasy games walking around

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.690 
the Final Fantasy games walking around
you<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.259> mount<00:01:22.409> them<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.250> really<00:01:23.369> fast

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you can mount them this is really fast

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.620 
you can mount them this is really fast
but<00:01:24.420> he's<00:01:25.290> fun<00:01:25.560> nonetheless<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.220> looks<00:01:26.369> crazy

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
but he's fun nonetheless it looks crazy

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.240 
but he's fun nonetheless it looks crazy
well<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.439> something<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> keep

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
well this is something for you to keep

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.039 
well this is something for you to keep
your<00:01:29.340> eyes<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.490> because<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.270> will<00:01:30.869> be

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
your eyes on because this will be

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.780 
your eyes on because this will be
something<00:01:31.229> good<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:32.220> get<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> text<00:01:32.670> just

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
something good if they get a text just

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.280 
something good if they get a text just
right<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.299> get<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> animations<00:01:33.930> working

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
right and we get the animations working

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.280 
right and we get the animations working
perfectly<00:01:34.680> because<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.630> another<00:01:37.020> for

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
perfectly because it's just another for

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.620 
perfectly because it's just another for
mod<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:38.369> nothing<00:01:38.759> too<00:01:38.880> great<00:01:39.180> I'll<00:01:39.329> say<00:01:39.509> that

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
mod it's nothing too great I'll say that

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.359 
mod it's nothing too great I'll say that
now<00:01:39.810> because<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> textures<00:01:40.619> definitely<00:01:41.280> need

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
now because the textures definitely need

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.730 
now because the textures definitely need
work<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.939> mean<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> textures<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.229> kind<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.560> suck

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
work I mean the textures do kind of suck

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.580 
work I mean the textures do kind of suck
and<00:01:43.979> currently<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.820> can't<00:01:45.030> jump<00:01:45.270> or<00:01:45.509> swim<00:01:46.229> in

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and currently you can't jump or swim in

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.340 
and currently you can't jump or swim in
