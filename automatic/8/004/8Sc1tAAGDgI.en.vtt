00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.430
 now welcome to the tutorial tutorial 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.799
 to some of my laptop keyboard 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.780
 based on the article of the same name 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:16.650
 the on my homepage www.ist.de too 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.789
 find them to clean such a laptop 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.590
 keyboard has proven very strong in 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:31.189
 my eyes the help of some 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:34.500
 less tools and below are the pz 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.480
 where called cotton swabs or too 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.950
 cleaning towels or also 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.260
 A stop when we look at one another 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.280
 laptop pressetour degree how fast 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.030
 getting cleaned 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.420
 Well, it is easy the notebook 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.629
 not to expose somehow 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.870
 Key combinations will ask for 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.239
 where, for example, hair then in the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.359
 Keyboard you can fell with 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:08.729
 Tweezers go well and year 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.670
 take off or because you want and the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.130
 keyboard is a bit off the hook 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.590
 you also lift out the individual keys 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.930
 Please be very careful 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.180
 because these could break out, too 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.909
 usable are these cotton swabs 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.820
 I can go now and 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.130
 various off her long walk to the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.979
 letters and signs 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.850
 You can see you have it relatively fast then 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.500
 but some trick and picked out 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.110
 laptop keyboard like then quite good 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.049
 cleaned 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.200
 in the selection of cleaning towels 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.240
 especially if this is a bit damp 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.100
 you should be careful otherwise 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.380
 attacks in this possibly keyboard 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.990
 or the screen but there 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.770
 special books which one in the specialized trade 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.770
 can buy 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.620
 so 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.120
 books dust protection it is less 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.540
 to pay attention to how they are dry 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.520
 This makes it relatively easy 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.140
 to go over there 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.410
 By the way, it can also be used on the screen 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.110
 I'll go over there 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.260
 relatively quickly this opportunity too 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.260
 clean 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.750
