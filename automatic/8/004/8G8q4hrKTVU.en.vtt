00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.429 

here<00:00:05.580> we<00:00:05.670> have<00:00:05.790> two<00:00:06.000> V<00:00:06.240> 39<00:00:06.690> batteries<00:00:07.200> I'm

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:07.439 
here we have two V 39 batteries I'm

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:09.910 
here we have two V 39 batteries I'm
going<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.740> use<00:00:07.950> them<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.430> demonstrate<00:00:08.809> the

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
going to use them to demonstrate the

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.560 
going to use them to demonstrate the
electronics<00:00:10.920> on<00:00:11.070> board<00:00:11.100> that<00:00:11.879> regulate<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
electronics on board that regulate the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.990 
electronics on board that regulate the
power<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:13.110> charge<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.590> cells<00:00:13.849> but<00:00:14.849> one<00:00:14.969> of

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
power to charge the cells but one of

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.089 
power to charge the cells but one of
them<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.210> completely<00:00:15.360> empty<00:00:15.840> and<00:00:16.230> one<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.980> them

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:17.099 
them is completely empty and one of them

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.700 
them is completely empty and one of them
is<00:00:17.220> nearly<00:00:17.550> completely<00:00:17.880> full<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.710> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
is nearly completely full and the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.800 
is nearly completely full and the
electronics<00:00:20.460> basically<00:00:21.029> regulate<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
electronics basically regulate the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.500 
electronics basically regulate the
amount<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.080> power<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.800> goes<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
amount of power that goes to the the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.550 
amount of power that goes to the the
cells<00:00:24.779> inside<00:00:25.490> based<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.789> their<00:00:27.480> their<00:00:27.869> state

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
cells inside based on their their state

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.810 
cells inside based on their their state
of<00:00:28.680> their<00:00:28.859> charge<00:00:29.100> state<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.609> if<00:00:29.699> they're

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
of their charge state so if they're

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.279 
of their charge state so if they're
completely<00:00:30.119> empty<00:00:30.330> they'll<00:00:30.660> take<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.019> more

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
completely empty they'll take on more

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.080 
completely empty they'll take on more
current<00:00:31.680> and<00:00:31.890> they'll<00:00:32.040> limit<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> current<00:00:32.940> so

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
current and they'll limit the current so

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.850 
current and they'll limit the current so
that<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.390> doesn't<00:00:33.690> overcharge<00:00:34.199> the<00:00:34.379> cells<00:00:34.590> too

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
that it doesn't overcharge the cells too

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.709 
that it doesn't overcharge the cells too
rapidly<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.580> then<00:00:36.090> when<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.330> cells<00:00:36.540> are

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
rapidly and then when the cells are

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.880 
rapidly and then when the cells are
completely<00:00:37.140> charged<00:00:37.770> you'll<00:00:38.430> see<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
completely charged you'll see that the

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.680 
completely charged you'll see that the
current<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.070> scaled<00:00:41.399> back<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.239> let's<00:00:42.450> start

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
current is scaled back so let's start

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.610 
current is scaled back so let's start
with<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> completed<00:00:43.230> cells<00:00:45.379> I'm<00:00:46.379> going<00:00:46.559> to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
with the completed cells I'm going to

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.209 
with the completed cells I'm going to
connect<00:00:46.890> them<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.629> bench<00:00:48.629> supply<00:00:49.910> and<00:00:52.219> this

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
connect them to bench supply and this

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.180 
connect them to bench supply and this
bench<00:00:53.579> supply<00:00:54.200> we<00:00:55.200> can<00:00:55.379> set<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> voltage<00:00:56.039> of

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
bench supply we can set the voltage of

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.340 
bench supply we can set the voltage of
six<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.140> monitor<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.770> amps<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.850> Watts<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
six and monitor the amps and Watts the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.369 
six and monitor the amps and Watts the
the<00:01:01.620> current<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.100> power<00:01:02.870> well<00:01:03.870> good<00:01:04.080> I'll<00:01:04.199> go

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the current and power well good I'll go

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.020 
the current and power well good I'll go
ahead<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.680> connect<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.550> powered<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:08.030> so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
ahead and connect it and powered on so

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.730 
ahead and connect it and powered on so
we<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.869> battery<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.290> pulling<00:01:10.650> about

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
we see that the battery is pulling about

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.179 
we see that the battery is pulling about
one-and-a-half<00:01:11.189> amps<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.590> about<00:01:13.590> nine<00:01:13.890> watts

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
one-and-a-half amps and about nine watts

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.069 
one-and-a-half amps and about nine watts
at<00:01:14.880> 6<00:01:15.180> volts<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.909> it's<00:01:17.909> charging

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.580 

fullcycle<00:01:22.210> shows<00:01:23.210> that<00:01:23.359> it's<00:01:23.539> charging<00:01:24.350> from

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
fullcycle shows that it's charging from

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.919 
fullcycle shows that it's charging from
basically<00:01:25.070> flat<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:26.509> now<00:01:26.600> what<00:01:26.719> I'm<00:01:26.780> going<00:01:26.899> to

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
basically flat and now what I'm going to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.959 
basically flat and now what I'm going to
do<00:01:27.079> since<00:01:27.320> most<00:01:27.649> of<00:01:27.740> our<00:01:27.829> bags<00:01:28.070> come<00:01:28.310> with<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.609> 12

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
do since most of our bags come with a 12

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.959 
do since most of our bags come with a 12
volt<00:01:29.030> switch<00:01:29.329> is<00:01:29.719> change<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.799> voltage<00:01:30.979> to<00:01:31.700> 12

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.219 
volt switch is change the voltage to 12
volts<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:32.390> see<00:01:32.659> what<00:01:32.810> happens<00:01:33.289> to<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.950> the

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
volts and see what happens to the the

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.039 
volts and see what happens to the the
current<00:01:37.060> before<00:01:38.060> at<00:01:38.179> the<00:01:38.299> 6<00:01:38.509> volt<00:01:38.659> setting<00:01:38.990> we

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
current before at the 6 volt setting we

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.300 
current before at the 6 volt setting we
were<00:01:39.170> getting<00:01:39.380> one-and-a-half<00:01:39.799> amps<00:01:40.159> now

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
were getting one-and-a-half amps now

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.359 
were getting one-and-a-half amps now
we're<00:01:40.429> getting<00:01:40.670> about<00:01:41.439> 3/4<00:01:42.439> and<00:01:42.770> we're

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
we're getting about 3/4 and we're

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.219 
we're getting about 3/4 and we're
getting<00:01:43.610> about<00:01:43.759> 9<00:01:44.060> watts<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:44.630> we're<00:01:44.959> still

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
getting about 9 watts and we're still

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.959 
getting about 9 watts and we're still
we're<00:01:45.770> getting<00:01:45.979> a<00:01:46.039> little<00:01:46.130> bit<00:01:46.310> more<00:01:46.610> than<00:01:46.819> 9

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
we're getting a little bit more than 9

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.600 
we're getting a little bit more than 9
watts<00:01:47.209> this<00:01:47.420> at<00:01:47.659> this<00:01:47.869> point<00:01:48.170> but<00:01:48.610> basically

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
watts this at this point but basically

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.309 
watts this at this point but basically
what<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.149> on-board<00:01:50.450> electronics<00:01:50.569> have<00:01:51.140> done

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
what the on-board electronics have done

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.620 
what the on-board electronics have done
is<00:01:51.500> they've<00:01:51.649> said<00:01:51.920> all<00:01:52.100> right<00:01:52.340> well<00:01:52.579> I<00:01:52.850> can

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
is they've said all right well I can

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.109 
is they've said all right well I can
take<00:01:53.840> on<00:01:53.869> X<00:01:54.409> amount<00:01:54.739> of<00:01:54.890> power<00:01:55.069> to<00:01:55.700> then<00:01:55.819> put

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
take on X amount of power to then put

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.270 
take on X amount of power to then put
them<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.539> cells<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:57.770> my<00:01:57.950> maximum

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
them to the cells and that is my maximum

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.270 
them to the cells and that is my maximum
charge<00:01:58.700> rate<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.179> if<00:01:59.780> I<00:01:59.899> get<00:02:00.200> varying<00:02:00.890> voltage

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
charge rate and if I get varying voltage

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.969 
charge rate and if I get varying voltage
I'm<00:02:01.459> going<00:02:01.579> to<00:02:01.640> scale<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.179> current<00:02:02.539> to<00:02:03.439> to

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
I'm going to scale the current to to

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.259 
I'm going to scale the current to to
match<00:02:04.299> so<00:02:05.299> to<00:02:06.170> keep<00:02:06.289> it<00:02:06.409> within<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.770> range<00:02:07.269> so

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
match so to keep it within that range so

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.330 
match so to keep it within that range so
these<00:02:08.479> these<00:02:08.840> electronics<00:02:09.470> prevent<00:02:10.190> us<00:02:10.310> from

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
these these electronics prevent us from

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.580 
these these electronics prevent us from
overcharging<00:02:11.239> even<00:02:11.660> if<00:02:11.750> we<00:02:11.870> have<00:02:12.049> more

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
overcharging even if we have more

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.280 
overcharging even if we have more
voltage<00:02:13.069> than<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:14.239> necessary<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.840> charge<00:02:15.140> the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
voltage than is necessary to charge the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.710 
voltage than is necessary to charge the
cells<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:16.000> basically<00:02:17.000> uses<00:02:17.420> as<00:02:17.540> much<00:02:17.569> energy

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
cells and basically uses as much energy

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.759 
cells and basically uses as much energy
as<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.590> can<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.160> charge<00:02:19.810> efficiently<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.530> I'm

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
as it can to charge efficiently so I'm

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.640 
as it can to charge efficiently so I'm
going<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.950> turn<00:02:22.129> off<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.819> supply<00:02:23.650> reset

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
going to turn off the the supply reset

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.670 
going to turn off the the supply reset
to<00:02:25.220> 6<00:02:25.940> volts

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.630 

and<00:02:31.159> then<00:02:32.379> disconnect<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:35.000> discharge

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
and then disconnect the the discharge

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:45.750 
and then disconnect the the discharge
and<00:02:37.640> then<00:02:37.790> connect<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.870> charge<00:02:39.140> one

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.320 

and

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.440 

you<00:02:50.870> see<00:02:51.170> at<00:02:51.530> six<00:02:51.920> volts<00:02:53.020> about<00:02:54.850> 270<00:02:55.850> milliamps

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
you see at six volts about 270 milliamps

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.560 
you see at six volts about 270 milliamps
draw<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.050> about<00:02:57.500> 1.6<00:02:58.280> 2<00:02:58.580> watts<00:02:58.850> as<00:02:59.090> opposed<00:02:59.420> to

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
draw and about 1.6 2 watts as opposed to

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.710 
draw and about 1.6 2 watts as opposed to
about<00:02:59.870> one<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.650> half<00:03:00.680> amps<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.880> nine<00:03:02.390> watts

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
about one and a half amps and nine watts

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.840 
about one and a half amps and nine watts
so<00:03:03.050> this<00:03:03.740> battery<00:03:04.100> is<00:03:04.130> almost<00:03:04.430> completely

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
so this battery is almost completely

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.090 
so this battery is almost completely
full<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.480> it's<00:03:05.930> already<00:03:06.320> slowing<00:03:06.650> down<00:03:06.890> its

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
full and it's already slowing down its

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.560 
full and it's already slowing down its
current<00:03:07.550> intake<00:03:08.300> so<00:03:09.020> that<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.290> battery

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
current intake so that the battery

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.750 
current intake so that the battery
basically<00:03:11.570> reaches<00:03:11.990> full<00:03:12.290> charge<00:03:12.760> without

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
basically reaches full charge without

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.180 
basically reaches full charge without
damaging<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.330> cells<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:15.290> there<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:16.040> have<00:03:16.070> it

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
damaging the cells so there you have it

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.760 
damaging the cells so there you have it
the<00:03:16.790> demonstration<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.770> overcharge

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
the demonstration of overcharge

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.830 
the demonstration of overcharge
protection
