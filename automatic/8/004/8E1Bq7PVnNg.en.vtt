then<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.530> want<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> continuously<00:01:44.460> stir

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
then you just want to continuously stir

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.550 
then you just want to continuously stir
this<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:47.840> right<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.140> want<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.380> keep

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
this all right so you want to keep

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.980 
this all right so you want to keep
stirring<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.600> see<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.780> getting

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
stirring this as you can see is getting

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.569 
stirring this as you can see is getting
nice<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.380> thick<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.040> don't<00:01:53.250> want<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.460> walk

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
nice and thick you don't want to walk

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.190 
nice and thick you don't want to walk
away<00:01:53.640> for<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.119> second<00:01:54.540> because<00:01:54.630> even<00:01:55.020> walking

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
away for a second because even walking

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.800 
away for a second because even walking
me<00:01:55.530> 45<00:01:56.100> minutes<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.700> enough<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.570> burn

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
me 45 minutes is enough it is to burn

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.319 
me 45 minutes is enough it is to burn
you<00:01:58.380> see<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.710> more<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.040> stir<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.090> more

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
you see the more you stir and the more

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.090 
you see the more you stir and the more
it<00:02:00.479> cooks<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.020> more<00:02:01.200> lighter<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.740> becomes

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it cooks the more lighter it becomes

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.050 
it cooks the more lighter it becomes
because<00:02:02.340> you're<00:02:02.460> starting<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> cook<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
because you're starting to cook the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.880 
because you're starting to cook the
syrup<00:02:03.390> now<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.930> want<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.229> be<00:02:04.320> sure<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.500> scrape

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
syrup now you want to be sure you scrape

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.980 
syrup now you want to be sure you scrape
the<00:02:05.100> side<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.549> will<00:02:05.729> prevent<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.360> from

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the side this will prevent it from

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.740 
the side this will prevent it from
burning<00:02:07.259> also<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.789> they<00:02:09.149> just<00:02:09.360> want<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.569> keep

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
burning also and they just want to keep

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.270 
burning also and they just want to keep
stirring<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.739> don't<00:02:10.890> move<00:02:11.069> away<00:02:11.190> from

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
stirring that so don't move away from

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.990 
stirring that so don't move away from
the<00:02:11.459> stove<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.030> keep<00:02:12.330> stirring<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:14.790> can

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
the stove you can keep stirring you can

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.490 
the stove you can keep stirring you can
turn<00:02:15.150> your<00:02:15.330> stove<00:02:15.569> down<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.230> little<00:02:16.379> bit

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
turn your stove down just a little bit

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.170 
turn your stove down just a little bit
you<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.800> want<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> boil<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.430> enough<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.090> you

you just want to boil this enough so you
see<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.480> more<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.080> boil<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:20.160> thicker<00:02:20.520> it

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
see the more I boil the thicker it

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.030 
see the more I boil the thicker it
becomes<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.510> caramels<00:02:22.050> looking<00:02:22.379> really<00:02:22.890> good

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
I'm waiting for it to get up to a little

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.229 
I'm waiting for it to get up to a little
bit<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:33.150> waiting<00:02:33.450> for<00:02:33.629> it<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.780> get<00:02:33.930> above<00:02:34.290> 190

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
bit so waiting for it to get above 190

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.400 
bit so waiting for it to get above 190
you<00:02:36.239> needed<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.690> go<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.930> about<00:02:37.319> 250<00:02:38.269> Fahrenheit

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
you needed to go to about 250 Fahrenheit

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.839 
you needed to go to about 250 Fahrenheit
which<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.590> about<00:02:40.769> 10<00:02:41.069> minutes<00:02:41.310> cooking<00:02:41.670> time

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
which is about 10 minutes cooking time

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.940 
which is about 10 minutes cooking time
so<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.420> want<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.720> cook<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.019> down<00:02:43.379> for<00:02:43.440> 10

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
so you want to cook this down for 10

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.850 
so you want to cook this down for 10
minutes<00:02:44.190> before<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.390> know<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:45.690> ready<00:02:48.860> okay
