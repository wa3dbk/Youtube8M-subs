words now Kent is a disempowering word

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.799 
words now Kent is a disempowering word
meaning<00:00:46.049> it<00:00:46.409> takes<00:00:46.530> from<00:00:47.309> us<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.970> it<00:00:48.570> brings

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
meaning it takes from us and it brings

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:55.049 
things that they do mobile home school

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:58.579 
things that they do mobile home school

but as they were doing their work this
word<00:00:58.890> kept<00:00:59.159> coming<00:00:59.519> up<00:00:59.640> can't<00:01:00.150> and<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.900> I<00:01:00.930> said

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
word kept coming up can't and so I said

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.969 
word kept coming up can't and so I said
guys<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.830> can't<00:01:02.129> use<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.489> word<00:01:03.080> can't<00:01:04.080> why

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
guys we can't use that word can't why

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.670 
guys we can't use that word can't why
because<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.970> drains<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.200> fact<00:01:07.409> I've

because it drains you and in fact I've

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.890 
because it drains you and in fact I've
been<00:01:07.710> doing<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.430> remember<00:01:08.790> why<00:01:09.180> i<00:01:09.540> said

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
been doing it do you remember why i said

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.710 
been doing it do you remember why i said
we<00:01:10.410> don't<00:01:10.560> want<00:01:10.800> to<00:01:10.890> use<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.160> work<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.720> answer

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
we don't want to use the work in answer

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.250 
we don't want to use the work in answer
it<00:01:12.900> makes<00:01:13.170> our<00:01:13.440> branding<00:01:13.890> stop<00:01:14.160> thinking

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
it makes our branding stop thinking

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.120 
it makes our branding stop thinking
absolutely<00:01:16.260> when<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.070> use<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.910> word<00:01:18.150> can't

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
absolutely when we use the word can't

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.490 
absolutely when we use the word can't
never<00:01:20.130> forget<00:01:20.550> it<00:01:20.970> makes<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.630> brain<00:01:21.930> stopped

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
never forget it makes the brain stopped

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.180 
never forget it makes the brain stopped
working<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.400> solution<00:01:23.730> as<00:01:24.570> long<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.410> you<00:01:25.920> say

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
working on a solution as long as you say

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.710 
working on a solution as long as you say
can't<00:01:26.550> then<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> brain<00:01:27.060> says<00:01:27.300> where<00:01:27.540> there's

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
can't then the brain says where there's

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.000 
can't then the brain says where there's
no<00:01:27.810> reason<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.260> me<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> think<00:01:28.620> about<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
no reason for me to think about it

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.880 
no reason for me to think about it
anymore<00:01:29.160> and<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.540> stops<00:01:30.930> working<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
anymore and so it stops working on a

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.170 
anymore and so it stops working on a
solution<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.690> when<00:01:33.690> we<00:01:33.960> say<00:01:34.760> another<00:01:35.760> term

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
solution but when we say another term

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.550 
solution but when we say another term
which<00:01:36.210> I'm<00:01:36.690> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> share<00:01:37.080> with<00:01:37.230> you<00:01:37.320> here

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
which I'm going to share with you here

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.649 
which I'm going to share with you here
in<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> second<00:01:38.190> it<00:01:38.340> helps<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> brain<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
in a second it helps the brain to

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.110 
in a second it helps the brain to
continue<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.260> keep<00:01:40.440> going<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.010> fact<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:41.940> is

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
continue to keep going in fact what is

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.540 
continue to keep going in fact what is
that<00:01:42.330> what<00:01:42.659> what<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.350> use<00:01:43.620> when<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:43.890> when<00:01:44.460> I

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
that what what do we use when I when I

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.220 
that what what do we use when I when I
told<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.940> don't<00:01:45.120> use<00:01:45.390> Kent<00:01:45.750> what<00:01:46.020> did<00:01:46.140> we

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
told you don't use Kent what did we

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.290 
told you don't use Kent what did we
substitute<00:01:46.830> for<00:01:47.070> Ken<00:01:47.310> well<00:01:47.550> what<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.090> say

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
substitute for Ken well what do we say

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.149 
substitute for Ken well what do we say
whenever<00:01:48.600> we're<00:01:48.930> having<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.320> problem<00:01:49.560> we're

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
whenever we're having a problem we're

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.260 
whenever we're having a problem we're
having<00:01:50.190> what<00:01:50.640> your<00:01:51.120> difficulty

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
having what your difficulty

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.880 
having what your difficulty
absolutely<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:53.690> when<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:54.050> say<00:01:54.260> I'm<00:01:54.500> having

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
absolutely so when you say I'm having

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.790 
absolutely so when you say I'm having
difficulty<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:56.180> brain<00:01:56.480> then<00:01:56.960> says<00:01:57.290> okay<00:01:57.650> well

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
difficulty the brain then says okay well

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.190 
difficulty the brain then says okay well
let's<00:01:58.010> work<00:01:58.250> on<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.550> solution<00:01:58.820> until<00:01:59.600> we<00:01:59.810> find

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
let's work on a solution until we find

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.670 
let's work on a solution until we find
and<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.640> that<00:02:02.000> is<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.510> better<00:02:02.930> way<00:02:03.650> of

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
and so that is the better way of

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.910 
and so that is the better way of
handling<00:02:04.840> anything<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:06.320> you're<00:02:06.470> coming<00:02:06.740> up

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
handling anything that you're coming up

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.040 
handling anything that you're coming up
against<00:02:07.670> any<00:02:08.090> problems<00:02:08.600> that<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.840> might<00:02:08.990> be

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
against any problems that you might be

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.590 
against any problems that you might be
having<00:02:09.410> your<00:02:10.100> children<00:02:11.000> or<00:02:11.120> yourself
