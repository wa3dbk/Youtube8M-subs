00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
live on the One X at the front you have

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.630 
live on the One X at the front you have
a<00:01:07.130> 3.5<00:01:08.130> inch<00:01:08.549> screen<00:01:09.000> quite<00:01:09.900> large<00:01:10.490> might<00:01:11.490> be

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
a 3.5 inch screen quite large might be

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.429 
a 3.5 inch screen quite large might be
small<00:01:11.880> by<00:01:12.090> today's<00:01:12.119> standards<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:12.930> pretty

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
small by today's standards but pretty

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.899 
small by today's standards but pretty
good<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> little<00:01:13.770> bit<00:01:13.950> more<00:01:14.100> about<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.340> screen

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
good a little bit more about that screen

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.130 
good a little bit more about that screen
it's<00:01:15.240> limited<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.640> 480<00:01:17.640> x<00:01:17.880> 320<00:01:18.509> pixels

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
it's limited to 480 x 320 pixels

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.910 
it's limited to 480 x 320 pixels
resolution<00:01:19.200> at<00:01:20.090> 165<00:01:21.090> pixel<00:01:21.659> density<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
resolution at 165 pixel density so you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.380 
resolution at 165 pixel density so you
will<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> lot<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.790> zooming<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
will have to do a lot of zooming in and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.740 
will have to do a lot of zooming in and
out<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.750> websites<00:01:25.729> it's<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:26.939> too<00:01:27.240> bad<00:01:27.270> though

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
out on websites it's not too bad though

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.120 
out on websites it's not too bad though
I<00:01:28.040> been<00:01:29.040> using<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.670> while<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.829> you<00:01:31.829> kind

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
I been using it for a while and you kind

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.179 
I been using it for a while and you kind
of<00:01:32.250> get<00:01:33.090> used<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.840> guess<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.130> not

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
of get used to it I guess so it's not

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.219 
of get used to it I guess so it's not
too<00:01:35.310> bad<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.420> said<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.780> will<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
too bad but like I said you will have to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.740 
too bad but like I said you will have to
do<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.590> bit<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.770> zooming<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.400> on

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
do a little bit of zooming in and out on

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.450 
do a little bit of zooming in and out on
website<00:01:39.750> coming<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> back<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.130> 5

especially<00:03:03.530> on<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.919> device<00:03:04.220> of<00:03:04.459> this<00:03:04.639> size

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
especially on a device of this size

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.119 
especially on a device of this size
where<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.359> screen<00:03:05.599> readers<00:03:06.590> matter<00:03:06.799> it's<00:03:06.950> not

too cluttered and all the notifications

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.979 
too cluttered and all the notifications
work<00:03:09.530> just<00:03:09.859> fine<00:03:10.359> of<00:03:11.359> course<00:03:11.419> if<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:11.810> load<00:03:11.959> it

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
work just fine of course if you load it

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.629 
work just fine of course if you load it
up<00:03:12.169> with<00:03:12.200> too<00:03:12.530> many<00:03:12.650> widgets<00:03:12.889> on<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.519> home

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.219 
up with too many widgets on the home
screen<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:13.909> might<00:03:14.239> get<00:03:14.419> a<00:03:14.449> little<00:03:14.750> bit<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.049> lag

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:15.229 
screen you might get a little bit of lag

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.759 
screen you might get a little bit of lag
but<00:03:15.560> like<00:03:16.099> I<00:03:16.190> said<00:03:16.250> not<00:03:17.060> too<00:03:17.180> bad<00:03:17.359> at<00:03:17.510> all<00:03:17.769> apart

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
but like I said not too bad at all apart

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.369 
but like I said not too bad at all apart
from<00:03:18.829> that<00:03:18.919> is<00:03:19.310> also<00:03:19.760> beats<00:03:20.120> audio<00:03:20.379> right

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
from that is also beats audio right

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.860 
from that is also beats audio right
built<00:03:21.650> in<00:03:21.799> which<00:03:22.069> does<00:03:22.430> mean<00:03:22.879> that<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.569> audio

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
built in which does mean that the audio

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.960 
built in which does mean that the audio
and<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:24.139> is<00:03:24.290> pretty<00:03:24.500> good<00:03:24.970> video

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
and this is pretty good video

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.879 
and this is pretty good video
unfortunately<00:03:26.150> is<00:03:26.690> limited<00:03:27.169> to<00:03:27.229> just<00:03:27.409> vga

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
unfortunately is limited to just vga

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.550 
unfortunately is limited to just vga
quality<00:03:28.069> so<00:03:28.459> it's<00:03:28.579> not<00:03:28.699> too<00:03:29.209> great<00:03:29.419> for<00:03:29.780> video

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
quality so it's not too great for video

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.349 
quality so it's not too great for video

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
light usage it can possibly get better

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.439 
light usage it can possibly get better
depending<00:03:45.169> on<00:03:45.319> how<00:03:45.829> you<00:03:45.889> use<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.190> on<00:03:46.639> moderate
