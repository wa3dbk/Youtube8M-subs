00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.420 
players hired lobbies parties all that
stuff<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.560> know<00:03:58.590> if<00:03:58.800> you<00:03:58.890> use<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.040> lightning

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
stuff you know if you use a lightning

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.570 
stuff you know if you use a lightning
strike<00:03:59.810> it<00:04:00.810> might<00:04:01.500> carry<00:04:01.800> on<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.100> next<00:04:02.340> kill

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
strike it might carry on to next kill

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.470 
strike it might carry on to next kill
streak<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:02.880> you<00:04:02.940> had<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.120> lighting<00:04:03.360> strike

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
streak so you had a lighting strike

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.330 
streak so you had a lighting strike
since<00:04:04.110> you're<00:04:04.290> gonna<00:04:04.470> use<00:04:04.860> lighting<00:04:05.070> straight

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
since you're gonna use lighting straight

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.880 
since you're gonna use lighting straight
you'll<00:04:05.520> kill<00:04:05.730> like<00:04:05.820> four<00:04:06.030> or<00:04:06.090> five<00:04:06.150> people<00:04:06.390> and

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
you'll kill like four or five people and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.500 
you'll kill like four or five people and
now<00:04:07.890> most<00:04:08.280> likely<00:04:08.370> just<00:04:08.610> going<00:04:09.180> right<00:04:09.270> off<00:04:09.390> the

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
now most likely just going right off the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.570 
now most likely just going right off the
bat<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.780> probably<00:04:10.020> get<00:04:10.170> like<00:04:10.200> 12<00:04:10.800> kills<00:04:11.040> so

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
bat you probably get like 12 kills so

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.449 
bat you probably get like 12 kills so
you<00:04:11.640> go<00:04:11.820> ahead<00:04:11.850> probably<00:04:12.330> work<00:04:12.480> for<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:13.459> so

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
you go ahead probably work for that so

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.430 
you go ahead probably work for that so

prestige players i'm using the unlock a
lot<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.550> things<00:04:23.640> i<00:04:23.880> like<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.240> swarm<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:24.690> you

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
lot of things i like the swarm so you

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.330 
lot of things i like the swarm so you
just<00:04:24.960> swarm<00:04:25.200> down<00:04:25.380> but<00:04:25.590> sometimes<00:04:25.890> i<00:04:26.010> do<00:04:26.070> go

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
just swarm down but sometimes i do go

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.290 
just swarm down but sometimes i do go
back<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.700> forth

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
back and forth

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.059 
back and forth
so<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:27.780> use<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.110> orbital<00:04:28.500> because<00:04:28.710> I<00:04:28.770> could<00:04:28.949> get

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
so I use the orbital because I could get

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.070 
so I use the orbital because I could get
the<00:04:29.099> killstreaks<00:04:29.550> now<00:04:29.699> so<00:04:30.599> you<00:04:30.659> play<00:04:30.960> with
