00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 welcome to more cinema please today the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.220
 Sunday August 16 and these have been 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.929
 the weirdest SME news of the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.929
 week but average 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.630
 we usually see transformations of 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.580
 people who go from a normal state to 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.050
 get a muscular team physique 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.310
 and define many of these 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.470
 transformations are products of the 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.600
 other steroids do not but what happens when 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.070
 happens of the time that happens when those 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.110
 people stop training stop 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.820
 consume attentive steroids because these 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.699
 others that we are going to see now are photos of 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.290
 ancient bodybuilders nowadays in this 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.110
 first case can i get hold of ham 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.610
 in which after two years of leaving the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.309
 training and stop consuming 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.320
 steroids looked like that super was pretty 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:49.320
 short for health problems but as 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.320
 you can see the change is another example 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.910
 of having an enviable physique to a 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.660
 belly pretty 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.380
 redon 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.380
 and adult 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.160
 another example are cousins â€‹â€‹or the prince 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.080
 also take the pictures before it was a 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:16.190
 bodybuilder with a very physical 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.190
 developed is also a person 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.159
 it does not seem even the same and for 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.799
 last another example that I want to highlight 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.250
 is the one in English like seeing this 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.920
 before I had a physicist also it was 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.290
 black 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:37.360
 or is a normal thin and white person 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:40.180
 probably the painting is obviously 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.650
 ladies and gentlemen after fashion 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.290
 run back the clock nobody 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:50.030
 a new fashion arrives that is going to petar 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:57.980
 all the touches do yoga with your dog that 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:00.230
 It happens to people who have not even 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.510
 He posted a YouTube video that was made 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.270
 very viral in which looked like it was 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.550
 yoga and gave the instructions on high 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.460
 for your dog to do the same 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.920
 positions that he most curious is that the 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.410
 dog seemed to understand them and that 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.750
 friends the deputy punished him in new 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.670
 York enough bad breath 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.490
 a study of Lyon gas so that its 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.430
 clients can practice yoga with their 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.950
 pets and at the same time pets 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.430
 made almost the same positions as 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.220
 their owners because according to her in the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.100
 interview that all the 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.620
 dogs can practice yoga though 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.760
 start these postures and modifications 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.780
 not always some things have 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.390
 sometimes it's being there breathing together and 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.980
 so if your dog is in practice 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.439
 better account for so that to be 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.170
 lying on the ground with your dog that 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.680
 section sorry joke but there is no 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.470
 the thing 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.720
 according to kindlemann morterista 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.700
 benefits are the same for the animal 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.579
 that for the man water 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.299
 in fact , she says that dogs 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.280
 they do yoga naturally when 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.510
 you make certain positions for 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.269
 correct with fractures or overloads 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.269
 missing someone has explained what 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:29.489
 benefits brings the human being to the 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:32.319
 yoga and what studies it has been based on 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.920
 claim that the benefits for a dog 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:40.800
 they are the same as for a human being 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.800
 in order nothing more than to add his honor 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.550
 the recommended video of this week is 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.320
 a full speed video for those who do not 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.730
 you know this youtube is a person 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.440
 very recognized within the world of 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.760
 fitness and its history is amazing 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.070
 because he was a person who has suffered 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.140
 ideological values participates in 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.760
 championships to eat I do not know exactly 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.350
 what is this type of championships called 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.790
 but it's those championships where you 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.070
 compete to see who is capable of 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.140
 eat more lost or more pizzas in 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.250
 less time you can see is something 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.080
 totally against events 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.090
 despite having suffered from that 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.920
 disease shows a body completely 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.630
 great since he is a lover of 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.590
 fitness and sports in general as 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.320
 well a few months ago they detected him 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.780
 testicular cancer with only detect van 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.790
 and he shot them a testicle and it seemed that 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.500
 everything had been resolved and that cancer 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.390
 had won in a typical measure that 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.950
 it changes your life completely it's not that 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.540
 before, he will not take advantage of his life but 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.190
 from that moment he decided to live it 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.710
 with more intensity and one of the things 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.090
 what he did was for example but get 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.800
 with his girlfriend with whom he had a lot 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.300
 time living in the channel you can 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.850
 find the vice that is promised 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.430
 count a trillion truth too very 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.750
 recommended in the canal delhi then everything 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.460
 I had to have stayed there but for 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.900
 Unfortunately in a review the doctor 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.000
 he realized that cancer was still in his 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.800
 body and that was extending the 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.200
 video to the recommended agency service 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.570
 consider this situation and a video 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.580
 really very very interesting and that 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.260
 I was personally touched by many 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.569
 you will think that he does this simply by 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.240
 visits or subscriptions but 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.469
 with very useful information for the 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.179
 people who have gone through 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:10.439
 similar situations or because one day 

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:10.439
 can go through a situation like this 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:18.380
 being everything by the same hope 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.380
 that in social networks 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.780

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:49.349
 then in each instruction car in 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.050

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:54.599
