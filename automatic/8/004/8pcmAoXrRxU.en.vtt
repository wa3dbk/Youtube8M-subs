market here today so this is the one
we've<00:00:13.429> just<00:00:13.670> got<00:00:13.820> out<00:00:13.910> the<00:00:14.030> box<00:00:14.269> it's<00:00:14.540> a<00:00:14.630> first

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
we've just got out the box it's a first

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.720 
we've just got out the box it's a first
look<00:00:15.200> so<00:00:15.769> how<00:00:15.889> about<00:00:16.009> we<00:00:16.129> go<00:00:16.340> through<00:00:16.640> it

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
look so how about we go through it

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.760 
look so how about we go through it
together<00:00:16.900> now<00:00:17.900> as<00:00:18.020> you<00:00:18.140> can<00:00:18.230> see<00:00:18.289> it's<00:00:18.680> a<00:00:18.740> very

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
together now as you can see it's a very

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.400 
together now as you can see it's a very
light<00:00:19.160> and<00:00:19.400> compact<00:00:19.670> camera<00:00:20.449> a<00:00:20.630> really<00:00:21.260> easy

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
light and compact camera a really easy

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.980 
light and compact camera a really easy
for<00:00:21.590> transit<00:00:22.279> or<00:00:22.490> for<00:00:22.850> similar<00:00:23.570> shooting

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
for transit or for similar shooting

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.300 
for transit or for similar shooting
where<00:00:24.500> you're<00:00:24.590> needed<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:25.010> carry<00:00:25.189> around

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
where you're needed to carry around

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.420 
where you're needed to carry around
quite<00:00:25.789> a<00:00:25.820> few<00:00:26.029> items<00:00:26.180> of<00:00:26.420> kit<00:00:27.039> so<00:00:28.039> let's<00:00:28.220> have<00:00:28.340> a

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
quite a few items of kit so let's have a

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.400 
quite a few items of kit so let's have a
look<00:00:28.460> at<00:00:28.609> its<00:00:28.760> basics<00:00:29.330> so<00:00:30.050> it's<00:00:30.260> got<00:00:30.380> a

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
look at its basics so it's got a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.790 
look at its basics so it's got a
one-third<00:00:30.949> CMOS<00:00:31.519> sensor<00:00:32.139> which<00:00:33.139> is<00:00:33.289> recording

one-third CMOS sensor which is recording

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.360 
one-third CMOS sensor which is recording
at<00:00:33.949> a<00:00:33.979> 24<00:00:34.639> megabit<00:00:35.120> per<00:00:35.149> second<00:00:35.809> rate<00:00:36.280> now<00:00:37.280> it

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
at a 24 megabit per second rate now it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.219 
at a 24 megabit per second rate now it
does<00:00:37.609> have<00:00:37.940> a<00:00:38.499> 64<00:00:39.499> gigabyte<00:00:39.949> internal<00:00:40.699> memory

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
does have a 64 gigabyte internal memory

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:44.020 
does have a 64 gigabyte internal memory
which<00:00:42.229> allows<00:00:42.530> for<00:00:42.799> a<00:00:42.829> recording<00:00:43.339> on<00:00:43.489> its<00:00:43.729> top

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
which allows for a recording on its top
