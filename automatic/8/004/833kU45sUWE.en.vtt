00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.780
 or the family that such a good welcome 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.970
 once again to another call of tutorial 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.950
 duty black ops 2 on braided 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.290
 corporation and good and I know many 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.820
 I missed, I do not forget you 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.710
 I want you to know face I'm less 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.810
 active because I'm doing other things 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.210
 that require my attention but I have not 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.460
 forgotten of none of you today 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.470
 I bring another new group in transit one 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.420
 more time until it goes well I think that 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.809
 practically what you're going to see as girls 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.969
 is trÃ nsit the boots I want to tell you that 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.640
 we become invincible we go back to 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.830
 create another pretty pretty barrier and 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.440
 we also leave the zombie again 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.100
 electric as long as we do not open 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.170
 the doors that next 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.480
 you will see in the video and I am trying 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.380
 explain how to do this simple trick 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.410
 which is also quite easy to agree 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.650
 well first of all it's totally 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.560
 forbidden , I mean it, be careful 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.380
 with this open this door is 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.710
 totally forbidden in agreement and is 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.420
 that can be opened with electric turbine 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.520
 we have to try to stay 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.070
 closed also those two doors should 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.100
 remain closed more than anything because 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.380
 If he does not answer, it will be very big and 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.570
 in addition the electric zombie will be entered 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.680
 to look for it the doors have to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.750
 be closed this is the first step 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.790
 and then we did not braid 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.280
 very easy to take a turbine you remove it 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.259
 outside you leave it hidden and when 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.360
 you have all the things you need 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.360
 to do the trick you go back with the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.880
 shield take the turbine and you put 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.710
 in agreement that's the only way 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.630
 that those two doors remain 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.770
 closed according to the time to make 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.210
 the good guys trick first of all 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.640
 I want to tell you 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.440
 the trick is very easy it is very easy what 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.210
 I mean seriously, it's very, very, very 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.860
 simple the only thing that happens that if not 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.369
 we are used to doing this kind of 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.979
 tricks 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.979
 when we let go of the shield it 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.440
 it breaks us out a laugh a deal and 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.300
 the shield explodes that's a patch that 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.890
 they put in their day to try to avoid 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.380
 that people do all this kind of 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.930
 tricks then what happens that if you do not 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.209
 we do well the shield burst there 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.850
 we will have to go back to pick up again 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.730
 a shield in order to take it easy 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.620
 they took the measures well so that this 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.630
 Well, do not pass us the water or if it happens 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.820
 Well, we are not going for other courses 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.130
 it is already but it is a task we have to 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.220
 back open doors back to my ruckus 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.989
 in agreement centered well centered and 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.870
 you will see how this trick comes out right away 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.900
 as I could always know that I 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.390
 I leave a preview agreement in 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.000
 third person because I like that the 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.550
 20 from various perspectives and also 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.920
 I leave the one that interests us according 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.989
 in the first person as you can see the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.819
 trick itself will take us out for several 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.459
 sites will sometimes get us out 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.769
 and other times he will take us out to the corner 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.879
 which is where we want to stay in 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.620
 as we say let's stay 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.480
 put in the suitcase the only thing that 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.389
 we have to do is turn us towards the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.760
 right and walk slowly we try 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.680
 go slowly until finally we 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.810
 let's put in the truth is that it is very 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.730
 easy I say so I think you're not going to 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.400
 have no problem when it comes to 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.980
 do it the truth 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.180
 once this is done I am going to simply 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.250
 only thing we have to do is to pass 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.530
 rounds I recommend you to have the 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.200
 Galvanized cuffs are important 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.079
 because well it did not happen to me I got to 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.140
 this round 25 and I was going to top of 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.900
 ammunition and everything but you never know 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.849
 agreement I also want to tell you that 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.609
 you can get out of the trick when you have 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.439
 a lot of pasta and say you 3 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.629
 I want to get out of the trick simply because 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.370
 You go out for a week and go out 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.379
 you can go to the bank before 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.329
 finish the game save all your 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.159
 dinerito and once it has already 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.290
 saved if you want to finish the 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.370
 you finish it and good kids 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.109
