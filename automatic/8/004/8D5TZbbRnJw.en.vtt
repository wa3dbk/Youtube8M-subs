00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
this video we're gonna be learning how

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.100 
this video we're gonna be learning how
to<00:00:43.710> save<00:00:43.980> seed<00:00:44.250> from<00:00:44.430> carrots<00:00:44.960> carrots<00:00:45.960> come

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
to save seed from carrots carrots come

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.630 
to save seed from carrots carrots come
in<00:00:46.199> a<00:00:46.260> range<00:00:46.470> of<00:00:46.620> different<00:00:46.680> shapes<00:00:47.190> sizes<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
in a range of different shapes sizes and

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.340 
in a range of different shapes sizes and
colors<00:00:47.790> most<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.659> which<00:00:48.780> you'll<00:00:48.930> never<00:00:49.079> find

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
colors most of which you'll never find

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.020 
colors most of which you'll never find
in<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.589> shops<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.339> this<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:50.850> great

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
in the shops so this is the one great

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.420 
in the shops so this is the one great
advantage<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.720> saving<00:00:52.050> your<00:00:52.170> own<00:00:52.199> seed

carrots are a biennial plant which means

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.630 
carrots are a biennial plant which means
that<00:00:58.199> they<00:00:58.289> grow<00:00:58.469> leaves<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.070> root<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.489> their

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
that they grow leaves in a root in their

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.400 
that they grow leaves in a root in their
first<00:00:59.879> year<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.570> then<00:01:00.690> flower<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.350> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
first year and then flower and go to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.599 
first year and then flower and go to
seed<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.010> second

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609

hungry rodents making a dinner out of
them<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.929> also<00:01:40.140> allows<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.709> to<00:01:40.890> select<00:01:41.069> for

them this also allows you to select for

them this also allows you to select for
the<00:01:41.459> best<00:01:41.640> roots<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.840> now<00:01:45.959> that<00:01:46.020> we've

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
the best roots so now that we've

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.660 
the best roots so now that we've
harvested<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:46.709> carrots<00:01:47.069> we<00:01:47.250> need<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.489> choose

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
harvested the carrots we need to choose

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.880 
harvested the carrots we need to choose
the<00:01:47.789> best<00:01:47.940> ones<00:01:48.179> to<00:01:48.300> save<00:01:48.539> seed<00:01:48.810> from<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.739> do

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the best ones to save seed from so to do

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.139 
the best ones to save seed from so to do
that<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.459> lay<00:01:50.550> them<00:01:50.700> out<00:01:50.789> in<00:01:50.849> a<00:01:51.000> big

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
that I'm going to lay them out in a big

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:02.200 
that I'm going to lay them out in a big
block

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.490 

so<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.450> what<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.660> variety<00:02:04.110> should<00:02:04.350> look

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
so this is what this variety should look

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.590 
so this is what this variety should look
like<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.550> carrot<00:02:05.970> that<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.300> want<00:02:06.570> to

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
like this is the carrot that we want to

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.900 
like this is the carrot that we want to
save<00:02:06.780> seed<00:02:06.990> from<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.470> orange<00:02:08.400> long<00:02:08.700> and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
save seed from it's orange long and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.380 
save seed from it's orange long and
tapered<00:02:10.250> this<00:02:11.250> one<00:02:11.430> here<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.240> see

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
tapered this one here as you can see

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.730 
tapered this one here as you can see
it's<00:02:12.570> purple<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:13.230> we<00:02:13.320> don't<00:02:13.440> want<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.590> be

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
it's purple so we don't want to be

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.450 
it's purple so we don't want to be
saving<00:02:13.950> seed<00:02:14.280> from<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.640> one<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.740> it's

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
saving seed from that one this one it's

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.220 
saving seed from that one this one it's
got<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.730> wrong<00:02:17.880> shape<00:02:18.180> it's<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.540> stump<00:02:18.780> rooted

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
got the wrong shape it's a stump rooted

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.680 
got the wrong shape it's a stump rooted
type<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.800> it's<00:02:20.340> also<00:02:20.490> very<00:02:20.640> very<00:02:20.880> hairy<00:02:21.360> which

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
type and it's also very very hairy which

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.910 
type and it's also very very hairy which
we<00:02:21.870> don't<00:02:22.050> want<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.260> pass<00:02:22.440> on<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> next

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
we don't want to pass on to the next

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.720 
we don't want to pass on to the next
generation

and<00:02:23.960> this<00:02:24.960> one<00:02:25.200> it's<00:02:25.500> forked<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:26.610> also

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
and this one it's forked and it's also

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.000 
and this one it's forked and it's also
split<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.900> we<00:02:27.990> don't<00:02:28.200> want<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.380> be<00:02:28.470> saving<00:02:28.800> seed

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
split so we don't want to be saving seed

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:38.030

from<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.340> one<00:02:29.460> either<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:36.260> I've<00:02:37.260> selected<00:02:37.410> 20

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
from that one either so I've selected 20

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.710 
from that one either so I've selected 20
of<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.220> best<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.730> 20<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.180> minimum<00:02:39.540> number

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720

of the best and 20 is the minimum number
you<00:02:40.080> really<00:02:40.350> ought<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.500> be<00:02:40.650> saving<00:02:41.100> seed<00:02:41.310> from

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
you really ought to be saving seed from

you really ought to be saving seed from
the<00:02:41.610> carrots<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.330> now<00:02:42.930> I'm<00:02:43.140> going<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.530> pop<00:02:43.920> them

the carrots so now I'm going to pop them

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.350 
the carrots so now I'm going to pop them
on<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.400> show<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.610> how<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.760> store<00:02:45.060> them<00:02:45.240> for

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
on and show you how to store them for

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:53.300 
on and show you how to store them for
winter<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:51.350> winter<00:02:52.350> storage<00:02:52.710> I'm<00:02:52.860> removing<00:02:53.130> the

winter a winter storage I'm removing the
leaves<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.850> reduce<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.270> water<00:02:54.420> loss<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.410> you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
leaves to reduce the water loss and you

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.199 
leaves to reduce the water loss and you
can<00:02:55.770> plant<00:02:55.980> them<00:02:56.100> quite<00:02:56.340> close<00:02:56.580> together<00:02:56.760> with

of about a mile then you don't need to

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.430 
of about a mile then you don't need to
worry<00:04:25.430> however<00:04:26.330> there<00:04:26.540> is<00:04:26.660> a<00:04:26.690> wild<00:04:27.050> carrot

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
worry however there is a wild carrot

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.620 
worry however there is a wild carrot

are other flowering carrots or you want

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.300 
are other flowering carrots or you want
to<00:04:36.080> save<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.410> seed<00:04:36.590> for<00:04:36.800> more<00:04:36.980> than<00:04:37.130> one

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
to save the seed for more than one

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.280 
to save the seed for more than one
variety<00:04:37.790> in<00:04:37.970> a<00:04:38.030> year<00:04:38.300> you'll<00:04:38.810> need<00:04:38.990> to<00:04:39.110> make<00:04:39.230> a

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
variety in a year you'll need to make a

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.440 
variety in a year you'll need to make a
cage<00:04:39.590> to<00:04:39.800> keep<00:04:39.950> out<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.190> insects<00:04:40.640> and<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.330> can

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
cage to keep out the insects and you can

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.990 
cage to keep out the insects and you can
use<00:04:41.630> fine<00:04:41.900> net<00:04:42.110> curtains<00:04:42.380> for<00:04:42.860> this<00:04:43.000> you'll

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
use fine net curtains for this you'll

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.760 
use fine net curtains for this you'll
then<00:04:44.180> need<00:04:44.390> to<00:04:44.450> introduce<00:04:44.780> insects<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.530> do<00:04:45.650> the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
then need to introduce insects to do the

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.100 
then need to introduce insects to do the
pollination<00:04:46.160> inside<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:46.970> cage<00:04:47.150> we<00:04:47.930> use

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
pollination inside the cage we use

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.960 
pollination inside the cage we use
fishing<00:04:48.410> maggots<00:04:48.890> hatched<00:04:49.430> into<00:04:49.670> flies

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
fishing maggots hatched into flies

00:04:49.970 --> 00:05:04.910 
fishing maggots hatched into flies
inside<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.750> cage

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.950 

so<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.550> carrot<00:05:05.850> seed<00:05:06.090> takes<00:05:06.360> a<00:05:06.510> few<00:05:06.690> weeks<00:05:06.750> to

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
so the carrot seed takes a few weeks to

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.380 
so the carrot seed takes a few weeks to
ripen<00:05:07.200> after<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:07.920> carrot<00:05:08.220> is<00:05:08.310> flowered<00:05:08.730> but

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
ripen after the carrot is flowered but

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.550 
ripen after the carrot is flowered but
you<00:05:09.450> can<00:05:09.600> tell<00:05:09.780> when<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.020> seeds<00:05:10.260> are<00:05:10.380> right

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
you can tell when the seeds are right

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.080 
you can tell when the seeds are right
because<00:05:10.890> they<00:05:10.980> turn<00:05:11.220> brown<00:05:11.490> and<00:05:11.760> they<00:05:11.820> start

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
because they turn brown and they start

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.700 
because they turn brown and they start
to<00:05:12.180> come<00:05:12.330> away<00:05:12.510> very<00:05:12.540> easily<00:05:12.990> from<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.500> flower

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
to come away very easily from the flower

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.270 
to come away very easily from the flower
heads<00:05:15.470> now<00:05:16.470> some<00:05:16.680> people<00:05:16.950> can<00:05:17.070> get<00:05:17.190> an

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
heads now some people can get an

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.010 
heads now some people can get an
allergic<00:05:17.460> reaction<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:18.090> carrot<00:05:18.540> seed<00:05:18.780> when

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
allergic reaction to carrot seed when

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.300 
allergic reaction to carrot seed when
they're<00:05:19.200> cleaning<00:05:19.440> it<00:05:19.650> because<00:05:19.980> it's<00:05:20.130> very

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
they're cleaning it because it's very

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.430 
they're cleaning it because it's very
dusty<00:05:20.550> so<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.390> prevent<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:21.930> can<00:05:22.230> wear<00:05:22.410> a

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
dusty so to prevent that you can wear a

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.400 
dusty so to prevent that you can wear a
dust<00:05:22.830> mask

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.710 

when<00:05:28.980> dry<00:05:29.250> carrot<00:05:29.790> seeds<00:05:30.030> can<00:05:30.240> be<00:05:30.270> rubbed<00:05:30.570> off

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
when dry carrot seeds can be rubbed off

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.870 
when dry carrot seeds can be rubbed off
the<00:05:30.840> heads<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.290> through<00:05:31.500> a<00:05:31.560> sieve<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:32.640> seeds

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
the heads and through a sieve the seeds

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.220 
the heads and through a sieve the seeds
are<00:05:33.000> quite<00:05:33.180> hairy<00:05:33.480> and<00:05:33.720> tend<00:05:33.930> to<00:05:33.990> clump

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
are quite hairy and tend to clump

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.840 
are quite hairy and tend to clump
together<00:05:34.410> and<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:34.980> sieve<00:05:35.190> really<00:05:35.490> just<00:05:35.700> gets

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
together and the sieve really just gets

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:43.820 
together and the sieve really just gets
rid<00:05:36.030> of<00:05:36.060> any<00:05:36.240> dust<00:05:36.480> an<00:05:36.750> undersized<00:05:37.200> seed<00:05:42.830> if

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
rid of any dust an undersized seed if

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.770 
rid of any dust an undersized seed if
they're<00:05:44.040> thoroughly<00:05:44.310> dry<00:05:44.700> the<00:05:45.240> hairs<00:05:45.480> can<00:05:45.690> be

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
they're thoroughly dry the hairs can be

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.750 
they're thoroughly dry the hairs can be
rubbed<00:05:45.960> off<00:05:46.110> using<00:05:46.530> rubber<00:05:46.710> gloves<00:05:47.010> and<00:05:47.640> this

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
rubbed off using rubber gloves and this

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.670 
rubbed off using rubber gloves and this
just<00:05:47.970> makes<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.330> seed<00:05:48.540> easier<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:49.080> sew<00:05:49.350> in<00:05:49.590> the

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
just makes the seed easier to sew in the

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.240 
just makes the seed easier to sew in the
springtime<00:05:51.200> feed<00:05:52.200> is<00:05:52.350> best<00:05:52.590> stored<00:05:52.860> somewhere

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
springtime feed is best stored somewhere

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.940 
springtime feed is best stored somewhere
cool<00:05:53.640> dry<00:05:54.300> and<00:05:54.540> dark<00:05:54.900> and<00:05:55.140> so<00:05:55.470> fridge<00:05:55.740> isn't

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
cool dry and dark and so fridge isn't

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.740 
cool dry and dark and so fridge isn't
really<00:05:56.340> ideal<00:05:56.370> just<00:05:57.180> because<00:05:57.420> it<00:05:57.540> can<00:05:57.660> be

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
really ideal just because it can be

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.270 
really ideal just because it can be
quite<00:05:58.020> humid<00:05:58.380> in<00:05:58.470> there<00:05:58.680> but<00:05:58.920> a<00:05:58.950> cupboard

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
quite humid in there but a cupboard

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.530 
quite humid in there but a cupboard
under<00:05:59.370> the<00:05:59.520> stairs<00:05:59.610> or<00:06:00.030> an<00:06:00.090> unheated<00:06:00.390> room

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
under the stairs or an unheated room

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.930 
under the stairs or an unheated room
will<00:06:00.900> do<00:06:01.050> fine<00:06:01.290> in<00:06:02.130> these<00:06:02.250> conditions<00:06:02.490> the

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
will do fine in these conditions the

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:16.450 
will do fine in these conditions the
seed<00:06:03.150> should<00:06:03.390> last<00:06:03.600> up<00:06:03.930> to<00:06:04.080> three<00:06:04.290> years

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.310 

so<00:06:17.460> after<00:06:17.760> you<00:06:17.850> put<00:06:17.880> the<00:06:18.120> C's<00:06:18.390> to<00:06:18.900> label<00:06:19.230> it

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
so after you put the C's to label it

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.680 
so after you put the C's to label it
name<00:06:19.770> the<00:06:20.190> variety<00:06:20.700> and<00:06:20.730> most<00:06:21.150> importantly

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
name the variety and most importantly

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.570 
name the variety and most importantly
the<00:06:22.350> date<00:06:24.710> so<00:06:25.710> you've<00:06:25.830> seen<00:06:25.980> the<00:06:26.130> video<00:06:26.370> and

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
the date so you've seen the video and

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.830 
the date so you've seen the video and
hopefully<00:06:26.790> picked<00:06:27.180> up<00:06:27.300> some<00:06:27.480> great<00:06:27.690> tips

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
hopefully picked up some great tips

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.540 
hopefully picked up some great tips
about<00:06:28.110> how<00:06:28.200> to<00:06:28.320> save<00:06:28.650> seed<00:06:28.890> from<00:06:29.070> your<00:06:29.220> carrots

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
about how to save seed from your carrots

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.880 
about how to save seed from your carrots
so<00:06:30.450> there<00:06:30.600> are<00:06:30.690> many<00:06:30.810> benefits<00:06:31.110> for<00:06:31.560> saving

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
so there are many benefits for saving

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.740
