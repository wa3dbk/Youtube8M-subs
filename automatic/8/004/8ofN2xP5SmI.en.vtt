00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
yeah that's not something that you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.039 
yeah that's not something that you
necessarily<00:01:02.280> want<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> cook<00:01:02.850> your<00:01:03.300> dinner<00:01:03.780> in

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
but once he pulls it out for those 30

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.670 
but once he pulls it out for those 30
seconds<00:01:06.180> he<00:01:06.479> basically<00:01:06.869> puts<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.470> that

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
seconds he basically puts it on that

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.190 
seconds he basically puts it on that
turnin<00:01:08.130> bar<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:08.850> he<00:01:09.000> begins<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.600> mold<00:01:09.930> it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
turnin bar where he begins to mold it

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.219 
turnin bar where he begins to mold it
where<00:01:10.710> he<00:01:10.860> begins<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.549> shape<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.840> almost

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
where he begins to shape it it's almost

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.660 
where he begins to shape it it's almost
like<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> creation<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.400> child<00:01:14.700> uh<00:01:16.549> maybe<00:01:17.549> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
like the creation of a child uh maybe a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.149 
like the creation of a child uh maybe a
child<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.509> Ben<00:01:18.810> Roethlisberger<00:01:19.740> or<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
child for Ben Roethlisberger or the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.370 
child for Ben Roethlisberger or the
football<00:01:20.610> gods<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.299> he<00:01:21.420> starts<00:01:21.960> ironing

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
football gods and then he starts ironing

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.980 
football gods and then he starts ironing
out<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> seams<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:24.060> nothing<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.630> I'm

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
out the seams and it's nothing that I'm

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.140 
out the seams and it's nothing that I'm
necessarily<00:01:25.290> gonna<00:01:25.979> try<00:01:26.280> because<00:01:26.970> quite

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
necessarily gonna try because quite

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
necessarily gonna try because quite
frankly<00:01:27.290> I'd<00:01:28.290> probably<00:01:28.560> make<00:01:28.920> an<00:01:29.100> awful

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
frankly I'd probably make an awful

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.190 
frankly I'd probably make an awful
football<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:30.000> once<00:01:30.390> we're<00:01:30.600> done<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
football but once we're done with the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600 
football but once we're done with the
molding<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> football<00:01:32.159> gets<00:01:32.280> turned

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
molding and the football gets turned

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.249 
molding and the football gets turned
inside<00:01:33.000> out<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.540> good<00:01:33.750> stuff<00:01:33.780> it's

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
inside out and all that good stuff it's

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.859 
inside out and all that good stuff it's
time<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.799> football<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.759> get<00:01:35.970> laced<00:01:36.329> up<00:01:36.600> I

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
time for the football to get laced up I

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.719 
time for the football to get laced up I
didn't<00:01:37.380> necessarily<00:01:37.470> know<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.400> football

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
didn't necessarily know that a football

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.179 
didn't necessarily know that a football
had<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> bladder<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> bladder<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
had a bladder but it is a bladder and

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.859 
had a bladder but it is a bladder and
the<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.579> fortunate<00:01:42.060> part<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.720> not

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the the fortunate part is it's not

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.630 
the the fortunate part is it's not
filled<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.320> any<00:01:43.530> type<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.829> excrement<00:01:44.369> or
