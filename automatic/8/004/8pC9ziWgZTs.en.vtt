00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.879 
modified pick up and knit is a technique
that<00:00:12.490> I<00:00:12.700> came<00:00:12.820> up<00:00:13.030> with<00:00:13.209> to<00:00:13.840> fill<00:00:14.170> a<00:00:14.199> specific

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
that I came up with to fill a specific

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.920 
that I came up with to fill a specific
need<00:00:15.129> that<00:00:15.429> arose<00:00:15.760> when<00:00:16.119> I<00:00:16.150> was<00:00:16.480> working<00:00:16.660> on

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
need that arose when I was working on

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.319 
need that arose when I was working on
Sheldon's<00:00:17.529> bee<00:00:17.830> costume<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.880> need<00:00:19.090> that<00:00:19.119> I

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:19.329 
Sheldon's bee costume the need that I

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.990 
Sheldon's bee costume the need that I
had<00:00:19.509> was<00:00:19.779> to<00:00:20.079> pick<00:00:20.289> up<00:00:20.470> stitches<00:00:21.009> without

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
had was to pick up stitches without

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.999 
had was to pick up stitches without
pulling<00:00:22.509> the<00:00:22.810> yarn<00:00:23.020> from<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.410> back<00:00:23.619> side<00:00:23.980> of

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
pulling the yarn from the back side of

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.220 
pulling the yarn from the back side of
the<00:00:24.310> fabric<00:00:24.520> to<00:00:24.970> the<00:00:25.000> front<00:00:25.419> because<00:00:25.869> that

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
the fabric to the front because that

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.170 
the fabric to the front because that
works<00:00:26.500> very<00:00:26.829> well<00:00:26.919> when<00:00:27.369> you're<00:00:27.550> picking<00:00:27.969> up

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
works very well when you're picking up

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.850 
works very well when you're picking up
around<00:00:28.509> an<00:00:28.689> edge<00:00:29.020> but<00:00:29.439> when<00:00:29.559> you're<00:00:29.680> picking

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
around an edge but when you're picking

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.799 
around an edge but when you're picking
up<00:00:30.099> in<00:00:30.219> the<00:00:30.309> middle<00:00:30.520> of<00:00:30.790> a<00:00:30.910> piece<00:00:31.119> in<00:00:31.360> this<00:00:31.540> case

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:31.809 
up in the middle of a piece in this case

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.260 
up in the middle of a piece in this case
I<00:00:32.079> was<00:00:32.290> picking<00:00:32.649> up<00:00:32.770> along<00:00:33.430> a<00:00:33.460> ring<00:00:33.760> underneath

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
I was picking up along a ring underneath

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.139 
I was picking up along a ring underneath
Sheldon's<00:00:35.020> turtleneck<00:00:35.620> I<00:00:35.829> couldn't<00:00:36.460> pull<00:00:37.000> the

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
Sheldon's turtleneck I couldn't pull the

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:38.549 
Sheldon's turtleneck I couldn't pull the
yarn<00:00:37.300> from<00:00:37.450> the<00:00:37.629> back<00:00:37.809> because<00:00:38.079> that<00:00:38.410> would

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
yarn from the back because that would

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.619 
yarn from the back because that would
require<00:00:38.739> me<00:00:39.160> to<00:00:39.190> kind<00:00:39.579> of<00:00:39.640> go<00:00:39.879> around<00:00:40.090> the

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
require me to kind of go around the

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.450 
require me to kind of go around the
turtleneck<00:00:41.050> so<00:00:41.410> I<00:00:41.440> needed<00:00:41.710> some<00:00:42.010> other

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
turtleneck so I needed some other

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.250 
turtleneck so I needed some other
technique<00:00:43.240> that<00:00:43.420> would<00:00:43.540> work<00:00:43.690> better<00:00:43.990> and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
technique that would work better and

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.140 
technique that would work better and
this<00:00:44.829> is<00:00:45.010> actually<00:00:45.160> a<00:00:45.370> fairly<00:00:45.700> simple

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
this is actually a fairly simple

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.600 
this is actually a fairly simple
technique<00:00:46.720> but<00:00:47.110> it<00:00:47.290> can<00:00:47.500> be<00:00:47.620> helpful<00:00:47.860> to<00:00:48.220> see

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
technique but it can be helpful to see

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.310 
technique but it can be helpful to see
it<00:00:48.730> rather<00:00:48.970> than<00:00:49.270> just<00:00:49.480> hear<00:00:49.780> it<00:00:49.900> described

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
it rather than just hear it described

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.470 
it rather than just hear it described
the<00:00:50.829> first<00:00:51.100> thing<00:00:51.340> that<00:00:51.370> you<00:00:51.579> need<00:00:51.790> to<00:00:51.820> do<00:00:52.180> is

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
the first thing that you need to do is

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.710 
the first thing that you need to do is
find<00:00:53.410> your<00:00:53.650> knitted<00:00:54.310> stitches<00:00:54.730> your<00:00:55.030> v-shaped

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
find your knitted stitches your v-shaped

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.860 
find your knitted stitches your v-shaped
knit<00:00:56.320> stitches<00:00:56.649> and<00:00:57.040> pull<00:00:57.940> up<00:00:58.149> on<00:00:58.329> the<00:00:58.570> bar

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
knit stitches and pull up on the bar

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.580 
knit stitches and pull up on the bar
that<00:00:59.440> is<00:00:59.620> in<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.920> middle<00:01:00.220> of<00:01:00.399> that<00:01:00.670> V<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:02.440> is

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
that is in the middle of that V this is

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.340 
that is in the middle of that V this is
the<00:01:02.739> same<00:01:02.980> bar<00:01:03.700> that<00:01:04.149> you<00:01:04.360> would<00:01:04.570> use<00:01:04.869> to<00:01:05.079> seem

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
the same bar that you would use to seem

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.289 
the same bar that you would use to seem
if<00:01:05.680> you<00:01:05.829> were<00:01:05.979> seeming<00:01:06.430> in<00:01:06.579> mattress<00:01:07.030> stitch

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
if you were seeming in mattress stitch

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.660 
if you were seeming in mattress stitch
so<00:01:07.659> it<00:01:07.869> should<00:01:08.140> look<00:01:08.290> familiar<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:09.280> second

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
so it should look familiar the second

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.719 
so it should look familiar the second
step<00:01:09.939> is<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.840> take<00:01:11.469> your<00:01:11.710> needle<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.159> poke<00:01:12.670> it

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
step is to take your needle and poke it

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.300 
step is to take your needle and poke it
through<00:01:12.939> that<00:01:13.570> bar<00:01:14.110> but<00:01:14.409> instead<00:01:14.890> of<00:01:15.010> poking

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
through that bar but instead of poking

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.250 
through that bar but instead of poking
it<00:01:15.610> through<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.090> fabric<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.659> other<00:01:16.900> side

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
it through the fabric to the other side

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.840 
it through the fabric to the other side
you're<00:01:17.770> just<00:01:17.950> going<00:01:18.159> to<00:01:18.250> slide<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.700> needle

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
you're just going to slide the needle

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.910 
you're just going to slide the needle
underneath<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:19.630> bar<00:01:19.840> from<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.200> bottom<00:01:20.710> to

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
underneath the bar from the bottom to

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.760 
underneath the bar from the bottom to
the<00:01:21.159> top<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.790> keep<00:01:22.510> the<00:01:22.780> needle<00:01:23.049> on<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.320> right

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
the top and keep the needle on the right

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.340 
the top and keep the needle on the right
side<00:01:24.040> of<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.310> fabric<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.750> third<00:01:25.930> step

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
side of the fabric then the third step

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.320 
side of the fabric then the third step
is<00:01:26.560> simply<00:01:27.010> to<00:01:27.280> wrap<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.700> yarn<00:01:27.729> around<00:01:28.060> the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
is simply to wrap the yarn around the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.760 
is simply to wrap the yarn around the
needle<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:28.930> pull<00:01:29.110> it<00:01:29.229> back<00:01:29.409> through<00:01:29.710> that

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
needle and to pull it back through that

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.039 
needle and to pull it back through that
bar<00:01:30.100> from<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.400> top<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.030> bottom<00:01:31.150> so<00:01:31.869> you've

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
bar from the top to the bottom so you've

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.450 
bar from the top to the bottom so you've
picked<00:01:32.320> up<00:01:32.470> a<00:01:32.590> knit<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:32.860> stitch<00:01:32.920> through<00:01:33.430> the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
picked up a knit a stitch through the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.760 
picked up a knit a stitch through the
bar<00:01:33.790> but<00:01:34.030> you've<00:01:34.180> done<00:01:34.390> so<00:01:34.630> with<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.200> yarn

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
bar but you've done so with the yarn

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.429 
bar but you've done so with the yarn
always<00:01:36.310> on<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.700> top<00:01:36.880> of<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.299> fabric<00:01:37.479> that's

always on the top of the fabric that's

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:46.500 
always on the top of the fabric that's
