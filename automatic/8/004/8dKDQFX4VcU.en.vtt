system has a really unique design it's

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.590 
system has a really unique design it's
thicker<00:02:31.440> on<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.860> front<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.760> as<00:02:33.240> we<00:02:33.390> move

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
thicker on the front and as we move

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.360 
thicker on the front and as we move
around<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.140> back<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.710> can<00:02:34.860> see<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.130> we

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
around to the back you can see that we

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.580 
around to the back you can see that we
have<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.610> wedge<00:02:35.940> shape<00:02:36.420> let<00:02:36.900> me<00:02:36.989> line<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.410> back

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
have a wedge shape let me line that back

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.500 
have a wedge shape let me line that back
up<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.010> center<00:02:38.340> here<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:39.330> gets

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
up in the center here and it gets

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.479 
up in the center here and it gets
thinner<00:02:39.900> as<00:02:40.200> we<00:02:40.680> go<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.040> back<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
thinner as we go to the back of the

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.370 
thinner as we go to the back of the
grill<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.030> what<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.360> does<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.020> gives<00:02:43.170> us

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
grill and what that does is it gives us

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.240
