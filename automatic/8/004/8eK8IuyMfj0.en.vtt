00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:17.640
 wow aaa lear arraiá chic a saint 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.279
 you are one more field and commented and the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.779
 today is clear again about because of a 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.350
 fan hawks 3 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.390
 we have new mysteries we have news and 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.580
 This time we get out of this 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.779
 boss snap story of those 15 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.579
 coming mysteries 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.860
 through these neps want to get it coming 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.350
 letting go and we're going to something a little 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.930
 how much more interesting are codes 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.790
 morse is more cultured than they speak 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.739
 So we had this, I just 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.120
 letting pass in the video of 11 should 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.250
 have seen the video from yesterday and brought a 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.500
 summary is of all the last snows that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.420
 they left on the mysterious new twitter 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.890
 What do we have in the marketing man? 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.690
 updating the message of the day of the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.579
 block 2 finally several things that you do not 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.469
 You saw the video to tell you to stay 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.660
 aware of everything we have there in the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.590
 novel currently novel black ops 3 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.270
 rock 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.909
 only one thing left missing show 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.640
 for you to explain to you that in the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.860
 hair in this new top image of the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.860
 marketing twitter - we have 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.630
 codes hidden in the corners of the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.119
 image is all right side as in the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.180
 left side we have morse codes 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.340
 and they translated apparently go in 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.860
 lead to a mysterious website actually 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.119
 they just give an idea to people who 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.890
 going to be a website is not because it's the 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.439
 next we put that image there 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.509
 we see that it left 90 ° people 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.110
 can translate the code 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.979
 morse 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.670
 Okay, and what she tells us is simply 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:45.210
 http and then she speaks the abbreviations that 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 r in theory this is an acronym 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.829
 so basically it starts to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.490
 explain that we will have 1 m site 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.140
 http www.amd.com for the people we have 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.540
 a site at some point that should be 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.149
 veiled must have mystery within him 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.369
 ok the doubt would be for this acronym 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.540
 what rv what happens is the following 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.569
 there is a code called code that is the 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.600
 that code as the staff out there 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.560
 Speech is this code is 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.470
 is as follows it works as follows 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.170
 way is this such a code that it 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.110
 always consists of three letters always 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.640
 starting with the letter that's right and then he 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.070
 has these three letters 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.470
 Together, the meaning always 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.330
 code to see what we find there 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.480
 translating this morse code from treyarch 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.040
 which means Aryan harry ie you 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.090
 is ready 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.680
 it's not a question if you're ready 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.600
 obviously it must be one of the ganassi we 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.520
 we'll be ready for a website like 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.870
 This one is ready to copy 13 anyway. 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.250
 Let's face it, let's just say a little cliché. 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.100
 but we translate that way 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.080
 through this said that the code is then the 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.250
 What do we have for the moment? 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.370
 banner is what we got 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.020
 find out through this translation 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.460
 I believe that this website comes to light 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.600
 somehow we'll find out 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.550
 your website 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.430
 before the revelation of the right trailer 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.170
 The plot will leave now, on Sunday 26 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.660
 next Sunday we will fall 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.100
 this trailer revealed to us and me 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.040
 I think before that we should have 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.170
 Such a mysterious website to put 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.300
 more things in our head I believe 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.740
 maybe even today some more 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.450
 thing about these websites and should 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.760
 watching this video is just after lunch 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.590
 to the tournament soon after lunch maybe 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.090
 I'll have a second video later. 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.210
 talking about something new that has 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.640
 on the part of the code as such. 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.400
 of the right website but it's basically this 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.050
 I ended up leaving yesterday yesterday 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.790
 theory that is emerging there is that 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.950
 all these grandchildren may be related to 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.140
 men, especially after this 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.790
 last snap of which budget spoke 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.120
 that only four people survived 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.190
 No, and a lot of people ended up referring this. 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.980
 men already had some theories 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.590
 there it could be a kind of 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.630
 income from relationship with zombie tests 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.340
 and things like that are all those 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.010
 these things the fan is doing 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.080
 and I find it particularly difficult 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.210
 everything that we are seeing is related 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.890
 with men but it might happen 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.750
 it might be that you really are 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.640
 Do you want to do something different, I just think 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.410
 difficult because she always leaves the 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.660
 men's marketing for the final 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.640
 people saw this very clearly in lopez 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.490
 of the nets had the first trailer of 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.080
 zombies is official of xbox 2 a month before 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.220
 of the game cast less than this until maybe 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.750
 So 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.310
 and I think it's too early for us 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.750
 start the thing on the shoulders but 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.180
 still a possibility to people 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.560
 can not take anything for granted in this 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.910
 I hope you would like this moment. 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.680
 video if you liked and want to leave the 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.880
 favorite haiti stays on 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.620
 channel that may still have one more 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.550
 video I'm going to stay here a hug 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.550
 everybody gets god and even is one more
