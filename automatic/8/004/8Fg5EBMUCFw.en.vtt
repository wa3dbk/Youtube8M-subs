00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
unit we take a look around we make sure

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.160 
unit we take a look around we make sure
that<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.789> got<00:00:44.910> all<00:00:45.149> those<00:00:45.300> common<00:00:45.719> areas<00:00:45.989> that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
that we got all those common areas that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.110 
that we got all those common areas that
could<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.440> potentials<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.340> leaks<00:00:47.520> make<00:00:47.969> sure

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
could be potentials for leaks make sure

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.850 
could be potentials for leaks make sure
we<00:00:48.239> got<00:00:48.390> those<00:00:48.570> sealed<00:00:48.840> up<00:00:49.020> good<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.500> then

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
we got those sealed up good and then

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.080 
we got those sealed up good and then
we're<00:00:50.010> good<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.190> go<00:00:50.399> we're<00:00:50.640> ready<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.910> ship

your unit to you so let's take a look
and<00:00:53.399> see<00:00:53.550> how<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> rainbow<00:00:54.030> works<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.660> then

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and see how the rainbow works and then

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:15.230 
and see how the rainbow works and then
we'll<00:00:55.050> go<00:00:55.230> inside<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.649> see<00:00:56.340> how<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.489> did

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.570 

now<00:01:16.170> we're<00:01:16.350> inside<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> shadow<00:01:16.979> cruiser<00:01:17.340> it's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
now we're inside the shadow cruiser it's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.430 
now we're inside the shadow cruiser it's
inside<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> rain<00:01:18.210> Bay<00:01:18.390> first<00:01:19.140> thing<00:01:19.320> we're

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
inside the rain Bay first thing we're

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.080 
inside the rain Bay first thing we're
gonna<00:01:19.530> look<00:01:19.619> at<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.100> around<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.460> slide-outs

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
gonna look at is around the slide-outs

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.580 
gonna look at is around the slide-outs
that's<00:01:21.600> probably<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> most

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
that's probably one of the most

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.990 
that's probably one of the most
important<00:01:23.100> areas<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.460> look<00:01:23.610> for<00:01:23.850> because

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
important areas to look for because

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.670 
important areas to look for because
you've<00:01:24.300> got<00:01:24.420> seals<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.020> other<00:01:25.110> things<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you've got seals and other things that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.980 
you've got seals and other things that
could<00:01:26.280> potentially<00:01:26.400> fail<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.690> we<00:01:27.780> check

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
could potentially fail so we check

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.050 
could potentially fail so we check
around<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> exterior<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.190> slide-out<00:01:29.490> we

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
around the exterior of the slide-out we

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.670 
around the exterior of the slide-out we
check<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> carpet<00:01:30.750> around<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.080> slide-out<00:01:31.350> on

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
check the carpet around the slide-out on

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.770 
check the carpet around the slide-out on
both<00:01:31.890> sides<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:32.970> check<00:01:33.180> anywhere<00:01:33.570> that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
both sides and we check anywhere that

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.330 
both sides and we check anywhere that
there<00:01:33.930> could<00:01:34.140> be<00:01:34.170> water<00:01:34.500> intrusion<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.190> this

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
there could be water intrusion in this

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.130 
there could be water intrusion in this
flight<00:01:35.550> out<00:01:35.729> area<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:36.659> we'll<00:01:36.810> move<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
flight out area then we'll move on to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.480 
flight out area then we'll move on to
all<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.440> windows<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:37.950> make<00:01:38.159> sure<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:38.399> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
all the windows we make sure all the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.490 
all the windows we make sure all the
windows<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:39.030> leak<00:01:39.270> by<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:40.140> around<00:01:40.320> those

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
windows don't leak by going around those

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.050 
windows don't leak by going around those
windows<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:40.890> making<00:01:41.280> sure<00:01:41.430> there's<00:01:41.610> no<00:01:41.670> signs

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
windows and making sure there's no signs

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.060 
windows and making sure there's no signs
of<00:01:42.240> water<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.320> look<00:01:43.470> at<00:01:43.560> things<00:01:43.800> on<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
of water then we look at things on the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.130 
of water then we look at things on the
