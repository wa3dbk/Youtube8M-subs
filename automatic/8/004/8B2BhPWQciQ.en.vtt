00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
us the textured tiles off the smooth I

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.979 
us the textured tiles off the smooth I
actually<00:00:43.640> prefer<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.670> smooth<00:00:44.910> myself<00:00:45.149> but

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
actually prefer the smooth myself but

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.569 
actually prefer the smooth myself but
these<00:00:46.110> texture<00:00:46.680> tiles<00:00:46.890> aren't<00:00:47.100> even<00:00:47.340> very

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
these texture tiles aren't even very

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.040 
these texture tiles aren't even very
textured<00:00:48.059> they're<00:00:48.180> actually<00:00:48.570> quite<00:00:49.170> smooth

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
textured they're actually quite smooth

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.510 
textured they're actually quite smooth
mmm<00:00:52.140> they<00:00:52.440> feel<00:00:52.649> comfortable<00:00:53.070> while<00:00:53.250> speed

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
mmm they feel comfortable while speed

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:03.380 
mmm they feel comfortable while speed
solving<00:01:00.500> nothing<00:01:01.500> comfortable<00:01:02.399> feel<00:01:02.730> they

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
solving nothing comfortable feel they

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.570 
solving nothing comfortable feel they
don't<00:01:03.539> really<00:01:03.719> stick<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:04.320> off<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.890> cube<00:01:05.189> very

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
don't really stick up off the cube very

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.160 
don't really stick up off the cube very
much<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.390> could<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:08.810> see<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:09.990> pretty

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
much if you could see see it's pretty

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.359 
much if you could see see it's pretty
much<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.560> sticker<00:01:10.920> because<00:01:11.280> it

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
much like it's sticker because it

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.020 
much like it's sticker because it
actually<00:01:11.610> goes<00:01:11.729> into<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> plastic<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:14.030> what

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
actually goes into the plastic so what

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.580 
actually goes into the plastic so what
does<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.270> mean<00:01:15.479> how<00:01:15.780> easy<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> replace

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
does this mean how easy is it to replace

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.830 
does this mean how easy is it to replace
well<00:01:17.220> I'll<00:01:17.430> go<00:01:17.580> ahead<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.939> show<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.180> I'll

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840

gonna<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> easiest<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.810> if

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
gonna be the easiest to get to but if

screwdriver<00:02:16.370> under<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.780> then<00:02:17.870> just<00:02:18.110> lift<00:02:18.290> it

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
screwdriver under and then just lift it

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.290 
screwdriver under and then just lift it
up<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.830> then<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.520> can<00:02:19.670> see<00:02:19.849> we<00:02:20.000> have<00:02:20.150> the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
up and then you can see we have the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.449 
up and then you can see we have the
separated<00:02:20.780> tab<00:02:22.180> now<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:24.080> inside<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.220> edge

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
separated tab now the inside of the edge

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.960 
separated tab now the inside of the edge
is<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:26.810> little<00:02:27.170> bit<00:02:27.349> indented<00:02:28.280> if<00:02:28.459> you<00:02:28.610> couldn't

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
is a little bit indented if you couldn't

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.229 
is a little bit indented if you couldn't
see<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.890> it's<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.190> there's<00:02:31.489> little<00:02:31.760> slots

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
see that it's and there's little slots

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.370 
see that it's and there's little slots
for<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.780> edge<00:02:32.930> there<00:02:33.410> for<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.910> tile<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.900> what

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
for the edge there for the tile so what

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.940 
for the edge there for the tile so what
you<00:02:36.530> do<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.830> use<00:02:37.010> pop<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.610> just<00:02:37.790> push<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.209> in

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
you do is use pop you just push it in

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.240 
you do is use pop you just push it in
snap<00:02:39.950> trying<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.400> place<00:02:41.590> one<00:02:42.590> little<00:02:42.890> tricky

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
snap trying to place one little tricky

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.020 
snap trying to place one little tricky
part<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.640> found<00:02:43.970> is<00:02:44.269> getting<00:02:44.600> on<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:45.280> edge<00:02:46.280> caps

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
part I found is getting on the edge caps

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.370 
part I found is getting on the edge caps
because<00:02:47.420> if<00:02:48.080> you're<00:02:48.230> not<00:02:48.260> careful<00:02:49.030> you'll<00:02:50.380> see

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
because if you're not careful you'll see

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.199 
because if you're not careful you'll see
I<00:02:51.440> got<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:51.769> one<00:02:51.950> on<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.730> just<00:02:52.940> goes<00:02:53.090> right

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
I got that one on it just goes right

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.960 
I got that one on it just goes right
back<00:02:53.390> in<00:02:54.340> it's<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.400> same<00:02:55.640> thing<00:02:55.819> at<00:02:55.910> the

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
back in it's the same thing at the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.479 
back in it's the same thing at the
corners<00:02:56.330> actually<00:02:56.750> easier<00:02:57.260> same<00:02:57.830> idea<00:02:58.220> so

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
corners actually easier same idea so

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.509 
corners actually easier same idea so
there's<00:02:58.640> none<00:02:58.760> really<00:02:59.030> use<00:02:59.900> showing<00:03:00.410> it<00:03:00.560> but<00:03:01.340> I

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
there's none really use showing it but I

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
will show you is the core just a cube

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.990 
will show you is the core just a cube

yeah and it's equipped for your hardware
for<00:03:18.290> speed<00:03:19.420> it's<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.480> pretty<00:03:20.660> quick<00:03:20.870> cube<00:03:21.200> I

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
for speed it's a pretty quick cube I

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:29.319 
for speed it's a pretty quick cube I
mean<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:27.459> really<00:03:28.459> don't<00:03:28.640> think<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.910> speed<00:03:29.209> is

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
mean I really don't think the speed is

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.069 
mean I really don't think the speed is
gonna<00:03:29.510> be<00:03:29.690> an<00:03:29.780> issue<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:30.109> this<00:03:30.230> puzzle<00:03:30.440> at<00:03:31.190> all

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
gonna be an issue of this puzzle at all

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.140 
gonna be an issue of this puzzle at all
corner<00:03:33.079> cutting<00:03:33.319> if<00:03:33.769> it's<00:03:34.040> not<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.700> best

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
corner cutting if it's not the best

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.319 
corner cutting if it's not the best
corner<00:03:35.690> cutter<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.549> mean<00:03:37.549> it<00:03:37.730> can<00:03:38.090> cut<00:03:40.090> lose<00:03:41.090> its

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
corner cutter I mean it can cut lose its

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.600 
corner cutter I mean it can cut lose its
corner<00:03:41.720> cutting

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.730 

so<00:03:47.240> if<00:03:47.420> you<00:03:47.510> corner<00:03:47.750> cut<00:03:48.110> a<00:03:48.140> little<00:03:48.470> bit<00:03:48.560> past

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
so if you corner cut a little bit past

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.210 
so if you corner cut a little bit past
the<00:03:48.890> line<00:03:49.570> but<00:03:50.570> a<00:03:50.900> little<00:03:51.350> bit<00:03:51.530> more<00:03:51.560> than<00:03:52.040> that

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
the line but a little bit more than that

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.950 
the line but a little bit more than that
it<00:03:52.490> starts<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:52.940> lose<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:54.070> did<00:03:55.070> cut<00:03:55.370> but<00:03:56.300> as<00:03:56.750> you

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
it starts to lose I did cut but as you

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.890 
it starts to lose I did cut but as you
can<00:03:57.050> see<00:03:57.110> it<00:03:57.320> starts<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.740> lose<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.630> is<00:03:59.630> this

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
can see it starts to lose it is this

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.430 
can see it starts to lose it is this
Cuban<00:04:00.230> palpable<00:04:00.800> yes<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.760> no<00:04:02.660> now<00:04:03.410> that

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
Cuban palpable yes and no now that

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.140 
Cuban palpable yes and no now that
doesn't<00:04:03.710> really<00:04:03.890> make<00:04:04.100> sense<00:04:04.130> it<00:04:04.430> acute<00:04:04.790> side

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
doesn't really make sense it acute side

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.330 
doesn't really make sense it acute side
are<00:04:05.390> probable<00:04:05.870> or<00:04:06.050> it<00:04:06.140> isn't<00:04:06.470> I<00:04:06.620> say<00:04:07.070> yes<00:04:07.310> and

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
are probable or it isn't I say yes and

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.190 
are probable or it isn't I say yes and
no<00:04:07.550> because<00:04:07.880> for<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.240> most<00:04:08.420> part<00:04:08.570> it<00:04:08.990> is

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
no because for the most part it is

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.130 
no because for the most part it is
unpoppable<00:04:09.980> but<00:04:10.910> I<00:04:11.120> also<00:04:11.330> do<00:04:11.600> fine<00:04:11.900> during

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
unpoppable but I also do fine during

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.650 
unpoppable but I also do fine during
sauce<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:12.740> get<00:04:12.920> random<00:04:13.340> pops<00:04:13.580> I<00:04:13.760> call<00:04:14.000> them<00:04:14.180> this

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
sauce I get random pops I call them this

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.660 
sauce I get random pops I call them this
means<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:15.080> an<00:04:15.200> edge<00:04:15.470> a<00:04:15.830> single<00:04:16.280> edge<00:04:16.459> will

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
means that an edge a single edge will

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.820 
means that an edge a single edge will
just<00:04:16.850> fall<00:04:17.060> out<00:04:17.090> like<00:04:17.480> wow<00:04:17.600> I'm<00:04:17.660> solving<00:04:18.140> so

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
just fall out like wow I'm solving so

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.430 
just fall out like wow I'm solving so
I'll<00:04:18.980> be<00:04:19.100> solving<00:04:22.960> trying<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.020> be<00:04:24.110> rough<00:04:24.320> with

I'll be solving trying to be rough with

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:35.260 
I'll be solving trying to be rough with
this<00:04:24.650> I<00:04:33.250> can't<00:04:34.250> get<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.490> pop<00:04:34.730> but<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.090> guys

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.570 
this I can't get it to pop but you guys
should<00:04:35.750> be<00:04:35.780> able<00:04:35.930> understand<00:04:36.530> pretty<00:04:37.280> much<00:04:37.460> an

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
should be able understand pretty much an

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.630 
should be able understand pretty much an
edge<00:04:37.730> piece<00:04:38.000> just<00:04:38.180> Falls<00:04:38.420> right<00:04:38.630> now<00:04:39.070> so<00:04:40.070> what

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
edge piece just Falls right now so what

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.340 
edge piece just Falls right now so what
I<00:04:40.670> recommend<00:04:40.850> this<00:04:41.270> cube<00:04:41.510> is<00:04:41.780> a<00:04:41.810> main<00:04:42.080> speed

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
I recommend this cube is a main speed

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.190 
I recommend this cube is a main speed
cube<00:04:42.680> yes<00:04:43.070> I<00:04:43.250> would<00:04:43.460> one<00:04:44.390> of<00:04:44.420> my<00:04:44.570> friends<00:04:45.080> the
