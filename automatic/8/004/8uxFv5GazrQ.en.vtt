00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.279
 eg ck 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.250
 the clock is ticking, what time is it ? 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.820
 already five to twelve already 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.789
 highest time around this question too 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:35.830
 we have to answer at one o'clock 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:39.770
 look clock in polish 6 o'clock 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:43.129
 hard to believe that these two 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.829
 We have something in common they have 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.160
 not even though, sega is one 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.550
 loanword from german but from 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.850
 an old word of today's words 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.989
 pointer and there you can already see the 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 Similarity of the pointer is only one 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.130
 By the way, part of a clock was lucky 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.970
 he rather 7 o'clock 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.580
 or maybe 19 o'clock anyway 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.460
 watches determine our lives they say 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.090
 when we have something to do 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.810
 when we get up to school or to 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.580
 work and go to bed again 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.659
 earlier, people are more likely to 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.229
 the sun oriented and what watches 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.450
 is there, for example, the hourglass or 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.820
 the sundial 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:42.530
 many certainly have their home too 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:45.610
 There is also an atomic clock 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.259
 to explain very exactly how the 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.470
 work would be a bit too 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.470
 The surprises are complicated at home 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.560
 not even thought but maybe you have 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.880
 your home a radio alarm clock the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.159
 get a radio signal from atomic clocks 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.770
 and then display the exact time 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.729
 you do not have to watch anymore 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.150
 and for which watches is 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.300
 Germany clearly knows the 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.450
 Cuckoo clocks every full hour 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.030
 comes a cuckoo 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.590
 the ur and you can hear cuckoo calls 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.819
 Above all , these watches are produced 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.680
 in the black forest in the south of germany 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:36.000
 matter of taste these watches kitsch 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.819
 Some would probably say so I look 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.099
 on my watch and see that our time 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.500
 has expired 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.760
 This was unfortunately the last part of our 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.549
 hiking weather series 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.269
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.269
 take care
