00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.320 
can't think about I mean yeah they
changed<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.280> template<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> whole<00:02:29.030> bunch<00:02:29.180> of

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
changed a template a whole bunch of

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.390 
changed a template a whole bunch of
times<00:02:29.540> if<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:29.870> know<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.620> design<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
times if you know the design and the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.979 
times if you know the design and the
layout<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.090> graphics<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.660> stuff<00:02:32.720> like<00:02:32.930> that

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
layout and graphics and stuff like that

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.130 
layout and graphics and stuff like that
but<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:34.700> problem<00:02:35.239> with<00:02:35.360> having<00:02:35.599> we're

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140

but the problem with having we're
thinking<00:02:36.500> about<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.830> old<00:02:36.950> runescape<00:02:37.489> because

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
thinking about the old runescape because

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.600 
thinking about the old runescape because
I<00:02:37.760> want<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.000> make<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.180> video<00:02:38.650> really<00:02:39.650> on<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.459> old

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
runescape you know like yeah not a video

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.640 
runescape you know like yeah not a video
on<00:02:42.800> here<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.100> my<00:02:43.220> main<00:02:43.400> channel<00:02:43.630> but<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:44.930> want<00:02:45.560> to

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
on here on my main channel but I want to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.410 
on here on my main channel but I want to
make<00:02:45.769> a<00:02:45.799> video<00:02:46.010> basically<00:02:46.489> on<00:02:46.760> like<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.150> old

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.120 
make a video basically on like the old
old<00:02:47.720> runescape<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:48.530> i'm<00:02:48.590> having<00:02:48.980> some

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
old runescape but i'm having some

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.009 
old runescape but i'm having some
problems<00:02:49.760> thinking<00:02:50.239> about<00:02:50.480> what<00:02:50.660> else<00:02:50.810> they

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
problems thinking about what else they

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.059 
problems thinking about what else they
fucked<00:02:51.799> with<00:02:52.040> now<00:02:52.989> they<00:02:53.989> took<00:02:54.230> away<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.620> wild

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
fucked with now they took away the wild

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.009 
fucked with now they took away the wild
and<00:02:55.730> they<00:02:55.849> took<00:02:56.030> away<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.239> tray<00:02:56.480> limit<00:02:56.840> I

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
and they took away the tray limit I

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.800 
and they took away the tray limit I
can't<00:02:57.769> really<00:02:57.980> think<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.370> anything<00:02:58.640> else<00:02:58.910> of

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
can't really think of anything else of

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.600 
can't really think of anything else of
course<00:03:00.049> they<00:03:00.200> added<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.560> grand<00:03:00.830> exchange<00:03:01.040> but

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
course they added the grand exchange but

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.910 
course they added the grand exchange but
in<00:03:02.000> my<00:03:02.690> opinion<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.200> Greenwich<00:03:03.590> change<00:03:03.799> is

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
in my opinion the Greenwich change is

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.430 
in my opinion the Greenwich change is
actually<00:03:04.250> kind<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.459> cool<00:03:04.670> it<00:03:05.209> just<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.319> know

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
actually kind of cool it just you know

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.229 
actually kind of cool it just you know
would<00:03:06.739> be<00:03:06.769> better<00:03:07.160> if<00:03:07.340> we<00:03:07.549> didn't<00:03:08.090> have<00:03:08.209> a

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
would be better if we didn't have a

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.289 
would be better if we didn't have a
trade<00:03:08.480> limit<00:03:08.810> but<00:03:09.620> then<00:03:09.920> again<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.700> know<00:03:10.940> the

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
trade limit but then again you know the

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.740 
trade limit but then again you know the
G<00:03:11.900> if<00:03:12.560> you're<00:03:13.099> buying<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.519> hundred<00:03:13.880> thousand<00:03:14.390> of

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
G if you're buying a hundred thousand of

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.690 
G if you're buying a hundred thousand of
something<00:03:15.320> you<00:03:15.530> can<00:03:15.680> easily<00:03:15.829> just<00:03:16.280> click<00:03:16.670> it

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
something you can easily just click it

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.580 
something you can easily just click it
instead<00:03:17.359> of<00:03:17.420> sitting<00:03:17.870> there<00:03:18.049> like<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.290> dumb

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
instead of sitting there like a dumb

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.509 
instead of sitting there like a dumb
dumb<00:03:18.799> like<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.310> have<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.150> be<00:03:20.780> like<00:03:20.930> buying<00:03:21.519> this

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
dumb like I have and be like buying this

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.390 
dumb like I have and be like buying this
many<00:03:22.790> logs<00:03:23.570> buying<00:03:24.140> this<00:03:24.470> many<00:03:24.709> pure<00:03:25.010> essence

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
many logs buying this many pure essence

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.460 
many logs buying this many pure essence
but<00:03:25.970> anyways<00:03:26.209> really<00:03:26.540> what<00:03:26.660> I'm<00:03:26.780> saying<00:03:27.079> is

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
but anyways really what I'm saying is

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.380 
but anyways really what I'm saying is
this<00:03:27.620> video<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.130> more<00:03:28.400> or<00:03:28.489> less<00:03:28.549> like<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.940> memory

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
this video is more or less like a memory

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.380 
this video is more or less like a memory
lane<00:03:29.750> for<00:03:30.109> me<00:03:30.280> really<00:03:31.280> because<00:03:31.489> I<00:03:32.030> want<00:03:32.299> to

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
lane for me really because I want to

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.180 
lane for me really because I want to
make<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.630> video<00:03:32.870> basically<00:03:33.260> like<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.709> old<00:03:33.920> run

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
make a video basically like the old run

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.569 
make a video basically like the old run
scape<00:03:34.549> so<00:03:35.180> it's<00:03:35.810> like<00:03:35.900> you're<00:03:36.769> it's<00:03:37.160> hard<00:03:37.459> to

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
scape so it's like you're it's hard to

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.789 
scape so it's like you're it's hard to
explain<00:03:37.900> damn<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.049> but<00:03:39.350> it's<00:03:39.500> gonna<00:03:39.650> be

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
explain damn it but it's gonna be

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.190 
explain damn it but it's gonna be
basically<00:03:40.040> like<00:03:40.459> memory<00:03:41.150> lane<00:03:41.480> if<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.079> guys

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
basically like memory lane if you guys

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.860 
basically like memory lane if you guys
can<00:03:42.470> imagine<00:03:43.130> that<00:03:43.370> but<00:03:44.269> I'm<00:03:44.389> having<00:03:44.569> some

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
can imagine that but I'm having some

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.770 
can imagine that but I'm having some
problems<00:03:45.410> coming<00:03:45.799> up<00:03:46.010> with<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.340> old
