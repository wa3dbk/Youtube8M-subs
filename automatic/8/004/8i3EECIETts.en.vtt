00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hello everyone and in this video I invite 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:10.090
 cook you with me 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.960
 simple eggplant snack recipe 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.529
 for its preparation we will need 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.039
 bunch of greens cheese garlic 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.470
 take to taste we love very sharply 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.279
 so here I take the whole head 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.200
 garlic next tomatoes eggplant 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.730
 olive oil and salt pepper mayonnaise 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.649
 I'll cook in a slow cooker today 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.980
 but in the same way this dish is possible when 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.289
 the desire to cook and the oven and the first 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:48.160
 we need to cut the eggplant 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:50.789
 on such rings about a centimeter 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.789
 thick 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.680
 can be a little less 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.680
 so luggage well I already cut and now 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.900
 send it to the slow cooker for 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.210
 roasting 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.580
 for this at the bottom of the multicooker I pour 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.960
 small amount of olive oil 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:26.160
 it is olive oil unrefined 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:37.120
 extra virgin and then spread 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:41.730
 eggplants are fairly evenly on 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.730
 little eggplants with salt and salt 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:52.210
 sprinkle with pepper 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:54.370
 and now I will fry them their time 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.130
 while our eggplants are roasted we 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.590
 let's start preparing products first 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:06.090
 i'll skip all the garlic through 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:08.920
 garlic press in this way 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.980
 so I already skipped all the garlic 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.500
 garlic press 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:19.500
 the next step I will cut tomatoes 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.500
 rings 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.299
 This crop I already cut my fingers and 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:41.190
 now on the smallest terke I will 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:44.470
 rub cheese and so cheese I already rubbed and 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.220
 the next step I will cut the greens 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.670
 dill and so dill I already 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.890
 cut and now we will do this 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.579
 I shift half the cheese to 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.680
 garlic 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:03.340
 and also I shift half of the dill to 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.530
 garlic 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.530
 and so here we need to add 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.530

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.720

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.420
 you need to mix it all up well 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.060
