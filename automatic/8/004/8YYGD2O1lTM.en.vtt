00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello everyone my name is one and this is not 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.830
 You can see it now for all my 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.260
 name is a welcome or nothing more to 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.330
 my channel to our pop economy of the month 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.009
 April until I can not read so much 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.289
 as I expected to read by the end of 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.180
 accounts of three books and a novel 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.189
 graphical and therefore the truth I feel that has 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.779
 been constant for all the drinks that 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.820
 I had because my university has 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.279
 quarters then ends every four 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.099
 months already I ran out then yes it was 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.810
 pretty hard because I had three finals and 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.790
 the last project and they say it's like what 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.559
 worst in the world and that does kill me 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.649
 logically I do not go for two days in a row 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.840
 and then there is the story in my life 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.670
 it's more pure fantasy law is it so 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.160
 all those who are teaching them are 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.750
 fantasies then without more than telling them 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.730
 let's start with this video the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.129
 first book I read this month is rubber 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.199
 kuyt de jong moneys and this is a 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.360
 common screen I mentioned earlier 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.070
 this video follows the story of a 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.320
 presents that water to the honeycomb after 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.210
 that those kingdoms attacked by then another 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.949
 kingdom disc pas die and many of the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.170
 children of the nobles who orphaned and 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.670
 all very small are saved by one 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.920
 the when a little more 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.689
 let's say and spend ten years and between them 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.880
 they have raised in society in which they 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.770
 they have trained and they fight and they are all 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.530
 looking for a way to recover his kingdom 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.540
 back from the hands of bad rengo 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.460
 but of all that and watchman of the night 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.440
 in which he pretends to be nice or 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.080
 the black knife for another option 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.509
 Spanish, the secret disease that 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.549
 help people that is like batman type 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.229
 let's say that only night appears and 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.149
 this is all black then nobody knows 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.680
 but who sometimes be as 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.689
 Obviously there is a relationship between 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.460
 princess and the black night and things very 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.289
 well they happen to me personally 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.929
 he liked it very much and it's because I 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.060
 they like their fantasies as heavy 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.340
 as a type of hobbits or extra in the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.080
 rings again how do we continue to see and 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.909
 in fact posts I never read game of 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.130
 thrones because I tried to read it and this is 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.580
 as you know how they sometimes use 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.509
 very very words like I do not know deep and 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.580
 the world is like too heavy I do not know 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.140
 how to explain then the truth to me 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.819
 like our genes is that plantation 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.250
 we are the perfect light contraction 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.959
 that I caught at this time and then if 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.979
 after seeing me in wembley another 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.739
 fantasy 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.690
 16 john by marilyn carlson and this is 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.640
 also of a princess wanted to escape to 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.739
 their wedding because they did not want to marry 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.090
 a prince who did not know the fields 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.190
 socially that is also your best 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.379
 friend and between the two they arrive at a town 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.690
 and they start to live everything but it turns out that 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.000
 there is a prince and a murderer behind 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.430
 she and everyone obviously know each other 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.310
 and nothing I show you that this book better 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.590
 extremely surprised because something happens 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.170
 like a little more than half of the book 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.209
 maybe and I want simply because 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.459
 open can not be from friends as per 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.349
 three minutes when I read that part there's no 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.019
 to re-read the last chapter 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.239
 previous there you can simply 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.069
 explosive that happens is like enough 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.260
 obvious from the beginning or completely 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.900
 not obvious from the beginning and for me 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.660
 was completed proposed those never them 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.430
 can come and when I saw it it was after 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.560
 from that I took a little break from 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.450
 the novels and I read this graphic novel 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.670
 that is called out and lent it to me 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.950
 best friends and well if this is the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.140
 volume 4 of this series that really does not 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.370
 I'm very much like reading comics but I 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.659
 prey of this one and I liked it quite 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.790
 then keep having the volumes 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:24.209
 I 'm not going to sing music 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.060
 it's like a guy for weiss in the sense 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.040
 that in the world there are many planets and 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.019
 there is as you want between the planets and 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.189
 things like that and it's been very popular in the 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.230
 community got English then 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.970
 I decided to enter this when friends of 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.799
 pressure lend less and the last book 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.140
 What I read this month is where I was park 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.450
 the star gym us is the third book of the 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.680
 series of pieces of glass and I think not 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.329
 it's so standard yet 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.769
 probably as a product we hope 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.349
 that I bring my product because seriously 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.629
 is 20 I am very very very good and 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.849
 he occupied the fourth book already here percent 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.400
 the cover is already and is called was of 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.780
 shadows or the queen of shadows I hope 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.459
 what others want and why I like it 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.230
 quite like that and nothing after a thing 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.139
 that if you have read throne of 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.060
 crystal and you liked it so much that I can 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.760
 read in this book introduce us to a 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:17.250
 new character called robot and oh 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:21.410
 by god he 's 11 to celebrate this 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.410
 book and uruguay and selena 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.700
 so where we have read have to have it 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.460
 as all are already that I read this 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.560
 month but I started one that is called more no 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.540
 there are cases of being arrays and of this 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.860
 I will talk to you in my next group and 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.420
 I also want to mention some 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.220
 readings that I would like to be in topics 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.810
 that comes and then basically that has 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.580
 concluded series obviously in good 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.470
 term this book first and once 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.510
 I ended up probably finishing it 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.100
 tomorrow night and then after that 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.740
 I want to read in Alice's house 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.720
 blood type to finish and conclude 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.490
 very nice mind the precision series 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.320
 because if it 's all over it's been a while 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.880
 on land that I really like not 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.770
 we know they do not know because it's been a long time 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.930
 convention to this series but I love a 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.850
 crazy symptom and then for some reasons 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.650
 I have not been able to read the last two books 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.750
 and a friend of mine from the water is like a 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.490
 crazy about them because I only recommend 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.980
 this being about it and said to taste 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.050
 the delicious ones and he says it's over 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.000
 the series and I want you finished the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.590
 equipment but good and then to have 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.450
 flowers and I also want to see finish the 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.340
 series of employment time and it is the series that 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.080
 Vampires academy goes on and I'm missing 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.850
 also the last books that I do not 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.190
 I agree how they are going to this moment but 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.990
 I know that the fourth book I say the fifth 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:37.560
 book 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:39.810
 times months ago in addition to build 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.940
 that series would then be flying my 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.590
 two series in a single mentioned these 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.710
 they were all books that I mentioned to you today 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:53.550
 this time there are not many books but you can 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:56.330
 be useful and good not even the 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.330
 next chao 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.050
