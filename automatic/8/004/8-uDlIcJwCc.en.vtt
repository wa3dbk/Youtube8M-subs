00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello guys 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.750
 I know that not everyone is in the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.280
 path to be the master pokémon in this 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.900
 some people can still 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.170
 be wondering if it's worth it 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.820
 buy these new games and xy I'm with 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.070
 many hours today says practically 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.960
 everything the game can perceive certain to have 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.119
 able to capture that he passes the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.800
 legendary damn can not can not no 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.810
 can not can not can not 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.880
 this time it seems that nintendo decided 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.849
 actually investing in the series was not 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.059
 that story of simply making a 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.170
 new game and have we always have new ones 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.550
 new map eras street is all in graph 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.920
 was reformulated 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.050
 the story is very interesting very well 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.730
 animated moments 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.379
 more epic a production value 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.360
 totally new that we had never seen 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.070
 in the series including the online system that 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.020
 has been reformulated in a very 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.149
 It's great that this edition counts 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.550
 with the commitment of people who really 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.719
 they understood children because they did not need 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.960
 what they wanted and what the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.420
 problems that existed in that already well 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.100
 long series now in the sixth generation 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.710
 amount of changes that I think 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.630
 it would not even be as long as 12 was the generation 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.229
 who invented such things as daylight and 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.150
 in the evening 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.650
 among many other things like one 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.450
 Pokemon x and y 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.909
 certainly ignited the interest of 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.429
 many people including myself 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:27.579
 to point out that things here fuck 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:29.590
 10 the old safari zones with their 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.640
 mobile phone to the way they were 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.380
 horrible 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.840
 usually our beach is clean 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.590
 time a great pokémons more with balls 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.990
 limited 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.939
 the limited number of steps is all 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.189
 forcing the player to go multiple times 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.200
 it is to go after all 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.509
 points of interest and also of items 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.149
 in this generation it was super simplified 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.239
 every friend to register on pds has confirmed 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.610
 turned goals from a personal firewall 13 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:57.399
 Pokémon at most two and had no 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.439
 turned the game but normally they are 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.950
 good to be captured through 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:05.799
 battles with their pokémons and any 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.440
 normal balls any other is and 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.149
 like cherry on the cake of the pokémons think 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.720
 in a much greater chance of having 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:18.250
 governability love i hate pips 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.480
 certain Pokémon also suffered from this 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.430
 bad but not anymore 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.400
 now live low consumption videos 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:30.970
 four times giving rise to the following 8 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.769
 and in the mind as a child I really wanted 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.109
 see the pokémons with something more real 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.549
 the three all I had was the anime 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.290
 as the imagination itself 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.230
 after a while it emerged by a trail 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.790
 and kindled in our hearts the hope 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.849
 to see the pokémon game totally 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.280
 President came 13 years after the 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.599
 model are very good effects of the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.040
 ordinances are incredible 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.959
 removing problems from the front 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.700
 especially rely on the adoption 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.400
 Why did I become so happy? 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.750
 even with this number 7 memory is always 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.880
 interesting when developers 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.870
 this is to add a new type of 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.549
 pokémon fairy name is not very flashy 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.639
 not impress much and they put 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.859
 this category retroactively 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.819
 any pokémon that apparently is 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.430
 pink color 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.489
 so now old classics like 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.019
 prefers of the kind it makes sense but 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.510
 any waiting form is a category 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.700
 super effective with trading sessions and 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.110
 will certainly give new possibilities 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.910
 for whom competitive battle 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.950
 furthermore, there are modifications to 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.570
 let the game more balanced pokémons 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.990
 for example has more 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.820
 resistance four ghosts and cei 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.580
 people criticized the number of new 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.410
 pokémons this generation we had 68 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.780
 new and much less than the previous ones 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.540
 but I think keeping the number down 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.120
 they play quality not all of them 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.670
 have the capacity and potential to 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.459
 being in battles but the design some 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.290
 best moments of all with several 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.810
 in my favorites list and others already 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.709
 they gained popularity being half 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.000
 like this 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.310
 nintendo has a troubled history 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.810
 when it comes to online games and even 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.760
 said that people did not want to 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.709
 to play online in years ago 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.540
 after that they began applying for 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.010
 one more chicken other barriers of 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.870
 communication between people 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.970
 all on their own behalf 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.919
 safety of little children little children 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.540
 or no one disagrees that it is the mainz 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.380
 generation know if it works 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.330
 Wonderful 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.880
 he is fully employed someone play and 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.010
 It is very easy to change pokémon to vote for 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.450
 friends are online 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.900
 I was one of those who found the mega solutions 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.390
 When the internet comes up, it sucks. 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.040
 I thought it was going to be silly until 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.990
 mega solutions everywhere nobody 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.740
 normal pokémons without this 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.290
 capacity 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.550
 obviously not even when she 's so stupid 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.440
 after doing something like that 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.510
 is a well-balanced system where you 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.490
 can only use with a revolution by 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.680
 battle to increase the status of a 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.940
 pokémon is a very cool dynamic and the 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.650
 exclusive moment in battles 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.290
 mainly against human and design 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.780
 They'll be fine, this is not me. 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.910
 kind of person who becomes obsessive behind 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.550
 of the best cts to create a pokémon 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.620
 through the complex system of 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.810
 bridge and fortunately for me this 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.560
 generation has not made it much easier to 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.690
 this things 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.270
 using the super train or several 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.010
 cities that I was going to show you 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.990
 individual strengths also the Pokémon 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.970
 easy to achieve in an environment 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.260
 being made the knife was a beautiful step to 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.419
 front to leave the game more 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.040
 balanced for everyone 2 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.470
 this edition has a very good world 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.419
 the rhythm of the game I've seen in 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.430
 no need to stay there 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.169
 fighting here because our voucher 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.970
 to increase the lightness on my team and 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.030
 thus moving from a much more 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.770
 difficult for others 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.930
 everything flowed smoothly with challenges 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:43.910
 on the 10th or 11th I expected the story 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.500
 Pokemon you so interesting is not 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.000
 I'm going to give no spoilers and neither do I 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.400
 I want nobody to think I 'm in a 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.050
 super fantastic moment and will enter the 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.360
 video portal as one of the best 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.280
 none of this but for the series she was a 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.080
 beautiful step forward and adult tone because 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.760
 she even seems to look a bit off 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.040
 context but I enjoyed watching the series 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.810
 with a little older following the age 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.670
 The average player 's villain has one type 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.620
 well explained interesting that everything 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.270
 takes explosive moments that last until 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.680
 slightly more than half after 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.880
 you are freer to 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.880
 simply being the master pokémon 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.070
 defeat the other videos of nothing 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.740
 so this is where very personal 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.870
 Thank you for seeing if you enjoy it. 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.910
 a like with your own on the channel 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.980
 I'm just starting, I'll try. 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.780
 have yet to improve 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.280
 videos and making quality content 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.280
 to everyone thank you very much
