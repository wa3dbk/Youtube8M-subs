00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.699
 and cycling them is a special cycling experience that does not like it 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.329
 landscape and working environment a good distance away 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:23.169
 reserving a good bike pays a lot of attention to its pulling equipment and 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.519
 in addition, already think a lot of other things 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.129
 for a cycling holiday a thorough preparation discussion is no 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.979
 cycling holidays and camping often go hand in hand 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.840
 provide a light and compact camping equipment 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.540
 no more sure adapted tent sleeping bag and sleeping mat 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.080
 beh 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.710
 choose a bicycle bag according to the budget a destination 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.730
 yes 80 bags for bags and sends cash registers 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.270
 similarly certainly for repair material 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.640
 with a good muti you can already do a lot of repairs 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.650
 look further at a bicycle pump 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.200
 recovery kit bandages there are many boats the brake pads a bottle of oil and 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200
 there are the inner tube and some are mentioned 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.110
 it is useful to gain some technical knowledge before and during the basics 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.110
 practice repairs on the bike 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.870
 especially use functional clothing that dries quickly with a comfortable fit 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.020
 a good bike pulled a sweater of socks 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.950
 shoes with which you can walk and cycling and of course good breathability 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.860
 waterproof raincoat beh 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.270
 A comfortable bicycle tunnel protects your eyes and with the use of dark lenses 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.230
 which also armed against the sun 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.550
 gloves and bowls also always come in handy 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.320
 a smart bike rack is always a helmet 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.890
 it is the warm conditions for a helmet with good air circulation 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.190
 I think it also contributes to the navigation system 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.860
 the gps searched that you had to stop less to study the map and 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.540
 Moreover, your route at home behind the computer can be completely prepared and 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.970
 computer programming 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.189
 This GPS can be mounted on a handy I need first 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.369
 a couple of course a cyclist is often dependent on himself 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.109
 thanks to these tips you can safely travel a lot of miles
