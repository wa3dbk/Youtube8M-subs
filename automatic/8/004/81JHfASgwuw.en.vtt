 perfect i woke up with us the pros and cons of chrome what to say about 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.270
 this game 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.830
 of course we can't but don't say that it has an amazing graphic 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.350
 especially for pc because they have 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.150
 the pc supports directx 11 which are only supported by emotion 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.820
 sign up and win the generation 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.780

 and adds it's a roma graphic 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.229
 sisi nocerina tram atmosphere 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.030
 guys that is really gorgeous with light effects you've ever seen together 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.670
 are other games 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.810
 the plot is really wonderful to have a novel written by 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.049
 anyway, I don't remember a Russian writer or anything like that 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.999
 however a novel then 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.029
 very beautifull % 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:15.269
 the as it is the plot is the atmosphere itself just dead houses star juve transfer 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:21.340
 hotel arlas mosfera sometimes really nightmare because we will meet again in 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.179
 20 truly mortgage places to isolate even and disgusting events 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:31.459
 with companion cydia mutant monsters and so on 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.569
 so it was sometimes at times really thrilling game 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.899
 then we start with where against 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.499
 we can say meeting are really very few simone 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.990
 a boh interfree was slightly 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.759
 neglected although perfect enough for me 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:53.769
 artificial intelligence like more or less all other sin games 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.119
 he could do a little better 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.539
 another defect or that I have read in many forums 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:04.719
 sisi also for human means are immortal but honestly I do not have them 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:10.089
 found everything I'm great in immortality type for a few shots on TV starts 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.979
 mass also because the enemies are really armored so 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.959
 and nothing perfect we pass now 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.139
 to what to history 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.190
 the story is about a boy who has a sofa in the elements 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.380
 troppolitani because - intel to the earth was destroyed 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:40.589

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:46.319
 smileys are living more hearts in the city because there is too much radiation 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.219
 there 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.129
