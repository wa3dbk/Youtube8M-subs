be able to deliver for his business in
years<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.269> come<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.990> know<00:00:28.140> whites<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.919> use<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:29.339 
years to come you know whites we use a

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.099 
years to come you know whites we use a
lot<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.579> what<00:00:29.759> by<00:00:29.939> RAM<00:00:30.359> labs<00:00:30.659> because<00:00:30.960> we

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
lot of what by RAM labs because we

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.390 
lot of what by RAM labs because we
always<00:00:31.199> try<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.499> find<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.859> next<00:00:31.919> best<00:00:32.250> thing

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
always try to find the next best thing

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.670 
always try to find the next best thing
so<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:32.940> would<00:00:33.300> use<00:00:33.329> about<00:00:33.840> twelve<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.320> fourteen

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
so we would use about twelve to fourteen

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.920 
so we would use about twelve to fourteen
round<00:00:34.950> lands<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.370> genomic<00:00:36.090> test<00:00:36.329> all<00:00:36.510> them<00:00:36.720> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
round lands we genomic test all them and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.970 
round lands we genomic test all them and
we've<00:00:37.740> been<00:00:37.950> doing<00:00:38.100> our<00:00:38.370> merino<00:00:38.850> size<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.420> well

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
we've been doing our merino size as well

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.760 
we've been doing our merino size as well
in<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.400> the<00:00:41.520> whites<00:00:42.110> we<00:00:43.110> look<00:00:43.290> at<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> eating

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
in in the whites we look at the eating

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.650 
in in the whites we look at the eating
quality<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.400> if<00:00:44.490> we<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:44.820> there's<00:00:45.150> one<00:00:45.390> there

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
quality so if we know there's one there

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.390 
quality so if we know there's one there
that's<00:00:45.930> not<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.560> hasn't<00:00:46.740> got<00:00:46.950> good<00:00:47.160> shear

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
that's not it hasn't got good shear

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.670 
that's not it hasn't got good shear
force<00:00:47.730> or<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.210> some<00:00:48.390> artifact<00:00:48.990> we<00:00:49.170> most

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
force or in some artifact we most

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.350 
force or in some artifact we most
probably<00:00:50.010> won't<00:00:50.250> go<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.490> and<00:00:50.730> use<00:00:50.880> that<00:00:51.060> ground

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
probably won't go on and use that ground

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.710 
probably won't go on and use that ground
lamb<00:00:51.740> we<00:00:52.740> also<00:00:52.890> use<00:00:53.310> that<00:00:53.610> because<00:00:54.150> we<00:00:54.510> use

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
lamb we also use that because we use

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.320 
lamb we also use that because we use
round<00:00:54.990> lambs<00:00:55.290> and<00:00:55.560> we<00:00:56.040> only<00:00:56.190> keep<00:00:56.490> a<00:00:56.730> couple<00:00:57.120> of

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
round lambs and we only keep a couple of

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.720 
round lambs and we only keep a couple of
older<00:00:57.690> Rams<00:00:57.900> from<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.590> group<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.490> next

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609 
program was the natural next step we're

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:26.480 
program was the natural next step we're

confidence<00:01:50.039> if<00:01:50.429> we<00:01:50.579> use<00:01:50.789> a<00:01:50.819> pole<00:01:51.149> ram<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:51.659> can

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
confidence if we use a pole ram we can

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
confidence if we use a pole ram we can
ask<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.109> that<00:01:52.319> genomic<00:01:52.770> test<00:01:53.009> now<00:01:53.219> and<00:01:53.249> if

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
ask for that genomic test now and if

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.190 
ask for that genomic test now and if
he's<00:01:53.880> got<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> double<00:01:54.389> pole<00:01:54.780> because<00:01:55.020> we've

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
he's got the double pole because we've

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.779 
he's got the double pole because we've
got<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> lot<00:01:55.499> of<00:01:55.560> horn<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:55.979> our<00:01:56.100> flock<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.639> is

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
got a lot of horn in our flock as it is

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.730 
got a lot of horn in our flock as it is
because<00:01:56.999> when<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.270> started<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:57.899> used<00:01:58.170> other

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
because when we started we used other

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.199 
because when we started we used other
poles<00:01:58.950> or<00:01:59.189> horns<00:01:59.459> we<00:01:59.579> didn't<00:01:59.789> really<00:01:59.939> care<00:02:00.179> now

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
poles or horns we didn't really care now

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.629 
poles or horns we didn't really care now
we've<00:02:00.569> made<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.779> decision<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:02.039> need<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.490> go

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:02.639 
we've made a decision that we need to go

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:05.779 
we've made a decision that we need to go
to<00:02:02.700> poles<00:02:03.029> for<00:02:03.479> um<00:02:03.689> crazy<00:02:04.590> care<00:02:04.950> really<00:02:05.159> mr.
