logo Halloween it's the same thing just

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.719 
logo Halloween it's the same thing just

the new Knick logo or they new like
design<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:47.150> can't<00:03:47.479> describe<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:48.639> there's<00:03:49.639> a

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
design I can't describe it there's a

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.879 
design I can't describe it there's a
Paramount<00:03:50.209> desk<00:03:50.620> everything<00:03:51.620> it's<00:03:51.829> just

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
Paramount desk everything it's just

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.770 
Paramount desk everything it's just
dated<00:03:52.370> 2004<00:03:53.030> with<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.239> new<00:03:53.389> neck<00:03:53.599> logo<00:03:53.959> so

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
dated 2004 with a new neck logo so

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.929 
dated 2004 with a new neck logo so
that's<00:03:56.780> pretty<00:03:57.109> much<00:03:57.349> that<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:57.919> I<00:03:58.280> would<00:03:58.819> like

00:03:58.929 --> 00:03:58.939 
that's pretty much that and I would like

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.759 
that's pretty much that and I would like
to<00:03:59.049> thing<00:04:00.049> is<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:00.530> turkey<00:04:00.979> mistletoe<00:04:01.459> it's

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
to thing is that turkey mistletoe it's

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.729 
to thing is that turkey mistletoe it's
reminiscent<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:04.009> the<00:04:04.129> cover

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
reminiscent of the cover

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.640 
reminiscent of the cover
so<00:04:06.739> I'd<00:04:07.099> say<00:04:07.459> possibly<00:04:08.419> Halloween's<00:04:09.169> a<00:04:09.319> little

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
so I'd say possibly Halloween's a little

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.439 
so I'd say possibly Halloween's a little
more<00:04:09.769> popular<00:04:09.979> disc<00:04:10.519> because<00:04:11.060> it's<00:04:11.239> been

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:11.449 
more popular disc because it's been

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.349 
more popular disc because it's been
reissued<00:04:11.780> or<00:04:12.430> Paramount<00:04:13.430> just<00:04:13.729> hasn't<00:04:13.939> made<00:04:14.299> a

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
reissued or Paramount just hasn't made a

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.830 
reissued or Paramount just hasn't made a
DVD<00:04:14.599> of<00:04:14.959> that<00:04:15.019> yet<00:04:15.459> so<00:04:16.459> that's<00:04:17.449> pretty<00:04:17.750> much
