00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
came out shows that mobile usage on the

t-mobile due to net neutrality concerns

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.130 
t-mobile due to net neutrality concerns
but<00:02:33.400> frankly<00:02:33.790> this<00:02:33.940> is<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.150> promotion<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:34.960> not

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
but frankly this is a promotion and not

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.810 
but frankly this is a promotion and not
a<00:02:35.170> permanent<00:02:35.500> thing<00:02:35.740> so<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.310> think<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.640> lot<00:02:36.670> of

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
a permanent thing so I think a lot of

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.670 
a permanent thing so I think a lot of
those<00:02:37.000> arguments<00:02:37.330> are<00:02:37.600> unfounded<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.320> does

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
those arguments are unfounded it does

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.650 
those arguments are unfounded it does
suck<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:38.980> all<00:02:39.250> access<00:02:39.670> isn't<00:02:39.850> there<00:02:40.240> yet<00:02:40.450> but

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
suck that all access isn't there yet but

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.390 
suck that all access isn't there yet but
it<00:02:40.780> will<00:02:40.810> likely<00:02:41.140> be<00:02:41.290> added<00:02:41.710> sooner<00:02:42.010> or<00:02:42.190> later

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
it will likely be added sooner or later

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.370 
it will likely be added sooner or later
so<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.790> think<00:02:42.880> we<00:02:43.210> must<00:02:43.360> exercise<00:02:43.870> patience

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
so I think we must exercise patience

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.190 
so I think we must exercise patience
rather<00:02:44.709> than<00:02:44.950> lashing<00:02:45.340> out<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.780> who<00:02:46.900> wants<00:02:47.050> to

rather than lashing out so who wants to

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.140 
rather than lashing out so who wants to
