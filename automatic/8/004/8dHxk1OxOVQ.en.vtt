 we want a heartfelt good scar because of its beautiful sunny 

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:06.890
 belong to Hamburg 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.910
 Colleague Violet I just dropped it on the grass on the lawn 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.559
 Lawn where just that the game took place between the Hamburg 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.690
 Blue Devils and the Dresden Monarchs is 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.409
 12 7 went out for Hamburg and 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:20.839
 yes you can say that is about "This result actually plays the 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.339
 clear dominance of Hamburg with the WAZ against the dreary again 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.529
 especially the offense of the citizen list place still partially 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.999
 Considerable has perhaps a bit missed a warm spot 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.770
 Making points to me now would be his passing away 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.610
 So definitely in the first half quite clear dominance of the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.260
 Guard of an offensive side says Zahner 20 year to 50 or so 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.019
 just 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.309
 096 points why the samples examine the same problem of the device 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.600
 Eventually we know how to play when we arrived until 1910 in 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.840
 Weinheim continues 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.180
 the gameplay appreciated accordingly 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.510
 It runs like a thread through the season 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.800
 It is not clear enough how much better on it and has even again 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.550
 improved 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.110
 and today we have three things to play a role accordingly 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.950
 Super performance 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.450
 thereby arise 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.090
 in moving because he but forget them when we think that's a pity 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.150
 more than 2 percent of the most part many deep in the Sonata was the only one 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.830
 something on the 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.550
 To find Cobos was the yield the offer in today, while frighteningly weak 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.870
 and that was not just because that percent listed as the processor 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.390
 Way in the field stood 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.010
 that's like at every trade fair »said Faltermeier Rooms for real runs 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.049
 through the holding and via Lucas Wetzel 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.229
 Thal abound hamm-center Radio Shack then start to third quarter 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.009
 nor the ball of color was carried back to the incarceration 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.960
 in between 1280 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.149
 for this month if she has any points or 4 she brings 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.820
 but still done 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.350
 so this is worth seeing pass 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.680
 from Marbach though 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.800
 Markus Bowe another 61 year to reach the end zone 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.170
 could run, however 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.060
 It was by no means intoxicating 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.100
 the address has the dancing joy quite properly set up a phantom 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.390
 as well as managed to stop the hamburgers at 1 as there is certainly a lot left 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.149
 Potential in it but what the hamburgers did not do today 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.950
 Errors in form «I think that is remarkable, too 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.950
 play why others have actually held the balls the burgers 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:16.009
 Coach Schellinger Oppenheim he so that percent 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:19.780
 It was quite a risk which game there was little improvement 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.699
 by the Hamburger so much more spend almost percent 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.980
 as the biggest player believes 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.559
 that it somehow also that's always been full 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.579
 the parcour the way i have to stop a game with his aim at him a picture 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.509
 the problem was that walls or took that were also at ISI 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:38.239
 Percent in case injured Julian Spurs hurt z never plays 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.849
 with the same goals together 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.849
 Edward Whitacre has changed more today, says Ulrich Sieber and that 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.709
 of course it's hard for Jews to sit in the single game and so on and so forth 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:46.120
 on 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.870
 and since already this feeling has gone more on safety 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.839
 moved the ball 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:53.369
 what the current breather has been orphaned right now 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:54.589
 So early in the season 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.939
 and also that they each have their breathers but because moves 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.849
 in which her father and two jerseys sunk 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.720
 has not been around forever and that has been enough is the question of whether 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.980
 For the whole season, Manz was sometimes bitter 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.689
 paid that she runs offensively 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.900
 we captured 2 interviews after the game so mean 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.729
 but Markus Thoma asked the only process straps for the rotary Marx like 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:18.290
 because so 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.450
 his feeling during the cold start was run so Markus Beumer in the interview 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.669
 there were 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.929
 and of course we have already fatal asked for how he takes that 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:33.289
 overall game appraises 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:36.289
 So here the statements of Dresen time slipped 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.449
 the deception maneuver 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.169
 and we just can not close the bag the hands on lead up 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.409
 to the end of the slogan last doubt 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.069
 we want to play over the last three 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.329
 now took on 2 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.349
 Eyewitnesses out of business and all players unfortunately lost 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.480
 for that it should demand too much has already struck very badly 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:01.589
 it was more in it 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:04.079
 that was balm are very annoying and on 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.079
 Game played well played in Hama 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.729
 Hamburg for no police of a 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.909
 and there and few opportunities go 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.909
 to score and of course as a sponsor on a defense 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.759
 You can not be dissatisfied if you are doubtful 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.759
 but we know 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.720
 this is ins 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.240
 weakened to what extent it is extremely in demand 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.990
 new staff to become predictable 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.680
 the huge fireworks I was at the start 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.439
 but who would have become predictable? 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.340
 employ young people 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.629
 do not know everything 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:40.789
 Gescher who is still unsure game 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.789
 that the penalty system 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.710
 standing on the other side 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.710
 Surely, the loss of Böhm was her handicap 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.680
 and we have to get into the artwork 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.539
 Outlook for the next game to be expected 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:04.879
 Answer followed 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.729
 Carter Fight 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.729
 certainly not all facts 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.789
 Percent as well as bottlenecks 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.129
 He should be the Öbb 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.789
 To see comments from the show on the previous day 12 like this for Hamburg with 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:19.610
 that she with it 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.370
 in the table at Andreasen Morax passed under many 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.300
 next week a very heavy opponent Wollert 15 o'clock Sinner Braunschweig 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.110
 Lions guest because what's in it 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.499
 yes what if he asks himself a few minutes he goes off and Brunswick 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.729
 i seldom have such a prescribed look the more the tree has fallen down 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.849
 I think if they lose tonight in the match then it is 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:42.930
 but one 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.370
 Whilst the percentage of value completely overlooked is about us can choose 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.669
 because I believe they can be lent when they are far from Stephen King Kiel 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.529
 then I will not see anything because it was for the man but he does not see yet 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:54.419
 give 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.360
 just by soot deposits 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.650
 and then of course the injured ones and so on 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.080
 You really have to work everything that means it has to be that way 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.619
 disciplined as today hardly penalties no turnovers 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:07.379
 and really 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.529
 the track to Stuhr on schedule does not stand still 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.789
 and then just hope that the Braunschweiger nerves when they show 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.650
 If they keep coming for 60 years, they would come today 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.690
 and then there is a real chance they lose everything we have to do this 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.610
 was next round on 7 to 7 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.219
 a downer he remains today to a serious injury of a 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.360
 Hamburg player may transfer 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.680
 Because the whole of Wolfsburg's current state of affairs, they tell us 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.650
 was rumored 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.030
 the same space of crisis so processes they have now for the shots 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.669
 stood at 6:30 pm Saturday night 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.159
 Percent of the players were transported out of the live broadcast because of the 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:46.210
 Ambulance start the platform 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.660
 apparently it seems he is then the player again 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.340
 Percent has become unconscious you can only that so that I have followed 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.340
 that he stayed very long and then he became with percentages 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.249
 with trembling before both Faymann and so here on average with 1 it is not 

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:04.779
 drove off middle with siren and so on that means it sounds like 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:07.189
 Melide he after being an interpreter 

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:10.889
 here the wildest rumors make the rounds we guess so we have to 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.999
 severe concussion and just hope it's nothing worse 

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:17.949
 but if a man is an ambulance as well as 2 daring 20 minutes one can 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.199
 it is never really a good sign 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:23.870
 So get well sooner son to his at number 8 ahead of the post office 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.430
 Florian Florian Voss 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.680
 from our building the RomCom soon back on its feet yes as said the 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.410
 Pilgrims the next week Saturday against the Braunschweig Lions in parallel 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.289
 Speedy Dress Morax coming Saturday 15h 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:38.860
 in Heinz Field at home Heinz Field against the Cologne Falcons and that's the case 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.880
 a little endgame 

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.390
 against the relegation the game for game two I say though consciously 

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.939
 Kellerkinder against each other that's surprising how the whole thing goes out 

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:50.089
 hopefully it will take a long time to get home safely and happily 

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:53.429
 Have fun because Brüderles Nistelrooy against Braunschweig and I hope you 

00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:56.259
 So be it the construction of a gate to the contrary that is either 

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:59.439
 Live in the stadium or bar Radio Monarch makes flood victims good time 

00:07:59.439 --> 00:07:59.759
 is
