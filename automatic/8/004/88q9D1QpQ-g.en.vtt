 delivery delivery to the male he goes 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.039
 you can notice that this good exit is a 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.410
 of the care with you comes out is the maintenance 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.740
 of its aesthetics 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.840
 so are the trees normally 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.019
 they grow a lot, that's it. 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.870
 normal scissors from January 14th is 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.520
 scissors can be even well stuck 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.590
 needs to be can be a common scissors 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.270
 benefited in that way 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.590
 so most aces like 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.360
 was talking about the pines for example 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.260
 if they can in any other way depends on a 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.829
 well, thank you 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.780
 depends on each species of bonsai as 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.690
 you can but the vast majority sprout 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.219
 a lot and if you can not stay that way 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.590
 Size is only bland 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.690
 the engineer if you can not arrive at 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.879
 Christmas already has a problem playing 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.910
 So it 's crazy so it has to be 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.530
 constantly pruning and watering because 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.930
 The vase is very tiny in the game. 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.700
 then the earth dries very fast then 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.979
 so what do we see from training 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.540
 with patience with related to good sai 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.070
 a truth you can not take a bore 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.960
 with him are you going to travel and leave the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.210
 console without water knows it dies 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.729
 in the summer he dies in the winter not 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.390
 holds up well because the water evaporates 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.990
 You've both understood the problem is so tasty. 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.790
 from the vase all the brother who is then the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.829
 People have to let this good one go always 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.170
 Softly make some dirt here. 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.040
 then appear a bonsai even more is the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.729

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.140
 bubble in which it is the size of a 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.350
