00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
very happy of

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.780 
very happy of
what<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.580> did<00:02:14.760> today<00:02:15.950> we<00:02:16.950> understand<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.550> is

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
what we did today we understand that is

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.059 
what we did today we understand that is
the<00:02:18.000> much<00:02:18.180> more<00:02:18.450> serious<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:19.440> since

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
the much more serious that we have since

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.300 
the much more serious that we have since
we<00:02:20.190> start<00:02:20.459> than<00:02:20.849> others<00:02:20.940> we<00:02:21.450> have<00:02:22.130> we<00:02:23.130> give

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
we start than others we have we give

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.900 
we start than others we have we give
time<00:02:23.660> some<00:02:24.660> players<00:02:24.870> come<00:02:25.110> late<00:02:25.260> some<00:02:25.980> players

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.210 

we<00:02:29.910> don't<00:02:30.450> training<00:02:30.900> some<00:02:31.319> days<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.830> but<00:02:32.069> we

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
we don't training some days and but we

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.949 
we don't training some days and but we
must<00:02:32.430> push<00:02:32.610> them<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.300> give<00:02:33.450> more<00:02:33.690> time<00:02:33.900> to

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
must push them to to give more time to

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.620 
must push them to to give more time to
play<00:02:34.319> so<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.520> balance<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.150> time<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.450> play

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
play so the balance of the time to play

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.990 
play so the balance of the time to play
is<00:02:36.690> not<00:02:37.020> not<00:02:37.350> good<00:02:37.560> at<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.280> moment<00:02:38.459> but<00:02:38.850> in

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
is not not good at this moment but in

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.910 
is not not good at this moment but in
this<00:02:39.090> game<00:02:39.680> we<00:02:41.360> we<00:02:42.360> prepare<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.050> this<00:02:43.709> much

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
this game we we prepare this this much

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.250 
this game we we prepare this this much
more<00:02:44.459> serious<00:02:44.910> more<00:02:45.480> like<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.780> competition

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
more serious more like a competition

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.220 
more serious more like a competition
because<00:02:47.130> we<00:02:47.430> must<00:02:47.610> felt<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.390> competition<00:02:48.989> in

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
because we must felt the competition in

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.509 
because we must felt the competition in
our<00:02:49.350> players<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:51.980> original<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.069> can<00:02:53.220> say<00:02:53.370> that

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
our players and original I can say that

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.460 
our players and original I can say that
we<00:02:53.670> are<00:02:53.760> ready<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.060> ready<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.140> start<00:02:55.350> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470
