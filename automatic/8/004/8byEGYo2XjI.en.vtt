magnificent<00:00:13.259> harddrive<00:00:14.389> the<00:00:15.389> SES<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:17.119> ate

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
magnificent harddrive the SES you ate

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.290 
magnificent harddrive the SES you ate
bits<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.720> 0<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.410> 1<00:00:21.439> solid<00:00:22.439> storage<00:00:23.039> unit<00:00:23.460> so

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
bits of 0 and 1 solid storage unit so

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.810 
bits of 0 and 1 solid storage unit so
this<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.689> basically<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:26.689> hard<00:00:27.689> drive<00:00:28.580> it<00:00:29.580> can

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
this is basically a hard drive it can

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.780 
this is basically a hard drive it can
store<00:00:31.040> zeros<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:36.469> so<00:00:37.469> let's<00:00:38.399> see<00:00:38.640> what

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
store zeros and one so let's see what

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.299 
store zeros and one so let's see what
this<00:00:38.969> bad<00:00:39.239> boy<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.719> do<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:41.700> let's<00:00:42.920> so<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.100> are

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
this bad boy can do so let's so we are

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.979 
this bad boy can do so let's so we are
now<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.520> currently<00:00:45.239> storage<00:00:46.050> unit<00:00:46.379> b<00:00:47.059> of<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
now on currently storage unit b of the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.830 
now on currently storage unit b of the
SSU<00:00:51.710> this<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.789> display<00:00:54.890> it<00:00:55.890> shows<00:00:56.190> whether

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
SSU this is the display it shows whether

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.130 
SSU this is the display it shows whether
the<00:00:58.489> units<00:00:59.489> are<00:00:59.730> on<00:01:00.390> or<00:01:00.899> off<00:01:01.079> 0<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:02.219> 1<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:03.930> can

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the units are on or off 0 or 1 you can

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:12.050 
the units are on or off 0 or 1 you can
see<00:01:04.290> two<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.830> three<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.780> on<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.900> let's<00:01:11.060> so

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
see two and three is on so let's so

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.870 
see two and three is on so let's so
these<00:01:12.299> are<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:13.850> section<00:01:14.930> levers<00:01:16.729> click<00:01:17.729> on

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
these are the section levers click on

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.440 
these are the section levers click on
lever<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:19.549> flick<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:21.650> that<00:01:22.650> will<00:01:23.610> change<00:01:23.939> one

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
lever a flick one that will change one

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.120 
lever a flick one that will change one
if<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:26.549> desire<00:01:27.080> let's<00:01:28.080> press<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.770> button

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
if I so desire let's press the button

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.179 
if I so desire let's press the button
once<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:33.320> unit<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:34.350> changes

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
once and you see one unit one changes

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.490 
once and you see one unit one changes
its<00:01:36.320> value<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.590> 1<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.630> change<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.049> back<00:01:40.290> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
its value to 1 you can change it back to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.910 
its value to 1 you can change it back to
zero<00:01:43.280> let's<00:01:44.280> leave<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.850> this

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.800 

over<00:01:48.920> here<00:01:49.100> we<00:01:49.400> can<00:01:49.580> change<00:01:49.880> which<00:01:50.270> storage

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
over here we can change which storage

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.150 
over here we can change which storage
unit<00:01:52.000> which<00:01:53.000> file<00:01:53.620> we<00:01:54.620> would<00:01:54.830> like<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.070> access

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
unit which file we would like to access

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.940 
unit which file we would like to access
and<00:01:58.160> each<00:01:58.490> file<00:01:58.880> has<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.210> different<00:02:02.560> can<00:02:03.560> hold

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
and each file has a different can hold

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.320 
and each file has a different can hold
different<00:02:06.430> outputs<00:02:07.430> or<00:02:07.690> zeros<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.899> one<00:02:10.000> so<00:02:11.000> in

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
different outputs or zeros and one so in

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.190 
different outputs or zeros and one so in
a<00:02:12.430> storage<00:02:13.430> unit<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:14.090> we<00:02:14.780> have<00:02:15.170> for<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:18.020> is

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
a storage unit a we have for that is

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.260 
a storage unit a we have for that is
outputting<00:02:18.740> one<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.280> one<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.240> is

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
outputting one and one that is

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.530 
outputting one and one that is
outputting<00:02:20.930> one<00:02:21.310> number<00:02:22.310> one<00:02:22.520> is<00:02:23.000> outputting

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
outputting one number one is outputting

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.520 
outputting one number one is outputting
one<00:02:24.610> we<00:02:25.610> can<00:02:25.880> flick<00:02:26.270> two<00:02:26.960> levers<00:02:27.350> levels<00:02:29.530> which

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
one we can flick two levers levels which

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.810 
one we can flick two levers levels which
means<00:02:30.830> we<00:02:31.070> are<00:02:31.130> opening<00:02:31.700> two<00:02:32.510> sections

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
means we are opening two sections

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.370 
means we are opening two sections
opening<00:02:34.820> section<00:02:35.060> 3<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.660> 2<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.760> we<00:02:37.760> can

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
opening section 3 and 2 and we can

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:46.450 
opening section 3 and 2 and we can
change<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.710> value<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:44.950> they<00:02:45.950> will<00:02:46.190> all

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
change the value and they will all

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.430 
change the value and they will all
remember<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:48.640> store<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.820> data<00:02:51.880> so<00:02:52.880> in

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
remember and store the data so in

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.820 
remember and store the data so in
storage<00:02:54.440> unit<00:02:55.250> B<00:02:55.520> it<00:02:56.510> has<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.870> same<00:02:57.080> data<00:02:57.410> as

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
storage unit B it has the same data as

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:05.530 
storage unit B it has the same data as
before<00:03:02.140> so<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:03.470> is<00:03:03.880> this<00:03:04.880> is<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.060> hard<00:03:05.330> drive

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
before so this is this is a hard drive

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.990 
before so this is this is a hard drive
so<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.320> doesn't<00:03:06.650> do<00:03:06.830> much<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.070> on<00:03:07.489> its<00:03:07.790> own

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
so it doesn't do much just on its own

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.300 
so it doesn't do much just on its own
and<00:03:08.890> right<00:03:09.890> now<00:03:10.100> it's<00:03:10.310> just<00:03:10.489> for<00:03:10.730> show<00:03:10.760> off<00:03:11.150> but

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
and right now it's just for show off but

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.890 
and right now it's just for show off but
it<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:14.390> was<00:03:14.630> serve<00:03:15.019> a<00:03:15.200> greater<00:03:15.530> purpose<00:03:16.570> in<00:03:17.570> the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
it it was serve a greater purpose in the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.970 
it it was serve a greater purpose in the
near<00:03:18.140> future<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:19.190> hope<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:20.510> let's<00:03:21.260> take<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.590> look

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
near future I hope so let's take a look

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.190 
near future I hope so let's take a look
at<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.340> redstone<00:03:22.820> airy<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:26.480> these<00:03:26.780> are<00:03:27.140> the

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
at the redstone airy so these are the

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.400 
at the redstone airy so these are the
two<00:03:28.180> storage<00:03:29.180> units<00:03:29.660> it's<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.459> be

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.640 

and<00:03:34.500> these<00:03:35.460> are<00:03:36.300> essentially<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.080> RS<00:03:37.380> nor

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
and these are essentially the RS nor

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.530 
and these are essentially the RS nor
latch<00:03:37.710> is<00:03:38.360> stacked<00:03:39.360> upon<00:03:39.510> each<00:03:39.930> other<00:03:41.540> which

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
latch is stacked upon each other which

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.640 
latch is stacked upon each other which
the<00:03:43.110> output<00:03:43.290> goes<00:03:43.800> over<00:03:44.250> here<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:45.320> follow<00:03:46.320> the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
the output goes over here and follow the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.320 
the output goes over here and follow the
line<00:03:46.830> here<00:03:48.830> these<00:03:49.830> are<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.370> inputs<00:03:50.520> of<00:03:50.940> the

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
line here these are the inputs of the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:58.970 
line here these are the inputs of the
user<00:03:52.640> it's<00:03:53.640> 0<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.750> 1<00:03:57.140> which<00:03:58.140> will<00:03:58.380> change<00:03:58.650> the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
user it's 0 and 1 which will change the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.840 
user it's 0 and 1 which will change the
output<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:03.030> for<00:04:03.510> every<00:04:04.850> RS

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.360 
output and that is for every RS
knowledge<00:04:07.010> these<00:04:08.010> are<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.370> section<00:04:09.290> sections

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
knowledge these are the section sections

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.580 
knowledge these are the section sections
so<00:04:11.370> when<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:11.820> open<00:04:11.850> an<00:04:12.210> section<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.960> piston

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
so when you open an section the piston

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.560 
so when you open an section the piston
goes<00:04:14.160> out<00:04:14.490> on<00:04:14.850> either<00:04:15.330> side<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:17.360> allows

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.240 

signals<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.870> go<00:04:22.049> through<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:24.920> make<00:04:25.920> the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
signals to go through and make the

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.660 
signals to go through and make the
output<00:04:26.640> change<00:04:29.660> that's<00:04:30.660> why<00:04:30.990> it's<00:04:31.920> very<00:04:32.310> nice

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
output change that's why it's very nice

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.460 
output change that's why it's very nice
to<00:04:32.940> have<00:04:33.150> sections<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:35.090> sections<00:04:36.090> are<00:04:37.020> open

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
to have sections and sections are open

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.460 
to have sections and sections are open
on<00:04:37.620> both<00:04:38.010> sides<00:04:38.460> on<00:04:38.820> both<00:04:39.090> storage<00:04:39.840> unit<00:04:40.200> if

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
on both sides on both storage unit if

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.880 
on both sides on both storage unit if
you<00:04:40.590> open<00:04:40.710> one<00:04:41.840> if<00:04:42.840> you<00:04:42.990> open<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.500> open<00:04:43.620> on

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
you open one if you open the open on

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.330 
you open one if you open the open on
both<00:04:44.160> but<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.900> signal<00:04:46.290> will<00:04:46.440> not<00:04:46.680> come<00:04:46.980> will

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
both but the signal will not come will

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.810 
both but the signal will not come will
only<00:04:47.520> come<00:04:47.850> true<00:04:48.090> too<00:04:48.450> true<00:04:49.230> to<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.340> one<00:04:50.520> you

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
only come true too true to the one you

00:04:50.820 --> 00:05:00.689 
only come true too true to the one you
have<00:04:51.060> selected<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:52.580> these<00:04:54.080> two<00:04:55.550> selectors

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.469 

when<00:05:01.699> you<00:05:01.820> choose<00:05:02.560> when<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:03.650> select<00:05:04.479> storage

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
when you choose when you select storage

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.330 
when you choose when you select storage
unit<00:05:05.870> this<00:05:06.050> will<00:05:06.290> come<00:05:06.470> down<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:08.020> allowing

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
unit this will come down and allowing

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.030 
unit this will come down and allowing
this<00:05:10.340> thing<00:05:10.580> you<00:05:10.669> know<00:05:10.760> to<00:05:11.000> go<00:05:11.180> through<00:05:12.040> save

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
this thing you know to go through save

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.909 
this thing you know to go through save
on<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.430> other<00:05:13.550> side<00:05:17.260> this<00:05:18.260> is<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.740> T

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
on the other side this is the T

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.650 
on the other side this is the T
flip-flop<00:05:19.430> that<00:05:19.699> control<00:05:20.240> stat<00:05:22.360> controls<00:05:23.360> a

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
flip-flop that control stat controls a

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.840 
flip-flop that control stat controls a
and<00:05:24.020> whether<00:05:24.889> you're<00:05:25.160> choosing<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.699> or<00:05:25.910> b<00:05:26.060> and

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
and whether you're choosing a or b and

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.620 
and whether you're choosing a or b and
then<00:05:28.850> also<00:05:29.770> control<00:05:30.940> controlling<00:05:31.940> whether<00:05:32.270> or

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
then also control controlling whether or

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.529 
then also control controlling whether or
not<00:05:32.810> a<00:05:33.639> or<00:05:34.639> b<00:05:34.850> is<00:05:35.090> allowed<00:05:35.449> to<00:05:36.280> display<00:05:37.539> it

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
not a or b is allowed to display it

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:45.100 
not a or b is allowed to display it
controls<00:05:39.380> which<00:05:40.160> one<00:05:42.340> so<00:05:43.340> if<00:05:43.580> B<00:05:43.970> is<00:05:44.000> chosen<00:05:44.600> as

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
controls which one so if B is chosen as

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:52.960 
controls which one so if B is chosen as
now<00:05:46.449> then<00:05:47.449> only<00:05:47.810> the<00:05:48.610> signals<00:05:49.610> from<00:05:51.970> storage

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
now then only the signals from storage

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.930 
now then only the signals from storage
unit<00:05:53.270> B<00:05:53.510> will<00:05:53.780> come<00:05:54.050> true<00:05:54.770> to<00:05:55.460> the<00:05:55.639> display<00:05:56.030> and

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
unit B will come true to the display and

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:05.900 
unit B will come true to the display and
vice<00:05:58.940> versa

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:15.590 

yeah<00:06:06.950> that's<00:06:08.840> basically<00:06:09.840> it<00:06:12.200> so<00:06:13.580> if<00:06:14.580> any<00:06:14.880> is

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
yeah that's basically it so if any is

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.090 
yeah that's basically it so if any is
anything<00:06:16.230> please<00:06:17.450> ask<00:06:18.620> I'll<00:06:19.620> try<00:06:19.830> to<00:06:19.860> answer
