00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.740
 Well putt 3.0 was done next 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.050
 How to use something like this How about new features 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:09.529
 Is 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:10.680
 Yes 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.060
 Well, I had an article and I would like to see that too 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.400
 But from me 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.440
 this time 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.410
 Quite particularly 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.279
 I think that I would like to help you for your hard work 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.200
 First of all it is a glacier 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.569
 Glacier 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.029
 It became cute faster 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.169
 Yeah 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.249
 actually 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:31.479
 If you try 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:32.840
 can you see it 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.780
 It is rice 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.780
 Yeah I'm doing a little 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.200
 It is each party 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.140
 It became very one after another correction 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.670
 I wonder if I can understand that I got better 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.450
 but 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.010
 Medium and large- 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.970
 It is a general that the data of the safety department is received at the station Spaoto 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.050
 It is called a course in front of the agency 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.079
 If it is a dwarf to commentary, it is strongly mouth-feeling dirty 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.320
 In addition to the opengl, the minimum opengl is dirty 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.330
 In regard to this, the same sign is a man a little bit, but speed 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.860
 Wrong by speeding up 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.430
 Later on opengl 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.270
 I've left a house, but I want to see what I think I would do before 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.719
 by the way 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.690
 It is to wash 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.730
 to this 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.950
 Switch to the house with a regular quartz tree 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.700
 When writing adeco 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 It's a little dirty, but it's too early after that 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.220
 The usual choice is also the time 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.560
 It is a triangle 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.760
 I go to the skin 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.020
 further 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.189
 This time 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.960
 Furthermore, the name is also adopted in full 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.470
 Something like this 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.480
 I came to airanimation 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.440
 For example, if you choose this 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.910
 When convenience store became bigger 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.580
 But it was quite difficult if you say to the side 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.360
 I went to that kind of holder function 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.860
 Or a little physiology quite this 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.970
 As you use it, the more you use it, the more it comes with the tires of the book 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.039
 It was in the state, but it's almost time 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.850
 A lot 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.020
 As we think that some made data, we use as line finance base 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.909
 It was 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.459
 Furthermore 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.669
 What was from the first day of the public 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.749
 It is a function to draw gold figures, but this is good 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.769
 I told you that you requested data transfer from outside the prefecture 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:20.950
 High there 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.970
 It's been a while since it was hard to use 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.329
 It's a little bit too 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:31.689
 It is just by what this puts 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.149
 Well this 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:36.549
 This connector is also attached to something like mind map 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:37.459
 Wrap around 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.069
 Just like before, it's like you have to wash yourself 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.689
 I think it's a little easier to use 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.009
 It is from now on, such as the foundation 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.189
 I used all of qualifying 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.299
 Furthermore 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.240
 The same group 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.820
 Because it was equipped, quite the powerpoint and the entourage top 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.359
 It became possible to make things, but grouping was done 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.650
 Well done, with just one sample 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.249
 I tried to collect it, but this time it contains such a sample 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:07.829
 I will 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.289
 Congratulations there is a mockup 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:13.279
 I also want to do it recently but it looks good 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:15.719
 I have received high school students etc. 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.639
 Handwritten old handwriting 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.159
 Watch Partner and Typing Style- 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.099
 To make things 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.289
 Surely 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.689
 Optional function 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:28.599
 Nakajima keyboard here 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.359
 Iijima died 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.459
 In addition, the control which can be used with the western music icon 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.619
 It is put as a result 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.589
 Again by handwriting 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:40.299
 It's a harmful thing or something 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.899
 You can make it 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.579
 Like this 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.579
 Significantly lower 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:47.549
 Yamanaka 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.719
 Especially in Japan where you can use the general quotas 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.310
 But I think many people have been developed by imap 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:58.430
 It is said that while there was a medium effect here 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.299
 That Wenger 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.639
 You use various things of eldest son in combination 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:04.429
 Taitaka 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:07.429
 Teijin Fiber and such a feeling 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:09.610
 Also the app points increased 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.780
 If you can make it easily 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.589
 Of course you can copy andtest 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:16.900
 I was doing eco 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.259
 Kroon was caught in the selection vs. the meeting 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.159
 If you submit 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.659
 The same two 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.680
 I will ask you 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.479
 Screen transition 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.749
 Maybe this is it 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:31.370
 I wonder if I'm making it 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.430
 Do this 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.550
 For insurance contracts 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.909
 We are still 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.740
 I did this experiment this time, but a little figure 1 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.719
 Maeba 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:42.800
 The template which joined during the detailed version upgrade 

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:45.089
 I want to be a batter, I want to increase a little 

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:46.569
 Though I think 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:49.559
 I want someone who is something or dried meat 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.150
 If you have 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.000
 To all please 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.190
 Very positive 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.809
 It is when we use to want to examine 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:00.289
 I felt this icon 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.289
 Mobile phone site summary that is difficult to understand 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.819
 Blessed 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.800
 I wonder if the function was in an easy-to-understand icon 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.800
 Focus on something 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.620
 I sing with the above-mentioned Brooklyn print face photo 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.559
 There was also an increase in such risks 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.559
 It turned out that what I made before was not attached 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.240
 Remains z this time that divided the dark that opened the very function 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.770
 It is supposed to be loaded with a lot of features 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.419
 Just for the traditional customer 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:34.889
 completely 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.770
 Please upgrade 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.089
 Thank you 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.509
