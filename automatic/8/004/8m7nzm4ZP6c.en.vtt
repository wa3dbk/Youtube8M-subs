00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
now so let's go through kind of each

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.660 
now so let's go through kind of each
individual<00:02:35.409> part<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.280> know<00:02:36.400> kind<00:02:36.610> of

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
individual part and you know kind of

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.460 
individual part and you know kind of
what<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.390> entails<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.049> what<00:02:38.079> it's<00:02:38.260> for

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
what it entails and what it's for

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.740 
what it entails and what it's for
basically<00:02:39.030> now<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.120> first<00:02:40.299> thing<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.540> we've

basically now the first thing that we've

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.050 
basically now the first thing that we've
got<00:02:40.989> is<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.970> battery<00:02:42.970> itself<00:02:44.489> again<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.730> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
got is the battery itself again the the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.229 
got is the battery itself again the the
record<00:02:46.420> time<00:02:46.690> depends<00:02:47.200> obviously<00:02:48.120> how<00:02:49.120> are

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
record time depends obviously how are

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.490 
record time depends obviously how are
you<00:02:49.299> gonna<00:02:49.420> be<00:02:49.540> using<00:02:49.659> it<00:02:49.840> for<00:02:49.989> them<00:02:50.170> not<00:02:50.290> sure

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
you gonna be using it for them not sure

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.099 
you gonna be using it for them not sure
the<00:02:50.739> exact<00:02:51.040> staff<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.640> battery<00:02:51.970> itself

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
the exact staff to the battery itself

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.509 
the exact staff to the battery itself
and<00:02:53.109> this<00:02:53.379> is<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.680> little<00:02:53.950> were<00:02:54.129> kind<00:02:54.489> of

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
and this is that little were kind of

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.280 
and this is that little were kind of
power<00:02:54.849> brick<00:02:55.060> those<00:02:55.329> talk<00:02:55.540> about<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.810> do<00:02:56.019> need

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
power brick those talk about you do need

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.069 
power brick those talk about you do need
this<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.680> actually<00:02:56.980> charge<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:58.079> camcorder
