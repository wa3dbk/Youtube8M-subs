00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.320 
so finally this week we gotta go we
weren't<00:05:11.860> able<00:05:12.069> to<00:05:12.280> move<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.460> football<00:05:12.819> we<00:05:13.210> had

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
weren't able to move the football we had

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.839 
weren't able to move the football we had
to<00:05:13.449> try<00:05:13.569> something<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.229> it<00:05:15.069> cost<00:05:15.370> us<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.759> little

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
to try something and it cost us a little

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.999 
to try something and it cost us a little
bit<00:05:16.029> there<00:05:16.240> but<00:05:16.419> I'm<00:05:17.080> more<00:05:17.409> pleased<00:05:17.710> with<00:05:17.889> the

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
bit there but I'm more pleased with the

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.529 
bit there but I'm more pleased with the
way<00:05:18.129> we<00:05:18.159> played<00:05:18.490> in<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.639> second<00:05:18.939> half<00:05:19.090> I<00:05:19.300> think

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
way we played in the second half I think

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.480 
way we played in the second half I think
you<00:05:19.990> know<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.319> be<00:05:20.500> where<00:05:20.680> we<00:05:20.830> were<00:05:21.009> at<00:05:21.189> home<00:05:21.310> the

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
you know to be where we were at home the

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.070 
you know to be where we were at home the
three<00:05:21.699> points<00:05:22.000> in<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.150> second<00:05:22.479> half<00:05:22.509> sets<00:05:22.900> up

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
three points in the second half sets up

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.330 
three points in the second half sets up
about<00:05:23.289> the<00:05:23.439> character<00:05:23.800> of<00:05:23.830> our<00:05:23.919> kids<00:05:24.189> and

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
about the character of our kids and

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.369 
about the character of our kids and
we'll<00:05:24.819> have<00:05:24.939> to<00:05:25.060> build<00:05:25.210> on<00:05:25.419> that<00:05:25.449> not<00:05:26.050> happy

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:26.379 
we'll have to build on that not happy

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:27.839 
we'll have to build on that not happy
with<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.620> loss<00:05:26.800> not<00:05:27.129> happy<00:05:27.490> that<00:05:27.639> we<00:05:27.729> were

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
with the loss not happy that we were

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.300 
with the loss not happy that we were
unable<00:05:27.969> to<00:05:28.210> do<00:05:28.330> things<00:05:28.599> after<00:05:29.590> watch<00:05:29.889> the<00:05:30.069> film

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
unable to do things after watch the film

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.399 
unable to do things after watch the film
and<00:05:30.460> I<00:05:30.639> know<00:05:30.699> that's<00:05:30.939> the<00:05:31.180> verbal<00:05:31.840> coach<00:05:32.110> speak

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
and I know that's the verbal coach speak

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:33.809 
and I know that's the verbal coach speak
but<00:05:32.680> he'll<00:05:32.949> have<00:05:33.039> to<00:05:33.189> watch<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.490> film<00:05:33.729> and

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819 
but he'll have to watch the film and

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:35.640 
but he'll have to watch the film and
figure<00:05:34.150> it<00:05:34.180> out<00:05:34.330> because<00:05:34.479> when<00:05:35.259> we<00:05:35.379> came<00:05:35.500> on

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
figure it out because when we came on

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.959 
figure it out because when we came on
the<00:05:35.770> second<00:05:36.069> half<00:05:36.189> we<00:05:36.370> were<00:05:36.400> able<00:05:36.580> to<00:05:36.759> run<00:05:36.939> the

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
the second half we were able to run the

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.869 
the second half we were able to run the
football<00:05:37.240> pretty<00:05:37.659> much<00:05:37.840> it<00:05:38.020> will<00:05:38.199> and<00:05:38.879> that

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:39.879 
football pretty much it will and that

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:41.309 
football pretty much it will and that
just<00:05:40.060> can't<00:05:40.330> we<00:05:40.479> can't<00:05:40.659> wait<00:05:40.840> for<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.080> second
