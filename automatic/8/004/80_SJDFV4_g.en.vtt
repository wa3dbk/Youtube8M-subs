00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.099

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.210
 I make you a new video in 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.939
 which I will show you how 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.400
 raise a horse for help 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.130
 already I would like to thank my 90 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.750
 subscribers who really supported me for 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.610
 my videos that always order and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.270
 so he has that it really does 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.160
 pleasure 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.860
 so here we are for my tenth 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.260
 video I would not say already because 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.149
 good it's not spent particularly life 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.829
 but I still have 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.780
 just as important to look after my 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.090
 videos maybe more noticed because I 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.410
 started putting thumbnails on my 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.480
 videos I take a lot of time to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.500
 do that it's really a job that 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 I really care and so that 's what 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.899
 switch to the tutorial for for these cct 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.939
 horse lifting so here we have 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.439
 a lot a lot a lot but first 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.330
 I'm going to show how kraft is a 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.840
 special stage for horses so and 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.770
 looks like she is called Kraft 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.150
 cydel so it's not a saddle pig 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.799
 it's really a saddle horse that 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.960
 you will really only have with the mode 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.720
 raw akers words that you will find on 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.729
 a software called pipe x which 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.460
 not only allows you in salty this 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.360
 mode but also to move to versions 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.320
 previous of minecraft is at a stage 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.520
 many other modes 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.329
 so that's very very nice 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.329
 so I'll put it to you to have 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.070
 description it was loaded 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.130
 downloadable at least on platform 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.579
 pc 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:54.740
 so windows 7 windows vista linux and 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:57.110
 mac and I will also put a video 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.850
 of a youtuber that I really like 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.140
 you may know because he 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.600
 begins to impose itself in the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.610
 youtube community when it comes to 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.569
 gus dx which makes video media 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.229
 besides, I advise you to 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:11.030
 subscribe to his channel in passing and so 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.099
 he makes a video to explain a little 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.680
 those who fix and its usefulness 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.450
 so I said in brief what he 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.959
 was serving but well here we see 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.470
 since to go to the tutorial then here I 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.330
 basically this is basically a 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.930
 representation of a work table 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.430
 so here's this little tool that we 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.849
 serves to kraft is a lot a lot of 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.209
 things to make a saddle for a 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.079
 horse so you just have to have so 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.750
 it's not very expensive 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:44.780
 it will be enough for you to have 5 2 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.480
 spoons so you place it upside down 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.830
 in fact and you're going to make a kind 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.960
 weird triangle 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.280
 in language or to do so here is in 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:00.360
 leaving a space here by advancing that 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:04.320
 so that gives you here is a kraft cydel 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.230
 so now once we have it we're going 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.000
 go see a horse and we will go to him 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.940
 ask this saddle but he 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.410
 does not belong there yet you see on 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.480
 will take our bread or bread there 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.460
 will come back pretty well and we'll try to 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.920
 climb and then we will love to note 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.200
 see it he pitched it means he 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.360
 must give more bread again I 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.610
 am a drug addict offering for you 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.650
 accept and here it is all yauque nem 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.730
 which means choose vote finally 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.800
 the name of your pet 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.940
 I'm going to give him a world 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.490
 rotten i will call it youtube the name 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.030
 totally rotten but hey it's for 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.990
 Youtube 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.760
 so here is special dedication 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.260
 youtube so then you will be able to 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.760
 simply move the horse dildo 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.220
 so there to know that it is me who the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.140
 directs with directional keys 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.580
 here is finally a little trick we can 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.459
 blow up with your key 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.739
 for the jump so here's hop hop hop hop 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.450
 hop we can blow it up and that's it 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.670
 so we went for a nice walk 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.790
 nice too I searched for a long 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.379
 moment how how do i have how 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.360
 go down because I could not get to 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.880
 go down gc right-click left click 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.180
 I tried everything but I found 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.240
 final was mistakenly pressed the 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.900
 key maj and what happens I 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.070
 can go down 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.289
 so he has vouvoyÃ© the doormat so have 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.660
 we entered and there is his life bar so 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.220
 there we will take him to his box with 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.889
 the other horse so my other horse 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.289
 here's hop we put in there for 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.850
 go down by pressing his image 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.360
 meet we'll give them a little bit of 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.780
 form each and they will end up doing 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.300
 a baby 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.810
 so I do not know if it's too long 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.810
 will not wait 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:01.169
 they ordered us bread and more 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:07.410
 chances are he will make a baby so 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:08.550
 this is to make a little baby that must 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.949
 not wait I think because it's 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.330
 very very long here they are in their 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.729
 enclosures and you give them a little 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.070
 often they do not worry 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.810
 it's not super expensive the poor for 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.430
 find the cement to help you in 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.979
 your villages pnj you still have 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.590
 a chance 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:28.020
 and here is this tutorial is now 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.849
 finished I hope you have enjoyed it and 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.349
