something anywhere you know 24 30 inches
wide<00:00:45.630> you<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:46.080> find<00:00:46.290> out<00:00:46.470> a<00:00:46.500> light<00:00:46.860> fixture

that<00:00:47.370> would<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.820> somewhere<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.660> same

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that would be somewhere in the same

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.320 
that would be somewhere in the same
ballpark<00:00:49.580> you<00:00:50.580> get<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.790> little<00:00:51.090> bit<00:00:51.150> larger

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
ballpark you get a little bit larger

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.130

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
rule of thumb this behave you merely

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.999 
rule of thumb this behave you merely
about<00:01:01.500> 2/3<00:01:02.310> the<00:01:02.550> size<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> vanity<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
about 2/3 the size of the vanity and the

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.709 
about 2/3 the size of the vanity and the
light<00:01:05.280> fixture<00:01:05.729> could<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.149> also<00:01:06.539> be<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719 
light fixture could then also be a

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:08.230 
light fixture could then also be a
little<00:01:06.899> bit<00:01:07.020> smaller<00:01:07.289> than<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.679> mirror

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
little bit smaller than the mirror

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.700 
little bit smaller than the mirror
proportionally<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.390> could<00:01:09.570> go<00:01:09.749> 2/3<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
proportionally you could go 2/3 on the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.219 
proportionally you could go 2/3 on the
mirror<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.219> birds<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.789> light<00:01:11.939> fixture

when you need a larger double vanities

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.359 
when you need a larger double vanities
you<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.649> make<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.859> decision<00:01:17.249> if<00:01:17.310> you

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you have to make the decision if you

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.969 
you have to make the decision if you
want<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:17.819> two<00:01:18.630> meters<00:01:19.020> two<00:01:19.229> light<00:01:19.439> fixtures

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
or one large mirror and generally you're

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.459 
or one large mirror and generally you're
always<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.789> one<00:01:23.939> put<00:01:24.179> two<00:01:24.390> light<00:01:24.630> fixtures<00:01:25.229> up

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
always on one put two light fixtures up

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.139 
always on one put two light fixtures up
Center<00:01:26.399> it<00:01:26.490> over<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> edge<00:01:27.329> sink<00:01:27.749> bowl<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
Center it over the edge sink bowl so you

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.510 
Center it over the edge sink bowl so you
can<00:01:30.149> kind<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.439> take<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> information<00:01:31.889> from<00:01:32.399> a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
can kind of take the information from a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.639 
can kind of take the information from a
single<00:01:32.700> vanity<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.630> apply<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.289> a<00:01:34.319> large

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
single vanity and apply it to a large

single vanity and apply it to a large
double<00:01:35.749> just<00:01:36.749> to<00:01:36.869> keep<00:01:37.049> everything<00:01:37.380> in

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
double just to keep everything in

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.219 
double just to keep everything in
proportion<00:01:38.329> usually<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.810> want<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.049> take

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
proportion usually just want to take

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.770 
proportion usually just want to take
that<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.889> have<00:01:43.310> mirrors<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.579> are<00:01:44.880> that
