00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hi, your friend Alejandro Torres speaks to you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.680
 of educating your dog dot in this 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.750
 video I'm going to reveal the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.269
 most common behaviors of our 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.660
 dogs and how to correct them in a way 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.400
 positive and without punishment the application of 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.710
 some kind of training for 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.779
 obedience at an early stage is the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.660
 most effective technique to correct 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.609
 any problem of behavior 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.859
 new techniques serve to educate the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.869
 dogs and correct behaviors that 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.840
 can be problematic for a happy 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.910
 relationship since we can advance a lot 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.160
 faster and get in a way 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.590
 natural and effective to direct the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.210
 dog behavior with much less 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.640
 stress and anxiety 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.030
 remember the behavior is the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.010
 result of a dog's behavior the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.260
 dogs understand things very 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.780
 different to human beings that's why 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.390
 when you are trying to correct it 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.480
 you could be generating the problems of 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.460
 worst behavior educate is not 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.439
 just make your dog stay 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.489
 quietly in your backyard 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.220
 home 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.340
 teach that hand or that it's a good 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.649
 guard dog is a lot more than that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.720
 next six of the 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.460
 most common behaviors and their 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.220
 solution 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.200
 first the dog demanding if your dog 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.539
 that barks or throws seven and when 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.850
 he wants to eat out what you give him something 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.610
 is exhibiting a behavior 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.340
 demanding as the dog knows that this 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.340
 behavior works and keeps doing 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.100
 the same if it behaves if only 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.030
 ignore it when the behavior ceases 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.060
 not well and caress the second jump 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.950
 about you or other people, lean towards 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.860
 back when your dog must enter and it 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.560
 throw on you, turn your back or stand 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.560
 on the side if it is necessary to ignore or 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.119
 everything do not talk to him do not do anything is what 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.950
 more effective 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.539
 You must make sure that you do not have 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.610
 opportunity to jump on other 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.980
 people order him what he feels 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.410
 when a dog jumps on a person 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.179
 he is not greeting you but he is 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.230
 imposing what he wants to do in that 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:17.050
 third moment barks non-stop to the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.820
 Dogs like to bark to let them know 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.910
 that you do not like can be an incentive 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.220
 so that he stops doing it but screaming at him 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.800
 it's not the best way to get it is 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.500
 better shake a can full of coins 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.830
 to get your attention when you stop 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.870
 bark praises what he will eventually learn 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.000
 that silence entails more prizes than 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.310
 the fourth noise bites it all 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.800
 if we leave our dog too 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.840
 time alone it is very possible that due to the 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.480
 Boredom starts to bite everything 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.390
 that you have at your reach we will play see 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.430
 totally normal acts especially in 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.450
 the puppies so you have to give and 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.260
 toys so that they are distracted fifth 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.560
 strap strip 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.360
 dogs pull the leash 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.340
 mainly for two reasons because 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.530
 we follow them or because their step 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.200
 natural is much faster than the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.230
 ours if we teach him to walk with the 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.450
 Tension-free belt with based methods 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.550

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.560
 relaxed and nice for the dog 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.810
 devote a few minutes to keep 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.450
 with the strap next to you and watch that the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.420
 strap is not tense every time 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.800
 pull the strap congratulate him and give him a 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.650
 prize 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.110
 sixth candle while people like 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.570
 we must get used to our dog 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.970
 from puppy to sit and wait for

 we serve him we put the plate in his 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.230
 place and we give him the order to eat this 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.720
 will tell you that our level of 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.520
 hierarchy is superior because we are 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.580
 we who administer the 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.490
 food although it hurts and it costs us 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.770
 ignore his pleading look your dog 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.800
 will end up surrendering to understand that no 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.630
 can manipulate t the dog believes that 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.570
 who eat before him are the 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.130
