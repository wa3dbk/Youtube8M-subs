00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
going this way again you're leaning your

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.160 
going this way again you're leaning your
body<00:03:56.129> you're<00:03:56.909> going<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.120> explode<00:03:57.569> that<00:03:57.750> next

out there once again you got to pull up

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.449 
out there once again you got to pull up
you<00:04:02.700> got<00:04:02.849> a<00:04:02.879> driving<00:04:03.239> dish<00:04:03.599> you<00:04:03.930> got<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.110> layup

you got a driving dish you got a layup

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.190 
you got a driving dish you got a layup
here's<00:04:05.459> how<00:04:05.579> you<00:04:05.640> can<00:04:05.849> practice<00:04:06.090> this<00:04:06.510> get<00:04:07.170> a

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
here's how you can practice this get a

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.289 
here's how you can practice this get a
straight<00:04:07.590> line<00:04:07.829> you're<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.579> foul<00:04:08.760> line

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
straight line you're the foul line

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.149 
straight line you're the foul line
can't<00:04:09.750> get<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:09.930> straight<00:04:10.409> line<00:04:10.590> here's<00:04:10.980> what

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
can't get a straight line here's what

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.030 
can't get a straight line here's what
you<00:04:11.310> do<00:04:11.489> all<00:04:12.390> right<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.689> practice<00:04:13.319> just<00:04:13.739> going

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
you do all right you practice just going

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.490 
you do all right you practice just going
over<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.549> line<00:04:14.730> over<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.569> line<00:04:15.599> the<00:04:16.229> ball

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
over the line over the line the ball

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.370 
over the line over the line the ball
should<00:04:16.739> start<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.269> should<00:04:18.509> end<00:04:18.780> in<00:04:19.229> the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
should start and it should end in the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.460 
should start and it should end in the
exact<00:04:19.769> same<00:04:20.039> spot<00:04:20.459> every<00:04:20.759> single<00:04:21.509> time<00:04:21.870> the

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
exact same spot every single time the

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.170 
exact same spot every single time the
ball<00:04:22.680> should<00:04:22.889> not<00:04:23.100> land<00:04:23.430> on<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.699> other<00:04:23.880> side

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
ball should not land on the other side

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.730 
ball should not land on the other side
of<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.389> line<00:04:24.449> or<00:04:24.990> you're<00:04:25.110> not<00:04:25.199> really<00:04:25.440> doing

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
of that line or you're not really doing

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.719 
of that line or you're not really doing
the<00:04:25.830> move<00:04:25.979> efficiently

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
the move efficiently

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.879 
the move efficiently
okay<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:27.240> take<00:04:27.539> a<00:04:27.570> nice<00:04:27.780> long<00:04:28.110> line<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:28.740> line

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
okay so take a nice long line this line

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.040 
okay so take a nice long line this line
is<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.160> very<00:04:29.280> long<00:04:29.520> pays<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:30.330> take<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.539> nice<00:04:30.780> long

is it very long pays it take a nice long

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.710 
is it very long pays it take a nice long
