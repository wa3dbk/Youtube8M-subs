00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.890 

that<00:01:53.840> just<00:01:54.050> looks<00:01:54.230> gross<00:01:54.590> I<00:01:55.480> have<00:01:56.480> a<00:01:56.510> feeling

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
that just looks gross I have a feeling

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.200

them<00:01:57.080> with<00:01:57.260> it<00:01:57.440> you<00:01:58.160> know<00:01:58.280> it's<00:01:58.460> not<00:01:58.610> as<00:01:58.790> strong

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
them with it you know it's not as strong

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.350 
them with it you know it's not as strong
and<00:01:59.450> tasting<00:01:59.930> as<00:02:00.080> you<00:02:00.200> would<00:02:00.350> expect<00:02:00.770> it<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:00.920> be

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
and tasting as you would expect it to be

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.030 
and tasting as you would expect it to be
it's<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.420> little<00:02:02.630> bit<00:02:02.750> just<00:02:03.410> a<00:02:03.560> little<00:02:03.590> bit<00:02:03.890> of

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
it's a little bit just a little bit of

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.169 
it's a little bit just a little bit of
salting<00:02:04.460> um<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:06.770> really<00:02:07.070> stinks<00:02:07.370> though<00:02:07.610> Jesus

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
salting um it really stinks though Jesus

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.060 
salting um it really stinks though Jesus
that<00:02:08.330> really<00:02:08.600> stinks<00:02:08.899> but<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:09.530> flavor<00:02:09.800> isn't

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
that really stinks but the flavor isn't

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.540 
that really stinks but the flavor isn't
that<00:02:10.340> strong<00:02:11.020> so<00:02:12.020> I<00:02:14.110> guess<00:02:15.190> whatever<00:02:16.190> you

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
that strong so I guess whatever you

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.460 
that strong so I guess whatever you
would<00:02:16.730> use<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.209> in<00:02:17.480> would<00:02:17.870> probably<00:02:18.320> be

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
would use this in would probably be

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.520 
would use this in would probably be
great<00:02:19.270> but<00:02:20.270> you're<00:02:20.660> definitely<00:02:20.810> not<00:02:21.170> meant<00:02:21.410> to

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
great but you're definitely not meant to

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.280 
great but you're definitely not meant to
just<00:02:21.770> take<00:02:22.010> chunks<00:02:22.340> out<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:23.120> know

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
just take chunks out of it you know

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.100 
just take chunks out of it you know
better<00:02:24.610> yeah<00:02:25.610> it's<00:02:25.820> not<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:26.060> not<00:02:26.300> beef<00:02:26.480> jerky

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
better yeah it's not it's not beef jerky

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.440 
better yeah it's not it's not beef jerky
come<00:02:27.800> on<00:02:27.890> jerky<00:02:28.750> but<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:30.790> mean<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:31.970> has<00:02:32.180> enough

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
come on jerky but I mean this has enough

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.970 
come on jerky but I mean this has enough
of<00:02:32.570> that<00:02:32.690> fishy<00:02:32.870> flavor<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.890> is

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
of that fishy flavor that this is

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.699 
of that fishy flavor that this is
probably<00:02:34.220> using<00:02:34.520> bras<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.270> stuff<00:02:35.709> something

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
probably using bras and stuff something

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.310 
probably using bras and stuff something
that<00:02:36.800> needs<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.040> be<00:02:37.070> reconstituted<00:02:37.630> yeah<00:02:38.630> so

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
that needs to be reconstituted yeah so

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.380 
that needs to be reconstituted yeah so
yeah<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.630> gotta<00:02:41.630> hang<00:02:41.930> up<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.140> thumbs-up<00:02:43.390> even

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390
