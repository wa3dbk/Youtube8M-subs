all together in a very kind of kept on

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.670 
all together in a very kind of kept on
price<00:00:17.910> because<00:00:18.600> they<00:00:18.750> are<00:00:18.840> replicas<00:00:19.289> ok<00:00:19.560> these

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
price because they are replicas ok these

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.300 
price because they are replicas ok these
are<00:00:19.830> replicas<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.510> how<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.779> looks<00:00:22.310> it

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
are replicas so this is how it looks it

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.089 
are replicas so this is how it looks it
has<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.519> emulated<00:00:24.300> orange<00:00:24.869> background<00:00:25.230> just

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
has the emulated orange background just

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.460 
has the emulated orange background just
cool<00:00:26.400> if<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:28.400> yeah<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:30.660> back<00:00:30.900> which<00:00:31.289> is

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
cool if you like yeah the back which is

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.110 
cool if you like yeah the back which is
smart<00:00:31.740> resistance<00:00:32.930> as<00:00:33.930> its<00:00:34.170> X<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:34.649> ok<00:00:35.399> what

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
smart resistance as its X here ok what

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.350 
smart resistance as its X here ok what
means<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:37.969> yeah<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.120> says<00:00:39.390> g<00:00:40.079> shock<00:00:41.360> shock

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
means this yeah it says g shock shock

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.229 
means this yeah it says g shock shock
with<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.780> ok<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.620> shock<00:00:43.800> resistant<00:00:44.280> can

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
with this ok so it's shock resistant can

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.639 
with this ok so it's shock resistant can
just<00:00:45.420> whack<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.660> around<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.350> won't<00:00:46.469> even

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
just whack it around here you won't even

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.010 
just whack it around here you won't even
break<00:00:46.950> because<00:00:47.520> human<00:00:47.940> replicas<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.690> works

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
break because human replicas it works

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.849 
break because human replicas it works
too<00:00:50.030> you<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.860> stopwatch<00:00:53.270> ok<00:00:54.559> stop<00:00:55.559> watch

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
too you have a stopwatch ok stop watch

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:03.170 
too you have a stopwatch ok stop watch

56 I said it's the 57 in the video I'm
sure<00:02:09.100> it's<00:02:09.280> almost<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.940> same<00:02:10.119> just<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.020> same

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
sure it's almost the same just the same

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.920 
sure it's almost the same just the same
thing<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:12.220> what<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.520> resistance<00:02:13.030> okay<00:02:13.450> not

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
thing is what the resistance okay not

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.110 
thing is what the resistance okay not
show<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.170> with<00:02:14.410> ups<00:02:14.620> 10<00:02:15.069> meters<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.970> is

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
show you with ups 10 meters but it is

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.100 
show you with ups 10 meters but it is
what<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.420> resistance<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:18.480> yeah<00:02:19.480> get<00:02:19.900> this

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
what the resistance and yeah get this

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.620 
what the resistance and yeah get this
it's<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.500> replica<00:02:20.850> if<00:02:21.850> you're<00:02:22.030> gonna<00:02:22.120> money<00:02:22.390> get

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
it's a replica if you're gonna money get

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.540 
it's a replica if you're gonna money get
the<00:02:22.750> origin<00:02:23.080> when<00:02:23.319> i'm<00:02:23.410> not<00:02:23.560> sure<00:02:23.739> if<00:02:23.920> how<00:02:24.310> much

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
the origin when i'm not sure if how much
