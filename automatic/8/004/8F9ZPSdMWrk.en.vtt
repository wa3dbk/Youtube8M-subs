00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
ok back to the glitches so I have a Wii

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.960 
ok back to the glitches so I have a Wii
zapper<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.220> hard<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.400> me<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.880> on

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
zapper so it's hard for me to do it on

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.540 
zapper so it's hard for me to do it on
the<00:00:30.060> dapper<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.960> gotta<00:00:32.120> take<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.180> out<00:00:34.550> ok

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the dapper so I gotta take this out ok

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.720 
the dapper so I gotta take this out ok
so<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> very<00:00:37.469> easy<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.430> run

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
so this is a very easy but you just run

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.110 
so this is a very easy but you just run
jump<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.540> crouch<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:42.559> then<00:00:43.559> you're<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.739> here

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
jump and crouch and then you're in here

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.779 
jump and crouch and then you're in here
very<00:00:45.120> easy<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:47.000> over<00:00:48.000> there

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
very easy and you can get over there

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:56.950 
very easy and you can get over there
fresh<00:00:50.789> right<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:55.160> you<00:00:56.160> can<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.340> over<00:00:56.399> here

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
fresh right here you can get over here

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
fresh right here you can get over here
but<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.109> some<00:00:58.289> reason<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.890> think<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.640> that

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
but for some reason I think that that

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.740 
but for some reason I think that that
light<00:01:00.449> spot<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.960> can't<00:01:01.140> walk<00:01:01.350> through<00:01:01.590> its

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
light spot you can't walk through its

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.109 
light spot you can't walk through its
weird<00:01:03.750> i<00:01:03.930> don't<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.970> just

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
weird i don't get it but so you just

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
weird i don't get it but so you just
have<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.330> get<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.540> corner<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.290> yeah

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
have to get in the corner so here yeah

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.030 
have to get in the corner so here yeah
and<00:01:08.549> then<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.900> get<00:01:10.049> out<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> same

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
and then to get out you just do the same

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.870 
and then to get out you just do the same
thing<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.760> go<00:01:11.850> from<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:13.070> here<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
thing you can go from here here or the

come in through all those places and get

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.460 
come in through all those places and get
out<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.990> all<00:01:19.080> those<00:01:19.170> places<00:01:19.790> just<00:01:20.790> run<00:01:21.119> or<00:01:21.780> jump

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470

so these that's the only glitches i know
on<00:02:27.280> this<00:02:27.400> area<00:02:27.730> just<00:02:28.120> use<00:02:28.600> all<00:02:28.900> these<00:02:29.080> shacks

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
on this area just use all these shacks

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:38.910 
on this area just use all these shacks
we<00:02:30.430> can<00:02:30.550> get<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.970> get<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.300> there<00:02:34.740> so<00:02:37.470> if<00:02:38.470> i<00:02:38.650> find

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
we can get to get it there so if i find

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.130 
we can get to get it there so if i find
more<00:02:39.160> glitches<00:02:39.370> which<00:02:40.300> i<00:02:40.570> don't<00:02:40.720> think<00:02:40.870> there

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
more glitches which i don't think there

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.500 
more glitches which i don't think there
are<00:02:41.170> any<00:02:41.290> one<00:02:41.620> which<00:02:41.800> is<00:02:41.830> on<00:02:42.070> this<00:02:42.190> map<00:02:42.490> but<00:02:42.730> if

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
are any one which is on this map but if

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.960 
are any one which is on this map but if
i<00:02:43.660> if<00:02:44.260> i<00:02:44.380> do<00:02:44.440> end<00:02:44.770> up<00:02:45.130> finding<00:02:45.340> any<00:02:45.610> more<00:02:45.820> i'll
