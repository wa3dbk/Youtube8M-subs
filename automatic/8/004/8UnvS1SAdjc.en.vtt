00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:24.630
 all you see in these you can see 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:24.630
 how he will kill and the matter of the glowing pumpkin 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:36.159
 he also appeared his face has not changed 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.760
 they are the same as the Well knock out 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.290
 specify 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:50.680
 show me rainier 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:58.320
 the village they like defended on the village 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.320
 where I live and tell me how 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.670
 and here I want to show you how to tame 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.840
 horse and for version 161 162 and see 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.720
 she is already tamed 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.920
 can she not like to go here 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.920
 you can manage it 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:26.310
 but if you tame better bareback 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:39.690
 then you will not be able to manage it well here 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:42.299
 look so here is a horse and here you can 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.470
 take the horse's face as well if you can 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:49.880
 how would this be included 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:56.940
 bio you can find it 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:03:21.269
 so it looks like this and take 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:26.820
 also look here we can 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:30.000
 guys here's a foal can't be tamed but 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.730
 But if he had taken the night with you 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.700
 by 2 or 2 he will grow a big horse 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.440
 see a horse sometimes does it like this 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.769
 you can't eat it better then 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.710
 make another horse out the other way around 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.710
 not 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.630
 lamps and try the Turks or 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:58.470
 you can think like empty hands 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:04:01.050
 too good see now we have to 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:17.480
 it is necessary to tame here and so do long 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:17.480
 for the day and there will be candles try 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:28.550
 return yes so can a lot of stuff 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.540
 tamed everything 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:46.890
 look here click on it 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:49.380
 Inventory button and you see climbed 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.540
 click on the inventory take the saddle and 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.840
 put on where everything is now we can ride 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.979
 on his four types of armor like diamond 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:05.910
 good and so it looks gold well 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:08.250
 worse and iron seems to me that 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.820
 train more on a real horse 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.710
 I always looked like just in case 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.630
 diamond 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:23.610
 and after multiply 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:25.050
 put on the saddle we can walk and pushing 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.729
 on the problem we see how we 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:34.190
 this field is executed and you can jump 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.190
 but I said goodbye
