we're<00:00:04.290> ready<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.799> blow<00:00:05.009> when<00:00:05.400> we<00:00:05.549> take<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.790> look

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
we're ready to blow when we take a look

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.480 
we're ready to blow when we take a look
at<00:00:06.240> Nova's<00:00:06.750> neutron<00:00:07.200> star<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:08.069> can<00:00:08.220> pick<00:00:08.370> up

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
at Nova's neutron star you can pick up

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.669 
at Nova's neutron star you can pick up
neutron<00:00:08.910> star<00:00:09.179> for<00:00:09.330> 25,000<00:00:10.110> standing<00:00:10.530> after

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
neutron star for 25,000 standing after

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.020 
neutron star for 25,000 standing after
you've<00:00:10.920> reached<00:00:11.099> rank<00:00:11.400> five<00:00:11.700> with<00:00:11.910> either

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
you've reached rank five with either

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.020 
you've reached rank five with either
Cephalon<00:00:12.599> sudha<00:00:12.960> or<00:00:13.170> steel<00:00:13.590> meridian<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.730> this

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
Cephalon sudha or steel meridian so this

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.250 
Cephalon sudha or steel meridian so this
is<00:00:15.150> one<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> abilities<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.109> was

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
is one of the abilities that I was

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.050 
is one of the abilities that I was
extremely<00:00:16.650> curious<00:00:17.130> about<00:00:17.490> as<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.910> thought

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
extremely curious about as I thought

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.640 
extremely curious about as I thought
that<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.359> had<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.539> lot<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.900> potential

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
that it had a lot of potential

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.740 
that it had a lot of potential
well<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.039> only<00:00:20.430> ever<00:00:20.670> used<00:00:20.970> null<00:00:21.270> star<00:00:21.539> when<00:00:21.720> I

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
well I only ever used null star when I

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.779 
well I only ever used null star when I
remembered<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.350> existed<00:00:22.920> which<00:00:23.220> was<00:00:23.580> pretty

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
remembered it existed which was pretty

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.700 
remembered it existed which was pretty
rare<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.359> did<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> halfway<00:00:24.990> decent<00:00:25.380> job<00:00:25.410> but

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
rare it did a halfway decent job but

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.080 
rare it did a halfway decent job but
letting<00:00:25.980> me<00:00:26.099> know<00:00:26.130> something<00:00:26.670> was<00:00:26.789> creeping

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
letting me know something was creeping

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.029 
letting me know something was creeping
up<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.420> me<00:00:27.480> or<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.109> an<00:00:28.230> enemy<00:00:28.380> was<00:00:28.710> hiding

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
up on me or if an enemy was hiding

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.830 
up on me or if an enemy was hiding
behind<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.369> corner<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.179> thought<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.720> this

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
behind a corner so I thought that this

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.330 
behind a corner so I thought that this
might<00:00:31.050> actually<00:00:31.080> be<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.679> really<00:00:31.980> cool<00:00:32.189> twist

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
might actually be a really cool twist

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.370 
might actually be a really cool twist
The<00:00:33.030> Syndicate<00:00:33.329> modifier<00:00:33.870> gives<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
The Syndicate modifier gives you the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.110 
The Syndicate modifier gives you the
ability<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.860> detonate<00:00:35.370> all<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.700> your<00:00:35.850> existing

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
ability to detonate all of your existing

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.360 
ability to detonate all of your existing
null<00:00:36.570> stars<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.200> deal<00:00:37.380> aerial<00:00:37.770> effect<00:00:38.070> blast

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
null stars to deal aerial effect blast

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.190 
null stars to deal aerial effect blast
damage<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.000> knock<00:00:39.180> down<00:00:39.360> all<00:00:39.600> enemies<00:00:39.989> within

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
damage and knock down all enemies within

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.470 
damage and knock down all enemies within
a<00:00:40.410> range<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.190> more<00:00:41.340> null<00:00:41.579> Czar's<00:00:41.850> detonated

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
a range the more null Czar's detonated

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.389 
a range the more null Czar's detonated
the<00:00:42.600> more<00:00:42.780> damage<00:00:43.110> dealt<00:00:43.350> now<00:00:43.920> complete

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the more damage dealt now complete

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.860 
the more damage dealt now complete
testing<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.940> definitely<00:00:45.390> scales<00:00:45.719> with

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
testing this definitely scales with

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.690 
testing this definitely scales with
power<00:00:46.079> strength<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.530> well<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:46.950> range<00:00:47.370> mods

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
power strength as well as range mods

another<00:00:48.480> thing<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.809> note<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.200> while<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> base

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
another thing to note is while the base

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.470 
another thing to note is while the base
range<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> explosion<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.879> approximately

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
range of the explosion is approximately

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.900 
range of the explosion is approximately
5<00:00:51.750> meters<00:00:52.020> enemies<00:00:52.920> take<00:00:53.129> considerably<00:00:53.640> less

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
5 meters enemies take considerably less

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.520 
5 meters enemies take considerably less
damage<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.539> further<00:00:54.750> they<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:54.989> away<00:00:55.320> from

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
damage the further they are away from

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.709 
damage the further they are away from
the<00:00:55.620> epicenter<00:00:55.739> now<00:00:56.640> honestly<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.449> more<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the epicenter now honestly the more and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.990 
the epicenter now honestly the more and
more<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> tested<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.829> Sattar<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.219> got<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
more I tested this the Sattar I got the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.790 
more I tested this the Sattar I got the
fact<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.449> while<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.809> does<00:01:00.989> scale<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.500> damage

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
fact is while it does scale the damage

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.650 
fact is while it does scale the damage
from<00:01:01.890> each<00:01:02.100> explosion<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.789> not<00:01:03.059> equivalent<00:01:03.420> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
from each explosion is not equivalent to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.090 
from each explosion is not equivalent to
the<00:01:03.780> damage<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.140> each<00:01:04.350> individual<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:04.920> all

star detonated now my numbers are

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.719 
star detonated now my numbers are
extremely<00:01:07.350> rough<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> grading

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
extremely rough because of the grading

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.640 
extremely rough because of the grading
damage<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.570> seems<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:09.990> approximately

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
damage but it seems to do approximately

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.859 
damage but it seems to do approximately
50%<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> damage<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.180> each<00:01:12.299> individual

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
50% of the damage that each individual

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.450 
50% of the damage that each individual
null<00:01:13.170> star<00:01:13.409> would<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.830> their<00:01:13.979> own<00:01:14.010> in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
null star would do on their own in

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.190 
null star would do on their own in
addition<00:01:15.180> due<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> way<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> damage

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
addition due to the way the damage

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.170 
addition due to the way the damage
tapers<00:01:16.590> off<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:17.009> not<00:01:17.250> really<00:01:17.580> effective<00:01:18.060> at

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
tapers off it's not really effective at

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.820 
tapers off it's not really effective at
killing<00:01:18.330> off<00:01:18.570> enemy<00:01:18.990> swarms<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.470> its<00:01:19.619> own

killing off enemy swarms on its own

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.190 
killing off enemy swarms on its own
however<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.240> does<00:01:21.450> seem<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.990> made

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
however what it does seem like it's made

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.140 
however what it does seem like it's made
for<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.619> control<00:01:23.159> when<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.729> played<00:01:23.939> around

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
for is control when it played around

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.219 
for is control when it played around
with<00:01:24.270> testing<00:01:24.689> its<00:01:24.810> range

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
with testing its range

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.749 
with testing its range
it<00:01:25.320> seemed<00:01:25.560> far<00:01:25.860> more<00:01:26.009> effective<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:26.610> keeping

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it seemed far more effective at keeping

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.609
