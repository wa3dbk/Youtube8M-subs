keepers<00:00:03.750> channel<00:00:04.200> saw<00:00:04.410> this<00:00:04.589> pizza<00:00:05.069> oven<00:00:05.400> and

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
keepers channel saw this pizza oven and

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.340 
keepers channel saw this pizza oven and
asked<00:00:05.700> some<00:00:06.029> questions<00:00:06.569> about<00:00:06.720> it<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.080> so<00:00:07.259> in

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
asked some questions about it and so in

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.709 
asked some questions about it and so in
this<00:00:07.500> video<00:00:07.830> which<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:09.120> course<00:00:09.300> about<00:00:09.690> a

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
this video which is of course about a

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.770 
this video which is of course about a
pizza<00:00:10.019> oven<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.740> that's<00:00:10.889> so<00:00:11.280> exciting<00:00:11.780> I'm

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780

this thing what it is and where you can
get<00:00:16.500> one<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.390> Wisco<00:00:18.390> Industries

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
get one this is the Wisco Industries

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.939 
get one this is the Wisco Industries
Incorporated<00:00:19.460> model<00:00:20.539> 425<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.840> pizza<00:00:22.590> oven

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
Incorporated model 425 a pizza oven

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.460 
Incorporated model 425 a pizza oven
and<00:00:23.100> although<00:00:23.670> Wisco<00:00:24.300> Industries<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.140> based

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and although Wisco Industries is based

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.150 
and although Wisco Industries is based
in<00:00:25.740> Wisconsin<00:00:27.109> this<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.320> made<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.949> same

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
in Wisconsin this is made in the same

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.130 
in Wisconsin this is made in the same
place<00:00:29.400> everything<00:00:30.029> else<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.420> made<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.840> China

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
place everything else is made in China

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.920 
place everything else is made in China
but<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:32.189> seems<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.730> made<00:00:32.910> fairly<00:00:33.360> well<00:00:33.570> I

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
but it seems to be made fairly well I

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.709 
but it seems to be made fairly well I
have<00:00:34.620> been<00:00:34.829> inside<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.309> just<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.820> see<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.630> know

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
have been inside it just to see you know

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.150 
have been inside it just to see you know
what<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:37.020> going<00:00:37.320> on<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:37.800> because<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
what was going on in there because the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.470 
what was going on in there because the
thing<00:00:38.340> that's<00:00:38.489> very<00:00:38.550> interesting<00:00:39.090> about<00:00:39.270> this

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
thing that's very interesting about this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.569 
thing that's very interesting about this
is<00:00:39.690> unlike<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> lot<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.290> similar<00:00:40.710> pizza<00:00:41.100> ovens

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
is unlike a lot of similar pizza ovens

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.209 
is unlike a lot of similar pizza ovens
this<00:00:42.000> thing<00:00:42.270> has<00:00:42.510> an<00:00:42.860> electronic<00:00:43.860> control

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
this thing has an electronic control

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.979 
this thing has an electronic control
panel<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> front<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> digital<00:00:45.719> timer

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
panel on the front with a digital timer

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.680 
panel on the front with a digital timer
and<00:00:46.320> two<00:00:47.160> temperature<00:00:47.700> selectors<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.450> stuff

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
and two temperature selectors and stuff

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.590 
and two temperature selectors and stuff
like<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.440> normally<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.579> don't<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:51.239> good

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
like that and normally I don't have good

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.680 
like that and normally I don't have good
feelings<00:00:51.930> when<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:53.090> when<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.120> see<00:00:54.420> something

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
feelings when I when I see something

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.319 
feelings when I when I see something
like<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:56.280> device<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.879> gets<00:00:57.000> hot

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
like this in a device that gets hot

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.330 
like this in a device that gets hot
because<00:00:57.750> usually<00:00:57.960> what<00:00:58.260> seems<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.770> happen<00:00:58.949> is

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
because usually what seems to happen is

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.220 
because usually what seems to happen is
eventually<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.969> electronics<00:01:00.750> themselves

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
eventually the electronics themselves

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.470 
eventually the electronics themselves
get<00:01:01.440> cooked<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.820> much<00:01:03.000> more<00:01:03.210> serious

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
get cooked and it's much more serious

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780 
get cooked and it's much more serious
than<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.500> bad<00:01:04.739> capacitors<00:01:04.979> or<00:01:05.610> anything

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
than just bad capacitors or anything

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.840 
than just bad capacitors or anything
like<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.590> now<00:01:07.590> those<00:01:07.799> things<00:01:08.010> not<00:01:08.250> built<00:01:08.580> too

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
like that now those things not built too

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.179 
like that now those things not built too
badly<00:01:09.150> internally<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.799> they've<00:01:10.979> got

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
badly internally what they've got

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.950 
badly internally what they've got
they've<00:01:11.460> got<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.670> bit<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.030> fiberglass<00:01:12.570> batting

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
they've got a bit of fiberglass batting

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.830 
they've got a bit of fiberglass batting
up<00:01:13.260> against<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> interior<00:01:14.729> panel<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
up against the interior panel here to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.840 
up against the interior panel here to
try<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.170> protect<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.799> electronics<00:01:17.369> they

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
try and protect the electronics they

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.910 
try and protect the electronics they
also<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.420> DC<00:01:18.869> brushless<00:01:19.229> fan<00:01:19.710> in

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
also have a little DC brushless fan in

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.609 
also have a little DC brushless fan in
here<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> variable<00:01:21.810> speed<00:01:21.960> circuit

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
here that is on a variable speed circuit

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.350 
here that is on a variable speed circuit
but<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.799> doesn't<00:01:23.189> stay<00:01:23.369> turning<00:01:23.790> slow<00:01:24.060> for

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
but it doesn't stay turning slow for

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.300 
but it doesn't stay turning slow for
very<00:01:24.570> long<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.110> speeds<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.950> breakneck

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
very long it speeds up to a breakneck

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.510 
very long it speeds up to a breakneck
speed<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.299> runs<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.840> mad<00:01:28.400> during<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
speed and just runs like mad during the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.100 
speed and just runs like mad during the
time<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.759> you're<00:01:30.030> cooking<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> pizza<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
time that you're cooking the pizza and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.670 
time that you're cooking the pizza and
also<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:32.040> several<00:01:32.460> minutes<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.850> their<00:01:33.030> after

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
also for several minutes of their after

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.319 
also for several minutes of their after
anyway<00:01:34.680> does<00:01:35.369> seem<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> be<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.909> good<00:01:36.180> quality

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
anyway does seem to be a good quality

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.719 
anyway does seem to be a good quality
fan<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.200> delta<00:01:37.439> fan<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.220> that's<00:01:38.579> a

here<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:18.250> starts<00:03:18.580> out<00:03:18.760> slow<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.410> then<00:03:20.410> just

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
here it starts out slow and then just

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.710 
here it starts out slow and then just
gradually<00:03:20.830> picks<00:03:21.340> up<00:03:21.519> speed<00:03:21.670> until<00:03:22.120> it's<00:03:22.360> just

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
gradually picks up speed until it's just

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.210 
gradually picks up speed until it's just
flying

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
Farm and fleet now farming fleet is not

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.230 
Farm and fleet now farming fleet is not
a<00:03:43.510> nationwide<00:03:43.990> chain<00:03:44.460> in<00:03:45.460> fact<00:03:45.700> I<00:03:45.820> think<00:03:45.880> they

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
a nationwide chain in fact I think they

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.960 
a nationwide chain in fact I think they
service<00:03:46.900> pretty<00:03:47.140> much<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.970> Midwestern

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
service pretty much the Midwestern

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.210 
service pretty much the Midwestern

down<00:03:51.430> in<00:03:51.610> Missouri<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:53.470> few<00:03:54.100> places<00:03:54.340> in

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
down in Missouri and a few places in

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.910

between<00:03:54.820> so<00:03:55.510> if<00:03:55.870> you<00:03:56.020> can't<00:03:56.260> find<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.680> farm

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920
