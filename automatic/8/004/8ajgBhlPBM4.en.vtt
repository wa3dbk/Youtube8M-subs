as<00:04:21.000> I<00:04:21.180> said<00:04:21.389> before<00:04:21.440> it's<00:04:22.440> extremely

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
as I said before it's extremely

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.280 
as I said before it's extremely
enjoyable<00:04:23.580> for<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:24.030> two-minute<00:04:24.480> level<00:04:24.810> the

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
enjoyable for a two-minute level the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
gameplay make for an enjoyable level but

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.390 
gameplay make for an enjoyable level but
it<00:04:29.639> ends<00:04:29.940> too<00:04:30.150> abruptly<00:04:30.720> for<00:04:31.050> me<00:04:31.200> that's<00:04:32.160> not

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
it ends too abruptly for me that's not

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.220 
it ends too abruptly for me that's not
to<00:04:32.550> say<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.060> boss<00:04:33.330> wasn't<00:04:33.630> satisfying

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230

to<00:04:34.410> fight<00:04:34.680> I'm<00:04:35.310> just<00:04:35.580> saying<00:04:35.850> that<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.300> level

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
to fight I'm just saying that the level

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.140 
to fight I'm just saying that the level
ended<00:04:36.930> too<00:04:37.169> soon<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.710> that's<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.280> big<00:04:38.610> minus
