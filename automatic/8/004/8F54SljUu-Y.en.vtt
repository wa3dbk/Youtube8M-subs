 let's nothing compare with brazil 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.460
 the country that gave the world football after 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.669
 one of the most wonderful 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.669
 celebrations in the history of the world championship 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.009
 and for the Brazilian ticket comes 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.109
 responsible moment which can 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.109
 share with the world 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.450
 1994 is the most grandiose show in 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.079
 the world came to the united states 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.739
 America at the stadium appreciated the noise and 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.030
 enthusiasm major championship 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.660
 world in history 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.180
 after twenty four years desperate 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.570
 desire to win one team is ready 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.160
 sacrifice all to strive to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.080
 to win 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.150
 Brazil 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.310
 m realized was quite different 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.500
 Brazil there was no free role 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.260
 carnival culture football rfs 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.100
 there was only one world championship on 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.060
 all times 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.500
 so we will play football 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.410
 is organized 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.120
 but the brazilian team is not even 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.420
 just did not work out on the football field 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.340
 they fought to play better 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.970
 Brazilians themselves both sides 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.080
 I knew that the last time was Brazil 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.340
 win the world championship 24 years ago 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.220
 I worked hard on myself 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.170
 I gave up many things to 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.100
 be there in favor of my wife was 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.890
 pregnant at that moment 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.730
 we know it is clear 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.180
 in Russia was needed everywhere so that 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.510
 concentrate completely 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.840
 play your car with 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.200
 Romario striker 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.870
 romario and bebeto more perfect 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.040
 combinations that help brazil win this 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.040
 the game can not be imagined 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
 Brazil launched with overwhelming zeal 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.120
 that is, but when the team went out in one 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.990
 sixteenth finals thoughts guys 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.990
 returned to pregnant wife 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.140
 I mentally called york I was very 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.180
 excited 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.000
 but when I'm on the football field I 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.050
 forget everything 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.960
 I think only about my team 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.460
 mates and how can i help brazil in 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.519
 Asia 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.590
 glancing at from brazil faced 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.120
 with the masters of the americans after 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.189
 tough critics and beta scored victorious 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:17.729

 they went to the quarter finals 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.799
 and after the match the kids club appeared 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:23.939
 one reason to celebrate in 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.209
 the hospital he had a son 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.059
 Matios was born the seventh 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:31.389
 I was on the phone and could hear how Matios 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.149
 crying doctor hung up next to him i 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:35.699
 could hear him crying 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:39.149
 at this moment emotions overwhelmed me 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:40.949
 while the fans celebrated the exit 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:42.409
 quarter finals brazil all 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.269
 Tibet's thoughts were on tof 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.779
 to be near your newborn 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.149
 son with whom was for 100 thousand miles from 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.419
 him i was dying to take it on 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.639
 hands cancel it 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.779
 that night on the eve of the match 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.149
 the only thing god didn't ask for 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:59.029
 it give me the opportunity to score in 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.029
 honor of inauguration 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.689
 quarter finals world championship 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.649
 holland vs brazil 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:09.059
 newspaper scene just two days ago at that 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.379
 time as the attacker stepped onto the pitch one 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.439
 of the most important and emotional games in 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.749
 your life piles 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.819

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.039
 the poplars they had really strong 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:23.169
 players the game was incredibly difficult 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.149
 undoubtedly the hardest game of all 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:27.459
 competition time 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.459
 the Dutch have thrown all their forces on the Brazilians 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.899
 m but after the transfer bebeto romario 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.899
 Zagreb 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.489
 then the ball went bebeto and after him 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.209
 and the opportunity they were waiting for I did not give 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.239
 defender then goalkeeper and scored 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.699
 ball in the middle of rocks 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.059
 a son immediately appeared in my head as if I were 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.089
 Kachalova in the hands of Moscow and then I 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:56.829
 looked away and saw 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.339
 we are actively engaged in doing the same 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:02.339
 it was great all of us together 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.739
 I'll submit 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:09.839

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:12.369
 plan 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:14.279
 mood 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:15.969
 so the newspaper welcomed his 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.389
 newborn son his country and the whole world 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.699

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:24.669
 of the year 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.610
 and the celebration everywhere went down in history 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.610
 these leaflets 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.030
 however, nobody meant more than 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.499
 for the person to whom it was dedicated 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:37.650
 Sinar Beta Mathios 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.389
 sometimes when my father and I go somewhere 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.630
 go together people ask and this and 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.790

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.010
 the most incredible and unforgettable 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.580
 in ways
