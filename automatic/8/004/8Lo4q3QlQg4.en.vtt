00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
output from the VMS system so now we're

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.390

going<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.410> show<00:04:47.620> you<00:04:47.650> how<00:04:47.919> we<00:04:47.980> actually

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
going to show you how we actually

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.430 
going to show you how we actually
simulate<00:04:48.880> these<00:04:49.030> inputs<00:04:49.510> into<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.960> BMS

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
simulate these inputs into the BMS

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.100 
simulate these inputs into the BMS
system<00:04:50.890> so<00:04:51.790> from<00:04:52.000> our<00:04:52.150> device<00:04:52.390> under<00:04:52.419> test<00:04:52.870> we

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
system so from our device under test we

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.180 
system so from our device under test we
have<00:04:53.230> a<00:04:53.790> three<00:04:54.790> different<00:04:55.150> sets<00:04:55.390> of<00:04:55.540> leads

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
have a three different sets of leads

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.460 
have a three different sets of leads
which<00:04:57.190> go<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:57.430> our<00:04:57.640> being<00:04:57.880> my<00:04:58.000> test<00:04:58.330> and<00:04:58.600> you

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
which go to our being my test and you

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.060 
which go to our being my test and you
can<00:04:59.620> see<00:04:59.800> here<00:05:01.020> we<00:05:02.020> have<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.380> cell<00:05:02.770> voltage

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
can see here we have the cell voltage

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.550 
can see here we have the cell voltage
simulator<00:05:03.820> lines<00:05:04.180> we<00:05:04.870> have<00:05:04.990> five<00:05:05.230> of<00:05:05.410> them

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.320 
simulator lines we have five of them
connected<00:05:05.980> here<00:05:06.250> we're<00:05:06.400> simulating<00:05:06.700> for

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
connected here we're simulating for

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.750 
connected here we're simulating for
ourselves<00:05:07.770> so<00:05:08.770> if<00:05:08.830> we're<00:05:08.950> going<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.130> tap<00:05:09.430> into

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
ourselves so if we're going to tap into

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.570 
ourselves so if we're going to tap into
the<00:05:09.880> high<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:10.390> low<00:05:10.710> end<00:05:11.710> of<00:05:11.919> that<00:05:12.040> stack<00:05:12.370> of

the high and low end of that stack of

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.950 
the high and low end of that stack of
cell<00:05:12.790> we<00:05:12.970> actually<00:05:13.300> need<00:05:13.450> five<00:05:13.690> different

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960

not using the sense connector here we

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.170 
not using the sense connector here we

have four cells and since this was just

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.969 
have four cells and since this was just
a<00:05:25.270> demonstration<00:05:25.450> we're<00:05:26.260> not<00:05:26.440> too<00:05:26.620> concerned
