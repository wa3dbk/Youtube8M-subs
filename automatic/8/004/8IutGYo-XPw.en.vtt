00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
free out I was in surgery 3 hours and 5

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.930 
free out I was in surgery 3 hours and 5
minutes<00:02:59.610> you<00:03:00.420> know<00:03:00.510> they<00:03:01.170> do<00:03:01.230> about<00:03:01.940> with

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
minutes you know they do about with

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.650 
minutes you know they do about with
their<00:03:03.150> prep<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.930> then<00:03:04.050> after<00:03:04.470> surgery<00:03:05.010> like

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
their prep and then after surgery like

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.360 
their prep and then after surgery like
getting<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.750> breathing<00:03:07.140> tube<00:03:07.410> out<00:03:07.590> waking<00:03:08.070> up

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
getting the breathing tube out waking up

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.729 
getting the breathing tube out waking up
the<00:03:08.850> nurse<00:03:09.300> told<00:03:09.600> me<00:03:09.750> that's<00:03:09.900> about<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.260> half<00:03:10.530> an

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
the nurse told me that's about a half an

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:11.300 
the nurse told me that's about a half an
hour

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
hour

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.690 
hour
so<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.970> actual<00:03:12.540> surgical<00:03:13.350> part<00:03:13.920> was<00:03:14.220> 2<00:03:14.489> hours

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
so the actual surgical part was 2 hours

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.650 
so the actual surgical part was 2 hours
in<00:03:17.600> 32<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.780> half<00:03:18.930> hours<00:03:19.380> roughly<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.660> don't

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
cancer is cancer and that went off to

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.740 
cancer is cancer and that went off to
pathology<00:03:39.799> but<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:41.459> surgeon<00:03:42.000> did<00:03:42.239> tell<00:03:42.510> my

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
pathology but the surgeon did tell my

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.949 
pathology but the surgeon did tell my
family<00:03:43.080> that<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:45.150> looked<00:03:45.630> really<00:03:45.930> good

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
have to go through this I was really

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.130 
have to go through this I was really
really<00:04:17.030> worried<00:04:17.690> about<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:20.570> can't

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
mean at least I could get up and walk

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.500 
mean at least I could get up and walk
around<00:04:32.990> and<00:04:34.090> easily<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.480> in<00:04:35.840> that<00:04:37.330> went<00:04:38.330> to

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
around and easily and in that went to

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.040 
around and easily and in that went to
the<00:04:38.630> bathroom<00:04:39.080> are<00:04:39.380> ready<00:04:39.650> and<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.660> that<00:04:41.660> so
