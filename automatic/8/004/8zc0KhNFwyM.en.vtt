 dual sim of the Taiwanese company we see 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.530
 a little what is then included in 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.890
 packaging a little uncomfortable from 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.860
 April with this card this 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.770
 we are parading it here it is then 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.809
 inside we find the device 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.960
 naturally we remove it then we see a 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.370
 what we still don't have a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.920
 series of chippings concerning a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.770
 micro a quick guide some did 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.150
 on safety and warranty and then 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.600
 The classic classic micro USB USB cable 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.960
 htc charger and in this case more 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.700
 classic non-yamaha model headphones 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.490
 classic and headphones then the model 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.950
 standard 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.600
 the device here it is htc the sun 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.310
 526 g we see it in all his 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.340
 beauty a well a good product I have to 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.319
 say very very nice to see cute 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.329
 repeats the double boxes acate cile 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:35.759
 fronts then we'll see if they work 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.560
 both in let's look 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.359
 review given that sometimes 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.310
 they work only in other voices 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.979
 both work then to understand 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.529
 a moment then we see little above 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.779
 we have the players and a half to the right 

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:50.310
 biagio and the excel volume and shutdown 

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:53.429
 which are confused with the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.490
 microphone phone cover 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.469
 input for lazy cable in series ba 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.359
 left the phone is smooth in the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.429
 rear 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.369
 let's find the 8 camera 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.439
 megapixel with LED flash and more 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.289
 microphone the pressure outlet of the 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:15.480
 flow the htc logo and then this part yes 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.370
 remove the cover is immovable and this 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.000
 because for those inside you go to 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.800
 hide the input for micro sd 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.310
 the entrance for the two micro sims and the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.980
 pure battery of htc battery 2000 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.830
 milly ampere holes by closing instead 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.930
 going then to the part instead 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:39.540
 frontal we find here we are here 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.030

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.819

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:05.910

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.989
 thick a device just came out 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.880
 therefore it was released at the end of March 2015 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.069
 practically just a week ten 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.760
 days ago or what a cross compared to when 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.959

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.200

 rice through in the microsd 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:42.569

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.700
 I remember more TV and dual SIM 3g 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.650

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.600
 give us a few days time to 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.519
 go and test the device and then there 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.590

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.489
