00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
being that way I do like a this map it's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.850 
being that way I do like a this map it's
kind<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.820> its<00:01:00.300> dynamic<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> aspects<00:01:01.980> of

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
kind of its dynamic and the aspects of

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.960 
kind of its dynamic and the aspects of
its<00:01:04.860> vast<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.820> has<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> lot<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.920> Hayes's<00:01:07.970> with

the snow well I guess they're not
Hayes's<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> has<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> lot<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.380> coverage

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.580 
domination if you guys control a and B
and<00:04:09.920> then<00:04:10.730> capture<00:04:11.209> see<00:04:11.450> their<00:04:12.170> spawn

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
and then capture see their spawn

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.390 
and then capture see their spawn
location<00:04:13.190> will<00:04:13.550> change<00:04:14.060> to<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:15.769> far<00:04:16.040> side

over<00:04:16.790> here<00:04:17.000> where<00:04:17.209> I'm<00:04:17.299> aiming<00:04:17.479> at<00:04:17.720> right<00:04:17.989> now

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
over here where I'm aiming at right now

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.580 
over here where I'm aiming at right now
in<00:04:18.560> that<00:04:18.680> little<00:04:19.160> generator<00:04:19.940> area<00:04:20.450> nine<00:04:21.380> times

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
in that little generator area nine times

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.860 
in that little generator area nine times
out<00:04:21.799> of<00:04:21.859> ten<00:04:21.950> their<00:04:22.669> spawn<00:04:23.210> will<00:04:23.450> turn<00:04:23.720> into

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
out of ten their spawn will turn into

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.950 
out of ten their spawn will turn into
that<00:04:24.020> so<00:04:24.950> keep<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:25.580> in<00:04:25.760> mind<00:04:26.060> if<00:04:26.330> your<00:04:26.750> team
