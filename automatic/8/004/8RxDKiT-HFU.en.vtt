clock<00:02:10.619> speed<00:02:10.800> up<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.390> 2.1<00:02:12.390> 60<00:02:12.720> Hertz

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
clock speed up to 2.1 60 Hertz

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.100 
clock speed up to 2.1 60 Hertz
I<00:02:13.709> mean<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.640> something<00:02:15.209> really<00:02:15.959> really

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
I mean that is something really really

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.280 
I mean that is something really really
killer<00:02:16.530> there<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.250> also<00:02:18.239> this<00:02:18.629> chip<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.049> great

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
killer there so also this chip is great

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.490 
killer there so also this chip is great
for<00:02:19.709> delivering<00:02:20.430> solid<00:02:20.879> performance<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.750> it

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
for delivering solid performance and it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.890 
for delivering solid performance and it
comes<00:02:22.739> with<00:02:22.829> a<00:02:23.010> 2gb<00:02:23.189> of<00:02:23.430> RAM<00:02:23.760> option<00:02:24.209> which<00:02:24.750> is

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
comes with a 2gb of RAM option which is

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.110 
comes with a 2gb of RAM option which is
reasonable<00:02:25.560> amount<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.069> allows<00:02:26.370> some

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
reasonable amount that allows some

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.839 
reasonable amount that allows some
flexibility<00:02:27.840> with<00:02:27.959> multitasking<00:02:28.799> now<00:02:29.250> if<00:02:29.640> you

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
flexibility with multitasking now if you

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.270 
flexibility with multitasking now if you
are<00:02:29.970> wondering<00:02:30.239> about<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.379> storage<00:02:31.709> option

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
are wondering about the storage option

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.220 
are wondering about the storage option
you<00:02:32.790> will<00:02:32.939> not<00:02:33.120> have<00:02:33.359> to<00:02:33.480> vary<00:02:33.750> about<00:02:33.989> that

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
you will not have to vary about that

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.530 
you will not have to vary about that
because<00:02:34.379> 64<00:02:35.040> gigabyte<00:02:35.340> internal<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:36.030> you

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
because 64 gigabyte internal and you

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.170 
because 64 gigabyte internal and you
also<00:02:36.689> have<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.140> option<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.560> plug<00:02:37.859> in<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.250> 128

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
also have the option to plug in and 128

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.660 
also have the option to plug in and 128
