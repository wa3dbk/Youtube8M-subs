food grade 5 gallon bucket and so now we

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.900 
food grade 5 gallon bucket and so now we
are<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.859> drill<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> hole<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> bucket

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
are going to drill a hole in the bucket

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.490 
are going to drill a hole in the bucket
and<00:00:31.520> there's<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.910> know<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.030> seam<00:00:33.450> here<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:34.440> you

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and there's you know a seam here so you

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.900 
and there's you know a seam here so you
want<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.130> get<00:00:35.899> your<00:00:36.899> hole<00:00:37.290> about<00:00:37.860> an<00:00:38.070> inch<00:00:38.430> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
want to get your hole about an inch and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.420 
want to get your hole about an inch and
a<00:00:39.030> half<00:00:39.059> above<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:41.730> bottom<00:00:42.239> seam<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.649> that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
a half above the bottom seam and that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.200 
a half above the bottom seam and that
will<00:00:44.730> allow<00:00:44.969> sediment<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:46.020> settle<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.309> won't

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
will allow sediment to settle and won't

00:00:48.210 --> 00:01:05.950 
will allow sediment to settle and won't
come<00:00:48.750> through<00:00:49.320> then<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:59.180> pressure

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.980 

might<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> little<00:01:07.380> bit<00:01:07.530> easier<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
might be a little bit easier with a

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:25.249 
might be a little bit easier with a
power<00:01:09.990> drill<00:01:18.950> closer<00:01:21.290> there<00:01:22.400> finally<00:01:24.259> we've

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
power drill closer there finally we've

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:33.260 
power drill closer there finally we've
got<00:01:25.290> our<00:01:25.799> full<00:01:29.420> punch<00:01:30.420> through<00:01:31.970> took<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> little

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
got our full punch through took a little

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.789 
got our full punch through took a little
bit<00:01:33.390> more<00:01:33.600> work<00:01:34.490> than<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.579> thought<00:01:36.350> ok<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.650> so

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
bit more work than I thought ok and so

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.830 
bit more work than I thought ok and so
I'm<00:01:37.920> using<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.340> file<00:01:40.100> just<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:43.640> deeper

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
I'm using this file just to deeper

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.680 
I'm using this file just to deeper
which<00:01:46.840> they<00:01:47.170> suggested<00:01:47.800> do<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.130> prevent

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
which they suggested do to prevent

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.050 
which they suggested do to prevent
leakage<00:01:49.690> I<00:01:49.900> don't<00:01:50.050> know<00:01:50.110> if<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:51.250> is<00:01:51.760> the

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
leakage I don't know if this is the

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.390 
leakage I don't know if this is the
right<00:01:52.240> size<00:01:52.510> file<00:01:52.870> or<00:01:53.350> this<00:01:53.620> is<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.920> best<00:01:54.130> way

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
right size file or this is the best way

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.590 
right size file or this is the best way
check<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:54.940> out

metals so be aware of this it's for

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:06.110 
metals so be aware of this it's for
microbial<00:04:02.239> contamination<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:04.590> before<00:04:05.159> you

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
microbial contamination so before you

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.910 
microbial contamination so before you
fill<00:04:06.329> your<00:04:06.510> bucket<00:04:06.750> with<00:04:07.260> your<00:04:07.409> dirty<00:04:07.620> water

fill your bucket with your dirty water

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:16.779 
fill your bucket with your dirty water
you'll<00:04:08.909> want<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.409> screw<00:04:11.120> your<00:04:12.120> filter<00:04:14.269> onto

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
you'll want to screw your filter onto

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.080 
you'll want to screw your filter onto
the<00:04:17.789> fitting<00:04:18.479> on<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.870> end<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.199> your<00:04:19.260> hose<00:04:19.590> and

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
the fitting on the end of your hose and

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.390 
the fitting on the end of your hose and
that<00:04:21.090> screws<00:04:21.479> on<00:04:21.660> very<00:04:21.930> easily<00:04:22.260> so<00:04:22.979> let's<00:04:23.160> see

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
that screws on very easily so let's see

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.890 
that screws on very easily so let's see
how<00:04:23.580> this<00:04:23.789> works<00:04:24.150> or<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.870> water<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:29.750> let<00:04:30.750> you

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
how this works or the water and let you

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.490 
how this works or the water and let you
terminate<00:04:31.440> it<00:04:31.620> water<00:04:32.389> goes<00:04:33.389> in<00:04:33.660> that<00:04:33.900> way<00:04:34.169> and

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
terminate it water goes in that way and

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.490 
terminate it water goes in that way and
of<00:04:34.650> course<00:04:35.010> you<00:04:35.910> want<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.449> clean<00:04:36.889> receptacle<00:04:37.970> to

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
of course you want a clean receptacle to

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:50.350 
of course you want a clean receptacle to
catch<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:41.100> flow<00:04:47.660> more<00:04:48.660> there<00:04:49.020> there's<00:04:49.380> my<00:04:49.710> cat

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
catch the flow more there there's my cat

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.439 
catch the flow more there there's my cat
I'm<00:04:51.360> gonna<00:04:51.510> check<00:04:51.870> out<00:04:52.760> what<00:04:53.760> is<00:04:53.940> going<00:04:54.300> on

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
I'm gonna check out what is going on

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:02.379 
I'm gonna check out what is going on
anyway<00:04:55.289> you<00:04:55.350> can<00:04:56.210> see<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.630> flow<00:05:00.199> as<00:05:01.199> my<00:05:01.500> cat

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
anyway you can see the flow as my cat

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:13.439 
anyway you can see the flow as my cat
now<00:05:03.389> has<00:05:03.599> lost<00:05:03.840> interest

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.510 

when<00:05:14.449> you<00:05:14.599> fill<00:05:14.840> up<00:05:14.930> your<00:05:14.960> receptacle<00:05:15.889> you'll

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
when you fill up your receptacle you'll

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.510 
when you fill up your receptacle you'll
want<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.210> clip<00:05:17.900> this<00:05:18.110> up<00:05:18.410> pretty<00:05:18.770> quick<00:05:19.250> so<00:05:19.490> you

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
want to clip this up pretty quick so you

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.909 
want to clip this up pretty quick so you
don't<00:05:19.789> get<00:05:20.509> any<00:05:20.660> water<00:05:21.669> around<00:05:22.669> and<00:05:22.909> then<00:05:23.919> and

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
don't get any water around and then and

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.490 
don't get any water around and then and
that's<00:05:25.129> pretty<00:05:25.370> easy<00:05:25.490> and<00:05:26.419> hold<00:05:26.659> it<00:05:26.810> upward

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
that's pretty easy and hold it upward

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.670 
that's pretty easy and hold it upward
and<00:05:27.889> then<00:05:28.460> you<00:05:29.180> have<00:05:29.360> your<00:05:29.569> handy<00:05:30.139> little<00:05:30.319> hook

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
and then you have your handy little hook

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.089 
and then you have your handy little hook
which<00:05:31.520> fits<00:05:32.389> right<00:05:32.659> over<00:05:33.139> the<00:05:33.319> top<00:05:33.560> of<00:05:33.830> this

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
which fits right over the top of this

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:38.920 
which fits right over the top of this
and<00:05:35.199> you<00:05:36.199> snap<00:05:36.650> it<00:05:36.860> in<00:05:37.039> and<00:05:37.370> then<00:05:38.330> you<00:05:38.539> can<00:05:38.750> just

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
and you snap it in and then you can just

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.129 
and you snap it in and then you can just
hook<00:05:39.400> your<00:05:40.400> filter<00:05:40.849> right<00:05:41.180> on<00:05:41.479> to<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:41.840> edge<00:05:41.930> of

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
hook your filter right on to the edge of

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.619 
hook your filter right on to the edge of
the<00:05:42.199> bucket<00:05:42.379> and<00:05:43.039> there<00:05:43.849> you<00:05:44.000> have<00:05:44.030> it

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629 
the bucket and there you have it

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:49.540 
the bucket and there you have it
the<00:05:45.110> sp1<00:05:45.740> 8:1<00:05:46.550> all-in-one<00:05:47.650> filter<00:05:48.650> by<00:05:49.190> Sawyer

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
the sp1 8:1 all-in-one filter by Sawyer

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.379 
the sp1 8:1 all-in-one filter by Sawyer
so<00:05:49.909> now<00:05:50.090> I<00:05:50.120> am<00:05:50.539> going<00:05:50.780> to<00:05:51.169> demonstrate<00:05:52.360> how<00:05:53.360> to

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
so now I am going to demonstrate how to

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.249 
so now I am going to demonstrate how to
use<00:05:53.690> the<00:05:54.409> squeeze<00:05:55.509> filtration<00:05:56.509> system<00:05:57.080> with

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
use the squeeze filtration system with

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.779 
use the squeeze filtration system with
your<00:05:57.560> Sawyer<00:05:58.310> squeeze<00:05:58.759> felt<00:05:59.150> you'll<00:05:59.389> want<00:05:59.720> to

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
your Sawyer squeeze felt you'll want to

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:06.640 
your Sawyer squeeze felt you'll want to
first<00:06:02.590> put<00:06:03.590> your<00:06:03.620> dirty<00:06:04.250> water<00:06:04.580> and<00:06:05.349> into<00:06:06.349> your

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
first put your dirty water and into your

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.959 
first put your dirty water and into your
squeeze<00:06:06.979> and<00:06:07.250> if<00:06:07.340> you're<00:06:07.490> in<00:06:07.580> the<00:06:07.699> field

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:07.969 
squeeze and if you're in the field

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.110 
squeeze and if you're in the field
sometimes<00:06:08.810> it's<00:06:09.169> very<00:06:09.229> difficult<00:06:09.500> to<00:06:10.400> you

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
sometimes it's very difficult to you

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.899 
sometimes it's very difficult to you
know<00:06:11.150> actually<00:06:11.780> fill<00:06:12.169> this<00:06:12.199> from<00:06:12.949> standing

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:13.909 
know actually fill this from standing

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:17.469 
know actually fill this from standing
water<00:06:14.180> it<00:06:15.020> just<00:06:15.409> does<00:06:15.620> not<00:06:15.650> fill<00:06:16.159> up<00:06:16.210> all<00:06:17.210> the

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
water it just does not fill up all the

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.260 
water it just does not fill up all the
way<00:06:17.659> so<00:06:17.990> it's<00:06:18.740> much<00:06:19.009> easier<00:06:19.639> if<00:06:19.880> you<00:06:19.909> have<00:06:20.240> a

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
way so it's much easier if you have a

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.879 
way so it's much easier if you have a
kind<00:06:20.630> of<00:06:21.069> container<00:06:22.069> that<00:06:22.310> you<00:06:22.669> can<00:06:23.000> pour<00:06:23.930> your

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
kind of container that you can pour your

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.450 
kind of container that you can pour your
water<00:06:25.159> into<00:06:26.150> the<00:06:26.810> squeeze<00:06:27.110> bag<00:06:27.590> the

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
water into the squeeze bag the

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.730 
water into the squeeze bag the
waterfalls<00:06:29.090> are<00:06:29.479> fast<00:06:30.229> flowing<00:06:31.090> creeks<00:06:32.740> you

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
waterfalls are fast flowing creeks you

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.129 
waterfalls are fast flowing creeks you
might<00:06:33.919> have<00:06:34.099> easier<00:06:34.969> time<00:06:35.240> just<00:06:35.659> spilling<00:06:35.930> it

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
might have easier time just spilling it

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:41.580 
might have easier time just spilling it
straight<00:06:36.500> and<00:06:36.800> I<00:06:37.190> all<00:06:38.060> you<00:06:38.300> have<00:06:38.449> to<00:06:38.569> do<00:06:38.779> now<00:06:39.740> is

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
straight and I all you have to do now is

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.159 
straight and I all you have to do now is
screw<00:06:43.300> your<00:06:44.979> filter<00:06:45.979> right<00:06:46.340> onto<00:06:46.699> the<00:06:46.819> top

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
screw your filter right onto the top

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:53.800 
screw your filter right onto the top
okay<00:06:48.169> so<00:06:48.229> once<00:06:49.090> you<00:06:50.090> have<00:06:50.779> your<00:06:51.789> bag<00:06:52.789> filled<00:06:53.599> up

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810 
okay so once you have your bag filled up

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.420 
okay so once you have your bag filled up
and<00:06:54.139> your<00:06:54.409> filter<00:06:55.250> screwed<00:06:56.120> on<00:06:56.300> the<00:06:56.479> top<00:06:57.430> take

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
and your filter screwed on the top take
