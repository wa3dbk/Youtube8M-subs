00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.180
 Huawei had April 15 marked in 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:13.400
 the calendar as the date on which we 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:15.320
 would show his new huawei of 8 the p 8 goes 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.810
 to be the new flagship of Huawei 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.820
 for this 2015 in our first 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.980
 impressions we find ourselves with a 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.260
 terminal that has been able to take advantage of 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.460
 maximum its frontal space and with 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.060
 very thin frames 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.650
 integrates a lightweight 52-inch panel and 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.449
 with quality finishes 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.769
 the manufacturer shows that it is 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.069
 learning to make devices 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:39.710
 premium by leaps and bounds clear that 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:41.659
 there are still details that polish like 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.449
 physical buttons that look somewhat soft 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:47.120
 With four colors available the design 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.399
 is another of the aspects that stand out 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.289
 despite the possible similarities that 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.109
 You can find other options 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.420
 market is about the performance we've already 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.969
 seen that his full hd screen was 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.729
 added a cool 930 kirin software 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.660
 developed by the company itself that 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.560
 has 8 cores cortex 53 of 64 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.060
 bits 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.100
 a gpu of 628 with those data doubt the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.289
 performance does not make sense in a 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.320
 high-end terminal operation 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:21.079
 It is fast and fluid and it seems that it is very 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.539
 it's still a good choice as 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.580
 aesthetically pleasing software layer 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.250
 ordered with many options 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.140
 personalization and background lollipop 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.509
 like that though 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.360
 Huawei pushes too much services 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.130
 which include with respect to the camera one of 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.530
 the strongest news of this 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.350
 terminal we find a sensor 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.580
 which has four colors 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.220
 Image stabilizer and a chip 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.259
 separate for the processing itself of the 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.420
 images is soon to take off 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.729
 conclusions but for ours 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.920
 It seems that it will not disappoint although there will be 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.069
 to analyze to see if it reaches the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.229
 height or not of others already contrasted 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.569
 no doubt pe 8 means a good 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.970
 start of the manufacturer it seems that 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.670
 this year it will be able to 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.890
 compete in the high end with a design 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.600
 attractive and that yes some unknowns 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.420
 still the truth is that Huawei 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.250
 is positioned as a manufacturer to have 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.250
 into account this 2015
