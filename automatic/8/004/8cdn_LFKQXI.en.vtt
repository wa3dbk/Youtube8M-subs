the way there you go now you got

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.699 
the way there you go now you got
negative<00:01:59.539> that's<00:02:00.539> it<00:02:00.750> here<00:02:00.959> for<00:02:01.140> X<00:02:01.289> and<00:02:03.709> back

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
negative that's it here for X and back

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.199 
negative that's it here for X and back
over<00:02:05.009> here<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:07.700> think<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.759> need<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:08.940> some

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
over here I think we need to some

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.280 
over here I think we need to some
tweaking<00:02:09.630> on<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> doing<00:02:14.900> excellent<00:02:15.900> work<00:02:15.930> doing

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
speed air is bringing up to four

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:37.970 
speed air is bringing up to four
stations<00:02:24.599> make<00:02:24.750> them<00:02:30.290> excellent<00:02:31.290> work<00:02:36.980> ok

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
stations make them excellent work ok

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.440 
stations make them excellent work ok
we'll<00:02:38.160> stop<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.519> per<00:02:38.790> second<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.180> then<00:02:39.329> we

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
we'll stop that per second and then we

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.240 
we'll stop that per second and then we
left<00:02:39.690> should<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.500> quick<00:02:40.769> go<00:02:40.920> as<00:02:41.100> well
