for<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.400> and<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.180> way<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.510> develop<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.400> an

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
for that and and way to develop it an

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.220 
for that and and way to develop it an
exercise<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.880> do<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.120> play<00:02:12.360> simply<00:02:12.720> play<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.960> bar

exercise I do is play simply play a bar

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.770 
exercise I do is play simply play a bar
chord<00:02:13.530> but<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.820> finger<00:02:15.210> at<00:02:15.300> one<00:02:15.450> note<00:02:15.630> at<00:02:15.750> a

chord but but finger at one note at a

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.830 
chord but but finger at one note at a
time<00:02:15.810> instead<00:02:17.090> instead<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.390> like<00:02:18.570> that

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
time instead instead of like that

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.960 
time instead instead of like that
holding<00:02:19.320> all<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.530> notes<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:19.860> play<00:02:20.820> them

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
holding all the notes I play them

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:31.640 
holding all the notes I play them
separately<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:29.280> my<00:02:29.400> hand<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:30.590> playing<00:02:31.590> a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
separately so my hand is is playing a

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.050 
separately so my hand is is playing a
note<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.070> letting<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.430> off<00:02:32.610> with<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.940> left

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
note and letting it off with the left

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.000 
note and letting it off with the left
hand<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:34.320> course<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.590> right<00:02:34.680> hand<00:02:34.890> just

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
hand and of course the right hand just

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.130 
hand and of course the right hand just
keeps<00:02:35.280> on<00:02:35.370> chugging<00:02:35.580> alternate<00:02:36.570> on<00:02:36.780> every

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
keeps on chugging alternate on every

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.400 
keeps on chugging alternate on every
note<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:37.620> down<00:02:37.860> up<00:02:38.130> down<00:02:38.340> up<00:02:38.400> even<00:02:39.210> though

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
note so it's down up down up even though

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.410 
note so it's down up down up even though
you're<00:02:40.410> you're<00:02:40.680> playing<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.940> next<00:02:42.090> string

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
you're you're playing the next string

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.880 
you're you're playing the next string
you're<00:02:42.570> playing<00:02:42.840> maybe<00:02:43.080> in<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.440> opposite

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
you're playing maybe in the opposite

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.730 
you're playing maybe in the opposite
direction<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.340> your<00:02:44.550> pick<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.910> going<00:02:45.740> that's

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
direction that your pick is going that's

00:02:46.740 --> 00:03:07.460 
direction that your pick is going that's
why<00:02:47.040> they<00:02:47.160> call<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.370> alternate<00:02:48.000> picking<00:03:06.470> stuff

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
why they call it alternate picking stuff

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.710 
why they call it alternate picking stuff
like<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.890> it's<00:03:08.790> good<00:03:09.000> for<00:03:09.270> you<00:03:09.420> it's<00:03:09.450> like

like that it's good for you it's like

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.160 
like that it's good for you it's like
vitamins<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.320> know<00:03:11.090> it's<00:03:12.090> good<00:03:12.330> for<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.660> what
