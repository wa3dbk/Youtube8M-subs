00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.629
 military because it was actually 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.840

 mendonÃ§a Duarte two years 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.520
 the weather was tense because the accident 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:59.990
 with the castor beans of the family 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.990
 The document also 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:09.380
 but it was another intense day 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.660
 concentration of military police does not 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.270
 smiled at the place and saw the towel when 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.530
 pastorinhas units so as Opel 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.530
 go to the village 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.649
 You know you've seen it here now that it was 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.960
 from sbt 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.469
 the national newspaper of the globe network and the tj 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.750
 Brazil's sbt the journalist leaf 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:36.170

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.719
 to pronounce my vote at will without 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.569
 I doubt the here now that unfortunately 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.369
 I've been feeling sbt programming 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.439
 the newspaper that on May 20 would 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.329

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:53.359
 mistake and do school today nowadays 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.640
 national newspaper which may present themselves 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:58.909
 as the vehicle of citizenship here now 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.819
 who started this work here now 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.590
 has made all other broadcasters 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.369
 changed the posture of the redoubt reporters 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.470
 changed the position of publishers of 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.720
 presenters I think it's a one vote 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.989
 hence now if foreseeing vain vote 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:21.230
 show the beautiful garden by the imprint is 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.730
 opinionated journalism and charisma 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.579
 boris casoy 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.170

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.549
 in the national newspaper 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.590
 one vote for national newspaper the question 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.359
 tied for a new meeting for the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.470
 here now to get brazil 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:48.919
 ailton almeida I think the newspaper 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.260
 national but what really changed my 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:54.620
 vote to is protected brazil by 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.569
 credibility by the look of the dove with the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.620
 and the empathy he has with the 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.660
 viewer or in the news and 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.150
 people believe in them is very 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.340
 important a newspaper even credibility 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.810
 my vote is provisional and for dj brazil 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.810
 Brazilians hurt 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.989
 this arrangement does not not may be a 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.129
 strong candidate for the press prize 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.879
 next year 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:24.659
 I decided 96 the tj Brazil because of boris 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:29.540
 who has to give the girl an opinionated tone 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.540
 pj brasil greater involves the fatima 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.109
 I have great respect for the 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.469
 boris casoy I think it 's better 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.879
 very credible presenter 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.680
 very credible professional 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.079
 but we are voting in the newspaper 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.510
 certainly I think tj had their 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.769
 big moments and 96 but I think the 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.079
 national newspaper 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.799
 overall performed better 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:55.530
 all year then my vote is that 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:58.139
 jonas national pj journal 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.629
 brazil three games so far in rockwell 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:05.010
 paulo ricardo held the newspaper the day 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:07.199
 which one connected a jn really changed 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.790
 enough because there is one now 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.430
 social concern 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.870
 the here has now been much copied by 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.639
 other stations, right? 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.070
 Unfortunately it went out of the air but I'm staying. 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.109
 with boris tj brasil na at 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.139
 credibility of his independence 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.669
 autonomy in wire with tj brasil four 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.669
 laps to pj barrel 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.449
 I really like do you very much 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.509
 boris I think so the best shot 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:39.509
 anchor in Brazilian journalism 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:41.099
 he has opinions very well placed and 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.479
 He is free to speak what he does well. 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:46.070
 you see 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:50.070
 but considering the team considering the 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.770
 Work is global, I get a newspaper. 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.690
 national newspaper national 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.419
 Brazil bought a vote here now one 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.370
 vote was abraham it's your turn, just open it 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.960
 a good one I had the pleasure of integrating 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.789
 The staff are from here now which was really 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.770
 a television news program that revolutionized 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.569
 language of journalism in Brazilian TV 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.669
 I think it was even sending a hug from the 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.770
 colleagues and represent fulfilled their 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.530
 beautifully mission on the news on 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.240
 a cycle and j Brazil boris casoy I think 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.460
 that made everyone else 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.620
 television networks to regain credibility 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.150
 everyone was inspired by it and also 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.009
 something has changed the television news 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.930
 began to have consistency 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.729
 Now I think the national newspaper 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.889
 entrance of evandro carlos de andrade in 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.870
 direction has really revolutionized because 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.550
 national newspaper it could be complete 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.800
 level of information but often 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.330
 he lacked credibility of the people in 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.020
 time to vote everybody preferred boris 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.759
 I'm married 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.889
 tj brazil precisely because it was the 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:42.840
 your independence voice of freedom with 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.300
 this change the national newspaper 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.789
 reacquired personality has a line 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.800
 editorial has position regarding the 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.080
 great national affairs this is very 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.030
 important and more than that went into 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.710
 line of complaint and is helping to 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.630
 take the mask off Brazil so the 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.080
 national daily vocational global home 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.080
 from santa 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.430
 the vote for the here now lacks the 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.590
 two jurors are missing two jurors to osce 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.910
 corners and please it 's your turn pink 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.800
 he looks I think here now 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.300
 really has a great importance I 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.150
 I think he influenced the news 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.440
 that began to get more loose 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.020
 popular 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:25.010
 I think it's wonderful Brazil is 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.660
 a great super journalist is emphatic 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.490
 not that he talks we believe with 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.410
 who is speaking but the national newspaper 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.720
 awakened from a sleep that he was 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.660
 having for a long time he began to 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.820
 make complaints that influenced to 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.310
 start a process and face others 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.660
 journalists and other bodies that I 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.910
 I think it is no longer national. 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.680
 achieving is to have the role that he always 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.600
 should have had from the beginning then 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.700
 my vote is from the national newspaper in front 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.380
 the national newspaper with five votes to 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.500
 four laps to arrive in brazil 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:57.080
 vote for the here now let's stop 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:01.010
 the so gomes pinto the last blow to 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.780
 decision I like too much beyond the lamb 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.830
 in today independent of where he 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.750
 is 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:10.580
 I say this to like it but I vote it 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.950
 of course the national newspaper 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.380
 I'm more complete the final product is 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:20.060
 much more much more built than 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:23.300
 tj brazil and can have an opinion is 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.940
 relative because the national newspaper counts 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.100
 the stories we need to know the 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.910
 not reaction newspaper but the relationship of 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:35.540
 magazine died no one sleeps without seeing the 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:38.230
 compulsory national newspaper not only then 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:41.260
 national newspaper the best newspaper 

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.210
 in 1991 while for the maracanÃ£ 

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.930
 reach to steal the vote from Brazil 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.930
 to the here now
