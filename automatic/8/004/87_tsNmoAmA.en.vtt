00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.600
 I read 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.129
 captain of the event 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.679
 paper smoke 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.869
 Brazilian version let's see 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.229
 I'll catch up to six games 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.500
 fire in the library 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.500
 really enjoyed 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.150
 is this from having already seen everything in life is a kindness of everything I've seen 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.480
 what else has risen 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.080
 enough 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.740
 that's right 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.740
 it's not he's clear 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.870
 once I saw a tv show where the doctor asked him 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.940
 cool 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.150
 if the customer 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.780
 the architect 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.990
 there can be no mess 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.820
 and it will take weeks maybe months to tie 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.700
 after cycling on orkut we are talking about a battalion of trucks and 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.460
 employees of the city in August, the country works without counting the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.640
 time it will take to rebuild all children with no goal goals and 100 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.640
 free and with no right weight 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.530
 knows that I like to make the cells 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.090
 arrested the author to autograph and then seeing on the current internet 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.090
 the only problem is to sell over the internet you have to wait for the boss 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.090
 of the individual arrive by mail 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.900
 in 2003 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.220
 in February
