already separated from his mom and it

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.840 
already separated from his mom and it

was better for him to have a home at
that<00:00:18.029> age<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:19.020> best<00:00:19.320> not<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.010> they

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
that age it's best not to do that they

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.679 
that age it's best not to do that they
need<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.670> with<00:00:20.820> their<00:00:20.970> moms<00:00:21.180> until<00:00:21.539> they're

8<00:00:21.930> weeks<00:00:22.199> old<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.640> be<00:00:23.730> truthful<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
8 weeks old but to be truthful the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.759 
8 weeks old but to be truthful the
reason<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.750> he's<00:00:24.900> potty-trained<00:00:25.470> at<00:00:25.590> nine

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
reason that he's potty-trained at nine

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.650 
reason that he's potty-trained at nine
weeks<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.340> because<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.730> got<00:00:26.910> him<00:00:27.119> at<00:00:27.210> six<00:00:27.449> weeks

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
weeks is because I got him at six weeks

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.080 
weeks is because I got him at six weeks
otherwise<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.859> would<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.130> 11<00:00:29.519> weeks<00:00:29.730> or<00:00:29.939> so

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
otherwise it would be 11 weeks or so

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.730 
otherwise it would be 11 weeks or so
before<00:00:30.300> he<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.810> were<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.230> right

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
before he and I were on the right

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.410 
before he and I were on the right
but<00:00:31.949> 11<00:00:32.309> weeks<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.669> certainly<00:00:33.059> nothing<00:00:33.239> to

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
but 11 weeks is certainly nothing to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.770 
but 11 weeks is certainly nothing to
scoff<00:00:33.780> at<00:00:34.370> so<00:00:35.370> how<00:00:35.700> often<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:36.180> puppies<00:00:36.510> need<00:00:36.690> to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
scoff at so how often do puppies need to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.280 
scoff at so how often do puppies need to
potty

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
potty

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.190 
potty
well<00:00:37.410> puppies<00:00:37.739> their<00:00:38.160> party<00:00:38.520> machines<00:00:39.200> what

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
well puppies their party machines what

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.790 
well puppies their party machines what
goes<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.190> contingent<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.210> comes<00:00:42.480> out

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
goes in is contingent to what comes out

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.740 
goes in is contingent to what comes out
so<00:00:43.800> if<00:00:44.219> you're<00:00:44.460> leaving<00:00:44.910> food<00:00:45.149> out<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.629> them

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
so if you're leaving food out for them

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.080 
so if you're leaving food out for them
all<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.350> time<00:00:46.550> chances<00:00:47.550> are<00:00:47.760> they're

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
all of the time chances are they're

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.869 
all of the time chances are they're
going<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.510> need<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> potty<00:00:49.050> more<00:00:49.440> often<00:00:49.950> so

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
going to need to potty more often so

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.729 
going to need to potty more often so
when<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.180> puppies<00:00:51.480> need<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> pee<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.410> need<00:00:52.620> to

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
when do puppies need to pee they need to

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.200 
when do puppies need to pee they need to
pee<00:00:52.920> first<00:00:53.250> thing<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> morning<00:00:53.940> when<00:00:54.059> they

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
pee first thing in the morning when they

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.299 
pee first thing in the morning when they
wake<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:55.199> when<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:55.620> wake<00:00:55.890> up<00:00:56.100> not

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
wake up that's when they wake up not

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.580 
wake up that's when they wake up not
necessarily<00:00:57.120> when<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.420> wake<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
necessarily when you wake up in the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.200 
necessarily when you wake up in the
middle<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> night<00:00:59.370> depending<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.059> their

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
middle of the night depending on their

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.389 
middle of the night depending on their
age<00:01:00.239> every<00:01:00.899> two<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.260> four<00:01:01.289> hours<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
age every two to four hours so the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.130 
age every two to four hours so the
younger<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.149> your<00:01:03.270> puppy<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.930> more
