00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.520
 I am posting a cancer production video is a cancer pattern 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:12.930
 This time is completed in this corner 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.930
 I think that New Year's Day would like to add more paintings to early- type parts 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:24.080
 In a little way when the wipe is doing Mead is it in the last corner here. 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.870
 I finished stretching it and making it feel good 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:34.370
 It will be a party of gun tank 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:39.140
 So this time, this part of the tank or later, I mainly moved to this part of the understanding part here 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:42.130
 I would like to do a dirty painting 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:48.040
 First of all the mimicry parts here 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:53.890
 A little stiff in the soil since the condition in which the solid fill in the now flat ground to the outside of the part 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.550
 It looks like it's attached, but it's a few issues. It looks like chocolate. 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.140
 I don't know 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:03.590
 I want to paint from the top because I want to put out the shade of color a little here 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.370
 It is here to paint 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.800
 It is color clear my house cut Bragg 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:15.090
 It is a red brown paint that mixes here 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:19.450
 I'm making it here now, so from above 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.810
 I think that I want to paint in the feeling that the color of the base can be seen a little 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:27.490
 This new year 's wind is so high 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.800
 It is either this little recessed portion even though irregularities are Is not it mean that the firm 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.290
 Here 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.870
 Although are many you can paint to feel night 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:39.490
 1 year old little 4 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.940
 It feels like putting on the entire surface with a fan 3 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.409
 While leaving the color of the base 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.560
 In the recessed part 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.560
 I would like to paint it like I put it in 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:07.710
 It was painted so that shades of this kind of color came out like it was not when it was all one 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:13.020
 I think there is only a little sense of unity 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:16.420
 Once So I think that I want to paint a single that would thigh in the here painting has been completed 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.960
 I want to wait for a while until the paint dries 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.550
 This paint was Kawachi 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.730
 It turned out to be something like this 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.440
 I'm a little bit tired 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.440
 Color motor is about 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.740
 Now it is seen to move it is the form of parts 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.540
 Hmm 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:43.019
 I think this area will be gone because there is a matte later 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:47.050
 In addition, this three-dimensional part and the part of this tank will be included in this lower part. 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.490
 I think that I want to pile it is the color of the volley father 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.860
 At first a 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.830
 Dessert yellow 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:58.290
 Using these three colors in flat pressure red brown 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.569
 I tried to make this kind of feeling 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.350
 this 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.410
 I think that I would like to paint on this part 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:11.540
 First really thin Anou 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:14.380
 Thin sky immediately because there is a sex the When You're fails paint and wants code at a time 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.380
 I think I want to paint 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.790
 Eh painting is complete so 8 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.410
 It's a little bit difficult, but there is also a feeling that I've failed a little. 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.280
 It turned out to be something like this 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:44.260
 As it was a little bit new, I can't get used to brush easily and it looks like this 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.720
 The part that I understand is like this 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.460
 Some of the upper upper body part also in this 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.870
 I put the car color 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:59.000
 So I want to put in some bright colors 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:04.700
 I think that I want to kinda make mix back from 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.880
 Then I think it's a little white, and I want to add the brighter colors from above 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.880
 I will 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:25.960
 Finally it is here flat black and red brown 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.280
 We made a darker brown mix here 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.009
 Here 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.750
 Further added to the restless Tsu door 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:39.529
 I think that I want to put a sense of unity or rather put a shadow 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:43.659
 Do something similar to the sense of putting in some way 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.659
 I think this kana sense of unity comes out 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.080
 Painting is complete 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.100
 Well then 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.689
 It failed in one word 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.270
 Hmmm 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:03.270
 No 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.490
 It's a failure, so it's great 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.080
 That is 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:12.610
 Well say something is paint too ne 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.340
 I have painted too much like this 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.750
 There is something quite 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.660
 High 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.350
 It's a good idea if you have a paint 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.350
 Naa was wreck 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:29.189
 The part of the track is like this 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:33.490
 Perhaps because I am not familiar way after all than say soiled It is something this Saturday 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:38.340
 A lot of marks of the brush are attached 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.340
 I think I became to feel say was hanging medium 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.720
 difficult 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:47.340
 It is really difficult to do weathering that we use painting like this with brush painting 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.030
 Is it 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:54.160
 I already did this for the first time 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.810
 It is a feeling that the lack of experience was exposed 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:03.960
 I will really go if I'm sorry 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:05.950
 As this upper part of the body is going to be quite quiet relatively 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:13.340
 But 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:15.680
 Quite Kedomo It is part of the lower I wanted to do with the other little high-Hour color 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.440
 Even while painting 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.820
 Let's go thinking while thinking 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:24.070
 It becomes quite thick coating 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:28.600
 It was a big deal 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:34.510
 This is also a experience 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:35.230
 Not after all's go try and do you think this Nde valid work well people from the beginning to do it yourself 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:42.670
 Because 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:44.060
 Let's learn more from school failure and learn more from school failure 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.919
 I will 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:51.360
 Next time I put a seal because there is also a part where I will put a seal on this side or after this 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:54.710
 A lot of things 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.710
 I think that I want to do it after this 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.620
 I failed 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.830
 Yeah yeah
