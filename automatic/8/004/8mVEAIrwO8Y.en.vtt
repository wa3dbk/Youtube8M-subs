cycling in your hand you can pay the

new card cycling appears across all the

new card cycling appears across all the
shards<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:27.869> example<00:00:28.380> here's<00:00:29.070> Ridge<00:00:29.400> ran<00:00:29.699> it

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
shards for example here's Ridge ran it

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.500 
shards for example here's Ridge ran it
sometimes<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.009> nice<00:00:32.189> fat<00:00:32.489> 64<00:00:33.059> creature<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
sometimes a nice fat 64 creature is

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.900 
sometimes a nice fat 64 creature is
exactly<00:00:34.020> what<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.290> need<00:00:34.620> but<00:00:35.309> sometimes<00:00:35.700> it's

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
exactly what you need but sometimes it's

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.970 
exactly what you need but sometimes it's
not<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.540> that's<00:00:36.960> where<00:00:37.140> cycling<00:00:37.559> comes<00:00:37.770> in

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
not and that's where cycling comes in

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.450 
not and that's where cycling comes in
early<00:00:38.840> in<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> game<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.410> seven-man<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> creature

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
early in the game a seven-man a creature

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.270 
early in the game a seven-man a creature
isn't<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.360> do<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.629> much<00:00:42.809> good<00:00:43.280> cycling

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
isn't going to do you much good cycling

isn't going to do you much good cycling
let<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.640> exchange<00:00:44.850> Ridge<00:00:45.329> ran<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.809> for<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> new

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
let you exchange Ridge ran it for a new

card to psycho Ridge ran it pay it
cycling<00:00:49.590> cost<00:00:49.829> which<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> pretty<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:51.270> after

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
cycling cost which is pretty just after

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.279 
cycling cost which is pretty just after
the<00:00:51.629> word<00:00:51.780> cycling<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.590> discard<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:54.289> then

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the word cycling and discard it then

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.729 
the word cycling and discard it then
draw<00:00:55.530> your<00:00:55.710> card<00:00:56.899> when<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:57.989> cycle<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.440> card

you're<00:00:59.309> playing<00:00:59.579> an<00:00:59.730> ability<00:01:00.030> not<00:01:00.809> playing<00:01:01.170> a

see<00:01:09.750> cycling<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> simplest

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
see cycling is one of the simplest

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.640 
see cycling is one of the simplest
keywords<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> game<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.140> also<00:01:13.320> one

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
keywords in the game but it's also one

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.830 
keywords in the game but it's also one
of<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> most<00:01:13.890> useful<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.360> does<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
of the most useful and it does have a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.530 
of the most useful and it does have a
trick<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.229> two<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.380> its<00:01:16.650> sleeve<00:01:17.360> check<00:01:18.360> out

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
trick or two up its sleeve check out

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.080 
trick or two up its sleeve check out
resounding<00:01:18.960> thunder<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.310> costs<00:01:20.670> three<00:01:20.880> mana

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
resounding thunder it costs three mana

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.359 
resounding thunder it costs three mana
to<00:01:21.330> play<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.350> costs<00:01:22.619> eight<00:01:22.770> man<00:01:23.100> at<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
to play but it costs eight man at a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.730 
to play but it costs eight man at a
cycle<00:01:23.850> that's<00:01:24.600> because<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.080> has<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> cycle

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
cycle that's because it has a cycle

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.770 
cycle that's because it has a cycle
trigger<00:01:26.009> an<00:01:26.250> ability<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.060> triggers<00:01:27.509> when

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
trigger an ability that triggers when

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.770 
trigger an ability that triggers when
you<00:01:27.900> cycle<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.939> when<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.060> cycle<00:01:30.270> resounding

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
you cycle it when you cycle resounding

you cycle it when you cycle resounding
Thunder<00:01:31.439> its<00:01:31.979> ability<00:01:32.490> triggers<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.979> choose

Thunder its ability triggers you choose
a<00:01:35.310> target<00:01:35.869> then<00:01:36.869> resounding<00:01:37.470> thunder<00:01:37.920> deals

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
a target then resounding thunder deals

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.569 
a target then resounding thunder deals
six<00:01:38.520> damage<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.890> then<00:01:40.890> you'll<00:01:41.070> draw<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> card

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
six damage to it then you'll draw a card

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.319 
six damage to it then you'll draw a card
from<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> cycling<00:01:42.329> ability<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.850> cycling

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
from the cycling ability the cycling

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.090 
from the cycling ability the cycling
ability<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> triggered<00:01:46.470> ability<00:01:46.860> are

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
ability and the triggered ability are

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.899 
ability and the triggered ability are
two<00:01:47.430> separate<00:01:47.909> abilities<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.460> cycle<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
two separate abilities you can cycle the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.030 
two separate abilities you can cycle the
card<00:01:51.149> even<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:51.899> there<00:01:52.079> are<00:01:52.200> no<00:01:52.350> legal<00:01:52.560> targets

card even if there are no legal targets

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.580 
card even if there are no legal targets
for<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.250> triggered<00:01:53.640> ability<00:01:54.140> that's<00:01:55.140> because

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
for the triggered ability that's because

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.200 
for the triggered ability that's because
the<00:01:55.740> cycling<00:01:56.189> ability<00:01:56.549> itself<00:01:56.969> has<00:01:57.180> no

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the cycling ability itself has no

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.740 
the cycling ability itself has no
targets<00:02:00.320> let's<00:02:01.320> look<00:02:01.439> at<00:02:01.590> another<00:02:01.710> case<00:02:02.750> this

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
targets let's look at another case this

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.780 
targets let's look at another case this
time<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.560> cycle<00:02:04.950> trigger<00:02:05.130> does<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.759> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
time the cycle trigger does have a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.270 
time the cycle trigger does have a
target<00:02:07.940> but<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.060> leaves<00:02:09.270> play<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.899> response

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
target but it leaves play in response

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.240 
target but it leaves play in response
the<00:02:12.910> cycle<00:02:13.240> trigger<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.750> countered<00:02:14.230> but<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the cycle trigger is countered but the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.670 
the cycle trigger is countered but the
cycling<00:02:15.700> ability<00:02:16.030> isn't<00:02:16.240> you'll<00:02:17.200> still<00:02:17.440> draw

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
cycling ability isn't you'll still draw

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.250 
cycling ability isn't you'll still draw
a<00:02:17.709> card<00:02:20.310> just<00:02:21.310> like<00:02:21.400> before<00:02:21.880> cycling<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.959> card

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
a card just like before cycling a card

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.110 
a card just like before cycling a card
isn't<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.770> same<00:02:23.950> as<00:02:23.980> playing<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.550> as<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.700> spell

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
isn't the same as playing it as a spell

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:40.440 
isn't the same as playing it as a spell
