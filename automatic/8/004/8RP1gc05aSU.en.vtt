00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
the call on the field which was a

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.100 
the call on the field which was a
touchdown<00:01:55.100> I<00:01:55.310> think<00:01:55.580> they<00:01:55.730> have<00:01:56.110> evidence

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
touchdown I think they have evidence

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.770 
touchdown I think they have evidence
that<00:01:57.200> will<00:01:57.500> confirm<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:59.090> call<00:01:59.300> on<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.600> field

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
that will confirm the call on the field

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.500 
that will confirm the call on the field
exactly
