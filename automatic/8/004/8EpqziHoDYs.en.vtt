00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.650
 good how to repair 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.190
 good 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.120
 I have the killer whale 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.120
 and the other day 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.439
 well I got here 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.960
 Today is with the constant ass 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:44.080
 well let's see how to prepare is 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.080
 pretty simple, we just need 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.399
 click 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.840
 the glue 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.370
 - 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.370
 and a little patience 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.320
 well to the weather the thing we are going to give 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.320
 this form 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.330
 and we are going to start putting 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.390
 with everything 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.420
 for here inside 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.200
 with the tip of him 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.200
 from the earth 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.810
 and the glue 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.530
 so take a little 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.200
 exposing you should not go too 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.630
 I have enough that everything is 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.630
 for all 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.810
 Well, the whole race 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.360
 there are those who throw it directly into the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.030
 drop a drop but when I do not 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.840
 doing so for 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.840
 this time 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.620
 but to the bottom of the race there 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.030
 as only what you see there is only one 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.030
 little in 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:23.180
 good already in the second punch 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.180
 you see how it is 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.709
 but 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.709
 Super good 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.500
 it's been pretty good, you just have to 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.040
 close it and blow a little before 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.040
 close it 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.280
 and nothing and tomorrow in the triathlon I already have 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.210
 the repair neoprene tonight what 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.060
 I will leave 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.360
 well in such a position so that you do not 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.360
 open 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.860
 perfect 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.860
 straight already so that it opens us never again
