00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.840
 hello welcome on moto.com lenses 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.240
 we are again at Honda 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.680
 after early in the season left 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.660
 from the cb 500 f 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:50.980
 so we're back with the cb 500 x 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.309
 originality of this series cb 500 at 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.950
 honda 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.010
 you have three declensions so there xna 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.980
 air and the aef all three based on 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.800
 the same engine so a two-cylinder in 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.560
 Parallel cubant every 3 471 1 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.980
 cubic centimeter necessarily limited in 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:13.270
 thirty five kilowatts for the new 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.430
 license legislation to 2 a power 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.010
 who gets to 8500 rpm which 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.260
 you can see from the 1,700 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.690
 for example here we can really climb 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.820
 in the towers and an engine that 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.060
 develops a couple of 43 newton meters 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.340
 at 7000 laps so we can ride too 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.440
 well on the couple it is quite flexible 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.790
 despite everything for a missile 1 but we 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.409
 can also climb into everything that 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.090
 so lets us nice times 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.420
 so what is changing compared to 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.820
 the cbr tested early in the season and well 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.810
 not necessarily the look you can 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.960
 to see it remains in the series 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.250
 crosstourer or nc 7 100 x a look so 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.680
 a little bit 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.320
 trail with raised mudguard to 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.860
 the front a small motor shoe for 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.170
 protect otherwise the motor base obviously 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.450
 she this one remains him the same the 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.349
 tank him by cons wins 1 8 6 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.599
 reaching so says cedric 3 with 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.700
 the average autonomy of about 4 liters 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:18.760
 and half in the sense that you can imagine 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:20.410
 beautiful walks the height of saddle 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.019
 is she just a little bit higher 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.310
 we go to 810 mm we are at 7 190 on the 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.890
 cbs 500 f 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.720
 while ground clearance she goes back to 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.849
 170 mm 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.180
 basically a lot of little things that 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:38.700
 change for the same engine is just 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.700
 one kg more than the cbr 500 m 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.340
 side suspensions here no longer no 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.790
 change we find a mowing 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.360
 classic 41 mm rear on 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.290
 find the pr ling so settings 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.030
 adjustable in nine preload positions 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.040
 and always this phenomenon sometimes a 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.500
 small concrete dive bridge of the 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.470
 front fork braking 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.600
 here we feel the custom pretty well we are 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.530
 a little bit higher the position of 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.050
 driving is also a little bit 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.540
 different one is sitting the bust more 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.780
 right which overall does not interfere 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.110
 many braking side but no 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.650
 change no more than 320 mm of rain 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.810
 are at the front 1,240 with a single well 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.800
 are at the back is of course 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.800
 always with the decline 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.129
 another common point necessarily the table 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.340
 always completely digital 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.799
 gauge the contour km hour the partials 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.590
 and even a watch mention here a 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.160
 bubble that you can adjust on two 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.080
 positions 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.500
 obviously it will take out the tools 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.060
 to be able to make the rule to a bubble 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.210
 we would have liked to be a little more 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.220
 protective we must admit that on wholesale 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.320
 road or highway we still 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.440
 a lot of wind pressure no doubt 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.060
 whether we focus our action from to or in 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.550
 other props you will have 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.510
 the country opportunity to your motorcycle a 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.510
 bubble a little bigger 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:23.549
 while conclude from this test of the CB 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:27.599
 500 x and well proposed to less than 6000 

00:05:23.549 --> 00:05:29.459
 euros just like the cb 500 m frankly 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.869
 it's a very good idea from 

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:33.269
 honda to launch this range 

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:36.089
 now we know that the budget 

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:38.489
 is sometimes hard to find for 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:41.729
 bikers and you have here a motorcycle that 

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:43.609
 can combine and fun to go with 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.499
 some friends maybe on a ride 

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:48.359
 the duo will not scare him either 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:51.449
 saddle is comfortable enough too 

00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:54.089
 well in front of that behind the position and 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.159
 she also nice a good tank and 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:57.089
 limited consumption to make 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.959
 many kilometers 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:02.369
 I would say that ask for more 

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:06.179
 obviously there are no boxes like 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:06.860
 on a big bike we have barely 50 

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:10.259
 horses 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.479
 it may not seem like much for some people 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:15.419
 sound bomb my faith it can change 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:18.809
 via a simple silencer on the shelf 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:21.659
 accessories we can equip it at honda 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:23.879
 with the suitcases and with the top 15 and 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:26.849
 you have a bike there really for everything 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:29.429
 to go to work on weekdays 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:31.459
 have fun on weekends and leave 

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:33.389
 in a walk for 6000 euros 

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:36.149
 it will be difficult to do a lot 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:38.669
 better here it was diabolo on 

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:40.079
 Moto.com goals stay with us there 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.329
 will still have many more and that's 

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:45.059
 the season is not over yet far from 

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:47.569
 there we still hope you can 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:47.569
 surprise
