is<00:05:41.700> being<00:05:41.970> done<00:05:42.180> in<00:05:42.300> this<00:05:42.419> video<00:05:42.750> here<00:05:43.110> we're

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
is being done in this video here we're

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.130 
is being done in this video here we're
pressing<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.740> cowl<00:05:43.950> button<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:44.640> then<00:05:45.390> using

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
pressing the cowl button and then using

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.050 
pressing the cowl button and then using
the<00:05:46.500> up<00:05:46.740> and<00:05:47.130> down<00:05:47.340> arrows<00:05:48.110> to<00:05:49.520> make<00:05:50.520> sure<00:05:50.790> that

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
the up and down arrows to make sure that

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.710 
the up and down arrows to make sure that
the<00:05:51.479> displayed<00:05:51.990> thickness<00:05:52.740> it<00:05:53.460> correlates<00:05:54.450> to

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
the displayed thickness it correlates to

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.310 
the displayed thickness it correlates to
the<00:05:55.169> measured<00:05:55.620> thickness<00:05:56.660> now<00:05:57.660> once<00:05:58.050> this<00:05:58.260> is

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
the measured thickness now once this is

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.250 
the measured thickness now once this is
done<00:05:58.790> you<00:05:59.790> can<00:05:59.820> then<00:06:00.030> take<00:06:00.450> the<00:06:00.960> probe<00:06:01.290> and

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
done you can then take the probe and

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.420 
done you can then take the probe and
apply<00:06:04.260> it<00:06:04.320> to<00:06:04.800> your<00:06:05.460> sample<00:06:06.800> press<00:06:07.800> down<00:06:08.070> hard

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
apply it to your sample press down hard

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.250 
apply it to your sample press down hard
don't<00:06:08.880> forget<00:06:09.240> to<00:06:09.419> use<00:06:09.450> the<00:06:09.630> coupling<00:06:10.290> gel<00:06:10.320> and

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
don't forget to use the coupling gel and

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.710 
don't forget to use the coupling gel and
you<00:06:13.260> will<00:06:13.410> be<00:06:13.560> measuring<00:06:14.000> the<00:06:15.000> sonic<00:06:15.479> velocity

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
you will be measuring the sonic velocity

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.910 
you will be measuring the sonic velocity
of<00:06:16.289> this<00:06:16.979> material<00:06:17.550> in<00:06:18.320> this<00:06:19.320> case

of this material in this case

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.330 
of this material in this case
the<00:06:20.160> measured<00:06:20.520> velocity<00:06:21.390> is<00:06:23.210> 2512

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
the measured velocity is 2512

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.860 
the measured velocity is 2512
