so one thing you may have noticed

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.350 
so one thing you may have noticed
already<00:00:46.680> about<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> microphone<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.239> it

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
already about the microphone is that it

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720 
already about the microphone is that it
comes<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.780> two<00:00:48.989> separate<00:00:49.500> components<00:00:49.920> you

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
comes in two separate components you

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.130 
comes in two separate components you
could<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:50.970> seen<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.330> at<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> store<00:00:51.870> my

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
could have seen this at the store my

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.350 
could have seen this at the store my
little<00:00:52.440> intro<00:00:52.949> at<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> stop-motion<00:00:53.550> as<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
little intro at the stop-motion as the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.930 
little intro at the stop-motion as the
two<00:00:54.540> components<00:00:55.230> joint<00:00:55.800> together<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
two components joint together what it is

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.940 
two components joint together what it is
essentially<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.870> allows<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.410> extend

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
essentially is it allows you to extend

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.950 
essentially is it allows you to extend
the<00:00:59.129> microphone<00:00:59.640> instead<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.750> plugging

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the microphone instead of just plugging

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.290 
the microphone instead of just plugging
it<00:01:01.260> straightaway<00:01:01.890> into<00:01:02.070> USB<00:01:02.520> port<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.120> either

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it straightaway into USB port to either

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.840 
it straightaway into USB port to either
a<00:01:03.480> computer<00:01:04.050> or<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> laptop<00:01:04.289> and<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.250> does<00:01:05.550> help

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
a computer or a laptop and it does help

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.580 
a computer or a laptop and it does help
especially<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.660> fact<00:01:06.899> that<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.380> get

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
especially the fact that you can get

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.889 
especially the fact that you can get
better<00:01:07.860> audio<00:01:08.340> quality<00:01:08.399> apart<00:01:09.390> from<00:01:09.509> that<00:01:09.690> the

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
better audio quality apart from that the

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.170 
better audio quality apart from that the
blue<00:01:10.080> tikki<00:01:10.500> looks<00:01:10.770> nice<00:01:11.039> it's<00:01:11.399> built<00:01:11.789> well

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
blue tikki looks nice it's built well

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.779 
blue tikki looks nice it's built well
but<00:01:12.840> let<00:01:13.050> me<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.350> plug<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.740> into<00:01:13.950> my<00:01:14.190> computer

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
but let me just plug it into my computer

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.700 
but let me just plug it into my computer
and<00:01:14.820> show<00:01:15.300> you<00:01:15.360> what<00:01:15.600> else<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.960> does<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.560> when

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and show you what else it does so when

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.960 
and show you what else it does so when
you<00:01:16.800> plug<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.190> microphone<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.759> get<00:01:17.940> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
you plug in the microphone you get a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.480 
you plug in the microphone you get a
blue<00:01:18.300> indicator<00:01:18.539> light<00:01:19.020> indicating<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.100> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
blue indicator light indicating that it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.029 
blue indicator light indicating that it
is<00:01:20.670> an<00:01:20.820> intelligent<00:01:21.539> speech<00:01:21.840> mode<00:01:22.110> now<00:01:22.710> when

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
is an intelligent speech mode now when

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.800 
is an intelligent speech mode now when
you<00:01:23.160> don't<00:01:23.430> talk<00:01:23.759> then<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.240> would<00:01:24.390> turn<00:01:24.539> orange

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you don't talk then it would turn orange

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.200 
you don't talk then it would turn orange
meaning<00:01:25.440> it<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.770> muted<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.369> once<00:01:26.910> you<00:01:27.000> start

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
meaning it is muted but once you start

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.699 
meaning it is muted but once you start
talking<00:01:27.360> again<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.080> will<00:01:28.259> turn<00:01:28.470> blue<00:01:28.679> again

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:28.709 
talking again it will turn blue again

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.949 
talking again it will turn blue again
now<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.789> works<00:01:30.090> well<00:01:30.420> with<00:01:30.630> chats

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
now this works well with chats

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.650 
now this works well with chats
conference<00:01:31.740> calls<00:01:32.039> and<00:01:32.280> overall<00:01:32.849> weather<00:01:33.360> or

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
conference calls and overall weather or

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.320 
conference calls and overall weather or
nausea<00:01:34.259> environments<00:01:35.009> why<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.880> because

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
nausea environments why it's because

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.180 
nausea environments why it's because
during<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.050> time<00:01:37.289> when<00:01:37.500> there's<00:01:37.649> no<00:01:37.709> audio

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
during the time when there's no audio

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.219 
during the time when there's no audio
coming<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.849> microphone<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.450> meets<00:01:39.780> itself

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
coming to the microphone it meets itself

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.070 
coming to the microphone it meets itself
so<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:41.280> audio<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.030> background<00:01:42.479> does<00:01:42.840> not

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
so the audio in the background does not

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.109 
so the audio in the background does not
come<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.009> actual<00:01:44.340> microphone<00:01:44.789> and<00:01:45.000> it

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
come to the actual microphone and it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.449 
come to the actual microphone and it
doesn't<00:01:45.420> affect<00:01:45.509> any<00:01:45.990> call<00:01:46.319> or<00:01:46.619> chat<00:01:47.190> that<00:01:47.369> you

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
doesn't affect any call or chat that you

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.160 
doesn't affect any call or chat that you
might<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.759> having<00:01:47.940> at<00:01:48.209> that<00:01:48.240> time<00:01:48.660> or<00:01:48.929> maybe<00:01:49.080> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
might be having at that time or maybe a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.440 
might be having at that time or maybe a
voiceover<00:01:49.740> you're<00:01:49.890> doing<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.270> are

so now we're using the blue tikki

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.000 
so now we're using the blue tikki
microphone<00:02:52.240> for<00:02:52.510> audio<00:02:52.570> test<00:02:53.350> so<00:02:53.650> if<00:02:53.770> I<00:02:53.860> just

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
microphone for audio test so if I just

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.190 
microphone for audio test so if I just
bring<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.310> blue<00:02:54.490> ticket<00:02:54.880> closer<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.720> closer

noise<00:03:36.040> is<00:03:36.340> which<00:03:36.850> can<00:03:37.180> come<00:03:37.450> across<00:03:37.600> as<00:03:37.930> being

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
noise is which can come across as being

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.650 
noise is which can come across as being
annoying<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.430> there<00:03:39.610> we<00:03:39.700> go<00:03:39.730> here<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.239> is<00:03:40.420> with

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.330 

and<00:04:23.120> now<00:04:23.660> back<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.170> rode<00:04:24.320> videomic<00:04:24.620> the

and now back to the rode videomic the
ambient<00:04:25.850> sound<00:04:26.090> allowed<00:04:26.420> you<00:04:26.540> to<00:04:26.600> hear<00:04:26.840> what

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
ambient sound allowed you to hear what

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.900 
ambient sound allowed you to hear what
the<00:04:27.260> Tiki<00:04:27.620> is<00:04:27.650> hearing<00:04:28.070> now<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.670> you<00:04:28.760> could

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
the Tiki is hearing now so you could

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.460 
the Tiki is hearing now so you could
hear<00:04:29.060> more<00:04:29.270> of<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.480> fans<00:04:29.750> churning<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.380> it

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
hear more of the fans churning and it

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.840 
hear more of the fans churning and it
doesn't<00:04:30.770> make<00:04:30.890> for<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:31.190> greatest<00:04:31.430> audio

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
doesn't make for the greatest audio

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.870 
doesn't make for the greatest audio
quality<00:04:32.000> this<00:04:32.750> probably<00:04:33.260> I'll<00:04:33.470> go<00:04:33.980> mode<00:04:34.430> work

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
quality this probably I'll go mode work

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.640 
quality this probably I'll go mode work
best<00:04:35.210> if<00:04:35.390> you're<00:04:35.510> connected<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.960> laptop<00:04:36.140> and

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
best if you're connected to a laptop and

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.560 
best if you're connected to a laptop and
again<00:04:37.160> this<00:04:37.310> is<00:04:37.430> only<00:04:37.610> on<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.910> intelligent

again this is only on the intelligent
speech<00:04:38.870> mode<00:04:39.170> so<00:04:39.680> obviously<00:04:40.010> this<00:04:40.190> is<00:04:40.370> more

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
speech mode so obviously this is more
