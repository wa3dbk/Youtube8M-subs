him to tell you more about if it's just

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
the first of a series or or a one-off

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.729 
the first of a series or or a one-off
well<00:00:42.579> getting<00:00:43.579> to<00:00:43.730> that<00:00:43.880> issue<00:00:44.870> right<00:00:45.350> off<00:00:45.530> the

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
well getting to that issue right off the

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.040 
well getting to that issue right off the
bat<00:00:45.950> we<00:00:46.219> are<00:00:46.730> calling<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.450> introductory

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
bat we are calling it the introductory

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.240 
bat we are calling it the introductory
model<00:00:48.620> into<00:00:49.100> our<00:00:49.250> newly<00:00:49.879> designed<00:00:50.090> 50<00:00:50.780> series

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
model into our newly designed 50 series

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.670 
model into our newly designed 50 series
so<00:00:52.270> when<00:00:53.270> we<00:00:53.420> say<00:00:53.629> series<00:00:54.079> I<00:00:54.230> guess<00:00:54.379> it<00:00:54.559> is

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
so when we say series I guess it is

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.940 
so when we say series I guess it is
plural<00:00:55.809> since<00:00:56.809> we<00:00:56.930> only<00:00:57.050> have<00:00:57.320> one<00:00:57.559> microphone

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
plural since we only have one microphone

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.889 
plural since we only have one microphone
that<00:00:58.370> would<00:00:58.520> maybe<00:00:58.850> allude<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.510> fact<00:00:59.629> that

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
that would maybe allude to the fact that

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.619 
that would maybe allude to the fact that
there<00:01:00.110> will<00:01:00.289> be<00:01:00.320> other<00:01:00.590> microphones<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.629> I'm

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
there will be other microphones and I'm

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.639 
there will be other microphones and I'm
going<00:01:02.809> to<00:01:02.870> leave<00:01:03.020> it<00:01:03.110> at<00:01:03.199> that<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.379> then<00:01:03.590> I'm

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
going to leave it at that and then I'm

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.170 
going to leave it at that and then I'm
going<00:01:03.739> to<00:01:03.860> come<00:01:04.009> back<00:01:04.039> to<00:01:04.369> it<00:01:04.489> after<00:01:04.579> I<00:01:04.759> talk<00:01:05.000> to

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
going to come back to it after I talk to

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.969 
going to come back to it after I talk to
about<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.479> microphone<00:01:05.899> a<00:01:05.930> little<00:01:06.049> bit<00:01:06.409> okay

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
about the microphone a little bit okay

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.129 
about the microphone a little bit okay
fair<00:01:07.250> enough<00:01:07.280> ok<00:01:08.179> now<00:01:08.389> the<00:01:08.450> unique<00:01:08.929> thing

00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:09.139 
fair enough ok now the unique thing

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:10.569 
fair enough ok now the unique thing
about<00:01:09.170> this<00:01:09.439> mike<00:01:09.679> is<00:01:09.920> of<00:01:10.100> course<00:01:10.249> you<00:01:10.399> got

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
about this mike is of course you got

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.789 
about this mike is of course you got
four<00:01:11.029> rectangular<00:01:11.479> capsules<00:01:12.020> in<00:01:12.200> there<00:01:12.380> that

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
four rectangular capsules in there that

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.239 
four rectangular capsules in there that
is<00:01:12.950> correct<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:14.630> know<00:01:14.779> ultimately<00:01:15.100> when<00:01:16.100> this

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:16.249 
is correct you know ultimately when this

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.779 
is correct you know ultimately when this
microphone<00:01:17.139> was<00:01:18.139> set<00:01:18.409> out<00:01:18.439> where<00:01:19.039> we<00:01:19.159> defined

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
microphone was set out where we defined

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.519 
microphone was set out where we defined
what<00:01:20.179> we<00:01:20.299> wanted<00:01:20.599> in<00:01:20.719> a<00:01:20.810> microphone<00:01:21.229> it<00:01:21.409> was

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:21.529 
what we wanted in a microphone it was

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:23.019 
what we wanted in a microphone it was
kind<00:01:21.740> of<00:01:21.829> refreshing<00:01:22.249> for<00:01:22.520> our<00:01:22.639> engineers

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:23.029 
kind of refreshing for our engineers

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:25.120 
kind of refreshing for our engineers
because<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.990> wasn't<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.409> microphone<00:01:24.770> that<00:01:24.950> we

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
because it wasn't a microphone that we

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.309 
because it wasn't a microphone that we
came<00:01:25.429> to<00:01:25.849> the<00:01:25.969> table<00:01:26.149> saying<00:01:26.599> all<00:01:26.869> right<00:01:26.899> we

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:30.139 
need a project studio microphone that's

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:31.389

what<00:01:34.909> we<00:01:35.149> said<00:01:35.479> is<00:01:35.719> we<00:01:35.899> want<00:01:36.109> a<00:01:36.169> microphone

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
what we said is we want a microphone

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.830 
what we said is we want a microphone
that<00:01:36.919> has<00:01:37.099> the<00:01:37.249> highest<00:01:37.789> level<00:01:38.179> of<00:01:38.419> sonic

that has the highest level of sonic
purity<00:01:39.349> and<00:01:39.560> we<00:01:40.429> want<00:01:40.639> a<00:01:40.729> very<00:01:41.329> high-end<00:01:41.749> vocal

microphone<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:43.520> go<00:01:43.669> into<00:01:43.849> this<00:01:44.029> 50<00:01:44.299> series<00:01:44.509> and

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
microphone to go into this 50 series and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:46.419 
microphone to go into this 50 series and
that<00:01:44.840> was<00:01:44.929> really<00:01:45.049> where<00:01:45.409> we<00:01:45.560> left<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.279> we

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
that was really where we left it so we

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.339 
that was really where we left it so we
did<00:01:46.579> not<00:01:46.729> define<00:01:47.090> how<00:01:47.419> the<00:01:47.450> microphone<00:01:48.079> needed

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:48.349 
did not define how the microphone needed

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:50.739 
did not define how the microphone needed
to<00:01:48.439> be<00:01:48.759> constructed<00:01:49.759> or<00:01:49.909> what<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.209> cost<00:01:50.479> was

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
to be constructed or what the cost was

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:51.999 
to be constructed or what the cost was
going<00:01:50.929> to<00:01:50.989> be<00:01:51.079> of<00:01:51.169> the<00:01:51.289> microphone<00:01:51.739> and<00:01:51.889> this

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
going to be of the microphone and this

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.409 
going to be of the microphone and this
was<00:01:52.159> kind<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.399> very<00:01:52.549> liberating<00:01:53.209> for<00:01:53.359> our

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:53.419 
was kind of very liberating for our

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:54.940 
was kind of very liberating for our
engineers<00:01:53.869> who<00:01:53.989> really<00:01:54.200> got<00:01:54.289> to<00:01:54.439> flex<00:01:54.679> some<00:01:54.859> of

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
engineers who really got to flex some of

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.219 
engineers who really got to flex some of
their<00:01:55.099> engineering<00:01:55.489> muscle<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.869> four

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
their engineering muscle so the four

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.339 
their engineering muscle so the four
capsule<00:01:57.829> design<00:01:57.950> came<00:01:58.729> out<00:01:58.939> of<00:01:59.149> that<00:01:59.209> kind<00:02:00.139> of

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
capsule design came out of that kind of

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.760 
capsule design came out of that kind of
underlying<00:02:00.859> purity<00:02:02.079> concept<00:02:03.079> and<00:02:03.380> vocal

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
underlying purity concept and vocal

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.489 
underlying purity concept and vocal
concept<00:02:04.429> so<00:02:04.579> what<00:02:04.789> this<00:02:04.939> does<00:02:05.299> is<00:02:05.689> allows<00:02:06.079> us

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
concept so what this does is allows us

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:09.490 
concept so what this does is allows us
to<00:02:07.279> get<00:02:07.459> a<00:02:07.489> much<00:02:07.880> larger<00:02:08.630> surface<00:02:09.140> area<00:02:09.319> than

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
to get a much larger surface area than

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.920 
to get a much larger surface area than
we<00:02:09.800> could<00:02:10.039> with<00:02:10.220> conventional<00:02:11.060> technology

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
we could with conventional technology

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.920 
we could with conventional technology
it's<00:02:12.049> about<00:02:12.260> almost<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.739> 1.5<00:02:13.489> inch<00:02:13.730> diameter

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
it's about almost a 1.5 inch diameter

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.120 
it's about almost a 1.5 inch diameter
capsule<00:02:15.930> if<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.050> were<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.380> like<00:02:16.530> make<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.040> a

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
capsule if you were to like make it in a

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.940 
capsule if you were to like make it in a
circular<00:02:17.370> capsule<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.810> what<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.170> does<00:02:19.500> if

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
circular capsule but what this does if

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.350 
circular capsule but what this does if
you<00:02:20.130> were<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.340> make<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.490> capsule<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.090> large

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
you were to make a capsule that large

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.790 
you were to make a capsule that large
your<00:02:21.720> diaphragm<00:02:21.960> material<00:02:22.440> would<00:02:22.500> have<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.710> be

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
your diaphragm material would have to be

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.590 
your diaphragm material would have to be
much<00:02:22.950> thicker<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:24.030> would<00:02:24.120> have<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.360> have<00:02:24.450> much

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
much thicker you would have to have much

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.330 
much thicker you would have to have much
more<00:02:24.630> space<00:02:25.080> between<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.620> diaphragm<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
more space between the diaphragm and the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.540 
more space between the diaphragm and the
back<00:02:26.520> plates<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:28.040> it's<00:02:29.040> just<00:02:29.220> not<00:02:29.370> going<00:02:29.460> to

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
back plates and it's just not going to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.400 
back plates and it's just not going to
be<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.720> it's<00:02:30.720> not<00:02:30.810> going<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.020> be<00:02:31.080> what<00:02:31.230> this

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
be that it's not going to be what this

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.440 
be that it's not going to be what this
is<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.890> what<00:02:32.010> this<00:02:32.190> does<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.700> allow<00:02:32.970> us<00:02:33.240> to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
is and what this does is allow us to

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.680 
is and what this does is allow us to
have<00:02:33.710> a<00:02:34.710> very<00:02:35.280> fast<00:02:36.000> transient<00:02:36.390> response

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
have a very fast transient response

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.260 
have a very fast transient response
because<00:02:37.140> we<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.410> smaller<00:02:38.220> capsules<00:02:38.910> which

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
because we have smaller capsules which

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.130 
because we have smaller capsules which
are<00:02:39.450> two<00:02:39.750> microns<00:02:40.230> thick<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:42.450> we<00:02:42.570> get<00:02:42.750> kind<00:02:43.020> of

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
are two microns thick so we get kind of

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.590 
are two microns thick so we get kind of
the<00:02:43.260> benefits<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.220> smaller<00:02:45.060> diaphragm

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
the benefits of a smaller diaphragm

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.060 
the benefits of a smaller diaphragm
microphone<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.440> also<00:02:46.740> some<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
microphone with also some of the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.650 
microphone with also some of the
benefits<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.460> a<00:02:47.550> large<00:02:47.760> diaphragm<00:02:48.090> microphone

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
benefits of a large diaphragm microphone

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.170 
benefits of a large diaphragm microphone

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
noise and in fact the ones we're testing

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.290 
noise and in fact the ones we're testing
at<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.010> shop<00:02:53.220> or<00:02:53.490> right<00:02:53.730> around<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.030> for

at the shop or right around the for

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.750 
at the shop or right around the for
range<00:02:54.690> which<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.590> almost<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.250> limit<00:02:56.520> of<00:02:56.640> our

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
range which is almost the limit of our

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.130 
range which is almost the limit of our
anechoic<00:02:57.210> chamber<00:02:57.570> believe<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.900> or<00:02:57.990> not<00:02:58.080> our

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
anechoic chamber believe it or not our

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.350 
anechoic chamber believe it or not our
chambers<00:02:58.650> are<00:02:58.800> between<00:02:59.010> two<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.460> three<00:02:59.700> DB<00:03:00.090> of

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
chambers are between two and three DB of

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.390 
chambers are between two and three DB of
just<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.410> chamber<00:03:01.710> themselves<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.370> it's

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
just in the chamber themselves so it's

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.260 
just in the chamber themselves so it's
very<00:03:02.610> difficult<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.270> test<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.600> microphone

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
very difficult to test this microphone

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.300 
very difficult to test this microphone
so<00:03:06.270> that<00:03:06.510> was<00:03:06.690> kind<00:03:06.960> of<00:03:07.140> like<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.830> heart<00:03:08.100> of

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
so that was kind of like the heart of

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.210 
so that was kind of like the heart of
the<00:03:08.340> microphone<00:03:09.560> definitely<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.980> going<00:03:11.160> to

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
the microphone definitely is going to

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.100 
the microphone definitely is going to
work<00:03:11.340> best<00:03:11.730> for<00:03:11.970> vocals<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.570> has<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.720> very

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
work best for vocals it has a very

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.740 
work best for vocals it has a very
distinct<00:03:13.680> sweet<00:03:13.920> spot<00:03:14.220> when<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.000> get<00:03:15.330> off<00:03:15.540> of

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
distinct sweet spot when you get off of

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.090 
distinct sweet spot when you get off of
that<00:03:15.780> sweet<00:03:16.110> spot<00:03:16.320> you're<00:03:16.590> going<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:16.800> see<00:03:16.950> some

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
that sweet spot you're going to see some

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.010 
that sweet spot you're going to see some
high<00:03:17.280> frequency<00:03:17.820> roll-off<00:03:18.240> we<00:03:18.570> just<00:03:18.780> did<00:03:18.990> a

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
high frequency roll-off we just did a

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.500 
high frequency roll-off we just did a
test<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.830> other<00:03:19.950> day<00:03:20.250> in<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.640> studio<00:03:20.940> locally

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
test the other day in a studio locally

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.330 
test the other day in a studio locally
where<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.530> vocalist<00:03:22.920> didn't<00:03:23.100> want<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.280> wear

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
where the vocalist didn't want to wear

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.580 
where the vocalist didn't want to wear
headphones<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:24.060> they<00:03:24.180> had<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.570> NS<00:03:24.870> ten<00:03:25.110> sitting

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
headphones so they had to NS ten sitting

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.470 
headphones so they had to NS ten sitting
about<00:03:26.010> four<00:03:26.580> feet<00:03:26.760> behind<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.300> microphone

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
about four feet behind the microphone

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.540 
about four feet behind the microphone
driven<00:03:28.080> by<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.230> crown<00:03:28.530> amplifier<00:03:29.070> at<00:03:29.340> pretty

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
driven by a crown amplifier at pretty

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.360 
driven by a crown amplifier at pretty
crazy<00:03:29.850> volumes<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.560> was<00:03:31.680> virtually<00:03:31.890> zero

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
crazy volumes and it was virtually zero

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.240 
crazy volumes and it was virtually zero
bleed<00:03:33.150> into<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.690> microphone<00:03:34.050> so<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.130> was

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
bleed into the microphone so that was

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.350 
bleed into the microphone so that was
kind<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.490> something<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:35.790> we<00:03:36.000> hadn't<00:03:36.240> done

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
kind of something that we hadn't done

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.820 
kind of something that we hadn't done
back<00:03:36.570> at<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.810> factory<00:03:36.990> so<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.410> was<00:03:37.500> fun<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.709> see

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
back at the factory so it was fun to see

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.210 
back at the factory so it was fun to see
that<00:03:38.220> work<00:03:39.290> when<00:03:40.290> we<00:03:40.410> go<00:03:40.590> down<00:03:40.830> into<00:03:41.100> the

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
that work when we go down into the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.160 
that work when we go down into the
actual<00:03:41.520> construction<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.480> know<00:03:42.510> body

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
actual construction you know body

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.350 
actual construction you know body
residences<00:03:43.920> have<00:03:44.190> been<00:03:44.370> minimized<00:03:44.850> in<00:03:45.180> fact

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
residences have been minimized in fact

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.750 
residences have been minimized in fact
something<00:03:45.720> like<00:03:45.870> this<00:03:46.020> like<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.520> screen<00:03:47.520> or

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
something like this like the screen or

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.030 
something like this like the screen or
mesh<00:03:48.000> on<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.330> microphone<00:03:48.920> we're<00:03:49.920> actually

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
mesh on the microphone we're actually

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.160 
mesh on the microphone we're actually
fused<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.910> mesh<00:03:51.060> together<00:03:51.300> so<00:03:51.720> we<00:03:51.840> don't<00:03:52.020> have

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
fused the mesh together so we don't have

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.870 
fused the mesh together so we don't have
any<00:03:52.320> resonance<00:03:52.620> between<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:53.340> mesh<00:03:53.520> so<00:03:53.760> it's

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
any resonance between the mesh so it's

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.760 
any resonance between the mesh so it's
that<00:03:54.000> kind<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.270> attention<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:55.110> detail<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.709> the

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
that kind of attention to detail and the

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.050 
that kind of attention to detail and the
sonic<00:03:56.190> purity<00:03:56.610> that

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
sonic purity that

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.390 
sonic purity that
that<00:03:58.450> we<00:03:58.569> were<00:03:58.630> going<00:03:58.810> for<00:03:58.930> so<00:03:59.440> getting<00:04:00.280> back

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
that we were going for so getting back

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.490 
that we were going for so getting back
to<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.819> series<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.569> plural<00:04:01.930> aspect<00:04:02.349> of

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
to the series and the plural aspect of

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.760 
to the series and the plural aspect of
this<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.900> might<00:04:05.290> not<00:04:05.319> be<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:07.200> far<00:04:08.200> stretch<00:04:08.500> to

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
this it might not be a far stretch to

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.160 
this it might not be a far stretch to
think<00:04:08.800> that<00:04:09.069> we<00:04:09.310> would<00:04:09.430> maybe<00:04:09.640> have<00:04:10.030> some<00:04:10.989> type

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
think that we would maybe have some type

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.680 
think that we would maybe have some type
of<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.380> pencil<00:04:11.980> microphone<00:04:12.610> you<00:04:13.300> know<00:04:13.420> that

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
of a pencil microphone you know that

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.720 
of a pencil microphone you know that
makes<00:04:13.989> a<00:04:14.230> lot<00:04:14.530> of<00:04:14.590> sense<00:04:14.739> in<00:04:15.160> a<00:04:15.250> series<00:04:15.700> of

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
makes a lot of sense in a series of

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.280 
makes a lot of sense in a series of
microphones<00:04:17.010> but<00:04:18.010> from<00:04:18.250> there<00:04:18.959> this<00:04:19.959> is<00:04:20.109> not

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
microphones but from there this is not

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.810 
microphones but from there this is not
this<00:04:20.590> series<00:04:20.889> is<00:04:21.010> not<00:04:21.160> going<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.340> be<00:04:21.459> defined

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
this series is not going to be defined

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.840 
this series is not going to be defined
by<00:04:22.000> these<00:04:22.150> capsules<00:04:22.780> so<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.950> can<00:04:24.100> really<00:04:24.370> go

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
by these capsules so it can really go

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.600 
by these capsules so it can really go
any<00:04:25.240> direction<00:04:25.500> but<00:04:26.500> if<00:04:26.620> we<00:04:26.800> feel<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.370> next

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
any direction but if we feel the next

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.330 
any direction but if we feel the next
generation<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.960> going<00:04:29.080> to<00:04:29.200> benefit<00:04:29.740> from<00:04:30.220> a

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
generation is going to benefit from a

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.740 
generation is going to benefit from a
rectangular<00:04:30.850> capsule<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.419> know<00:04:31.510> that's<00:04:31.660> the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
rectangular capsule you know that's the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.690 
rectangular capsule you know that's the
way<00:04:31.840> we're<00:04:32.020> going<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.200> go<00:04:32.350> but<00:04:32.650> but<00:04:33.490> we're<00:04:33.639> not

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
way we're going to go but but we're not

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.600 
way we're going to go but but we're not
ruling<00:04:34.120> out<00:04:34.389> other<00:04:34.979> capsule<00:04:35.979> designs<00:04:36.310> as<00:04:36.580> well

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
ruling out other capsule designs as well

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.510 
ruling out other capsule designs as well
so<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.389> think<00:04:37.810> this<00:04:37.930> is<00:04:37.990> going<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.350> be<00:04:38.560> kind<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.430> a

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
so I think this is going to be kind of a

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.000 
so I think this is going to be kind of a
wide-open<00:04:39.790> playground<00:04:40.720> for<00:04:41.080> us<00:04:41.169> to<00:04:41.350> kind<00:04:41.919> of

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
wide-open playground for us to kind of

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.500 
wide-open playground for us to kind of
maybe<00:04:42.160> bring<00:04:42.460> some<00:04:42.490> unique<00:04:42.940> things<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.419> the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
maybe bring some unique things to the

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.060 
maybe bring some unique things to the
market<00:04:43.900> okay<00:04:44.500> thanks<00:04:44.979> Gary<00:04:45.190> great<00:04:45.669> thank<00:04:45.970> you
