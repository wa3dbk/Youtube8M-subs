00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:11.629
 we run the barbell top these are basic exercises and 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:13.989
 one of the best for building mass 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:15.839
 delta prominent muscles they are basically 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.809
 acts on their household products 

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:20.390
 overtake ways auxiliary 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.050
 load receive triceps she 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.210
 performed with a story sitting on 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.480
 bench we recommend you 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.660
 perform this exercise sitting on 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.719
 saving with the back it will reduce the harmful 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.719
 workload on the spine 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.490
 tough club have kicks 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.730
 died in the lower back 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.950
 remove the bar from the racks and lift it 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.950
 over the head 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.580
 while inhaling, slowly lower the bar 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.700
 head at 20 30 lower on the exhale 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.020
 squeeze it up 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.020
 grip width should be such that 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.750
 lower point of movement 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.080
 the forearms were vertically 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.280
 smoothly while inhaling 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.410
 exhale powerful up 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.590
 due to the fact that the rod is lowered 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.890
 just for the head load evenly 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.460
 distributed between front and side 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.460
 bunches of farsighted muscles 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.890
 in order to shift the load on 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.560
 front beams pl 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.430
 press the barbell and up unload 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.550
 flow 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.150
 while on vacation something andrew 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.690
 elbows a little lead forward 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.700
 but the barbell is squeezed out 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.670
 also clearly overhead 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.930
 the classic version of doing the same brains 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.439
 people with that stock but be careful so 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.659
 like a dangerous load on the spine in 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.040
 standing mode increases 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.090
 Stop 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.490
 when performing wife faith in the simulator 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.270
 smith 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.890
 you can concentrate more and 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.649
 work in isolation with 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.530
 deltoid muscle length is moving here 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.459
 only vertically and therefore 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.530
 no muscle involved 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.530
 stabilizers 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.089
 performs a mode under full pretoria 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.189
 scramble should not be too 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.499
 artificially 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.119
 or too wide 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:35.119
 do not stand 17 times 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.700
