00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.569
 all welcome back here we offer a small server turkey 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.670
 in the future, typish will come 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.580
 and 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.410
 I don't think it's a shame to do this 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.599
 you have to see a lot how beautiful 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.029
 the self is very far in short, this is probably less 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.900
 then the previous one 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.199
 true server tours is also building shell in dior states or it you 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.029
 on the server 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.249
 and just pure as then they got active as one 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:31.009
 People on these servers can make good ones first on either real behind 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.739
 just bite dog runs you of course have everyone in the team who is in it 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.290
 movie happened 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.190

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.430
 the club to the basement times later 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.430
 well 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.310
 nowadays, it is prohibited to work 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.520
 to have worked for enough money 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.690
 alma countries so many good things don't benefit 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.739

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.370
 alex the back of the house 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.260
 it is made from leaked messages 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.390
 year 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.100
 michael the suspicious packages that 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.350
 for people 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.350
 the inside 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.530
 for a while 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.530
 for a while still a supervisory board 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.700
 we have never been done 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 I don't even know the companies even wiser 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.170

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.770
 wait and see through healthy determine this is what I am doing with those who do these things 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.020
 nicer building is not normal either 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.870
 everybody 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.500
 one is right everyone has a pot but if you have such a fat game outfit just 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.870
 a shame if you have to be tempted to get a store 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.700
 or people that just money is nice language I usually just give the second 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.250
 pot 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.450

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.719
 lost 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.839
 then you might be able to cope with the question of 28, which means that it is not very much 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:17.799
 hard about it 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.020
 and we are upset about people who are really incredibly beautiful 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.409
 they get with steps on and not 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.150
 go out and ask with the square obtained on the lap flat or your new 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.889
 brought 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.709
 it's more about the word 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.709
 buy a ticket if you want to drown checkpoint 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.419

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.419

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.649

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:54.969
 there the gentlemen go in like the newspaper 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.359
 I think so 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.349
 and then have already had this first 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.799
 of course it just stays two plots on the field is not 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.799
 huge amount of market looks welcome 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.309
 slash typish a 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:10.169

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.989

 the initiative also gets to show these are by the 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:33.309
 I think it was initially made 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.559
 so I also filmed last time but I never call shed shed discs 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:37.129

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.429
 Take a quick look at this 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:40.430

 cartels fight each other 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.819
 they were 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.789

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:56.709

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.640

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.059
 which one do you have the chance to just taste extra? 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:44.549
 if you continue to continue after that, then I can even take care of it 

00:04:44.549 --> 00:04:45.469
 that you 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:48.300

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.830
 Bradford look I think the choir is too long a day too late what you think of this one 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.230

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.419
 and some friends 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.849
