00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.220
 Oh 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.340
 this year which is pretty amazing 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.890
 it's the set of runners present at 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.490
 start it's going to be a race quite 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.230
 unbelievable 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.700
 there are a lot of really good runners 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.270
 after I have to make a beautiful 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.830
 race 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.710
 if basically a good race some 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.770
 will be in front of others behind we will see 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.690
 this Saturday morning because if I finish 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.160
 fifth city plateau present well I 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.550
 will be super happy if I realized a 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.550
 good race 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.060
 from the start I was pleasantly 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.650
 surprised it's not gone too fast so 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.110
 I was immediately in a good tempo 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.620
 for an ultra so for me it was 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.620
 perfect 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.899
 what makes this race unique is 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.679
 its wild character and landscapes 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:48.189
 quite amazing about the 160 km on 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:50.170
 crosses three small village but the 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.750
 the rest of the time we are alone in the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.890
 nature has a really wild nature 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.189
 preserved that makes you want to be 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.189
 discovery and rediscovery 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.160
 for me in any case all the passages 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.080
 above 3000 5.17 altitude 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.940
 well the body a little more harm 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.320
 to know how to accept it must know 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.120
 to go more slowly under these latitudes 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.060
 the aca to 4000 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.379
 ok ie it will be better later 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.750
 it's not always easy because at this 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.060
 moment there we feel really slow is 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.260
 at the bottom of the hole but in general 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.379
 goes back down again so it's up to 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.819
 to say like that it'll be worse if 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:54.030
 I can stay with the little guy 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.030
 threatened if that's not all 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.680
 I'm there hard rock silverstone does not have 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.260
 changed it's still amazing 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.720
 and extreme and my race 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.100
 for me theirs is also completely 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.780
 extreme because I'm going 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.840
 maybe further than I am rarely 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.880
 went to the commitment level to finish at 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.730
 four legs almost I got 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.060
 feasted for at well a hundred 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.690
 terminals but after when you course folded into 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.690
 two like that 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.020
 stop the
