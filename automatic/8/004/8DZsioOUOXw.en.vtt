00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 Hello and welcome today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.429
 I want to show you how to get involved 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.929
 safety rope a lot gopro tinker yourself 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.280
 can 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:17.130
 and you need a few for that 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:21.350
 stuff from the angelsport range like 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:27.330
 we can see them, I just 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.500
 what is green has the strength of 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.920
 nine kilo 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.840
 Of course, there is also that in the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.239
 stainless look I never had to 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.040
 that it now shrouds so green here 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.969
 basically no big role in that 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.850
 Employees instead of then you need so 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:54.239
 a vortex is called that gets yes 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:57.230
 also invite the fishing gear he sees 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.920
 out there are also different sizes for 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:06.000
 then you need to solve so small 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.979
 we connect then or 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.390
 then attach the loop many times 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:18.860
 here and tool a pickaxe her 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.240
 can also have a company and one 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.799
 side cutter so that we the jet pipe 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:32.189
 can crop so then can you 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:35.670
 you can still jump little ones with it 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.170
 you keep the special show ahead 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.640
 and other things for some 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.570
 for example, the vortex of the safety rope 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.030
 after that 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:53.299
 we can do that one go pro now 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.870
 either we will have it here afterwards 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.910
 so move then 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.910
 So we make a loop then 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.860
 and the bend then comes through 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:16.920
 then our keeper comes to it 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:21.910
 either way or you make the loops 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.680
 you can see a small axel from the bracket 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.830
 by a flap this could be the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.810
 also put substances and then 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.460
 moor 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.580
 I now do in here a loop 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.500
 the center therefore subsequently one 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.900
 can do program because I need 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.440
 this this assurance style seidel 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.770
 I do not always need I want 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.710
 For example, use Mexico for a motorcycle 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.460
 scooter or automotive and not me 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.200
 I'm sure I'm safe 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.810
 Do not want to go that holder 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.310
 then fastened down I attach 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.570
 then the gopro on this safety rope 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.440
 not now and make the safety rope 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.890
 I then, for example, then I think 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.730
 firmly 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.690
 or turn the safety hook on 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.850
 car on the scooter a fortification if 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.860
 the age of coco drops the seco 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.180
 profanization star secret is in 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.650
 usually we just work 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.959
 Now take this sleep on any 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.600
 length from which we would like to have 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.780
 I do not need time to walk too long 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:41.670
 I'm now 30 cm times the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.670
 side cutter so you can see that too 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.190
 that is not frayed or something like that 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.310
 not my little sleeve gives you too 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.310
 so 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.960
 but then pushes the other piece 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.960
 here in the reef 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:09.820
 so you can see that looks good 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:16.380
 the piece even back that 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:18.670
 Rest just so finds analysis so 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:24.280
 Of course not before the cucumbers and co 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:25.950
 the flabby one is big enough 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.470
 should already have this game 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.110
 I think that's the true size then 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.040
 I take my nickname and presses 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:46.000
 simply effort the couple 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:46.810
 together our flat he could today 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.590
 still at fixed 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.160
 So that's just bombproof could 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.570
 now a few kilos turn to draw 20 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.720
 kilo all that so if the target audience 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.290
 and of that there should be nothing 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.570
 happen 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.410
 so now we can test this here 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.410
 put 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.720
 pen looking very solid so that 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.919
 is already like that on others 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.169
 side of this incident we want 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:30.389
 a possible fasten the pull 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:36.389
 us then it stops so the first 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:41.610
 redeem the tube again then the 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:44.220
 whirl through and then we do that 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:48.449
 we can say again firmly 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.009
 principles with the bend so here must 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.099
 The sleeping patterns are not too big 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.099
 his 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:06.639
 this size cozy actually push that 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.639
 we are together again 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:21.090
 so and now we can for example, the 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.910
 then fix it somewhere thanks to ours 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.490
 service can be opened completely here 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:30.180
 a hang on it and then we can do that 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:33.390
 somewhere on the scooter motorcycle on the handlebar 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.250
 somewhere as the robbers get stuck and 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:39.240
 that's just insurance after said 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.920
 why his team ico pro can do them completely 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.670
 easy and fast copying with little 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:48.530
 effort and yes I hope you have that 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.530
 video and see you next time
