00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.360 
in just a little bit almond Malka like
about<00:02:18.849> a<00:02:19.299> third<00:02:19.989> of<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.230> cup<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.829> loosen<00:02:21.220> up<00:02:21.310> the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
about a third of a cup to loosen up the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.360 
about a third of a cup to loosen up the
mixture<00:02:21.959> once<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:23.140> have<00:02:23.290> everything<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.920> go

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
mixture once you have everything in go

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.979 
mixture once you have everything in go
ahead<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.790> blend<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.569> might<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.959> a

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
ahead and blend this it might be a

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.330 
ahead and blend this it might be a
little<00:02:26.140> bit<00:02:26.319> difficult<00:02:26.739> for<00:02:26.769> you<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.099> blend

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
little bit difficult for you to blend

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.100 
little bit difficult for you to blend
because<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:27.879> is<00:02:28.030> going<00:02:28.299> to<00:02:28.420> be<00:02:28.659> a<00:02:28.840> thick

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
because this is going to be a thick

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.860 
because this is going to be a thick
mixture<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.250> should<00:02:30.579> be<00:02:30.730> thick<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.569> every

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
mixture and it should be thick so every

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.390 
mixture and it should be thick so every
now<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.170> then<00:02:32.260> just<00:02:32.590> take<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.769> spoon<00:02:33.129> or

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
now and then just take a spoon or

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.190 
now and then just take a spoon or
something<00:02:33.549> to<00:02:33.940> loosen<00:02:34.390> up<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.540> mixture<00:02:34.959> and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
something to loosen up the mixture and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.869 
something to loosen up the mixture and
then<00:02:35.440> go<00:02:35.739> ahead<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.010> turn<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.670> blender

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879
