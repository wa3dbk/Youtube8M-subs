00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
and got some sunken colonies there but

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.769 
and got some sunken colonies there but
the<00:00:05.910> only<00:00:06.029> thing<00:00:06.089> is<00:00:06.299> worried<00:00:06.540> about<00:00:06.569> this

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
point is swarm now the hijacking just

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.440 
point is swarm now the hijacking just
ripping<00:00:12.240> apart<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.870> defense's<00:00:13.530> there<00:00:14.450> looks

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
ripping apart the defense's there looks

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.050 
ripping apart the defense's there looks
like<00:00:15.599> PTX<00:00:16.020> just<00:00:16.199> got<00:00:16.350> 11<00:00:17.310> base<00:00:17.520> left<00:00:17.880> is

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
like PTX just got 11 base left is

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.920 
like PTX just got 11 base left is
rebuild<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.539> divine<00:00:19.170> amount<00:00:19.470> moving<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
taking out a Redeemers natural basis

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.080 
taking out a Redeemers natural basis
gonna<00:00:25.350> need<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.800> some<00:00:25.830> more<00:00:26.010> damage<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.430> in

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.359 
gonna need to do some more damage and in
the<00:00:27.240> game<00:00:27.390> here<00:00:27.630> because<00:00:28.220> redeemer<00:00:29.220> is

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the game here because redeemer is

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
expansions and I think they'll be able

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.640 
expansions and I think they'll be able
to<00:02:19.210> do<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.450> filly<00:02:19.690> successfully<00:02:20.320> look<00:02:20.470> over

to do that filly successfully look over

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.480 
to do that filly successfully look over
here<00:02:20.740> we<00:02:20.830> haven't<00:02:21.040> gotten<00:02:21.160> these<00:02:21.250> four

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
take out the spore colonies but this

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.500 
take out the spore colonies but this
other<00:02:30.280> sport<00:02:30.580> con<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.820> can<00:02:30.970> be<00:02:31.060> finished<00:02:31.390> in

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
other sport con is can be finished in

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.110 
other sport con is can be finished in
time<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.990> he's<00:02:32.890> knocking<00:02:33.190> out<00:02:33.310> yeah<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.850> the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
time and he's knocking out yeah and the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.700 
time and he's knocking out yeah and the
other<00:02:34.240> ones<00:02:34.390> there<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:35.020> if<00:02:35.230> he<00:02:35.320> had<00:02:35.410> moved<00:02:35.590> them

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
other ones there so if he had moved them

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.870 
other ones there so if he had moved them
to<00:02:35.800> kill<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.070> drones<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.460> think<00:02:36.640> he<00:02:36.700> would<00:02:36.820> have

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
to kill the drones I think he would have

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.570 
to kill the drones I think he would have
done<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.330> lot<00:02:37.510> more<00:02:37.570> damage<00:02:37.930> there<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.650> now

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
done a lot more damage there and now

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.949 
done a lot more damage there and now
Peter<00:02:39.970> curse<00:02:40.150> obviously<00:02:40.600> still<00:02:40.720> got<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.900> chance

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
Peter curse obviously still got a chance

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.720 
Peter curse obviously still got a chance
to<00:02:41.350> come<00:02:41.709> back<00:02:41.740> in<00:02:41.950> this<00:02:42.040> game<00:02:42.220> by<00:02:42.400> building<00:02:42.700> a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
to come back in this game by building a

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.650 
to come back in this game by building a
lot<00:02:42.850> of<00:02:42.970> fun<00:02:43.120> idolos<00:02:43.630> but<00:02:43.950> yeah<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.220> game<00:02:45.430> is

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
lot of fun idolos but yeah this game is

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.120 
lot of fun idolos but yeah this game is
still<00:02:46.660> quite<00:02:46.900> close<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.200> it's<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.920> really

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
still quite close and it's a really

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.910 
still quite close and it's a really
fascinating<00:02:48.459> game<00:02:49.350> I'm<00:02:50.350> not<00:02:50.590> sure<00:02:50.709> if<00:02:50.770> there

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
fascinating game I'm not sure if there

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.110 
fascinating game I'm not sure if there
are<00:02:51.010> things<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.310> are<00:02:51.430> missing<00:02:51.610> about<00:02:52.000> it

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
are things that are missing about it

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.199 
are things that are missing about it
strategically<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.730> looks<00:02:54.970> like<00:02:55.030> I've

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
strategically but it looks like I've

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.520 
strategically but it looks like I've
covered<00:02:55.420> most<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:55.930> most<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.380> main

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
covered most of that most of the main

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.720 
covered most of that most of the main
things<00:02:58.440> obviously<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.530> can't<00:02:59.980> call<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.340> guys<00:03:00.489> I

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
things obviously I can't call it guys I

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.310 
things obviously I can't call it guys I
don't<00:03:01.270> know<00:03:01.450> who<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:01.810> going<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.020> be<00:03:02.110> able<00:03:02.170> to

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
don't know who is going to be able to

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.400 
don't know who is going to be able to
win<00:03:02.440> this<00:03:03.209> maybe<00:03:04.209> Zerg<00:03:04.570> experts<00:03:05.080> would<00:03:05.230> be

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
win this maybe Zerg experts would be

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.470 
win this maybe Zerg experts would be
able<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.709> really<00:03:06.400> sort<00:03:06.820> of<00:03:06.940> give<00:03:07.450> the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
able to really sort of give the

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.110 
able to really sort of give the
advantage<00:03:07.780> one<00:03:08.140> way<00:03:08.290> or<00:03:08.350> another<00:03:08.410> but<00:03:09.120> it's

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
advantage one way or another but it's

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.550 
advantage one way or another but it's
hard<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.420> tell<00:03:10.630> who's<00:03:10.840> got<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.170> economic

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
hard to tell who's got the economic

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.229 
hard to tell who's got the economic
advantage<00:03:11.950> now<00:03:12.100> we've<00:03:12.220> got<00:03:12.400> those<00:03:12.519> Mueller's

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
advantage now we've got those Mueller's

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.030 
advantage now we've got those Mueller's
from<00:03:13.450> Redeemer<00:03:13.780> turning<00:03:14.290> into<00:03:14.500> guardians<00:03:14.860> and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
from Redeemer turning into guardians and

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.300 
from Redeemer turning into guardians and
that's<00:03:15.489> a<00:03:15.580> pretty<00:03:15.730> good<00:03:15.910> move<00:03:16.090> because<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
that's a pretty good move because the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.470 
that's a pretty good move because the
map<00:03:18.310> isn't<00:03:18.489> fill<00:03:18.730> up<00:03:18.820> with<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:18.970> lot<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.150> units

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
map isn't fill up with a lot of units

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.570 
map isn't fill up with a lot of units
and<00:03:19.660> when<00:03:20.350> you've<00:03:20.470> got<00:03:20.530> any<00:03:20.769> and<00:03:21.220> it's<00:03:21.370> able<00:03:21.459> to

take advantage of cliffs and things that

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.960 
take advantage of cliffs and things that
it<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.739> quite<00:03:24.100> a<00:03:24.130> good<00:03:24.280> way<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.400> getting<00:03:24.519> an

it is quite a good way of getting an

it is quite a good way of getting an
advantage<00:03:25.739> those<00:03:26.739> guardians<00:03:27.190> are<00:03:27.280> way<00:03:27.430> up<00:03:27.549> in

advantage those guardians are way up in

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.949

access<00:03:31.959> pensioner<00:03:32.320> this<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:32.620> quite<00:03:32.799> good<00:03:32.920> I

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
access pensioner this is quite good I

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.229 
access pensioner this is quite good I
think<00:03:33.100> he<00:03:33.310> should<00:03:33.489> be<00:03:33.549> able<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.760> take<00:03:33.910> out<00:03:34.060> this

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
think he should be able to take out this

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.270 
think he should be able to take out this
expansion<00:03:35.019> without<00:03:35.380> too<00:03:35.830> much<00:03:35.920> difficulty

expansion without too much difficulty

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.460 
expansion without too much difficulty
what<00:03:37.239> I'd<00:03:37.330> be<00:03:37.450> doing<00:03:37.480> if<00:03:37.810> I<00:03:37.900> was<00:03:38.019> Peter<00:03:38.290> was

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
what I'd be doing if I was Peter was

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.259 
what I'd be doing if I was Peter was
actually<00:03:38.709> buildings<00:03:39.010> obscure<00:03:39.400> just<00:03:39.640> but<00:03:39.820> the

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
actually buildings obscure just but the

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.570 
actually buildings obscure just but the
thing<00:03:40.450> is<00:03:40.480> he's<00:03:40.690> lost<00:03:40.900> aspire<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.769> not<00:03:42.459> sure

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
thing is he's lost aspire and not sure

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.039 
thing is he's lost aspire and not sure
if<00:03:42.640> he's<00:03:42.670> able<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:43.150> build<00:03:43.330> skirt<00:03:43.660> jizz<00:03:43.810> at<00:03:43.930> this

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
if he's able to build skirt jizz at this

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.630 
if he's able to build skirt jizz at this
point<00:03:44.290> this<00:03:45.100> is<00:03:45.160> what<00:03:45.280> it's<00:03:45.370> talking<00:03:45.459> about

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.560 
point this is what it's talking about
with<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.790> cliffs<00:03:46.060> you're<00:03:46.239> just<00:03:46.390> going<00:03:46.510> to

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
Guardian so that looks like a hatchery

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.920 
Guardian so that looks like a hatchery
going<00:04:00.610> down<00:04:00.730> but<00:04:00.880> in<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.390> meantime<00:04:01.570> we're

actually going to attack going in by
these<00:04:03.220> hydrolysis<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:03.880> that's<00:04:04.570> a<00:04:04.709> perfect

these hydrolysis and that's a perfect

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.300 
these hydrolysis and that's a perfect
dark<00:04:05.920> swarm<00:04:06.220> another<00:04:07.000> one<00:04:07.180> going<00:04:07.330> off<00:04:07.570> and<00:04:08.310> the

dark swarm another one going off and the

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.770 
dark swarm another one going off and the
only<00:04:09.610> thing<00:04:09.700> which<00:04:10.060> didn't<00:04:10.420> stop<00:04:10.510> them<00:04:10.750> from

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
only thing which didn't stop them from

only thing which didn't stop them from

completely wiping the floor at those

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.979 
completely wiping the floor at those
hydrolysis<00:04:12.820> is<00:04:12.970> just<00:04:13.299> like<00:04:13.450> two<00:04:13.720> or<00:04:13.959> three

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
hydrolysis is just like two or three

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.620

them out more Guardians coming in maybe
those<00:05:06.360> those<00:05:06.810> guardians<00:05:07.230> were<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.410> little<00:05:07.680> bit

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
those those guardians were a little bit

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.820 
those those guardians were a little bit
of<00:05:07.890> a<00:05:07.950> waste<00:05:08.130> I'm<00:05:08.940> saying<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.360> wonder<00:05:09.630> just<00:05:09.840> in

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
of a waste I'm saying to wonder just in

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.730 
of a waste I'm saying to wonder just in
terms<00:05:11.010> of<00:05:11.280> resources<00:05:11.730> I<00:05:12.440> don't<00:05:13.440> know<00:05:13.560> what

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
terms of resources I don't know what

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.270

else<00:05:14.240> ridhima<00:05:15.240> will<00:05:15.450> be<00:05:15.540> going<00:05:15.810> for<00:05:16.050> we<00:05:16.860> still

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
else ridhima will be going for we still

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.400 
else ridhima will be going for we still
got<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.490> zoo<00:05:17.640> guns<00:05:17.850> and<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:18.630> defile<00:05:19.080> us<00:05:19.200> but

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
got the zoo guns and and defile us but

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.530 
got the zoo guns and and defile us but
yeah<00:05:20.130> just<00:05:20.340> again<00:05:20.580> he's<00:05:20.730> got<00:05:20.910> nothing<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.330> take

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
yeah just again he's got nothing to take

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.310 
yeah just again he's got nothing to take
out<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:22.130> look<00:05:23.130> is<00:05:23.310> when<00:05:23.460> they<00:05:23.580> show<00:05:23.760> up<00:05:23.870> so<00:05:24.870> I

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
out the look is when they show up so I

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.900 
out the look is when they show up so I
guess<00:05:25.950> that's<00:05:26.130> why<00:05:26.250> it's<00:05:26.400> not<00:05:26.490> trying<00:05:26.730> to<00:05:26.790> do

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
guess that's why it's not trying to do

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.290 
guess that's why it's not trying to do
anything<00:05:26.940> with<00:05:27.480> the<00:05:27.780> zerglings<00:05:28.380> for<00:05:28.650> now<00:05:29.300> yeah

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
anything with the zerglings for now yeah

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.450 
anything with the zerglings for now yeah
man<00:05:30.540> both<00:05:31.170> but<00:05:31.560> both<00:05:31.770> these<00:05:31.920> players<00:05:32.220> are<00:05:32.340> no

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.920 
man both but both these players are no
doubt<00:05:32.610> thinking<00:05:33.060> really<00:05:33.420> really<00:05:33.630> hard<00:05:33.780> about

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
doubt thinking really really hard about

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.570 
doubt thinking really really hard about
what<00:05:34.200> they<00:05:34.320> need<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:34.500> do<00:05:34.680> to<00:05:34.710> win<00:05:34.950> and<00:05:35.160> with<00:05:35.310> fog

what they need to do to win and with fog

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.460 
what they need to do to win and with fog

of war on that's really uncertain as to

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.840 
of war on that's really uncertain as to
what<00:05:37.740> kind<00:05:37.860> of<00:05:37.980> unit<00:05:38.310> your<00:05:38.460> opponent's
