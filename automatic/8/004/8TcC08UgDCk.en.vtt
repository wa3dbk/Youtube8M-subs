00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it comes to that save file so I suggest

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.470 
it comes to that save file so I suggest
backing<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.559> as<00:00:55.949> soon<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.610> possible<00:00:57.180> it's

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
backing that up as soon as possible it's

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.540 
backing that up as soon as possible it's
not<00:00:57.600> guaranteed<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.739> would<00:00:58.949> work<00:00:59.190> but

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
not guaranteed that it would work but

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.090 
not guaranteed that it would work but
you<00:00:59.910> know<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.449> worth<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.840> try<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.469> one<00:01:01.890> more

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you know it's worth a try and one more

getting fixed here in this update which

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.200 
getting fixed here in this update which
is<00:01:15.299> probably<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.110> guarantee<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:18.030> some

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
is probably a guarantee and just some

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.120 
is probably a guarantee and just some
other<00:01:18.299> things<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:18.930> we're<00:01:19.110> kind<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.439> left<00:01:19.950> out

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
other things so we're kind of left out

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.920 
other things so we're kind of left out
of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> loop<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> am<00:01:21.780> going

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
of the loop on this one but I am going

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.800 
of the loop on this one but I am going
to<00:01:22.290> speculate<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.430> say<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.360> probably

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
to speculate here and say for probably

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.620 
to speculate here and say for probably
while<00:01:25.650> most<00:01:25.950> definitely<00:01:26.580> going<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.150> get<00:01:27.420> some

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
while most definitely going to get some

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.289 
while most definitely going to get some
fixes<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> bugs<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.610> glitches<00:01:29.880> in
