bronzer right here is a super light
bronzer<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.510> think<00:02:03.930> would<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.140> better<00:02:04.260> for

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
bronzer I think would be better for

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.590 
bronzer I think would be better for
people<00:02:04.830> with<00:02:05.040> pale<00:02:05.340> skin<00:02:05.369> for<00:02:06.090> me<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.479> actually

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
people with pale skin for me it actually

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.539 
people with pale skin for me it actually
comes<00:02:06.960> out<00:02:07.110> matching<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.710> my<00:02:07.799> skin<00:02:08.099> tone<00:02:08.280> for

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
comes out matching to my skin tone for

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.039 
comes out matching to my skin tone for
the<00:02:08.610> most<00:02:08.819> part<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.299> little<00:02:09.599> bit<00:02:09.720> darker

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
the most part just a little bit darker

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.839 
the most part just a little bit darker
so<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.590> can't<00:02:10.860> really<00:02:10.979> contour<00:02:11.549> with<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
so you can't really contour with that

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.789 
so you can't really contour with that
but<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.420> can<00:02:12.659> contour<00:02:13.140> with<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.440> chocolate

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
but you can contour with the chocolate

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.259 
but you can contour with the chocolate

bronzer that should I care the beach
bunny<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.620> probably<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.040> darkest<00:02:45.460> bronzer

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
if you're more tan I think this is the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.490 
if you're more tan I think this is the
bronzer<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.450> want<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.750> go<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.900> right<00:02:50.200> here<00:02:50.380> the

lasting<00:02:57.430> for<00:02:57.550> 16<00:02:57.880> hours<00:02:58.030> I've<00:02:58.330> actually<00:02:58.600> never

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
lasting for 16 hours I've actually never

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.120 
lasting for 16 hours I've actually never
tried<00:02:59.080> this<00:02:59.170> one<00:02:59.320> yet<00:02:59.350> so<00:02:59.620> I'm<00:02:59.680> super<00:03:00.010> excited

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
tried this one yet so I'm super excited

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.160 
tried this one yet so I'm super excited
but<00:03:00.850> it<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.120> matte<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.720> does<00:03:01.870> look<00:03:01.990> like<00:03:02.140> a

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
but it is matte and it does look like a

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.960 
but it is matte and it does look like a
very<00:03:02.350> pretty<00:03:02.680> shade<00:03:02.920> it's<00:03:03.220> kind<00:03:03.460> of<00:03:03.520> close<00:03:03.730> to

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
very pretty shade it's kind of close to

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.760 
very pretty shade it's kind of close to
the<00:03:04.000> bronze<00:03:04.390> import<00:03:04.990> list<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.440> then<00:03:05.590> milk

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
the bronze import list and then milk

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.930 
the bronze import list and then milk
chocolate<00:03:06.130> Soleil<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:06.580> I<00:03:06.640> think<00:03:06.730> they<00:03:06.910> just

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
chocolate Soleil so I think they just

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.460 
chocolate Soleil so I think they just
combined<00:03:07.360> these<00:03:07.510> two<00:03:07.570> shades<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.110> they<00:03:08.290> made

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
combined these two shades and they made

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.050 
combined these two shades and they made
the<00:03:08.620> 16-hour<00:03:09.100> one<00:03:09.400> that's<00:03:09.670> what<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:09.880> looks

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
the 16-hour one that's what it looks

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.030 
the 16-hour one that's what it looks
like<00:03:10.240> and<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.810> splash<00:03:11.020> center<00:03:11.350> here<00:03:11.620> is<00:03:11.800> the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
like and the splash center here is the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.920 
like and the splash center here is the
Sun<00:03:12.340> bunny<00:03:12.580> bronzer<00:03:13.060> which<00:03:13.240> is<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.420> natural
