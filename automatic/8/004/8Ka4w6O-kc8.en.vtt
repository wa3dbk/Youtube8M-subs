00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.350
 this being the best fair day in my restaurant in amsterdam is one of them 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.249
 have been making steaks on the big green egg for weeks 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:12.639
 we are not really a steak restaurant but we still use it 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.669
 a lot of steak meat a lot of people expect us to ado 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.559
 ready to prepare because that will and that many people expect to be 

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.619
 are going to be called a restaurant but we are not going to do that and we do not think they are 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.220
 so very much that we actually find the least tasty piece of meat 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.339
 what is it is me as a mesh is certainly not 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.310
 and we are now going to try just the five different types of steak 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.710
 have it made on the barbecue and see what it is 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.490
 diamond mason 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.970
 the intention was 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.600
 tokio the hare we have the sails and the 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.480
 nb offer bassets we are now going to speed up the musampa elements 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.480
 are an elongated piece of brook 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.140
 then we have the jordan here 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.940
 cut out a nice steak 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.030
 gap 2000 when popped up 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.160
 and the libian are less citizens are so many beautiful then that they are correct 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.260
 when a box really only cuts one for a suit and then 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.479
 cutting work of the post 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.180
 so this is do team anderson 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.630
 unfortunately 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.830
 Jews resin 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.160
 the sailing 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.370
 and debate became michal barbecue 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.380
 what to do if the restaurant takes a moment and leave the barbecue in it 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.910
 naturalize the two mission parking 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.240
 now they are not going to tackle 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.420
 do them on the barbecue 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.730
 a very small one 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.730
 a small device only first that piece of wind 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.850
 what is there are also with the castle 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.760
 this was the nicest thing there is 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.909
 and then 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.370
 some distance from me other than from polak and I didn't want another 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.480
 of all those trees and fires and that is the best we actually had the 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.480
 barbecue 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.860
 he actually already sees 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.400
 which steak very much 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.180
 but everything is and which 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.409
 Lindeman since the pull you almost broke up that says caught up 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.740
 What all we do with big talk is that we put them on 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.319
 to guess 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.600
 put in the oven 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.909
 what a rest 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.039
 and the faq is with those pieces 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.939
 it is not really good 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.029
 in taste 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.809
 A piece is absolutely beautiful is a nice size if you wormerse for months 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.279
 less strong 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.279
 people get the weirdest antics from ommen 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:27.799
 comes to read aloud with dinand minute fall winds if his holes 8 are just 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.969
 continue and years of active juice erp rider otherwise it must not all be the 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:31.480
 intention 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.040
 first read no salt and pepper gained is completely like the barbecue 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.159
 is so hot 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.569
 do what normally 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.169
 the mat stood 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.819
 takes a bit of pepper already burned here would be much to do the 600 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.799
 put in the barbecue 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.169
 it becomes salt and pepper afterwards 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.799
 and then cutting the meat can cut as it were, cutting the salt and pepper 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.290
 cut the meat 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.290
 in the street on taste 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.579
 we lose a pretty lady for minutes 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.399
 almost done 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:13.999
 is very angry where thermometer chip that above does not win that responds 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.730
 while I immediately open the tap and if you want a steak upstairs 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.189
 in addition, you can exist less naturally 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:25.489
 and he reacts immediately but the out of this is really really good wk final out 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.700
 such a device 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.149
 to take home 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:31.319
 class stays in the kitchen and I can tell you 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.349
 the restaurant does not stink 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.359
 the country fell out 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.359
 the hungarian who is going very fast 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.579
 weather the sun 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.019
 we have here 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.299
 abandoning the Jews 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.759
 as number four 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.759
 the sailing 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.619
 and number five lays on the couch 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:58.259
 received the committed 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.030
 the Australian the sea salt 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.629
 intended use 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.079
 and then we will be back 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.049
 this much fun hans 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.049
 this is the diamond brussels 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.629
 this is the sailing 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.370
 and this first 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.759
 Jews ace 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.030
 and then put the ball of fat on the barbecue separately piece of meat which is very coarse 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:30.300
 is of structure 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.300
 the remains there is very much in terms of structure 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.370
 so this is the bassets 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.680
 one of the things that pops up 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.139
 it is structure that gets bigger and bigger 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.370
 and that is actually quite funny to see 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.180
 is that the debate was in the places where the extreme group of structure 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.030
 left because we can not do more than just beat you if you are like 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.300
 host on your plate 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.099
 but how do you go as a guest he is then again it is a very large piece 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.650
 In the mouth it is therefore already barely 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.260
 on Friday is the bike I say but I did I spit it out of the kennedy road 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.409
 get what had happened once 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.409
 hey that it is best to save the debris 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.729
 then three things you do 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.479
 that in with 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.659
 you don't have the more expensive pieces of meat 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:21.940
 and with 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.669
 steaks that come from the advance so stated it always stands out 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.139
 is that if you take it further 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.589
 talk further banking 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:32.589
 it would give it a little life behind the flavors 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.620
 that more women 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.430
 amazingly beautiful pieces of meat 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.710
 and there what a lot of people expect in a restaurant 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.509
 I think that time has a bit left over 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.469
 I sat them very soft and tender meat but fear that it is done now 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:49.659
 to have 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:51.319
 cold meat as we call it 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:53.039
 is that you have to work first 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.460
 osn 2 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.910
 grind this piece of meat 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.490
 therefore you get very nice made the five types of steak now barbecued 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.490
 are two things that strike me the first 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.389
 is many times cheaper if that with you 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.349
 that said then also popped up 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.849
 that they are driving that price again says the pan 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.520
 he talks about consumer remains the people who buy rosas then the alps 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.680
 around 80 to 100 euros per kilo 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.999
 these pieces of meat do not exceed 15 to 30 euros per kilo 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.020
 for the rest the consumer results 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.400
 and just a most beautiful dhimmitude that still sees and you dare to see the 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.520
 quality of the meat 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.400
 is that there is no objection to horse meat alba 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.910
 And that creates real quality with the meat is that it doesn't get any moisture out 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.779
 it has not been frozen so nice ending it is not very fresh 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.990
 and say not very fresh meat should not be very far 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.650
 If legend is also dependent on the muscle tissue is broken down 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.319
 allowing the meat man to race 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.620
 in between meats we talk about this, rights talk about that in between 

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.550
 the 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.110
 three and five weeks 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.030
 Downfall has been they left anyway Wisgerhof the experienced wk but it watches 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.410
 capture so that muscle tissue breaks it down 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.619
 and that is becoming forest 

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:05.619
 however, that said the whole cliché 

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:09.689
 o'clock
