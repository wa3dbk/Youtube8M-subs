this and if you can look at the shape

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.200 
this and if you can look at the shape
that<00:00:46.800> they're<00:00:47.070> cut<00:00:47.280> will<00:00:47.430> actually<00:00:47.879> curled

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
that they're cut will actually curled

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.790 
that they're cut will actually curled
them<00:00:48.390> Conda<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:48.960> my<00:00:49.110> hair<00:00:49.289> straightener<00:00:49.590> but

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
them Conda with my hair straightener but

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.490 
them Conda with my hair straightener but
if<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.879> wasn't<00:00:51.090> curled<00:00:51.719> there's<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.379> couple

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
if it wasn't curled there's a couple

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.350 
if it wasn't curled there's a couple
strides<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.340> could<00:00:53.579> get<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.030> I'm<00:00:54.239> not

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
strides that I could get but I'm not

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.229 
strides that I could get but I'm not
gonna<00:00:54.449> do<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.600> right<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.079> if<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.890> see

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
gonna do that right now but if you see

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.209 
gonna do that right now but if you see
it's<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.629> kind<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.559> an<00:00:58.890> angle

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
it's just kind of like this at an angle

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.790 
it's just kind of like this at an angle
but<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.030> good<00:01:00.359> way<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:00.960> I've<00:01:01.260> found

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
but a good way to do it that I've found

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.920 
but a good way to do it that I've found
is<00:01:02.190> good<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.149> take<00:01:03.270> your<00:01:03.420> bags<00:01:03.600> all<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
is good is to take your bags all of a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.420 
is good is to take your bags all of a
sudden<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.530> looks<00:01:04.710> really<00:01:04.890> funny<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
sudden I this looks really funny and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.060 
sudden I this looks really funny and
take<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> opposite<00:01:06.960> side<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.530> cut

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
take it to the opposite side and cut

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.880 
take it to the opposite side and cut
like<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.930> like<00:01:09.930> kind<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.229> edit<00:01:10.500> angle<00:01:10.740> down

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
like that like kind of edit angle down

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.100 
like that like kind of edit angle down
the<00:01:11.100> opposite<00:01:11.670> way<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:12.750> once<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.020> flip

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the opposite way and then once you flip

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.109 
the opposite way and then once you flip
them<00:01:13.290> back<00:01:13.470> they'll<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.400> way<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.610> want

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
them back they'll be the way you want

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.450 
them back they'll be the way you want
them<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.570> also<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.990> take<00:01:16.439> mine<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.979> like

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
them and then also I take mine I like

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.499 
them and then also I take mine I like
them<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> little<00:01:17.970> bit<00:01:18.090> later<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.330> like

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
them to be a little bit later I like

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.940 
them to be a little bit later I like
there<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.750> shorter<00:01:19.080> ones<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
there to be shorter ones up here and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.410 
there to be shorter ones up here and
longer<00:01:20.310> ones<00:01:20.490> down<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.210> when

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
longer ones down here just so that when

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.109 
longer ones down here just so that when
I<00:01:21.450> straighten<00:01:22.110> them<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.380> curl<00:01:22.560> them<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:23.340> it

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
I straighten them and curl them it it

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.050 
I straighten them and curl them it it
just<00:01:24.210> looks<00:01:24.659> better<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.080> me<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.490> what<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:26.909> is

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
just looks better to me so what I do is

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.969 
just looks better to me so what I do is
I<00:01:27.450> kind<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:27.869> take<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> layer<00:01:28.409> top<00:01:28.799> layer

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
I kind of just take a layer top layer

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.190 
I kind of just take a layer top layer
like<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:30.060> it'll<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.630> look<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:30.869> that

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
like this and it'll just look like that

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.569 
like this and it'll just look like that
and<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.829> kind<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.040> trim<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.400> one<00:01:32.549> a

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and I just kind of trim this one a

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.789 
and I just kind of trim this one a
little<00:01:32.790> bit<00:01:32.970> shorter<00:01:33.270> doing<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
little bit shorter doing that all the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.620 
little bit shorter doing that all the
way<00:01:34.890> through<00:01:35.130> until<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.610> find<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.450> best

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
way through until I just find the best

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.960 
way through until I just find the best
way<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.049> looks<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.530> me<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:38.729> what<00:01:38.880> I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
way it looks for me and so that's what I

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.670 
way it looks for me and so that's what I
do<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:39.900> gonna<00:01:40.020> straighten<00:01:40.439> I'm<00:01:40.560> reel

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
and you do the full flip and hold it and

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.590 
and you do the full flip and hold it and
pull<00:04:19.830> it<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.070> side<00:04:20.160> like<00:04:20.370> that<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:21.150> let<00:04:21.359> go
