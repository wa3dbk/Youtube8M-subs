not that much difference thing all they
gotta<00:03:40.079> do<00:03:40.199> is<00:03:40.229> move<00:03:40.440> up<00:03:40.620> much<00:03:41.069> on<00:03:41.280> the

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
gotta do is move up much on the

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.460 
gotta do is move up much on the
racetrack<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.909> it<00:03:42.180> changed<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:42.900> well<00:03:43.169> they
