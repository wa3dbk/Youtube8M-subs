00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.640
 according to here, more like an hour is 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.430
 like a little good series I do not know no 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.489
 only that is because if it is a series 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:31.460
 I'm going to walk around making a list but 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:34.509
 a series of tutorials for marvel vs 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.509
 capcom 3 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.649
 we will see what is the former factor or 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.360
 factor x as you want to call it good 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.230
 training to be able to explain better 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.750
 and more calmly that is how to use it and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.309
 when to use it this video I think that 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.110
 they had many others I will explain what 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.110
 is the former factor what 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.320
 come the world alone 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:15.620
 I remind you to subscribe to my channel 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.380
 drive access for more videos so chingón 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.990
 and what is also the channel 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.790
 of mazzini films please remember 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.370
 comment all the videos and subscribe 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.230
 I like it so that more people 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.140
 can continue watching this video that in 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.040
 little active 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.060
 and good 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.450
 at 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.939
 the former factor is this thing that I'm 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.600
 pointing out at this moment that little 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.970
 red dot if several times depending 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.610
 As configured, it may be that the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.610
 exact let me 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.850
 please 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.140
 the former factor because the infinite good is 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.549
 playing training for the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.989
 infinity you activate it as many times 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:12.739
 you want and normal you can only use it one 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.860
 time but then of course once and this of x 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.660
 normal factor for example if it 's level 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.110
 1 means you will not be able to 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.569
 use until one of your three 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.160
 players because you always start with 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.299
 three players until one of them 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.830
 has been knocked out or killed 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.580
 level 2 is until 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.230
 the truth 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.270
 but so the number one is when when 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.040
 nobody is dead you can use it on 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.410
 level 2 is when only one of these 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.770
 members that is when one of your friends 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.190
 allies to the knockout you can already use it or 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.190
 be alone until two already or until 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.220
 that two of your characters are already 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.810
 dead already put what has been the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.970
 former center the infinity 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:07.250
 and good parks can be activated from this 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.900
 way by pressing what is the button 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.640
 rt or right trigger as you call it 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.630
 pressing rt which is the one with which 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.290
 You approach the enemy 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.370
 you move them away and pressing the button and the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.370
 same time in this way 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.959
 and that's the former factor that the tea that 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.680
 it serves the factor it is the factor what it 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.140
 does is increase your speed when attacking 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.730
 your attack is much stronger and you 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.000
 defense also for example if 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.430
 to do it 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.450
 good an example let's say that this wing 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:51.260
 Spencer tells me how special I 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.540
 I cover myself but not if I do not have 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.310
 the factor team starts me 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.530
 go down a bit on the side that is life 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.110
 but if I have asset it's factor and I 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.830
 I cover my defense increases up to the rank 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.830
 of what 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.960
 that my life diminishes us even though he 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.850
 is hitting me as long as I have 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.500
 the inspector activated now of cataluña 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.310
 was the former actor may be in note 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.349
 special like this 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.620
 so they see it is not active factor 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:23.389
 the former factor can make a slight 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.980
 pause during during as special 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.770
 example I will do what is the same 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.540
 as I just do now and from iu to 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.340
 half of how I'm going to do the former factor 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.120
 stop and see what happens 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.930
 water how 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.930
 exact 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.800
 but it has to be fast 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.800
 then well being what is the combo 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.080
 different 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.080
 x factor 'and again and how is this 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.090
 but obviously not working what is a 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.170
 what is life for life your bar 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.850
 of energy that is the one down here 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.250
 at level 15 obviously if it's going to 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.910
 just go down to make a slight 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.910
 never pause 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.240
 then that was what it was and that was the 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.630
 ex factor 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:34.139
 like us to that oblivion 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.660
 comment me down here on the cobras and 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.880
 comment on the comments that are 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.789
 difficult to see if I can help you if 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.050
 it can be a video of that and because otherwise 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.050
 at the same hype lying 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.020
 is that although 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.430
 perfect 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.440
 perfect good that was all subscribe 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.810
 please for more videos like these 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.610
 but not because of the quality of my video 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.860
 my 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.810
 of my dialogues and so on 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.090
 and that was all I leave plan 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.610
 tics racks for my frankenstein channel 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.810
 and for the channel of machines jones that 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.810
 it was everything and see you later
