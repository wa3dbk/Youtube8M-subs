00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.899
 ways to start the week and we're going to 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.530

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.580
 try this good to see what by the name 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.580
 I imagined it was 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.620
 a kind of the afternoon pulls but of 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.150
 won what's good 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.130
 finally choose your fighter and I'm 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.020
 loading loading loaded and hanging 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.040
 dismembered but to see what it is about 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.040
 this and 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.960
 it is with this that he said the and with this 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.950
 He said the weapons are worth then let's choose 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.600
 a sword of fire because it is not already 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.460
 I understand nothing heads 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.190
 I like this we go for the last 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.190
 which are the maximums that it seems with 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.110
 a gladiator helmet is worth torsos 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.730
 by their torsos torsos torsos we are going to 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.199
 choose the black the black I like 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.030
 quite 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.760
 Let's see how it looks like a little batman 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.190
 we go around here for those mattresses and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.130
 the arms so this is simply 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.080
 I want is to choose the parts of the body 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.460
 so that in the end I become a player and 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.860
 legs let's take the greens that 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.390
 They seem a little ninja turtle for me 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.530
 are giving like a lot and jerks and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.580
 I think it's because it's loading I do not know 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.940
 more than upload the advertising of the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.960
 page is the advertising page is 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.159
 loading and I'm given a lot of 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.240
 look and this is the saying that I have left 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.450
 well there are going to be these guarantees that are 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.890
 of these maps that are cool but not 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.780
 are to play them for it we are going to 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.460
 start with a good start we're not going to 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.039
 with the third map attempt with a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.710
 sword launcher which we pricked 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.600
 a little bit the feet is the perfect one to see 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.610
 If he pulls me what a girl comes with 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.560
 the ax I'm going to real everyone to this 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.600
 so that it is back 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.700
 and the cattle and that I had one 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.549
 I live but but but it is said that 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.420
 victory is victory you can survive 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.420
 we can always survive 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.770
 is that the head is survived without 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.560
 deadlines I have the stumps but it's what 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.799
 important that I have a healthy head well 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.799
 all right 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.709
 let's see what is this 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.709
 cottons 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.730
 the ibex the following is mainly 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:26.030
 if I can make the last jump drop 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.470
 and so he reached the end almost reaches the end 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.340
 let's try again hear me was 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.830
 being the fact that it's not going to 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.660

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.620

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.660
 eyes to not see it there we have it 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.419
 second attempt we brake a little bit 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.440
 we grab there and we fall here almost to the 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.050
 limit 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.700

 hook has broken my arm 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.320

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.940
 throwing of end balls gonzález 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.540

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.380
 to try 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.100
 nothing is missing us a lot 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:28.000
 and come help perfect death not the 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:31.180
 I have it is that it is wrong and I am going to 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.300
 death and damn death and you leave me 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.860
 swollen trunk or with the trunk is worth 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.230
 worth it is worth a little bit of peace or a 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.730
 little bit of peace before he said he was doing well and 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.220

 with this salmon that is happy girls and 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.630

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.990

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.580
 fallen well that I have let go before 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.690
 I would have fallen the spikes but good is 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.960
 that there was no information 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.150
 Look how good it looks that from here on never 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.350
 I heard I say that there is no passing and the cam of 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.430
 voucher 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.430

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.910
 the deafness just left me tubules 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:17.650

 justin bieber you call that path that 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.720
 could have taken everyone by 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.880
 ahead but it was not better to stay 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.880
 punctured and cut and see if we kill 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.889

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.210
 motilla a la borda la montilla and we go to 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.310
