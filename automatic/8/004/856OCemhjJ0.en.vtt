King<00:00:32.510> but<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.540> figured<00:00:33.809> it'd<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.559> better<00:00:34.800> than<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
King but I figured it'd be better than a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.600 
King but I figured it'd be better than a
label<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.640> hey<00:00:35.850> Shh<00:00:36.649> too<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.860> it'd<00:00:37.980> be<00:00:38.010> easier

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
label as a hey Shh too so it'd be easier

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.139 
label as a hey Shh too so it'd be easier
to<00:00:38.670> reference<00:00:39.149> later<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:41.460> sends<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.090> a
