pretty good balance of videos i guess i

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.309 
pretty good balance of videos i guess i
should<00:03:26.150> say<00:03:26.420> even<00:03:26.720> though<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:26.930> doesn't<00:03:27.049> really

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
should say even though it doesn't really

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.050 
should say even though it doesn't really
make<00:03:27.440> any<00:03:27.500> sense<00:03:27.859> but<00:03:28.190> anyways<00:03:28.579> hope<00:03:28.819> you<00:03:28.910> guys

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
make any sense but anyways hope you guys
