00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.420 
thick plastic but with a little cut out
here<00:00:35.380> so<00:00:35.559> you<00:00:35.649> can<00:00:35.770> be<00:00:35.860> able<00:00:35.980> to<00:00:36.070> pick<00:00:36.190> it<00:00:36.220> up

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.930 

maybe<00:00:39.430> pick<00:00:39.760> up<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.980> I<00:00:42.520> guess<00:00:42.730> this<00:00:42.880> little

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.970 
edge here this black little rim it's
like<00:00:46.900> another<00:00:47.140> thick<00:00:47.410> layer<00:00:48.480> gives<00:00:49.480> it<00:00:49.630> a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
like another thick layer gives it a

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.290 
like another thick layer gives it a
little<00:00:50.980> way<00:00:51.220> on<00:00:51.400> it<00:00:51.550> so<00:00:51.700> it'll<00:00:51.790> stay<00:00:52.030> there<00:00:52.180> as

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
little way on it so it'll stay there as

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.050 
little way on it so it'll stay there as
you<00:00:52.420> play<00:00:52.660> won't<00:00:52.930> bounce<00:00:53.170> up<00:00:53.560> and<00:00:53.740> down<00:00:54.060> then

we have this one with a little hole cut
out<00:00:56.650> on<00:00:56.829> it<00:00:57.390> gives<00:00:58.390> it<00:00:58.510> a<00:00:58.630> slight<00:00:59.230> different
