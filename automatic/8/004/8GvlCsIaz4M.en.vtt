renovated or MX a good off trail
performance<00:01:08.330> my<00:01:09.330> opinion<00:01:09.720> could<00:01:09.869> use<00:01:10.020> an

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
performance my opinion could use an

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.649 
performance my opinion could use an
uncoupled<00:01:11.100> rear<00:01:11.250> suspension<00:01:11.850> might<00:01:12.479> make<00:01:12.630> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
uncoupled rear suspension might make a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.780 
uncoupled rear suspension might make a
little<00:01:12.869> better<00:01:13.110> off<00:01:13.320> trail<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:13.920> certainly

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
little better off trail but certainly

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.940 
little better off trail but certainly
the<00:01:14.909> couple<00:01:15.180> rear<00:01:15.360> suspension<00:01:15.900> improves<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the couple rear suspension improves the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.770 
the couple rear suspension improves the
ride<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.310> trail<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.450> good<00:01:18.570> good

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
ride on trail so it's a good good

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.380 
ride on trail so it's a good good
compromise<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.800> off<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.390> definitely

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
compromise on and off and definitely

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.200 
compromise on and off and definitely
better<00:01:21.509> suited<00:01:21.840> off<00:01:21.990> trail<00:01:22.229> than<00:01:22.410> on<00:01:22.500> trail

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
better suited off trail than on trail
