00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:13.190
 [Music] 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.420
 relax friend that every day brings his 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.599
 own fans 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.599
 [Music] 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.189
 [Applause] 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.980
 the word surrender does not exist in my 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.380
 vocabulary 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.840
 but let me tell you something 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.840
 as here and your daughter are also going to 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.989
 disappear 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.989
 [Music] 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.020
 there are hatreds that do not end with death 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.020
 there are revenges that go beyond 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.890
 you 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.690
 now she is a free woman bruno if she 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.320
 you are going to lead him and you go to 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.320
 condemn you 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.640
 I dont know 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.380
 a coin is too little to decide 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.380
 my future 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.070
 [Music] 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.070
 because what he says 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.730
 some also with ways 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.950
 what to expect 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.770
 Wait here 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.950
 wait I think the pattern but it will be 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.950
 something 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.369
 when I tell you that the iguana is green 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.770
 it's because I have stepped on it 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.450
 it happens true I am saying pattern and 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.220
 you will say that I insist a lot with the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.960
 issue but is that if this is way of 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.780
 position in which you help with the delivery 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.700
 of such 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.080
 because it can not happen to them 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.160
 come here to tell you tomba 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.110
 deliver them to collect the silver 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.700
 he has forgiven me blanques to four months 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.380
 that would give what it would give if it were theirs 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.380
 if you went to them but 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.220
 I always have an ace up my sleeve 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.110
 [Music] 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.890
 now
