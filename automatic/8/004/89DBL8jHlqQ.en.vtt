00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
now the thing is that these are few

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.849 
now the thing is that these are few
concepts<00:00:03.149> that<00:00:03.540> you<00:00:03.750> got<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:04.020> understand<00:00:04.620> if

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
concepts that you got to understand if

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.190 
concepts that you got to understand if
you<00:00:04.980> understand<00:00:05.580> those<00:00:05.790> concepts<00:00:06.569> then

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
you understand those concepts then

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.890 
you understand those concepts then
you'll<00:00:07.379> get<00:00:07.589> bonus<00:00:07.890> marks<00:00:08.460> in<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.700> exam<00:00:08.900> the

you'll get bonus marks in the exam the
first<00:00:09.929> thing<00:00:10.410> I'm<00:00:10.530> going<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.860> explain<00:00:11.400> each<00:00:11.700> of

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
first thing I'm going to explain each of

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.720 
first thing I'm going to explain each of
the<00:00:11.969> maps<00:00:12.240> sail<00:00:12.690> now<00:00:13.469> as<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.799> as<00:00:14.099> we<00:00:14.340> all<00:00:14.460> know

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
the maps sail now as you as we all know

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.599 
the maps sail now as you as we all know
a<00:00:15.000> map<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.260> made<00:00:16.470> smaller<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.460> order

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
a map that to be made smaller in order

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.900 
a map that to be made smaller in order
to<00:00:17.789> fill<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.300> onto<00:00:18.859> the<00:00:19.859> piece<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.160> paper<00:00:20.310> all

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
to fill it onto the piece of paper all

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.980 
to fill it onto the piece of paper all
on<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.449> whiteboard

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:37.529 

you

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.630 

so<00:00:38.289> the<00:00:38.410> first<00:00:38.679> thing<00:00:38.949> I'm<00:00:39.070> going<00:00:39.280> to<00:00:39.429> talk

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
so the first thing I'm going to talk

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.240 
so the first thing I'm going to talk
about<00:00:39.670> is<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.870> light<00:00:41.079> scale<00:00:41.500> or<00:00:41.769> the<00:00:41.800> linear

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
about is the light scale or the linear

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.380 
about is the light scale or the linear
scale<00:00:42.370> we<00:00:43.000> normally<00:00:43.420> see<00:00:43.750> over<00:00:44.680> here

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
scale we normally see over here

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.420 
scale we normally see over here
somewhere<00:00:46.390> in<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.539> corner<00:00:46.780> of<00:00:47.079> the<00:00:47.260> map<00:00:47.500> or<00:00:47.800> on

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
somewhere in the corner of the map or on

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.079 
somewhere in the corner of the map or on
the<00:00:49.180> mat<00:00:49.420> key<00:00:50.219> now<00:00:51.219> that<00:00:51.430> is<00:00:51.550> what<00:00:51.760> it<00:00:51.850> looks

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
the mat key now that is what it looks

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.240 
the mat key now that is what it looks
like<00:00:52.210> you'll<00:00:52.629> see<00:00:52.870> these<00:00:53.079> a<00:00:53.140> straight<00:00:53.949> line

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
like you'll see these a straight line

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.180 
like you'll see these a straight line
and<00:00:54.549> then<00:00:55.390> some<00:00:55.659> numbers<00:00:56.079> D<00:00:56.289> at<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.649> top<00:00:56.890> note

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
and then some numbers D at the top note

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.779 
and then some numbers D at the top note
100<00:00:57.850> 200<00:00:58.329> 300<00:00:58.989> kilometers<00:00:59.649> and<00:00:59.890> at<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:00.579> bottom

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:12.480 
100 200 300 kilometers and at the bottom
note<00:01:01.239> 100<00:01:02.019> 200<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:02.589> 300<00:01:03.399> miles

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.050 

as<00:01:14.170> you<00:01:15.170> can<00:01:15.320> see<00:01:15.590> here<00:01:15.890> I<00:01:16.130> just<00:01:16.190> do<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.790> line

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
as you can see here I just do the line

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.120 
as you can see here I just do the line
scale<00:01:17.510> over<00:01:18.050> on<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:18.500> on<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:18.920> whiteboard

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
scale over on this on the whiteboard

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.650 
scale over on this on the whiteboard
over<00:01:19.520> yo<00:01:19.760> and<00:01:21.460> like<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:22.580> said<00:01:22.820> not<00:01:23.060> hundred<00:01:23.540> two

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
over yo and like I said not hundred two

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.210 
over yo and like I said not hundred two
hundred<00:01:23.690> three<00:01:24.050> hundred<00:01:24.260> four<00:01:24.530> hundred<00:01:24.830> and

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
hundred three hundred four hundred and

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.609 
hundred three hundred four hundred and
five<00:01:25.460> hundred<00:01:25.520> kilometers<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.780> forgot<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.350> put

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
five hundred kilometers I forgot to put

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.770 
five hundred kilometers I forgot to put
the<00:01:27.830> unit<00:01:28.400> of<00:01:28.490> measurement<00:01:28.880> in<00:01:29.240> Bay

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
the unit of measurement in Bay

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.160 
the unit of measurement in Bay
now<00:01:30.940> what<00:01:31.940> this<00:01:32.270> scale<00:01:32.810> tells<00:01:33.320> you<00:01:33.680> is<00:01:33.979> that

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
now what this scale tells you is that

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.210 
now what this scale tells you is that
from<00:01:36.170> here<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:37.369> here<00:01:37.700> on<00:01:37.940> your<00:01:38.390> map<00:01:38.750> is<00:01:39.050> a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
from here to here on your map is a

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:50.680 
from here to here on your map is a
hundred<00:01:40.220> kilometers

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.440 

so<00:01:51.690> even<00:01:52.050> if<00:01:52.440> this<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.310> let's<00:01:53.640> say<00:01:53.880> one

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
so even if this is let's say one

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.640 
so even if this is let's say one
centimeter<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.710> your<00:01:56.310> map<00:01:56.750> then<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:58.080> real<00:01:58.410> life

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
centimeter on your map then in real life

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.790 
centimeter on your map then in real life
it<00:01:59.130> would<00:01:59.430> be<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.880> hundred<00:02:00.200> kilometers<00:02:01.200> so

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
it would be a hundred kilometers so

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.070 
it would be a hundred kilometers so
let's<00:02:02.010> make<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.490> bit<00:02:02.520> practical<00:02:03.480> a<00:02:03.720> bit<00:02:03.870> more

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
let's make it a bit practical a bit more

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.930 
let's make it a bit practical a bit more
practical<00:02:04.530> yeh<00:02:04.860> let's<00:02:05.370> say<00:02:05.640> for<00:02:05.910> example

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
practical yeh let's say for example

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.780 
practical yeh let's say for example
you've<00:02:06.570> got<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.810> map<00:02:07.110> let's<00:02:08.040> say<00:02:08.280> these<00:02:08.490> your

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
you've got a map let's say these your

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.310 
you've got a map let's say these your
map<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:10.880> this<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:12.000> your<00:02:12.180> scale<00:02:12.630> right<00:02:13.020> there

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
map and this is your scale right there

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.410 
map and this is your scale right there
the<00:02:13.500> tough<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:14.160> let's<00:02:14.430> say<00:02:14.580> for<00:02:14.850> example

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the tough so let's say for example

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.580 
the tough so let's say for example
there's<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.660> place<00:02:15.990> here<00:02:16.020> at<00:02:16.470> Point<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:18.590> you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
there's a place here at Point a and you

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.160 
there's a place here at Point a and you
must<00:02:19.860> measure<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.640> distance<00:02:21.240> from<00:02:21.390> point<00:02:21.900> A

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
must measure the distance from point A

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.050 
must measure the distance from point A
all<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.130> way<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.580> point<00:02:23.850> B<00:02:25.610> now<00:02:26.610> what<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:27.030> are

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
all the way to point B now what you are

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.810 
all the way to point B now what you are
going<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.570> do<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:28.080> really<00:02:28.380> simple<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.550> are<00:02:29.700> now

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
going to do is really simple you are now

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.050 
going to do is really simple you are now
going<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.300> use<00:02:31.070> your<00:02:32.070> ruler<00:02:32.460> not<00:02:32.790> for

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
going to use your ruler not for

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.620 
going to use your ruler not for
argument's<00:02:33.690> sake<00:02:33.840> let's<00:02:34.110> say<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:35.790> these<00:02:36.360> are

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
argument's sake let's say this these are

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.080 
argument's sake let's say this these are
centimeters<00:02:37.560> then<00:02:38.340> you're<00:02:38.520> going<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.880> take

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
centimeters then you're going to take

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.500 
centimeters then you're going to take
your<00:02:39.300> ruler<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.930> don't<00:02:40.830> ever<00:02:41.480> obviously<00:02:42.480> a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
your ruler I don't ever obviously a

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.720 
your ruler I don't ever obviously a
linear<00:02:42.840> ruler<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.560> with<00:02:44.190> these<00:02:44.340> measurements

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
linear ruler and with these measurements

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.910 
linear ruler and with these measurements
yet<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.630> I'm<00:02:45.720> going<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.020> improvise<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:46.680> I'm

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
yet so I'm going to improvise but I'm

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.820 
yet so I'm going to improvise but I'm
going<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.250> draw<00:02:47.430> my<00:02:47.640> ruler<00:02:48.030> over<00:02:48.210> here<00:02:54.770> okay<00:02:55.770> so

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
going to draw my ruler over here okay so

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.520 
going to draw my ruler over here okay so
this<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.520> one<00:02:56.790> centimeter<00:02:57.300> two<00:02:57.810> centimeters

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
this is one centimeter two centimeters

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.960 
let's make it four point five
centimeters<00:03:18.350> now<00:03:19.350> if<00:03:19.470> your<00:03:19.709> teacher<00:03:20.010> asks<00:03:20.430> you

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
centimeters now if your teacher asks you

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.449 
centimeters now if your teacher asks you
to<00:03:21.450> calculate<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:22.080> distance<00:03:22.530> will<00:03:23.040> define

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
to calculate the distance will define

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.260 
to calculate the distance will define
the<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.300> real<00:03:24.570> distance<00:03:25.430> from<00:03:26.430> between<00:03:26.940> point

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
the the real distance from between point

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.440 
the the real distance from between point
a<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.600> point<00:03:28.200> B<00:03:28.470> then<00:03:28.770> you<00:03:28.920> simply<00:03:29.430> measure<00:03:30.030> it

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
a and point B then you simply measure it

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.750 
a and point B then you simply measure it
and<00:03:30.600> then<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.650> go<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:31.890> look<00:03:32.160> on<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.430> scale

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
and then you go and look on the scale

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.020 
and then you go and look on the scale
each<00:03:33.030> other<00:03:33.380> 4.5<00:03:34.380> centimeters<00:03:34.650> thing<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:35.850> is

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
each other 4.5 centimeters thing this is

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.180 
each other 4.5 centimeters thing this is
one<00:03:36.270> centimeter<00:03:36.750> two<00:03:37.170> centimeters<00:03:37.950> three

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
one centimeter two centimeters three

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.050 
one centimeter two centimeters three
centimeters

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
centimeters

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.630 
centimeters
four<00:03:39.330> but<00:03:39.870> we<00:03:40.080> measured<00:03:40.410> for<00:03:40.650> point<00:03:40.950> five<00:03:41.280> so

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
four but we measured for point five so

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.850 
four but we measured for point five so
it<00:03:41.730> must<00:03:41.910> be<00:03:41.970> halfway<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:42.540> between<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:43.350> we

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
it must be halfway in between and we

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.320 
it must be halfway in between and we
know<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.930> 100<00:03:45.930> divided<00:03:46.350> by<00:03:46.380> two<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:47.010> 50<00:03:47.760> so

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
know that 100 divided by two is 50 so

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.640 
know that 100 divided by two is 50 so
it's<00:03:48.930> four<00:03:49.260> hundred<00:03:49.290> plus<00:03:49.800> that<00:03:50.040> 50

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
it's four hundred plus that 50

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.369 
it's four hundred plus that 50
and<00:03:50.739> so<00:03:50.950> you'll<00:03:51.220> get<00:03:52.349> 450<00:03:53.549> kilometers<00:03:55.260> this<00:03:56.260> is

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
and so you'll get 450 kilometers this is

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.119 
and so you'll get 450 kilometers this is
how<00:03:56.500> easy<00:03:56.860> it<00:03:57.099> is<00:03:57.310> we<00:03:57.730> started<00:03:58.150> off<00:03:58.420> by<00:03:58.450> saying

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
how easy it is we started off by saying

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.670 
how easy it is we started off by saying
there's<00:04:00.129> a<00:04:00.340> certain<00:04:01.150> place<00:04:01.390> a<00:04:01.689> and<00:04:02.230> there's<00:04:02.560> a

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
there's a certain place a and there's a

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.289 
there's a certain place a and there's a
point<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.280> their<00:04:03.459> place<00:04:03.849> B<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:06.000> your<00:04:07.000> teacher

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
point and their place B and your teacher

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.800 
point and their place B and your teacher
is<00:04:07.540> asking<00:04:08.200> you<00:04:08.409> to<00:04:08.709> give<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.819> real<00:04:10.390> distance

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
is asking you to give the real distance

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.770 
is asking you to give the real distance
or<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.439> distance<00:04:11.470> in<00:04:12.069> reality<00:04:12.640> between<00:04:13.299> these

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
or the distance in reality between these

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.650 
or the distance in reality between these
two<00:04:14.140> places<00:04:14.470> now<00:04:14.980> as<00:04:15.250> soon<00:04:15.609> as<00:04:15.879> you<00:04:16.209> get<00:04:16.600> a

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
two places now as soon as you get a

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.779 
two places now as soon as you get a
question<00:04:17.259> like<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.470> where<00:04:18.070> you<00:04:18.190> have<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.549> say

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
question like that where you have to say

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.879 
question like that where you have to say
what<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.090> real<00:04:19.209> distance<00:04:19.870> is<00:04:20.019> remember<00:04:20.650> you

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
what the real distance is remember you

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.540 
what the real distance is remember you
are<00:04:20.979> going<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.609> use<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.600> scale<00:04:22.990> now<00:04:23.889> this

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
are going to use the scale now this

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.420 
are going to use the scale now this
scale<00:04:24.940> might<00:04:25.240> not<00:04:25.539> necessarily<00:04:25.750> be<00:04:26.430> measured

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
scale might not necessarily be measured

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.850 
scale might not necessarily be measured
in<00:04:27.639> centimeters<00:04:28.479> it<00:04:28.660> could<00:04:29.260> be<00:04:29.440> some<00:04:29.650> other

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
in centimeters it could be some other

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.129 
in centimeters it could be some other
random<00:04:30.190> little<00:04:30.940> distance<00:04:31.539> and<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:31.840> is<00:04:31.930> where

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
random little distance and that is where

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.870 
random little distance and that is where
you<00:04:32.260> have<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.560> improvise<00:04:33.010> a<00:04:33.070> bit<00:04:33.220> that<00:04:33.760> is

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
you have to improvise a bit that is

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.640 
you have to improvise a bit that is
where<00:04:34.090> you<00:04:34.180> can<00:04:34.330> take<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:34.539> piece<00:04:34.810> of<00:04:34.960> paper<00:04:35.139> and

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
where you can take a piece of paper and

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.460 
where you can take a piece of paper and
simply<00:04:36.580> put<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.970> piece<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.449> paper<00:04:37.630> just<00:04:38.139> below

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
simply put the piece of paper just below

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.120 
simply put the piece of paper just below
the<00:04:38.710> scale<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:39.400> measure<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:41.260> distances<00:04:41.949> as

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
the scale and measure the distances as

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.680 
the scale and measure the distances as
you<00:04:42.400> see<00:04:42.669> it<00:04:42.760> here<00:04:42.910> on<00:04:43.120> your<00:04:43.300> piece<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.539> paper

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
you see it here on your piece of paper

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.370 
you see it here on your piece of paper
and<00:04:44.199> then<00:04:44.770> you<00:04:44.949> go<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.660> place<00:04:46.930> where<00:04:47.260> you

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
and then you go to the place where you

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.620 
and then you go to the place where you
have<00:04:47.410> to<00:04:47.740> calculate<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.490> distance<00:04:48.759> you<00:04:49.419> put

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
have to calculate the distance you put

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.210 
have to calculate the distance you put
your<00:04:49.810> piece<00:04:49.990> of<00:04:50.020> paper<00:04:50.380> in<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.740> take<00:04:50.949> this<00:04:51.099> is

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
your piece of paper in it take this is

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.100 
your piece of paper in it take this is
your<00:04:51.340> piece<00:04:51.520> of<00:04:51.639> paper<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.210> you<00:04:52.900> make<00:04:53.080> no

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
your piece of paper and you make no

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.170 
your piece of paper and you make no
measurements<00:04:53.889> as<00:04:54.039> it<00:04:54.310> is<00:04:54.430> over<00:04:54.729> there<00:04:54.940> and

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
measurements as it is over there and

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.710 
measurements as it is over there and
then<00:04:55.840> you<00:04:56.020> can<00:04:56.280> easily<00:04:57.280> measure<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:58.419> real

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
then you can easily measure the real

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.150 
then you can easily measure the real
distance<00:04:59.289> between<00:04:59.710> point<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:00.750> point<00:05:01.750> B<00:05:02.160> so

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
distance between point a and point B so
