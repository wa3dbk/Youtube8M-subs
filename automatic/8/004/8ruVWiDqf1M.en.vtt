00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.350
 I go over people are all that 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.090
 how are you welcome one of the 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.860
 front in today's chapter I'm going 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.320
 to talk about a tool 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.370
 quite useful pretty effective that is going 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.740
 to serve you for the moment 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.350
 study moment 99 or if you seek 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.269
 a moment of relaxation or a moment of 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.640
 personal meditation to get with your 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:25.570
 I cause an inner being and thus achieve a 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.150
 level of extreme unconsciousness 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.250
 well that was very exaggerated the truth of 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.590
 the things is that this little system 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.930
 as you see and some glasses that have 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.059
 Inside, some LEDs allow the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.430
 person reach a certain level of 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.140
 concentration 8 this level stimulation 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.059
 at the neuronal level producing an effect 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.400
 positive and activating certain area of 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.230
 brain naturally non-invasive and 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.150
 best of all that this system is 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.860
 free so guys I invite you 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.190
 cordially to the next video from the side 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.190
 of the clock 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.420
 Y 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.610
 plus 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.590
 good people let's start with the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.290
 design and development to build 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.690
 our own mental glasses what 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.690
 you need first to have is this 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.509
 then the old connectors that 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.890
 they had our printer the first 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.990
 that they disappeared that they had this 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.170
 parallel port entry that are 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.009
 seeing that this cable is not going to use 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.610
 what we really need is this 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.520
 is this 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.470
 ok this piece is this part this cable 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.450
 we do not need it and we have to 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.580
 cut it we have to cut it as much 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.530
 close to this to this extreme since 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.850
 We will not play this one when it 's 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.780
 explaining on this side the welding 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.600
 there is this type of numbering and 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.429
 on the side of the exit is this guy 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.720
 Numbering 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.720
 and this is true here in the quebrada 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.770
 so by that little training or 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.080
 location of the cables we are going to 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:30.260
 have to perform the next circuit 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.260
 to build the connection of the LEDs 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.120
 and you can see how the connection of the 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.629
 leds 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.090
 our system is here each one these 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.640
 are the LEDs as you can see this the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.310
 position that you must have to perform the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.319
 type of connection as you can see this is 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.530
 the anode at this point and this is the case 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.110
 therefore all the ends of the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.599
 anode of each decade led 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.260
 at this point they are connected in a node 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:05.440
 or common terminal and at the other end the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.150
 cato go in these respective pins that 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.629
 you can see there but they are the 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.519
 pins that has the connector and 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.430
 I was previously naming and what 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.739
 same for this side come here highlight 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.040
 the pins to which they have to go 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.049
 soldiers realize here is it 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.080
 find this are the cables that are 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.540
 here connected 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.940
 and apparently it looks quite complicated to 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.860
 first sight because it is upside of 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.390
 go around 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.390
 and this supposes 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.380
 I recommend it to do this this 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.230
 connection make a kind of plates 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.560
 portals with some x-ray paper 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.090
 as you can see this is a rebellion 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.690
 forward I cut it, the ideal is 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.360
 do it together that is not separate 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.550
 and in this way it allows to locate well 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.410
 the LEDs and try to weld without any 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.220
 problem and of course so that it is 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.190
 fixed in this way in mind that is the 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.480
 idea or the objective pursued 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.130
 So that 's the way it has 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.300
 connect the LEDs and place them 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.040
 respectively in 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:21.350
 on the portalet plate and good and that's what 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:25.389
 more complicated to do this part of the 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.310
 system to stimulate our brain 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:32.389
 then what do you have to do 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:36.070
 is to take your glasses take adosarle 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.070
 here a kind of 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.760
 protector because it prevents the passage of 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.650
 external light and this way it generates a 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.440
 absolute darkness inside the 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.600
 box that ignore this it turns out that I had 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.810
 a problem with the system and I had to 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.190
 fix it here this was stuck here 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.680
 this has to go this way that 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.130
 are your glasses they have to go 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.130
 placed 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:04.730
 and finally we are going to get more or less 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.000
 what you are seeing now but 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:10.490
 here we have an eva rubber cover 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.820
 is covering there to make it darker 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.200
 the inside of the lenses and there they are 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:22.000
 our connected LEDs 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.770
 and its corresponding output from this 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.830
 way we have designed it in an easy way 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.350
 some mental glasses 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.740
 Now let's prove it works 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.960
 effectively in our computer 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.990
 good and now I 'm going to show you how 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:42.070
 when they will be ready for 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.750
 is absolutely well installed at 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.260
 time to connect all the LEDs 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.260
 they should learn 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.210
 to check it 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.569
 and indeed the LEDs have turned on 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.639
 immediately once connected 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:05.550
 they realize does not require any kind of 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.899
 software or driver forgiveness is not left 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.119
 No controller type to install 

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:11.580
 these after days only detect them 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:15.330
 the system immediately turns on 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:18.449
 now we are going to use the software that 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:22.300
 allows the manipulation and work of 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:25.319
 way that in a synchronized way 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.319
 and good people 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.010
 Once we have already 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.820
 configured installed our and 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:36.190
 made our mental glasses see 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.830
 they are connected me when trying 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.110
 look at me here here file this is the 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.690
 this is the gay programming program 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.340
 braille alpha way ok but leave down the 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:49.630
 description so they have it 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.630
 in these options 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:56.939
 a little screen that is also called 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:59.849
 there often have fade music and layers 

00:06:56.939 --> 00:07:02.580
 mental and here mental glasses 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:06.319
 connected mark this box and it is the 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.319
 test there says text 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.710
 and automatically recognizes it 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:16.540
 now we can change it leave the port 

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:19.410
 and put it inverted 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.410
 we said that 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:23.919
 will work in the opposite direction 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.320
 every time the program marks a 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:31.980
 little light 

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.510
 here in the glasses the light will appear and 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.969
 They will appear LEDs that are 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.699
 disconnected in it 

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:40.789
 the computer and the camera is going to 

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:40.789
 drink 

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.960
 ah
