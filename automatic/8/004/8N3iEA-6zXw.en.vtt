00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.770 
this allows players to access the list
of<00:02:01.649> players<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.490> their<00:02:02.729> joined<00:02:03.090> lobby<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
of players in their joined lobby and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.590 
of players in their joined lobby and
that<00:02:04.380> basically<00:02:04.680> means<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.670> mute<00:02:05.969> view

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
that basically means you can mute view

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.169 
that basically means you can mute view
profiles<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.530> stats<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:08.069> everyone<00:02:08.879> that's<00:02:09.060> in

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
profiles and stats on everyone that's in

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.369 
profiles and stats on everyone that's in
your<00:02:09.330> lobby<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.750> that's<00:02:09.929> pretty<00:02:10.200> helpful

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
your lobby so that's pretty helpful

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.110

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.430 
fixed an exploit where players were able
to<00:02:25.080> give<00:02:25.590> nos<00:02:26.240> boosts<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.420> their<00:02:27.810> car<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
to give nos boosts on their car the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.949 
to give nos boosts on their car the
nitrous<00:02:28.920> boosts<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.850> basically<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:30.720> went

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
nitrous boosts so basically what went

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.199 
nitrous boosts so basically what went
down<00:02:31.080> about<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:32.310> know<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.610> week<00:02:32.880> ago<00:02:33.000> or

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
down about you know a week ago or

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.600 
down about you know a week ago or
throughout<00:02:33.840> last<00:02:34.110> week<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.740> did<00:02:35.010> not<00:02:35.400> cover

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
throughout last week I did not cover

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.300 
throughout last week I did not cover
this<00:02:35.820> on<00:02:36.030> my<00:02:36.150> channel<00:02:36.600> because<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.350> didn't

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
this on my channel because I didn't

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.270 
this on my channel because I didn't
really<00:02:38.459> care<00:02:38.580> about<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.330> but<00:02:39.900> um<00:02:40.200> people<00:02:40.920> found

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
really care about it but um people found

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.540 
really care about it but um people found
a<00:02:41.430> way<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.670> put<00:02:42.540> nitrous<00:02:43.110> boosts<00:02:43.620> on<00:02:43.770> cars<00:02:44.250> and

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
a way to put nitrous boosts on cars and

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.970 
a way to put nitrous boosts on cars and
then<00:02:44.819> mod<00:02:45.060> them<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.420> online<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.200> then<00:02:46.650> people

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
then mod them in online and then people

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.800 
then mod them in online and then people
could<00:02:47.100> save<00:02:47.370> them<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.820> their<00:02:48.000> garages<00:02:48.360> what

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
could save them in their garages what

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.199 
could save them in their garages what
they've<00:02:49.380> actually<00:02:49.530> done<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:50.340> instead<00:02:51.060> of

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
they've actually done is instead of

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.360 
they've actually done is instead of
taking<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.630> cars<00:02:51.989> away<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.350> believe<00:02:52.860> what

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
taking the cars away I believe what

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.130 
taking the cars away I believe what
they've<00:02:53.550> done<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:54.060> they've<00:02:54.330> just<00:02:54.540> taken<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
they've done is they've just taken the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.530 
they've done is they've just taken the
nitrous<00:02:55.709> boosts<00:02:56.220> out<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.850> game<00:02:57.090> so

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
nitrous boosts out of the game so

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.780 
nitrous boosts out of the game so
whatever<00:02:58.230> car<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.920> thought<00:02:59.280> had<00:02:59.580> a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
whatever car that you thought had a

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.479 
whatever car that you thought had a
nitrous<00:03:00.360> boost<00:03:00.660> on<00:03:00.930> has<00:03:01.530> now<00:03:01.890> been<00:03:02.220> removed

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
nitrous boost on has now been removed

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.090 
nitrous boost on has now been removed
the<00:03:03.030> car<00:03:03.269> still<00:03:03.660> exists<00:03:04.290> correct<00:03:04.709> me<00:03:04.800> if<00:03:04.860> I'm

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
the car still exists correct me if I'm

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.310 
the car still exists correct me if I'm
wrong<00:03:05.130> but<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.550> think<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:06.060> car<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.570> still<00:03:07.260> in

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
wrong but I think the car is still in

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.500 
wrong but I think the car is still in
your<00:03:07.560> garage<00:03:07.709> but<00:03:08.670> they've<00:03:08.820> taken<00:03:09.120> off<00:03:09.390> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
your garage but they've taken off the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.199 
your garage but they've taken off the
nitrous<00:03:09.959> boost<00:03:10.260> it's<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.769> basically<00:03:11.489> it's

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
nitrous boost it's like basically it's

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.960 
nitrous boost it's like basically it's
drained<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:13.019> out<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.709> system<00:03:13.950> but<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.700> car

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
drained it out of the system but the car

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.570 
drained it out of the system but the car
still<00:03:15.000> exists<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.200> I'm<00:03:16.680> not<00:03:17.070> too<00:03:17.310> sure<00:03:17.550> about

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
still exists so I'm not too sure about

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.600 
still exists so I'm not too sure about
the<00:03:18.209> whole<00:03:18.540> situation<00:03:18.780> but<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.890> think<00:03:20.400> that's

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
the whole situation but I think that's

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.759
