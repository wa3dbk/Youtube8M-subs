00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
so you're good there it's actually

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.810 
so you're good there it's actually
really<00:00:33.989> easy<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.890> only<00:00:35.010> built<00:00:35.250> four<00:00:35.489> steps

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
really easy it's only built four steps

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.729 
really easy it's only built four steps
i'm<00:00:36.090> pretty<00:00:36.270> sure<00:00:36.390> three<00:00:36.960> or<00:00:37.079> four<00:00:37.260> steps<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
i'm pretty sure three or four steps and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.369 
i'm pretty sure three or four steps and
it<00:00:38.430> works<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.760> all<00:00:38.940> servers<00:00:39.210> both<00:00:39.930> private

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
it works on all servers both private

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.920 
it works on all servers both private

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
both types of servers and plus it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.400 
both types of servers and plus it
involves<00:00:55.980> closing<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> game<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.809> private

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410

think<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.579> matters<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.420> stand<00:01:30.810> up<00:01:31.020> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
think it matters but just stand up and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.319 
think it matters but just stand up and
it<00:01:31.920> appears<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.520> server<00:01:32.759> was<00:01:32.970> actually

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
it appears that that server was actually

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.010 
it appears that that server was actually
full<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.770> we're<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:35.880> get<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.689> one

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
full so we're going to just get on one

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.649 
full so we're going to just get on one
here<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.979> has<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.579> actually<00:01:39.030> spawns<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
here that has that actually spawns you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.410
