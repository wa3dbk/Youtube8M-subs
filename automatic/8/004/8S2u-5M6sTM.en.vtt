payments as a possibility that you could

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.200 
payments as a possibility that you could
come<00:00:51.690> up<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.469> their<00:00:53.160> late<00:00:53.399> payments<00:00:53.879> out<00:00:54.059> of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
your Lease Option fee but that will

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.200 
your Lease Option fee but that will
dramatically<00:00:56.250> reduce<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.670> amount<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.059> money

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
dramatically reduce the amount of money

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.450 
dramatically reduce the amount of money
that<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.469> do<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.770> dealers<00:00:59.219> and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
that you can get to do that dealers and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.189 
that you can get to do that dealers and
I<00:00:59.520> don't<00:00:59.699> usually<00:00:59.820> take<00:01:00.120> deals<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.600> but

I don't usually take deals like that but

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.720 
I don't usually take deals like that but
you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.500> look<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.219> decide<00:01:02.399> for

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
you can look at that and decide for

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.120 
you can look at that and decide for
yourself<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:04.489> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.670> also<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
yourself and then you can also have the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.380 
yourself and then you can also have the
seller<00:01:08.130> talk<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.939> their<00:01:09.060> mortgage<00:01:09.240> company

modification<00:01:10.890> which<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.909> becoming<00:01:12.180> more<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
modification which is becoming more and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.750 
modification which is becoming more and
more<00:01:12.689> difficult<00:01:12.930> these<00:01:13.320> days<00:01:13.400> for<00:01:14.400> them<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> do

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
more difficult these days for them to do

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.920 
more difficult these days for them to do
it<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.090> might<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.330> possible<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.689> them<00:01:15.810> to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it but it might be possible for them to

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.149 
it but it might be possible for them to
bring<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.259> current<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.680> then<00:01:16.830> make<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
bring it current and then make the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.830 
bring it current and then make the
payments<00:01:17.549> over<00:01:17.700> time<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.479> way<00:01:18.659> you'll

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
payments over time that way you'll

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.570 
payments over time that way you'll
protect<00:01:19.170> your<00:01:19.350> buyer<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> transaction

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
protect your buyer in the transaction

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.670 
protect your buyer in the transaction
and<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.820> seller<00:01:21.509> will<00:01:21.750> be<00:01:21.840> back<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.259> track<00:01:22.500> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
and the seller will be back on track and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.710 
and the seller will be back on track and
get<00:01:22.770> their<00:01:22.920> credit<00:01:23.100> straightened<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.759> over

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
get their credit straightened out over

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.649 
get their credit straightened out over
time<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.340> real<00:01:26.580> benefit<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.299> they<00:01:27.360> can

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
time so it's a real benefit if they can

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.960 
time so it's a real benefit if they can
pull<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.049> off<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.619> if<00:01:29.189> they<00:01:29.310> can't<00:01:29.670> I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
pull that off but if they can't I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.789 
pull that off but if they can't I
wouldn't<00:01:30.270> spend<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.600> lot<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.900> time<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> deal

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
wouldn't spend a lot of time with a deal

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.319 
wouldn't spend a lot of time with a deal
like<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.189> unless<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.939> can<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.210> it

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
like that unless you can get it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.310

one is you buy properties substantially

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.429 
one is you buy properties substantially
under<00:01:41.310> market<00:01:41.340> value<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:41.909> cash<00:01:42.240> or<00:01:42.540> two<00:01:43.140> you

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
under market value for cash or two you

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.870 
under market value for cash or two you
buy<00:01:43.560> properties<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.159> are<00:01:44.250> closer<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.549> market

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
buy properties that are closer to market

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
you could sell it on terms if you buy it

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.179 
you could sell it on terms if you buy it
for<00:01:54.450> cash<00:01:54.689> yeah<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.799> even<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:56.070> an

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
for cash yeah you can even do an

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.190 
for cash yeah you can even do an
assignment<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:56.880> cash<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.079> it

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
assignment for cash if you can get it

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.380 
assignment for cash if you can get it
low<00:01:58.409> enough<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.950> price<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.909> remember<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
low enough in price but remember the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.609 
low enough in price but remember the
person<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> sell<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.110> has<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.409> come<00:02:01.530> up

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
person you sell it to has to come up

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.569 
person you sell it to has to come up
with<00:02:01.740> cash<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.219> makes<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.430> more

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
with cash and that makes it more

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.520 
with cash and that makes it more
difficult<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:03.180> them<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.170> means<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.409> have

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
difficult for them so it means you have

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.560 
difficult for them so it means you have
fewer<00:02:04.890> people<00:02:05.189> that'll<00:02:05.820> buy<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.149> property

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
fewer people that'll buy that property

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.119 
fewer people that'll buy that property
so<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.049> want<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.320> focus<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:07.740> properties<00:02:08.099> that

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
so you want to focus on properties that

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.130 
so you want to focus on properties that
you<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.429> sell<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.640> terms<00:02:09.000> most<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> time

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you can sell on terms most of the time

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.900 
you can sell on terms most of the time
because<00:02:10.379> it'll<00:02:11.069> make<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.310> easier<00:02:11.640> for<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.879> to

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
because it'll make it easier for you to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.059 
because it'll make it easier for you to
sell

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
sell

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.500 
sell
we<00:02:13.129> know<00:02:13.249> that<00:02:13.459> if<00:02:13.549> we<00:02:13.640> take<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:13.879> property<00:02:14.329> on<00:02:14.390> a

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.390 
we know that if we take a property on a
lease<00:02:14.599> option<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.230> it's<00:02:15.530> properly<00:02:16.129> priced

lease option and it's properly priced

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.550 
lease option and it's properly priced
not<00:02:17.030> just<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.389> purchase<00:02:17.749> price<00:02:18.200> but<00:02:18.439> the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
not just the purchase price but the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.349 
not just the purchase price but the
actual<00:02:18.829> monthly<00:02:19.219> payment<00:02:19.700> which<00:02:19.999> is<00:02:20.030> much

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
actual monthly payment which is much

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.459 
actual monthly payment which is much
more<00:02:20.540> important<00:02:20.870> than<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.049> purchase<00:02:21.319> price

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:21.469 
more important than the purchase price

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.259 
more important than the purchase price
purchase<00:02:21.889> price<00:02:22.040> can<00:02:22.189> be<00:02:22.280> high<00:02:22.459> but<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
purchase price can be high but the

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.789 
purchase price can be high but the
monthly<00:02:23.510> payment<00:02:23.900> has<00:02:24.019> to<00:02:24.049> be<00:02:24.200> in<00:02:24.379> line<00:02:24.590> with

negative<00:04:30.220> cash<00:04:30.490> flow<00:04:30.820> if<00:04:31.060> they<00:04:31.240> only<00:04:31.390> get

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
negative cash flow if they only get

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.140 
negative cash flow if they only get
$2,800<00:04:32.530> a<00:04:32.770> month<00:04:32.920> income<00:04:33.550> on<00:04:33.670> that<00:04:33.700> property

$2,800 a month income on that property

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.480 
$2,800 a month income on that property

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
but the seller having $49 a month

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.670 
but the seller having $49 a month
negative<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.180> much<00:04:37.630> better<00:04:37.900> than<00:04:38.380> them<00:04:38.530> having

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680

a<00:04:38.950> $4,200<00:04:39.910> a<00:04:40.000> month<00:04:40.120> negative<00:04:40.720> that's<00:04:41.230> why

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
a $4,200 a month negative that's why

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.320 
a $4,200 a month negative that's why
this<00:04:41.500> works<00:04:42.010> because<00:04:42.430> it<00:04:42.610> makes<00:04:42.850> sense<00:04:43.120> for

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
this works because it makes sense for
