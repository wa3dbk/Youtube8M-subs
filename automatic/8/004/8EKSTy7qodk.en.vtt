00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.529
 the use we give to the bicycle there is no reason to limit it to the ofi the sport 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.660
 are an efficient means of locomotion that we could use 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.580
 daily in our urban displacements to nothing that the 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.380
 cities will have an adequate deployment of infrastructures and 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.229
 services that promote this use of the bicycle 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.730
 what you have to remember is a silent vehicle 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.280
 that does not pollute the air or consume more energy than the one who produces it and 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.010
 who drives it 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.230
 it's also healthy because cycling around the city we burn calories 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.350
 and we exercise however, despite the fact that its use represents so many advantages 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.230
 the bikes can hardly be seen in our cities, we might ask if there is not 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.890
 because the public authorities who manage the affairs of locomotion 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.870
 urban do not promote today even hinder the use of the bike as a means 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.630
 of transport in the cities 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.620
 consumer eroski has carried out a study in 18 capitals of our country and has 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.020
 verified that in two of them there is not a single kilometer of bike lane that in 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.860
 three there is only one kilometer of decí lane for every 50 thousand inhabitants 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.330
 and that only in vitoria and pamplona this figure improves the one kilometer mark 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.790
 bike lane every five thousand inhabitants 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.680
 thereto 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.660
 In addition, the insufficient number of bicycle parks and the lousy connection 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.770
 these with public transport 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.990
 there are also few cities that have launched 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.239
 Bike rental systems for use by citizens 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.700
 In short, ex-albo few exceptions the cities continue 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.350
 ignoring even despising the bicycle as a means of displacement 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.680
 urban 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.120
 of the 18 with stops the cities worst equipped to move by bike 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.559
 alicante and oviedo who failed the exam with a very bad club 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:13.929
 and here they do not have a single kilometer of bicycle lanes nor do they count 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:16.819
 with public bicycle rental service 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.000
 Murcia also suspends because it has no rent and because its allocation of 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.639
 bike lanes is minimal 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:30.430
 something similar happens in málaga granada valencia and to coruña that also 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.429
 suspended in this case with a simple evil 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.069
 at the opposite end are Barcelona 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:43.889
 córdoba san sebastián sevilla y vitoria who achieved a good as a note 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.269
 final 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.499
 meanwhile pamplona valladolid and zaragoza received an acceptable 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:52.079
 while 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.659
 and Santander overtook us 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:55.789
 regular 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.109
 but not everything is also quantity the quality of this road networks for 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.290
 cyclists and influence their employment promoting it 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.959
 uu dissuading the hypothetical hiti user 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.999
 it was analyzed the state of the bike lanes in the city were counted on them 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:14.619
 and the average valuation did not exceed the acceptable one, mainly due to the 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:18.829
 lack of parking and spa and insufficient signaling 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:23.219
 however, the maintenance of these bicycle lanes was generally rated 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:24.199
 of very good 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.589
 as well as its security conditions 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:32.129
 It was also found that only 18% of bicycle lanes had 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.269
 specific traffic lights for cyclists on the other hand spaces for 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.739
 park the bikes and leave them in a safe place until their next use come 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.169
 indispensable 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:47.689
 excels only Barcelona with its 14 thousand bike parks very far but in 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:53.749
 second place is san sebastián with 590 of these specific facilities 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.829
 to park the city bicycles 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.810
 worst equipped was Valladolid that had only 66 parking facilities 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:06.159
 also of course the two lacking bike lanes that 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.619
 let's remember 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:09.369
 oviedo already alicante 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:10.439
 However 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.910
 of the study of the two 89 bike parks that analyzed 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.019
 consumer eroski emerges an average note of evil de vido 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.960
 which tram obviously place 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.509
 is the fic ultra its use 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.749
 reasons are adduced slowly 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:48.569
 That's enough reason
