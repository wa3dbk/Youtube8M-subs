until eventually well the bread escapes

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.980 
until eventually well the bread escapes
outside<00:02:05.120> and<00:02:06.120> that's<00:02:06.330> when<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> kind<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.840> have

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
outside and that's when you kind of have

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.630 
outside and that's when you kind of have
to<00:02:07.080> start<00:02:07.550> so<00:02:08.550> being<00:02:08.790> smart<00:02:09.149> about

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
to start so being smart about

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.870 
to start so being smart about
how<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.210> move<00:02:11.510> what<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.080> avoid<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:13.550> also

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
how you move what you avoid and also

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.699 
how you move what you avoid and also
working<00:02:14.330> out<00:02:14.569> how<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.810> actually<00:02:15.050> become<00:02:15.440> toast

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
working out how to actually become toast

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.500 
working out how to actually become toast
so<00:02:16.459> you<00:02:16.520> guys<00:02:16.730> are<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:16.880> folks<00:02:17.090> most<00:02:17.330> surgeons

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
so you guys are the folks most surgeons

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.910 
so you guys are the folks most surgeons
in<00:02:17.870> yeah<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:18.860> again<00:02:19.670> we've<00:02:19.970> had<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.150> very<00:02:20.920> long

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
in yeah so again we've had a very long

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.900 
in yeah so again we've had a very long
process

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
process

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.850 
process
of<00:02:24.270> getting<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.960> am<00:02:25.440> bread<00:02:25.650> contour<00:02:26.160> on

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.320 

touch<00:02:29.860> devices<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.790> will<00:02:30.940> say<00:02:31.090> this

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
touch devices and I will say this

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.690 
touch devices and I will say this
preview<00:02:31.959> builds<00:02:32.319> so<00:02:32.800> yeah<00:02:33.069> their<00:02:33.310> looms<00:02:33.519> are

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
preview builds so yeah their looms are

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.589 
preview builds so yeah their looms are
subject<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.120> change
