the middle of the game in the middle of
a<00:02:26.480> game<00:02:26.860> we've<00:02:27.860> actually<00:02:28.040> had<00:02:28.310> cases<00:02:28.670> at<00:02:28.820> buck

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
a game we've actually had cases at buck

a game we've actually had cases at buck
in<00:02:29.180> way<00:02:29.630> back<00:02:29.840> we<00:02:30.350> think<00:02:30.860> we've<00:02:30.980> eliminated

in way back we think we've eliminated

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.400 
in way back we think we've eliminated
most<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.180> these<00:02:32.269> where<00:02:32.510> someone<00:02:33.079> walked<00:02:33.290> in

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
most of these where someone walked in

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.229 
most of these where someone walked in
the<00:02:33.500> dugout<00:02:33.799> during<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.130> game<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.489> know<00:02:35.180> you

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
the dugout during the game you know you

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.500 
the dugout during the game you know you
can<00:02:35.510> imagine<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.989> reaction<00:02:36.470> from<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.739> coach

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
can imagine the reaction from the coach

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.430 
can imagine the reaction from the coach
but<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.750> know<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.900> first<00:02:39.079> thing<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.260> want<00:02:39.380> to

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
but you know the first thing you want to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.630 
but you know the first thing you want to
try<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.590> do<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.769> take<00:02:39.890> emotion<00:02:40.130> out<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:40.489> and

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
try to do is take emotion out of it and

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.979 
try to do is take emotion out of it and
the<00:02:40.730> best<00:02:40.910> way<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.060> take<00:02:41.239> emotion<00:02:41.540> out<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.810> it

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
the best way to take emotion out of it

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.470 
the best way to take emotion out of it
is<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.620> do<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.920> 24<00:02:43.310> hour<00:02:43.459> rule<00:02:43.700> which<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.239> think

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
is to do the 24 hour rule which I think

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.009 
is to do the 24 hour rule which I think
almost<00:02:44.630> every<00:02:45.049> league<00:02:45.260> now<00:02:45.530> has<00:02:46.040> instituted

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
almost every league now has instituted

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.449 
almost every league now has instituted
we<00:02:48.019> would<00:02:48.170> like<00:02:48.350> for<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.590> parents<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.130> sit

times<00:03:42.769> than<00:03:42.950> not<00:03:43.180> you'll<00:03:44.180> find<00:03:44.480> out<00:03:44.690> that<00:03:44.840> the

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
times than not you'll find out that the

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.780 
times than not you'll find out that the
coach<00:03:45.200> has<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.769> different<00:03:46.129> perspective<00:03:46.310> and

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
coach has a different perspective and

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.949 
coach has a different perspective and
when<00:03:47.060> that<00:03:47.150> coach<00:03:47.389> shares

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
when that coach shares

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.599 
when that coach shares
well<00:03:48.379> the<00:03:48.560> skill<00:03:48.829> level<00:03:49.159> is<00:03:49.220> not<00:03:49.340> where<00:03:49.519> it

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
well the skill level is not where it

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.869 
well the skill level is not where it
needs<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:49.879> be<00:03:50.019> then<00:03:51.019> it's<00:03:51.200> okay<00:03:51.590> how<00:03:52.459> can<00:03:52.519> we

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
needs to be then it's okay how can we

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.599 
needs to be then it's okay how can we
get<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.359> that<00:03:53.810> skill<00:03:54.799> level<00:03:55.129> you<00:03:55.220> know<00:03:55.400> and

get to that skill level you know and

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.250 
get to that skill level you know and
it's<00:03:56.060> coaching<00:03:56.359> the<00:03:56.599> child<00:03:56.840> up<00:03:57.079> with

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
it's coaching the child up with

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.869 
it's coaching the child up with
different<00:03:57.470> techniques<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.190> knowing<00:03:58.849> that

different techniques and knowing that

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.550 
different techniques and knowing that
the<00:03:59.060> coach<00:03:59.269> of<00:03:59.599> the<00:03:59.780> child<00:04:00.049> would<00:04:00.200> spend<00:04:00.409> some

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
the coach of the child would spend some

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.020 
the coach of the child would spend some
more<00:04:00.650> time<00:04:00.709> on<00:04:00.920> an<00:04:01.190> activity<00:04:01.870> so<00:04:03.609> backing<00:04:04.609> up<00:04:04.909> a

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
more time on an activity so backing up a

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.670 
more time on an activity so backing up a
little<00:04:05.060> bit<00:04:05.420> when<00:04:05.870> you<00:04:05.959> address<00:04:06.260> it<00:04:06.409> with<00:04:06.530> your

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.740 
little bit when you address it with your
child<00:04:07.099> I<00:04:07.489> would<00:04:07.940> think<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.180> would<00:04:08.209> also<00:04:08.389> be

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
child I would think it would also be

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.530 
child I would think it would also be
important<00:04:09.500> not<00:04:09.909> to<00:04:10.909> front-load<00:04:11.239> that

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
important not to front-load that

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.089 
important not to front-load that
conversation<00:04:12.230> with<00:04:12.409> your<00:04:12.500> kid<00:04:12.769> because<00:04:12.919> the

conversation with your kid because the

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.220

today's game in general or practice in

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:34.450 
today's game in general or practice in

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
and I don't think we'd give them enough

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.580 
and I don't think we'd give them enough
credit<00:04:37.880> for<00:04:38.330> them<00:04:38.810> knowing<00:04:38.990> what's<00:04:39.199> going<00:04:39.349> on

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
credit for them knowing what's going on

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.140 
credit for them knowing what's going on
sometimes<00:04:39.860> yeah<00:04:40.340> in<00:04:40.520> case<00:04:40.669> that's<00:04:40.910> a<00:04:40.970> very

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
sometimes yeah in case that's a very

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.219 
sometimes yeah in case that's a very
good<00:04:41.270> point<00:04:41.449> because<00:04:41.599> you<00:04:41.930> know<00:04:42.020> when<00:04:42.139> I

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
good point because you know when I

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.689 
good point because you know when I
thought<00:04:42.380> about<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.650> 24-hour<00:04:43.160> rule<00:04:43.370> with<00:04:43.580> the
