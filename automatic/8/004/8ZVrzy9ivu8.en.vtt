00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.530
 they already did meiosis thanks mom and 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:10.099
 dad finally there are already two tabloids already 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:14.059
 can merge with me cells 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:18.320
 floor mouse you are applauded in is 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:21.710
 anyone see my cells to observe 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.550
 its costs so the particle is not big 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.580
 go through my you are going to need 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.329
 sodium potassium and a pump yes what 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.520
 you're looking for is the gradient 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.480
 generally to my cells we are going to 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.480
 close 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.350
 I want to see what being a cherry and open up 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.990
 the head I will use the number of languages 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.300
 that produces cancer that does not matter to me 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.000
 Professor sometimes tells me to kill what is 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.360
 that I thought I use the bromide of you or 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.140
 To have dyeing it deserves my 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.800
 cells let's observe the cycle 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.800
 mobile 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.350
 these cells we are going to regulate the cycle 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.350
 mobile 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.920
 I came to be given a few things to 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.990
 torture the wheels for the first time 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.659
 I'm going to dissect I already feel the blood 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.270
 that is going to splash on it we will look for things 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.369
 to be able to create a mad epidemic by 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.160
 all our Europe and sticking to 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.000
 a goddess form 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.000
 from lula 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.450
 I tell you a secret dream of having a 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.080
 fish tank to also be able to experience 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:51.330
 with gills and fins if you wear 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:56.460
 well I give you the honor of being the first 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:01.550
 that I experience and that every day or 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:05.420
 be daily have treatment and fill 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.920
 forms until one day you 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.690
 entertainment 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.690
 I mean in anaphylactic shock 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.680
 there will be applications a lot dna but 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.060
 only if you live these came the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.740
 jaguar cambridge doctors of my 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.900
 last thing I prefer microscopy 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.470
 fluorescence if I could make a wish 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.160
 I would like a tea I find green to my 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.160
 mobile 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:48.620
 controls very little cellular physics
