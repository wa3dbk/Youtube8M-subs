00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.669
 important in the channel to notify 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.350
 all users to all users 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:18.450
 that you have xbox one care warning os 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.610
 I would ask you to share this video 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.370
 with all our friends with all 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.100
 your family members who have xbox one 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.710
 to alert you to this problem that you 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.789
 I will tell next remember 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.510
 It's been a long time since GTA came out 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:38.460
 5 since thousands of computers were infected 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.440
 because of some scammers about 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.159
 trolls about the sons of bitches by 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.629
 say it so they made people believe 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:51.749
 that really swallowed that gta 5 was 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.789
 for pc and infected thousands of 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:56.929
 computers around the world with this 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.780
 foolishness you have to be careful because 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:02.850
 attention because they have copied a brochure 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.519
 of microsoft marketing of these that 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.700
 usually perform for the xbox one 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.890
 and what they have done, they have made some 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.600
 instructions or rather rather though 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.850
 where to the people who follow some 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.039
 instructions to do with the command there 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.409
 in the menu to take us to the option of 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.890
 that the console has backward compatibility 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.319
 with the xbox 360 games which is 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.409
 totally false therefore if you 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:33.719
 You find a marketing brochure 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.119
 microsoft on any web page in 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:39.179
 any forum anywhere that you 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.310
 say we promise you that the xbox back is going 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.280
 to have its compatibility with the xbox 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.610
 360 is completely IGNORE 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.819
 impossible they already said they confirmed it and 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.119
 the xbox one is not retrocompatible so 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:56.849
 so much is not the case it is not a case because it is 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.250
 totally false can only take you to 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:01.020
 total brightness of the console and you'll already have 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.049
 to send to sat because the console is 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.170
 it is unused civilized because 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.420
 because that combination of buttons 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.619
 leads to the kit development mode of the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.260
 console from which 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.269
 I talked to you in a video and microsoft other 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.330
 once through major nelson has 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:21.030
 informed today that that kit mode of 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.120
 development for everyone still not 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.060
 is available and is not yet for 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.239
 as if to say for the sight of the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.239
 people are not fully compatible in 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.819
 day to day therefore do not enter 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.739
 because surely you touch so much that 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.079
 you will do something and the perseverance remains 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.290
 Total enabled then 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:46.280
 I recommend you do not do it because it is 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.329
 totally false that you do or when 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.230
 retrocompatible with xbox games 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:54.599
 360 so I hope you share this 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.329
 video because it's very important you know 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:01.379
 that I try to help whenever I can 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.940
 and if we hit whenever we can and this 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.030
 it's quite important so 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.920
 share it like and favorites and see you 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.870
