worked our cell phones didn't work so it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.210 
worked our cell phones didn't work so it
was<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:27.990> hard<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.619> get<00:01:28.950> information

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
was just really hard to get information

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.249 
was just really hard to get information
to<00:01:29.790> get<00:01:29.880> news<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.360> find<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.720> what<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.960> happened

to get news to find out what it happened

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.920 
to get news to find out what it happened
I<00:01:31.290> do<00:01:31.350> remember<00:01:32.000> kicking<00:01:33.000> around<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> ideas

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
I do remember kicking around the ideas

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.810 
I do remember kicking around the ideas
with<00:01:34.320> everybody<00:01:34.680> was<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> solar<00:01:35.549> flare

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
with everybody was that a solar flare

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.319 
with everybody was that a solar flare
was<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.630> an<00:01:36.720> EMP<00:01:37.640> but<00:01:38.640> nobody<00:01:38.939> really<00:01:39.180> knew

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
was it an EMP but nobody really knew

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.120 
was it an EMP but nobody really knew
because<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:39.900> couldn't<00:01:40.140> get<00:01:40.350> any<00:01:40.500> news<00:01:40.770> not

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
because we couldn't get any news not

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.950 
because we couldn't get any news not
that<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.759> government<00:01:41.909> press<00:01:42.390> release<00:01:42.750> would

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that the government press release would

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.319 
that the government press release would
be<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> truth<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.470> at<00:01:44.399> least<00:01:44.700> were<00:01:44.970> used<00:01:45.240> to

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
be the truth but at least were used to

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.850 
be the truth but at least were used to
getting<00:01:45.509> news<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.079> then<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.380> couldn't<00:01:46.680> we

while<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.090> wasn't<00:02:43.390> home<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.470> was<00:02:44.830> away<00:02:45.190> from

my food and and supplies and I just

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.090 
my food and and supplies and I just
remember<00:02:49.750> my<00:02:51.900> brother<00:02:52.900> had<00:02:53.110> an<00:02:53.290> old<00:02:53.470> tractor

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
remember my brother had an old tractor

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.850 
remember my brother had an old tractor
like<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.370> really<00:02:54.730> really<00:02:55.000> old<00:02:55.150> tractor<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.989> we

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
like a really really old tractor and we

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.040 
like a really really old tractor and we
thought<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.280> still<00:02:57.790> worked<00:02:58.060> or<00:02:58.360> something<00:02:58.780> and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
thought it still worked or something and

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.050 
thought it still worked or something and
that<00:02:59.080> we<00:02:59.980> would<00:03:00.130> take<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:00.340> but<00:03:00.730> we<00:03:00.910> were

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
that we would take that but we were

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.650 
that we would take that but we were
concerned<00:03:01.239> because<00:03:02.020> people<00:03:02.380> were<00:03:02.530> already

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
concerned because people were already

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.780 
concerned because people were already
getting<00:03:04.660> kind<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:04.930> desperate<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.790> looting

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
getting kind of desperate and looting

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.330 
getting kind of desperate and looting
and<00:03:07.180> we<00:03:07.690> were<00:03:07.840> afraid<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.709> know<00:03:08.800> if<00:03:08.980> we<00:03:09.130> can

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
and stuff and I also one other detail I

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:34.759 
and stuff and I also one other detail I
remember<00:03:28.120> was<00:03:29.280> water<00:03:30.280> that<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:31.690> had<00:03:32.410> thought<00:03:33.310> I

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
remember was water that I had thought I

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.840 
remember was water that I had thought I
should<00:03:35.769> have<00:03:35.890> stored<00:03:36.130> more<00:03:36.400> water

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
should have stored more water

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.570 
should have stored more water
I<00:03:37.090> should<00:03:37.750> have<00:03:37.870> stored<00:03:38.140> more<00:03:38.350> water<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.980> I

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
I should have stored more water and I

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.009 
I should have stored more water and I
guess<00:03:39.820> you<00:03:40.120> know<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.239> pumps<00:03:40.630> had<00:03:40.780> shut<00:03:40.989> down

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
guess you know the pumps had shut down

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.289 
guess you know the pumps had shut down
and<00:03:41.410> we<00:03:41.920> didn't<00:03:42.220> have<00:03:42.340> access<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.760> water<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.180> I

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
and we didn't have access to water and I

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.479 
and we didn't have access to water and I
just<00:03:43.330> remember<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.980> maybe<00:03:45.130> that's<00:03:45.370> the

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
just remember and maybe that's the

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.850 
just remember and maybe that's the
personal<00:03:46.000> warning<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.630> me<00:03:46.780> maybe<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:47.680> part

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
personal warning to me maybe that part
