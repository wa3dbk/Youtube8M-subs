00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
seven on seven but just like I said the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.200 
seven on seven but just like I said the
way<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.440> ball<00:01:01.620> flies<00:01:01.950> off<00:01:02.190> his<00:01:02.340> hands<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.090> way

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
way the ball flies off his hands the way

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.789 
way the ball flies off his hands the way
he's<00:01:03.390> able<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.660> move<00:01:03.840> his<00:01:03.899> feet<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> pocket

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.380 
he's able to move his feet in the pocket
I<00:01:04.920> mean<00:01:05.039> he<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.189> does<00:01:05.489> everything<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:06.000> would

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.969 
I mean he just does everything you would
want<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.900> starting<00:01:07.229> quarterback<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.830> I

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.300 
kind of I think change of pace you have
Paul<00:02:37.630> Perkins<00:02:37.870> with<00:02:38.140> over<00:02:38.320> 200<00:02:38.740> carries<00:02:39.070> last

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
Paul Perkins with over 200 carries last

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.280 
Paul Perkins with over 200 carries last
year<00:02:39.610> both<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.910> new<00:02:40.030> quarterback<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:41.050> really

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
year both the new quarterback you really

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.020 
year both the new quarterback you really
want<00:02:41.530> kind<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.980> nice<00:02:42.250> stable<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.790> running

backs<00:02:43.180> there<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.570> think<00:02:43.630> if<00:02:43.810> Nate<00:02:43.959> stars<00:02:44.260> can

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
backs there so I think if Nate stars can

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.170 
backs there so I think if Nate stars can
really<00:02:45.220> be<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.459> number<00:02:45.670> two<00:02:45.819> guy<00:02:45.970> that's

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
in general that running him I thought

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.720

was good Simon Goines is another guy

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.360 
was good Simon Goines is another guy
who's<00:03:28.140> coming<00:03:29.140> off<00:03:29.230> some<00:03:29.560> leg<00:03:29.739> injuries<00:03:30.190> but

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
who's coming off some leg injuries but

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.860 
who's coming off some leg injuries but
he's<00:03:30.519> out<00:03:30.670> there<00:03:30.850> moving<00:03:31.209> a<00:03:31.299> little<00:03:31.450> bit<00:03:31.540> I

he's out there moving a little bit I

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.390 
he's out there moving a little bit I
think<00:03:32.230> that's<00:03:32.380> an<00:03:32.560> encouraging<00:03:32.829> thing<00:03:33.220> that

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
think that's an encouraging thing that

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.979 
think that's an encouraging thing that
another<00:03:33.940> thing<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.209> coach<00:03:34.390> more<00:03:34.600> touched<00:03:34.840> on

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
another thing to coach more touched on

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.199 
another thing to coach more touched on
afterwards<00:03:35.320> was<00:03:35.650> just<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:36.549> line<00:03:36.730> debts<00:03:37.000> I

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
afterwards was just the line debts I

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.140 
afterwards was just the line debts I
mean<00:03:37.360> they're<00:03:37.510> dig<00:03:37.930> too<00:03:38.140> deep<00:03:38.320> I<00:03:39.190> think<00:03:39.940> that's

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
mean they're dig too deep I think that's

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.819 
mean they're dig too deep I think that's
probably<00:03:40.420> encouraging<00:03:40.900> for<00:03:40.989> them<00:03:41.110> that'll

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
probably encouraging for them that'll
