00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
demonstration here this is the default

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.820 
demonstration here this is the default
TV<00:00:22.650> effect<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.550> you'll<00:00:23.699> see<00:00:24.560> so<00:00:25.560> see<00:00:25.769> how

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
here in the settings we have an option

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.290 
here in the settings we have an option
for<00:00:39.570> display<00:00:40.079> candy<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:41.129> go<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.910> we

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
for display candy so if we go in here we

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.970 
for display candy so if we go in here we
can<00:00:42.420> check<00:00:42.629> out<00:00:42.809> all<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.110> animations<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.860> we

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
can check out all the animations so we

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.670 
can check out all the animations so we
have<00:00:44.070> launched<00:00:44.399> animation<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> closed

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
have launched animation we have a closed

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.549 
have launched animation we have a closed
animation<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.600> also<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.140> switch

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
animation and then we also have a switch

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.680 
animation and then we also have a switch
animation<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.910> change<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.360> speed

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
animation and we can change the speed

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
animation and we can change the speed
the<00:00:52.140> direction<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> couple<00:00:53.340> other<00:00:53.520> things

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the direction and a couple other things

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.760 
the direction and a couple other things
on<00:00:54.030> all<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.480> these<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.170> let's<00:00:55.379> go<00:00:55.500> ahead<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
on all of these so let's go ahead and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.340 
on all of these so let's go ahead and
check<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.579> here<00:00:57.000> what<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.780> saw<00:00:58.020> was<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
check it out here what you saw was the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.119 
check it out here what you saw was the
TV<00:00:58.800> tube<00:00:59.100> animation<00:01:00.030> let's<00:01:00.570> go<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.780> cube<00:01:01.350> so

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
TV tube animation let's go to cube so

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.939 
TV tube animation let's go to cube so
when<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.399> launched<00:01:02.670> an<00:01:02.879> app<00:01:03.090> it'll<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> cube

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
when we launched an app it'll do a cube

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.250 
when we launched an app it'll do a cube
animation<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.250> pretty<00:01:08.490> cool<00:01:08.760> and

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
animation so that's pretty cool and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.310 
animation so that's pretty cool and
we'll<00:01:10.260> try<00:01:10.500> flip<00:01:10.890> now<00:01:13.490> flip<00:01:14.780> page<00:01:15.780> curl<00:01:16.110> this

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
we'll try flip now flip page curl this

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.999 
we'll try flip now flip page curl this
one's<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:16.770> really<00:01:17.280> cool<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.890> then<00:01:19.890> we

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
one's actually really cool and then we

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.670 
one's actually really cool and then we
have<00:01:20.100> uncurl<00:01:20.640> which<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.140> same<00:01:22.350> thing<00:01:22.650> but

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
have uncurl which is the same thing but

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.270 
have uncurl which is the same thing but
opposite<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.400> page<00:01:23.610> curl<00:01:25.820> ripple<00:01:28.130> we<00:01:29.130> have

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
opposite of page curl ripple we have

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.240 
opposite of page curl ripple we have
suck<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.570> actually<00:01:31.130> sucks<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
suck and this one actually sucks the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.039 
suck and this one actually sucks the
home<00:01:32.520> screen<00:01:32.850> down<00:01:33.090> into<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> home<00:01:33.750> button

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
home screen down into the home button

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.210 
home screen down into the home button
here<00:01:34.350> check<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.740> out<00:01:36.770> that<00:01:37.770> one's<00:01:37.979> actually

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
here check it out that one's actually

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:51.280 
here check it out that one's actually
really<00:01:38.610> cool<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.810> fade<00:01:43.880> cover<00:01:47.540> reveal

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.500 

push

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.190 

and<00:01:54.980> camera<00:01:55.980> iris<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.730> this<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.810> kind<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.110> what

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and camera iris and this is kind of what

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.860 
and camera iris and this is kind of what
you'd<00:01:58.380> think<00:01:58.410> it<00:01:58.710> would<00:01:58.830> be<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.210> those<00:02:00.660> are<00:02:00.810> all

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
you'd think it would be so those are all

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.320 
you'd think it would be so those are all
the<00:02:01.020> animations<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.800> here<00:02:02.190> and<00:02:02.370> like<00:02:03.120> I<00:02:03.270> said

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
the animations in here and like I said

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.150 
the animations in here and like I said
you<00:02:03.660> can<00:02:03.690> set<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.230> speed<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.800> them<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.070> can

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
you can set the speed of them you can

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.719 
you can set the speed of them you can
make<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.400> slower<00:02:05.790> faster<00:02:06.860> on<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.070> suck<00:02:08.369> you

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
make it slower faster on the suck you

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.490 
make it slower faster on the suck you
can<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.180> suck<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.690> home<00:02:09.899> button<00:02:10.200> or

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
can have it suck to the home button or

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.470 
can have it suck to the home button or
the<00:02:10.560> center<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.550> screen<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.060> I

the center of the screen and I

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.310 
the center of the screen and I
especially<00:02:12.780> like<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.200> suck<00:02:13.590> for<00:02:14.480> closing<00:02:15.480> so
