 and problems of addiction subtraction 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.390
 multiplication and division of numbers 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.390
 natural 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.480
 a fruit seller buys 220 boxes of oranges 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.890
 It has a truck that transports 35 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.720
 boxes how many trips does how many boxes 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.720
 takes on the last trip 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.240
 to solve let's use the method 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.620
 of pulley 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:03.370
 Step 1 understands the problem 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.239
 to identify the unknowns how many 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.239
 trips ago 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.909
 how many boxes does he take on the last trip 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.909
 to identify the data 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.290
 a fruit bowl 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.870
 220 boxes of oranges 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.100
 a truck 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.330
 35 boxes 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.350
 the conditions are identified 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.760
 conditions are given or are given in 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.640
 verbs buy 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.640
 has 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.640
 transport 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.980
 get a plan 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.400
 the plan considers the operation or 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.430
 mathematics 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.280
 that is, addition or subtraction or 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.680
 multiplication or division 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.310
 relating to the condition and 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.580
 unknown 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.060
 in our case our plan would be 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.860
 divide the boxes they buy between 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.860
 boxes that the truck transports 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.890
 and the quotient plus the residue the residue 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.550
 is a trip is the number of trips that 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.600
 makes the truck 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:38.000
 and finally the remainder is the number of 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.000
 boxes he takes on the last trip 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.350
 execute the plan 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.810
 we remember dividing the boxes you buy 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:54.110
 between the boxes that the truck transports 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:57.770
 the boxes you buy are 220 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.730
 between the boxes that the truck transports 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.730
 They are 35 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.730
 dividing 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.549
 we have as quotient 6 and as a residue 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.549
 10 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.760
 we remember the quotient 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:26.560
 that is 6 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.520
 plus the residue the residue would represent 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.070
 to a trip 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.460
 is the number of trips that the 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.720
 truck six plus one equals seven 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.870
 travels 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:48.090
 that is, the truck makes six trips 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:52.740
 carrying on each trip 35 boxes and the 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:56.660
 last trip only takes 10 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.660
 boxes because that's what's left over 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.790
 we remember the residue is the number of 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:08.170
 boxes that you take on the last trip is 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.170
 say 10 boxes 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.470
 I examined the solution obtained we make a 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:19.620
 review of the three previous steps and 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:24.360
 we answer the questions or unknowns 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:29.150
 answer seven trips ago 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.150
 in the last trip it takes 10 boxes
