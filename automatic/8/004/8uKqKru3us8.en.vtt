00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
if it wasn't for the fact that I had a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
job to do as soon as I walked out there

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:27.630 
job to do as soon as I walked out there
are<00:01:12.479> 50<00:01:13.229> behind<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.710> lump<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.310> my<00:01:14.430> throat

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.390 

that<00:01:28.090> have<00:01:28.300> an<00:01:29.080> Australian<00:01:29.650> world<00:01:29.860> champion

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
that have an Australian world champion

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.240 
that have an Australian world champion
that<00:01:30.520> would<00:01:30.550> be<00:01:30.700> something<00:01:31.170> Robertson<00:01:32.170> but<00:01:33.100> I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
that would be something Robertson but I

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.399 
that would be something Robertson but I
think<00:01:33.550> he's<00:01:34.300> got<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.540> real<00:01:34.720> good<00:01:34.870> chance<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:35.290> win

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
think he's got a real good chance to win

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.260 
think he's got a real good chance to win
