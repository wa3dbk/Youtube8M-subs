60 or Kinect but yeah I always say is
but<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.550> doesn't<00:00:26.760> work<00:00:27.090> at<00:00:27.330> all<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:28.320> this

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
but it doesn't work at all but this

but it doesn't work at all but this
thing<00:00:29.189> here<00:00:29.369> if<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.609> actually<00:00:30.150> worked

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
thing here if this actually worked

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.020 
thing here if this actually worked
really<00:00:30.720> well<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.019> remember<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.529> spent<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.430> lot<00:00:33.000> of

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
really well I remember I spent a lot of

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.319 
really well I remember I spent a lot of
hours<00:00:33.480> playing<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:34.469> toy<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.370> especially<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
hours playing I toy and especially the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.760 
hours playing I toy and especially the
kungfu<00:00:36.540> game<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> love<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.469> one

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
kungfu game I love that one

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.020 
kungfu game I love that one
but<00:00:39.379> yes<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.460> thought<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.640> was<00:00:41.820> kind<00:00:41.969> of

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
but yes so I just thought it was kind of

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.639 
but yes so I just thought it was kind of
interesting<00:00:42.270> set<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.050> know<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.410> that

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
interesting set you know to think that

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.560 
interesting set you know to think that
maybe<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.430> know<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.700> thing<00:00:44.910> which<00:00:45.239> would<00:00:45.450> be

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
maybe you know this thing which would be

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.450 
maybe you know this thing which would be
far<00:00:45.780> less<00:00:45.809> advanced<00:00:46.289> from<00:00:46.590> connecting<00:00:47.129> yeah

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
far less advanced from connecting yeah

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.930 
far less advanced from connecting yeah
far<00:00:47.789> less<00:00:47.969> expensive<00:00:49.370> was<00:00:50.370> kind<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.640> doing<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
far less expensive was kind of doing a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.470 
far less expensive was kind of doing a
better<00:00:51.090> job<00:00:51.329> back<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.829> know<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> lot<00:00:53.670> probably

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
better job back you know a lot probably

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.810 
better job back you know a lot probably
about<00:00:54.719> eight<00:00:54.989> years<00:00:55.199> ago

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
about eight years ago

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.540 
about eight years ago
so<00:00:56.820> mmm<00:00:57.870> anyway<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.920> looking<00:00:59.160> at<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> device

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
so mmm anyway so looking at the device

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.099 
so mmm anyway so looking at the device
we've<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.239> got<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> eye<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.690> logo<00:01:00.989> up

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
we've just got the eye to a logo up

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.160 
we've just got the eye to a logo up
there<00:01:01.340> PlayStation<00:01:02.340> 2<00:01:02.550> logo<00:01:02.940> there<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.539> of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
there PlayStation 2 logo there and of

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.500 
there PlayStation 2 logo there and of
course<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.040> lens<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:06.330> not

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
course we have the lens there I'm not

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.109 
course we have the lens there I'm not
sure<00:01:06.689> what<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> two<00:01:07.170> other<00:01:07.439> little<00:01:08.119> white

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
sure what the two other little white

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.320 
sure what the two other little white
circles<00:01:10.110> are<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:11.159> guess<00:01:11.939> they<00:01:12.090> might<00:01:12.210> be

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
circles are for I guess they might be

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.830 
circles are for I guess they might be
tracking<00:01:12.720> sensors<00:01:12.930> or<00:01:13.229> something<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:15.720> big

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
tracking sensors or something the big

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.179 
tracking sensors or something the big
thing<00:01:16.080> was<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.439> course<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.770> mean<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.950> needed

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
thing was of course I mean you needed

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.670 
thing was of course I mean you needed
plenty<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.640> room<00:01:18.119> yeah<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.900> know<00:01:19.290> mostly

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
plenty of room yeah you know mostly

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.670 
plenty of room yeah you know mostly
needed<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> stand<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.259> it<00:01:22.259> wasn't<00:01:22.470> known

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
needed to stand up but it wasn't known

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.770 
needed to stand up but it wasn't known
as<00:01:22.799> picky<00:01:23.070> as<00:01:23.100> Kinect<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:24.210> could<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.540> as

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
as picky as Kinect you could just as

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.300 
as picky as Kinect you could just as
long<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.110> were<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> frame<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:26.159> would

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
long as you were in the frame it would

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.700 
long as you were in the frame it would
detect<00:01:26.549> movement<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.320> it<00:01:28.320> would<00:01:28.439> register

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
detect movement and it would register

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.060 
detect movement and it would register
movements<00:01:29.220> as<00:01:29.310> hits<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.700> misses<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:32.009> a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
movements as hits or misses so it was a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.420 
movements as hits or misses so it was a
lot<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.280> fun<00:01:32.689> it<00:01:33.689> disconnected<00:01:34.200> into<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.710> ps2

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
lot of fun it disconnected into the ps2

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.020 
lot of fun it disconnected into the ps2
of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> standard<00:01:36.509> USB<00:01:36.810> ports<00:01:37.320> as<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.619> see

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
of the standard USB ports as you can see

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.219 
of the standard USB ports as you can see
time<00:01:39.030> at<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> device<00:01:39.600> itself<00:01:39.630> isn't<00:01:40.140> too

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
time at the device itself isn't too

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.530 
time at the device itself isn't too
interesting<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:42.090> kind<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.299> sat<00:01:42.450> on

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
interesting just just kind of sat on

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.749 
interesting just just kind of sat on
your<00:01:42.689> TV<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:45.119> course<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.509> came<00:01:45.750> with<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.759> toy

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
your TV and of course it came with I toy

your TV and of course it came with I toy
play<00:01:48.350> which<00:01:49.350> was<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.570> think<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.049> was<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> first

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
play which was I I think it was a first

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.020 
play which was I I think it was a first
party<00:01:52.710> title<00:01:53.040> anyway<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.340> says<00:01:53.640> down<00:01:53.820> there

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
Sony Computer Entertainment's so I'm

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.580 
Sony Computer Entertainment's so I'm
imagining<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.219> was<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> first<00:01:56.549> party<00:01:56.790> title<00:01:57.590> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
imagining it was a first party title and

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
remember this making nearly as much of a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.460 
remember this making nearly as much of a
splash<00:02:20.130> as<00:02:20.490> something<00:02:20.880> like<00:02:21.000> Kinect<00:02:21.440> well<00:02:22.440> I

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.680 
menus I think the menus were actually
mostly<00:04:00.810> part<00:04:01.230> of<00:04:01.350> it<00:04:02.000> they<00:04:03.000> could<00:04:03.060> kind<00:04:03.480> of

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
mostly part of it they could kind of

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.900 
mostly part of it they could kind of
mess<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.870> up<00:04:04.020> like<00:04:04.620> he<00:04:05.100> often<00:04:05.370> say<00:04:05.490> on<00:04:05.610> kinect

so i think there was a dancing game and
there's<00:04:13.680> become<00:04:14.310> through<00:04:14.520> game<00:04:14.730> that's<00:04:14.940> what

boxing<00:04:34.520> chump<00:04:34.850> so<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.210> box<00:04:35.900> robots<00:04:36.770> as<00:04:37.340> you

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
boxing chump so you box robots as you

I<00:04:39.080> don't<00:04:39.440> really<00:04:39.560> know<00:04:39.680> why<00:04:39.830> when<00:04:40.790> you<00:04:41.090> have<00:04:41.240> a

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
I don't really know why when you have a

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.940 
I don't really know why when you have a
boxing<00:04:41.630> granny<00:04:41.840> down<00:04:42.020> there<00:04:44.170> you<00:04:45.170> fo<00:04:45.440> Jaguar

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
boxing granny down there you fo Jaguar

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.130
