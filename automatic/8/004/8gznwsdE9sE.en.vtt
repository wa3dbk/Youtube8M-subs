eco-friendly device obviously sprint
this<00:00:15.059> committed<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:16.430> environmental<00:00:17.430> things

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
this committed to environmental things

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.870 
this committed to environmental things
advice<00:00:19.170> right<00:00:19.529> now<00:00:19.740> at<00:00:19.980> least<00:00:20.100> as<00:00:20.279> tested<00:00:20.760> is

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
advice right now at least as tested is

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
advice right now at least as tested is
probably<00:00:21.210> about<00:00:21.330> thirty<00:00:21.660> five<00:00:21.869> percent

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
probably about thirty five percent

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.189 
probably about thirty five percent
recycled<00:00:22.680> materials<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.510> recyclable

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
recycled materials and it's a recyclable

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.220 
recycled materials and it's a recyclable
device<00:00:25.529> as<00:00:25.740> well<00:00:25.769> too<00:00:26.449> I'm<00:00:27.449> final<00:00:27.779> specs<00:00:28.019> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
device as well too I'm final specs and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.990 
device as well too I'm final specs and
recyclability<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.160> will<00:00:29.460> come<00:00:29.609> closer<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
recyclability and will come closer to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.269 
recyclability and will come closer to
launch<00:00:30.300> also<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.050> Chargers<00:00:31.619> are<00:00:31.800> real<00:00:32.009> low

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
launch also the Chargers are real low

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.970 
launch also the Chargers are real low
power<00:00:33.210> consuming<00:00:33.660> charger<00:00:34.020> basically<00:00:34.469> it's

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
power consuming charger basically it's

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.500 
power consuming charger basically it's
kind<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.190> intended<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> mid-tier<00:00:36.120> LTE

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
kind of intended to be a mid-tier LTE

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.170 
kind of intended to be a mid-tier LTE
device<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.100> from<00:00:38.100> aspects<00:00:38.520> perspective<00:00:39.120> you

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
device so from aspects perspective you

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.069 
device so from aspects perspective you
get<00:00:39.329> four<00:00:39.629> inch<00:00:39.840> display<00:00:40.399> uses<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.809> LG's<00:00:42.809> really

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
get four inch display uses a LG's really

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.720 
get four inch display uses a LG's really
marine<00:00:43.290> OVA<00:00:43.770> display<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.780> you've<00:00:49.110> got<00:00:49.730> camera

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
marine OVA display and you've got camera

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.750 
marine OVA display and you've got camera
so<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.180> front-facing<00:00:51.570> vga<00:00:51.840> camera

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
so the front-facing vga camera

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.970 
so the front-facing vga camera
on<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> back<00:00:54.449> makes<00:00:54.809> them<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.320> 5<00:00:55.769> megapixel

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
on the back makes them a 5 megapixel

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.060 
on the back makes them a 5 megapixel
camera<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.000> flash<00:00:57.859> one<00:00:58.859> thing<00:00:58.980> you'll

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
camera with a flash one thing you'll

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.740 
camera with a flash one thing you'll
notice<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.699> gonna<00:00:59.850> brushed<00:01:00.239> aluminum

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
notice it's not gonna brushed aluminum

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.049 
notice it's not gonna brushed aluminum
look<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> yeah<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> really<00:01:02.670> solid

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
look to it yeah so it's a really solid

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.289 
look to it yeah so it's a really solid
device<00:01:03.449> feels<00:01:03.839> really<00:01:04.080> good<00:01:04.259> in<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> hands

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
device feels really good in the hands

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.570 
device feels really good in the hands
again<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> cover<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.780> actually<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.580> guilt

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
again the cover you actually have guilt
