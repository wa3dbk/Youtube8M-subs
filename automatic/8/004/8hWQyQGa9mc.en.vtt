slide back and forth get that seventh
fret<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.620> then<00:03:16.770> while<00:03:17.100> you're<00:03:17.280> there<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.550> do

step slide back and forth between seven
and<00:03:23.400> five<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:24.360> then<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:25.410> land<00:03:25.740> right<00:03:26.070> on<00:03:26.130> your

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
and five and then you land right on your

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.990 
and five and then you land right on your
a<00:03:26.730> after<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.430> know<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.700> kind<00:03:29.940> of

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
a after that and I you know I kind of

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.940 
a after that and I you know I kind of
slide<00:03:30.330> back<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> position<00:03:31.320> so<00:03:31.470> I'm<00:03:31.530> ready<00:03:31.740> for

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
slide back a position so I'm ready for

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.330 
slide back a position so I'm ready for
the<00:03:32.040> next<00:03:32.220> part<00:03:32.460> of<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.670> lip<00:03:33.020> lick<00:03:34.020> or<00:03:34.290> red<00:03:34.620> um

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
the next part of the lip lick or red um

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.380 
the next part of the lip lick or red um
live<00:03:36.300> here<00:03:37.110> yeah<00:03:37.320> so<00:03:37.350> it's<00:03:40.520> and<00:03:41.520> then<00:03:42.000> for<00:03:42.330> the

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
live here yeah so it's and then for the

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.720 
live here yeah so it's and then for the
next<00:03:42.540> one<00:03:42.690> uh<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.470> know<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.800> do<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:44.070> pull<00:03:44.340> off<00:03:44.520> I

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
next one uh you know I do a pull off I

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.270 
next one uh you know I do a pull off I
think<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.959> know<00:03:46.050> it's<00:03:46.260> slide<00:03:46.470> also<00:03:46.680> works<00:03:47.010> too

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
think you know it's slide also works too

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.590 
think you know it's slide also works too
but<00:03:47.520> I<00:03:47.550> probably<00:03:48.090> easier<00:03:48.240> to<00:03:48.300> pull<00:03:48.510> off<00:03:50.600> so

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
but I probably easier to pull off so

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.210 
but I probably easier to pull off so
that's<00:03:51.750> just<00:03:51.990> all<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.440> know<00:03:52.560> once<00:03:52.800> again<00:03:52.920> and
