00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.779
 two Brazilian champions face each other 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.250
 by the swell title it's time to 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.599
 introduce who is 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.509
 then he wants to tell ltz appeared in 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.640
 competitive scenario at the end of 2014 but 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.430
 did not end up getting so much attention as 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.800
 and stayed by the middle of the way but the end 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.699
 2014 was crucial to the history of 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.769
 mz 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.980
 They called it an uprising with the same team. 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.720
 knowing that he had a very long season 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.910
 inconstant by the staff standing warm but the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.870
 result as everyone knows could not 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.809
 have been better 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.600
 ntv ran over the first season of 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.559
 ccb where 2015 ending with 18 wins 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.960
 and only two defeats but they came to 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.250
 the second season again with a 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.590
 change in the region 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.059
 although this has greatly influenced the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.520
 style of team play 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.010
 it was not long before joplin was 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.739
 to adapt to the jungle environment and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.660
 mtv returned to show the same strength 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.359
 of the first step 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.580
 so much so that this second stage to him 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.320
 suddenly a single three matches with 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.729
 impressive 15 wins in 18 matches 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.070
 What is very curious is that the team 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.759
 It follows some of the trend pen 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.640
 gravitate around the millennium ringtones is a 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.560
 of the most important parts of npg and this 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.470
 is reflected by their participation in 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.369
 of the team and by the fact that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.630
 with practically 36% of slaughtering 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.329
 team champion but football touch 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.700
 was the champ champion with whom he is 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.240
 completely undefeated with three 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.159
 matches at each stage and no defeat 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.890
 numbers 1-0 touches this 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.700
 stage are quite impressive and he 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.829
 gets on average 193 dcs at 20 minutes 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.140
 of game 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.719
 another great reference for mtv is 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.729
 the top lener yang even though he has a 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.100
 participation - from then on 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.530
 that the rest of his team he has 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.630
 ability to react in general 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.439
 can make great use of your phone 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.700
 postage 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.069
 the fact that caught my eye 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.370
 during the research was that the champion 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.560
 most played on the young at cb low is a 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.049
 and although this is also the 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.860
 Most played champion of mayom the numbers 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.810
 of yang stealing are awesome are 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.830
 11 matches over two seasons 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.379
 and no defeat in this second stage 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:36.049
 he played with the champion six times 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:37.940
 one of almost six that the 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.780
 third player in whom he says that 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.569
 trust enough is the abc-rn dog he 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.780
 usually have very solid performances in 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.700
 any champion but his civilian is 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.410
 away the most used champion with the 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.239
 michael in this second stage 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.920
 and just as his companions have 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.640
 impressive statistics with this 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.060
 champion 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:05.359
 are nine matches only one defeat a 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:08.390
 loves absurd of 10.5 closing team 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.670
 we have oxy er and oxy that certainly 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.220
 it was the two players who 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.510
 developed from the beginning of the second 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.730
 cerol step 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.040
 but just like in the previous video I go 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.250
 just leave the statistics of the two to 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.720
 do not stretch the video 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.889
 motto to you that the final will be played 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.810
 in the pet 5 against 14 and much has changed is 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.150
 different pitches appear 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.489
 it did not work and when it happens 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.040
 in general we see all the laws also 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.690
 changing your method well then that's it 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.389
 guys these two teams are the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.480
 cerol finalists that this was the 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.760
 second part of the special I want to know about 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.310
 You, if you want a third part. 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.889
 that will constitute comparing a team 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.780
 with the other, I want to know who the 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:57.169
