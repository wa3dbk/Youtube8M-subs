00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.400
Hi and welcome! Uyghur tea. 
At first I have to excuse myself.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.500
We haven't found any description
 of that tea anywhere.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.000
What we’re gonna show you today is actually 
the description that my friend traveler showed me

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.900
She was in China personally visited the Uyghur
 people where she tasted that tea.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.080
So we're gonna try to make it according to 
her recipe but I have to inform you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.600
you're not gonna find it anywhere in the Internet 
but you can read a lot about the Uyghur.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.600
It's a very interesting nation. They are
 Chinese Muslims which is pretty unusual.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.840
As you know especially today Chinese people 
are not very religious, they're even the opposite.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.440
They fight with any signs of religion 
and here, it's worth mentioning Tibet.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.440
We all know what happened to Tibet 
which is a very religious country.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.340
The same thing happened to the Uyghur. 
The Chinese decided it's a part of China.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.440
Hence there's a group of Muslims living in China.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:52.140
That nation unfortunately gets thinner now 
as the policy is that more and more Chinese people

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.240
is encouraged to settle down in that region to mix those 
nations and to make the Uyghur disappear soon.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.840
However, the national identity and tradition 
of the Uyghur people is very strong

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.040
and they're a really cool tribe. If you have a chance 
to see some photos from Kashgar,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.340
the large city of Uyghur it's really amazing. 
Amazing place, amazing people.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.640
It's what we can call Orient. Some people 
say Japan and China are Orient,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.640
others say Middle East is orient
 but Uyghur are a mixture.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.240
Actually they stretch their culture 
from as far as Turkey to China.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.140
There they mix everything that's Turkish,. Arabian 
and Persian together with what's Chinese

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.840
or even Tibetan and Indi and Mongolian. Huge
 melting pot that gives really beautiful vibrant colors

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.540
It's like a really colorful beautiful culture.
 Beautiful art, it's all beautiful there actually.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.460
When I saw it, it's like One Thousand 
and One Nights. Amazing.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.860
It's great that such places still exist. 
It's a pity they're so unfamiliar.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.280
The least familiar thing is the Uyghur tea.
 I think it's wrong cause it's really awesome.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.780
We don't really know what to drink it from 
but I heard people drink it in a small cup with a lid.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.880
So most probably it's a gaiwan. We're gonna take a glass one 
so  that we can see exactly all that's gonna happen inside.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.480
The tea itself is pretty easy to make. 
You just pour some green tea  at the bottom,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.980
next, a layer of candy fruit, then a layer 
of dried fruit, and a layer of fresh fruit.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.880
Then we pour it all over with water 
and drink the brew and what's interesting here

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.480
is that the fruit work just like a strainer. 
We don't drink dregs, they don't get into our mouths

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.980
cause they can’t get from the very bottom and thanks 
to that we have a sweet drink thanks to candy fruit

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.980
nice fruity tea brew that's very comfortable to drink. 
I think we can recommend this drink to everyone.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.920
As you could see, it's very quick 
and easy to make. Let's taste it then.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.620
Beautiful strong fruity aroma.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.160
Really delightful!

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:35.860
It's sweet and tea flavor, and very fruity. 
Of course it depends what kind of fruit you use

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.240
Originally as I found out, they use anything that 
you have on hand so there's no particular recipe

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.840
It's important that one layer needs to be candy
 to give sweetness to it. We used some ginger here

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:55.540
cause I really love ginger. Both hot and cold
 and in all variations. I'm  a huge fan of ginger

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:02.640
so ginger with sugar that gave sweetness, and dried fruit,
 we added here some cranberry, Goji berries

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.240
for health, some plums, dates, banana, 
whatever you have on hand, and on the top

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:18.040
we added some kiwi fruit and pear. That's what I had 
and as I said, there's no one particular recipe here.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.140
You can just add whatever
 you have provided they're fruit.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:28.040
Experiment with this tea and add in 
whatever you like, pour it over many times

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:35.740
cause although the sugar is out from the ginger, 
 I think the second brew will be also sweet.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.840
It will be certainly nice and fruity,
 the juices will flow from the fruits.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.240
Sweetness from the ginger and tea from the tea.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.240
For me it's really awesome. I highly 
recommend it, especially before spring

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.340
when we start to feel like having 
something tasty, fresh and healthy.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.640

your own fruit, send us your recipes
