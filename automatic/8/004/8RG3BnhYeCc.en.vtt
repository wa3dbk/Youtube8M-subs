00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
before we start we will do what's called

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.660 
before we start we will do what's called
set<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.930> working<00:00:34.320> directory<00:00:34.860> basically<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
create the working directory in this

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.160 
create the working directory in this
case<00:00:56.790> I'm<00:00:56.970> going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.180> go<00:00:57.330> and<00:00:57.479> create<00:00:57.839> it<00:00:58.019> on<00:00:58.080> my

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
case I'm going to go and create it on my

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.979 
case I'm going to go and create it on my
desktop<00:00:58.559> I<00:01:00.500> can<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.589> just<00:01:01.800> right<00:01:02.070> click<00:01:02.989> and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989

parts we're going to create our blocks

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.580 
parts we're going to create our blocks
so<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.229> name<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.530> folder<00:01:10.710> blocks<00:01:15.290> say<00:01:16.290> ok<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
so just name the folder blocks say ok to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.630 
so just name the folder blocks say ok to
it<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:18.229> just<00:01:19.229> say<00:01:19.560> okay<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.890> program<00:01:23.280> informs

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
it and just say okay the program informs

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.980 
it and just say okay the program informs
you<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.789> you've<00:01:24.000> successfully<00:01:24.420> changed<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
we can now go and create our first part

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.300 
we can now go and create our first part
this<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.869> done<00:01:34.020> by<00:01:34.170> use<00:01:34.289> against<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.649> file<00:01:34.950> new

you're looking in the plan view of it

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.410 
you're looking in the plan view of it
front<00:02:13.890> datum<00:02:14.190> plane<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.820> you're<00:02:14.970> looking<00:02:15.090> head

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
front datum plane so you're looking head

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.350 
front datum plane so you're looking head
on<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.710> had<00:02:16.830> right<00:02:17.070> datum<00:02:17.490> plane<00:02:17.610> as

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
on to it and I had right datum plane as

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.680 
on to it and I had right datum plane as
they<00:02:18.510> are<00:02:18.660> looking<00:02:18.900> from<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.230> right<00:02:20.690> the

they are looking from the right the
first<00:02:21.900> part<00:02:22.140> we're<00:02:22.260> going<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.470> create<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:22.860> a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
first part we're going to create is a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.790 
first part we're going to create is a
really<00:02:23.220> simple<00:02:23.520> cylinder<00:02:24.410> this<00:02:25.410> will<00:02:25.590> be<00:02:25.710> done

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
really simple cylinder this will be done

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.890 
really simple cylinder this will be done
by<00:02:25.950> using<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.370> extrude<00:02:26.820> command<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.780> come

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
by using the extrude command so come

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.130 
by using the extrude command so come
across<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.440> extrude<00:02:29.720> left<00:02:30.720> click<00:02:30.930> answer

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
across to the extrude left click answer

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.360 
across to the extrude left click answer
it<00:02:33.350> you'll<00:02:34.350> notice<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.800> top<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.160> page
