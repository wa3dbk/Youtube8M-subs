obviously<00:01:38.830> knows<00:01:39.250> like<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.700> know<00:01:39.760> that<00:01:40.540> when

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
obviously knows like I know that when

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.840 
obviously knows like I know that when
you<00:01:40.810> go<00:01:40.960> super<00:01:41.200> low<00:01:41.470> carb<00:01:41.800> you<00:01:42.340> get<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.550> similar

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
you go super low carb you get a similar

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.690 
you go super low carb you get a similar
effect<00:01:43.450> in<00:01:43.660> terms<00:01:43.930> of<00:01:44.110> fat<00:01:44.320> loss<00:01:44.560> as<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:45.520> do

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
effect in terms of fat loss as you do

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.000 
effect in terms of fat loss as you do
with<00:01:46.120> doing<00:01:46.360> intermittent<00:01:46.810> fasting

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
with doing intermittent fasting

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.930 
with doing intermittent fasting
basically<00:01:48.010> when<00:01:48.250> your<00:01:48.370> body<00:01:48.520> runs<00:01:48.760> out<00:01:48.910> of

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
basically when your body runs out of

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.610 
basically when your body runs out of
glycogen<00:01:49.180> which<00:01:49.660> is<00:01:49.810> your<00:01:49.930> body<00:01:50.080> store<00:01:50.410> thumb

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
glycogen which is your body store thumb

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.170 
glycogen which is your body store thumb
sugar<00:01:50.980> and<00:01:51.190> your<00:01:51.280> liver<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.640> your<00:01:51.700> muscles

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
sugar and your liver and your muscles

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.810 
sugar and your liver and your muscles
your<00:01:53.080> body<00:01:53.290> turns<00:01:53.620> on<00:01:53.860> its<00:01:53.980> own<00:01:54.100> body<00:01:54.310> fat<00:01:54.610> for

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
your body turns on its own body fat for

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.820 
your body turns on its own body fat for
fuel<00:01:55.000> so<00:01:55.300> you're<00:01:55.540> gonna<00:01:55.630> have<00:01:55.840> that<00:01:55.990> happen<00:01:56.410> if

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
fuel so you're gonna have that happen if

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.650 
fuel so you're gonna have that happen if
you<00:01:57.040> go<00:01:57.220> ketogenic<00:01:57.580> which<00:01:58.030> is<00:01:58.150> basically

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
you go ketogenic which is basically

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.900 
you go ketogenic which is basically
really<00:01:58.960> low<00:01:59.080> carb<00:01:59.410> like<00:01:59.710> think<00:02:00.010> Atkins<00:02:00.820> diet

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
really low carb like think Atkins diet

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.270 
really low carb like think Atkins diet
now<00:02:01.690> you<00:02:01.750> don't<00:02:02.020> have<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.290> go<00:02:02.440> as<00:02:02.710> low<00:02:02.890> as<00:02:03.010> 30

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
now you don't have to go as low as 30

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.250 
now you don't have to go as low as 30
