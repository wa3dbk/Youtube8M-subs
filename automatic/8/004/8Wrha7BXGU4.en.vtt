00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
that the meat can all the meat is

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.240 
that the meat can all the meat is
covered<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.210> we<00:01:31.659> all<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.890> then<00:01:33.009> we<00:01:33.100> can

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
covered and we all so that then we can

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.460 
covered and we all so that then we can
start<00:01:33.460> frying<00:01:33.789> just<00:01:34.659> like<00:01:34.869> shallow<00:01:35.110> frying

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
start frying just like shallow frying

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.309 
start frying just like shallow frying
just<00:01:35.860> under<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.580> get<00:01:36.729> brown<00:01:37.090> so<00:01:37.750> we'll<00:01:37.990> do<00:01:38.170> this

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
just under to get brown so we'll do this

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.440 
just under to get brown so we'll do this
until<00:01:38.679> all<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.920> meat<00:01:39.429> is<00:01:39.670> all<00:01:40.060> brown

until all the meat is all brown
completely<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.979> looks<00:01:42.159> like<00:01:42.310> it's<00:01:42.490> burning

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
completely it looks like it's burning

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.029 
completely it looks like it's burning
but<00:01:42.940> it's<00:01:43.090> not<00:01:43.299> it's<00:01:43.569> just<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:44.530> burning<00:01:44.920> at

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
but it's not it's just the burning at

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.859 
but it's not it's just the burning at
the<00:01:45.069> bottom<00:01:45.460> makes<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.850> flavor<00:01:46.119> of<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.630> of

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
the bottom makes the flavor of the of

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.219 
the bottom makes the flavor of the of
the<00:01:47.080> boost<00:01:47.289> you<00:01:47.440> so<00:01:48.130> once<00:01:48.429> you're<00:01:48.580> done<00:01:48.610> we'll

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the boost you so once you're done we'll

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.840 
the boost you so once you're done we'll
we'll<00:01:50.229> be<00:01:50.350> back<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.709> put<00:01:50.920> on<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.250> onions<00:01:51.670> and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
stuff but right now we just keep on low

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.800 
stuff but right now we just keep on low
heat<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.490> little<00:01:54.729> bit<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.149> just<00:01:55.360> let<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.630> turn

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
heat a little bit and just let it turn

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.169 
heat a little bit and just let it turn
brown<00:01:56.080> all<00:01:56.350> right<00:01:56.530> we'll<00:01:56.890> be<00:01:57.009> right<00:01:57.190> back<00:01:57.399> okay

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179
