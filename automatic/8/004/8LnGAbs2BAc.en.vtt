00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
Kentucky I have UConn going and just

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.080 
Kentucky I have UConn going and just
because<00:00:46.739> they're<00:00:46.920> more<00:00:47.100> organized<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.730> I

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
because they're more organized and I

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.250 
because they're more organized and I
think<00:00:48.300> they<00:00:48.390> have<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.510> better<00:00:48.719> chance<00:00:48.809> of

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
think they have a better chance of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
think they have a better chance of
beating<00:00:49.500> them<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:50.309> from<00:00:50.370> their<00:00:50.579> players<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
beating them just from their players and

beating them just from their players and
experience<00:00:51.809> from<00:00:52.199> last<00:00:52.440> year<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.920> think

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
experience from last year I think

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.479

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.779 
they're going to go to the finals and
it's<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.690> good<00:00:58.340> for<00:00:59.340> VCU<00:00:59.670> and

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
and someone Michigan Satan mud fence I

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.390 
and someone Michigan Satan mud fence I
have<00:01:30.210> Memphis<00:01:30.750> going<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.619> haven't<00:01:32.100> really<00:01:32.220> been

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
have Memphis going I haven't really been

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.609 
have Memphis going I haven't really been
following<00:01:32.610> them<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.380> wanted<00:01:34.380> some

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
following them but I wanted some

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.100 
following them but I wanted some
research<00:01:35.009> into<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.909> bracket<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.720> just

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
research into this bracket and I just

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.179 
research into this bracket and I just
thought<00:01:37.170> they<00:01:37.350> were<00:01:37.439> better<00:01:37.590> team<00:01:37.890> overall

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
thought they were better team overall

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.240 
thought they were better team overall
and<00:01:38.640> Michigan<00:01:39.420> State<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.720> good<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.950> really

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and Michigan State is good but I really

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.560 
and Michigan State is good but I really
think<00:01:41.280> there's<00:01:41.579> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.790> upset<00:01:42.329> there

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
think there's going to be upset there

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.460 
think there's going to be upset there
and<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.470> then<00:01:43.710> my<00:01:44.100> looks<00:01:44.310> off<00:01:44.549> um<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:46.439> a

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
going and Kansas State I guess you're

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.990 
going and Kansas State I guess you're
out<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.580> luck<00:02:39.500> for<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.830> had<00:02:41.280> Harvard<00:02:41.670> go<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.850> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
out of luck for I had Harvard go to the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.490 
out of luck for I had Harvard go to the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
second round just because I think they

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.040 
second round just because I think they
can<00:02:43.650> beat<00:02:43.800> vanderbilt<00:02:44.250> overall<00:02:45.030> Harvard<00:02:45.959> in

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
can beat vanderbilt overall Harvard in

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.080 
can beat vanderbilt overall Harvard in
Wisconsin<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.770> don't<00:02:47.160> see<00:02:47.280> Harvard<00:02:47.580> going<00:02:47.820> past

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090

I'm<00:05:16.920> for<00:05:17.580> Syracuse<00:05:18.030> in<00:05:18.150> Wisconsin<00:05:18.780> I<00:05:18.930> have

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
I'm for Syracuse in Wisconsin I have

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.890 
I'm for Syracuse in Wisconsin I have
Syracuse<00:05:20.220> going<00:05:20.520> on<00:05:20.670> as<00:05:20.940> I<00:05:21.300> said<00:05:21.360> before<00:05:21.510> they

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
Syracuse going on as I said before they

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.780 
Syracuse going on as I said before they
they're<00:05:22.380> very<00:05:22.770> steady<00:05:23.130> they<00:05:23.310> lost<00:05:23.490> their<00:05:23.670> best

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
has really proven himself on all the

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.870 
has really proven himself on all the
players<00:05:37.680> on<00:05:37.920> their<00:05:38.010> team<00:05:38.070> of<00:05:38.310> really<00:05:38.670> prove

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
players on their team of really prove

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.420 
players on their team of really prove
themselves<00:05:39.270> for<00:05:39.810> UNC<00:05:40.200> I<00:05:40.230> have<00:05:40.560> them<00:05:40.710> going

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
themselves for UNC I have them going

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.400 
themselves for UNC I have them going
just<00:05:41.760> because<00:05:42.030> they're<00:05:42.210> very<00:05:42.510> stable<00:05:42.780> I<00:05:43.050> don't

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
just because they're very stable I don't

just because they're very stable I don't
think<00:05:43.470> temple<00:05:43.890> really<00:05:44.100> stands<00:05:44.370> a<00:05:44.430> chance<00:05:44.460> even

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
think temple really stands a chance even

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.890 
think temple really stands a chance even
though<00:05:45.510> they<00:05:46.080> are<00:05:46.200> a<00:05:46.230> good<00:05:46.440> team<00:05:47.240> for<00:05:48.240> North

Memphis and BYU there's a little more on
this<00:06:19.110> line<00:06:19.530> but<00:06:20.160> um<00:06:20.340> I<00:06:20.640> think<00:06:21.030> it's<00:06:21.330> going<00:06:21.419> to

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
this line but um I think it's going to

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.720 
this line but um I think it's going to
prevail<00:06:24.320> what<00:06:25.320> am<00:06:25.410> I<00:06:25.470> missing<00:06:25.590> okay<00:06:26.160> for

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730 
prevail what am I missing okay for

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.250 
prevail what am I missing okay for
Syracuse<00:06:27.180> know<00:06:27.330> how<00:06:27.480> state<00:06:27.720> I<00:06:27.750> have<00:06:27.840> a<00:06:28.080> high<00:06:28.200> Oh

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
Syracuse know how state I have a high Oh

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.840 
Syracuse know how state I have a high Oh
state<00:06:28.500> going<00:06:28.650> just<00:06:28.860> because<00:06:29.130> Syracuse<00:06:29.640> I

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
state going just because Syracuse I

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.210 
state going just because Syracuse I
don't<00:06:30.240> think<00:06:30.510> even<00:06:30.780> they<00:06:31.680> lost<00:06:31.890> their<00:06:32.040> best

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
don't think even they lost their best

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.740 
don't think even they lost their best
player<00:06:32.460> and<00:06:32.700> I<00:06:32.820> think<00:06:33.090> they<00:06:33.180> can<00:06:33.330> get<00:06:33.450> to<00:06:33.630> the

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
player and I think they can get to the

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.390 
player and I think they can get to the
Elite<00:06:33.930> Eight<00:06:34.050> but<00:06:34.500> I<00:06:34.530> do<00:06:34.590> not<00:06:34.830> think<00:06:34.890> they<00:06:35.250> can

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
Elite Eight but I do not think they can

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.950 
Elite Eight but I do not think they can
beat<00:06:35.520> Ohio<00:06:35.789> State<00:06:36.060> go<00:06:36.180> into<00:06:36.390> the<00:06:36.479> Final<00:06:36.810> Four

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
beat Ohio State go into the Final Four

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.719 
beat Ohio State go into the Final Four
that's<00:06:37.470> just<00:06:37.710> my<00:06:37.830> opinion<00:06:37.860> you<00:06:38.430> may<00:06:38.550> have

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
that's just my opinion you may have

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:39.770 
that's just my opinion you may have
other<00:06:38.850> opinions

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
other opinions

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.650 
other opinions
for<00:06:40.230> UNC<00:06:40.950> in<00:06:41.070> Kansas<00:06:41.490> I<00:06:41.639> have<00:06:41.760> UNC<00:06:42.240> going<00:06:42.510> on

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
for UNC in Kansas I have UNC going on

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.900 
for UNC in Kansas I have UNC going on
just<00:06:42.870> because<00:06:43.050> they're<00:06:43.590> more<00:06:43.770> stable<00:06:44.220> and<00:06:44.400> I

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
just because they're more stable and I

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.150 
just because they're more stable and I
think<00:06:45.480> Kansas<00:06:45.690> made<00:06:46.470> it<00:06:46.590> this<00:06:46.710> far<00:06:46.770> Brown

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 
think Kansas made it this far Brown

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.040 
think Kansas made it this far Brown
think<00:06:47.490> they<00:06:47.580> can<00:06:47.730> make<00:06:47.760> it<00:06:48.000> any<00:06:48.120> any<00:06:48.419> farther

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
think they can make it any any farther

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.640 
think they can make it any any farther
in<00:06:49.290> the<00:06:49.410> bracket<00:06:50.180> UNC<00:06:51.180> I<00:06:51.450> have<00:06:51.930> I<00:06:52.200> have<00:06:52.470> them

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
in the bracket UNC I have I have them

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.430 
in the bracket UNC I have I have them
losing<00:06:52.980> though<00:06:53.130> to<00:06:53.520> Ohio<00:06:53.820> State<00:06:53.940> in<00:06:54.450> the<00:06:54.510> Final

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
losing though to Ohio State in the Final

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.680 
losing though to Ohio State in the Final
Four<00:06:55.590> I<00:06:55.830> just<00:06:56.250> have<00:06:56.400> this<00:06:56.520> feeling<00:06:57.300> just

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
Four I just have this feeling just

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.420 
Four I just have this feeling just
because<00:06:57.990> Ohio<00:06:58.320> State's<00:06:58.620> really<00:06:58.919> balanced<00:06:59.280> but

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
because Ohio State's really balanced but

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.159 
because Ohio State's really balanced but
UNC's<00:06:59.850> really<00:07:00.060> balanced<00:07:00.419> it's<00:07:00.840> happened

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:01.169 
UNC's really balanced it's happened

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:04.280 
UNC's really balanced it's happened
before<00:07:01.200> UNC<00:07:01.950> beat<00:07:02.130> ohio<00:07:02.400> state<00:07:02.730> and<00:07:02.880> I<00:07:03.870> don't

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
before UNC beat ohio state and I don't

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.720 
before UNC beat ohio state and I don't
know<00:07:04.350> I<00:07:04.410> just<00:07:04.470> really<00:07:04.950> think<00:07:05.070> of<00:07:05.220> how<00:07:05.340> it's

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.730 
know I just really think of how it's

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.900 
know I just really think of how it's
gonna<00:07:05.880> going<00:07:06.600> to<00:07:06.660> work<00:07:06.810> for<00:07:07.050> it<00:07:07.139> all<00:07:07.260> this<00:07:07.410> year
