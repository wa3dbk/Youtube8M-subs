00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
once the twist is reached the grip i'll

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.159 
once the twist is reached the grip i'll
regrip<00:05:00.289> closer<00:05:00.650> to<00:05:01.039> the<00:05:01.189> top<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.599> pulled<00:05:02.930> down

and just twist it with my hand to really

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:12.760 
and just twist it with my hand to really
tighten<00:05:07.729> up<00:05:07.899> the<00:05:08.899> wire<00:05:10.960> and<00:05:11.960> then<00:05:12.110> clip<00:05:12.469> it<00:05:12.619> so

tighten up the wire and then clip it so

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.109 
tighten up the wire and then clip it so
there's<00:05:12.949> only<00:05:13.069> about<00:05:13.249> two<00:05:13.520> or<00:05:13.669> three<00:05:13.699> twists

00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:14.119 
there's only about two or three twists
