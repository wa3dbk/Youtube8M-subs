00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 thanks diego and good now a thousand and for 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.990
 luck will help us with the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.220
 exercises that the doctor recommended 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.260
 directly after the importance 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.929
 of cardiovascular activity the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.639
 walk to the bicycle we went to the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.289
 importance of the exercises of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.420
 elongation how we recover or 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.710
 we recover the legs exactly the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.289
 importance after having worked 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.670
 the muscles that are contracted is 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.800
 important to regain the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.720
 good length doing good 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.519
 Elongation and elasticity exercises 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.590
 well to also improve everything that is 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.600
 the part of joint mobility first 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.710
 we go to the twins long yes it is a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.430
 muscle group that works 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.050
 constantly if right back does not 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.670
 let's always use a chair that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.920
 will allow us to be within reach of 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.320
 everyone in the house 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.910
 right back trying to make the heel 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.679
 do not take off from the floor and legs 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.940
 well extended there we will achieve 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.820
 stretch everything that is the part of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.370
 twin and soleos and that always in everything 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.379
 which also examines exactly hebbel and 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.299
 only until this part of here back 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.820
 right there, more or less, we count 20 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.309
 seconds we change legs and what 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.409
 we repeat if so many times it is necessary 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.149
 if the feeling has to be that the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.649
 muscle is stretching that there is no pain 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.020
 yes because that also has to be 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.030
 Beware of exercises that are not 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.399
 too intense but it generates a 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.679
 feeling more of relaxation that is 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.929
 stretch I'm doing fine not to 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.420
 get to the pain then there we stretch 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.069
 twins back straight forward 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.009
 as long as the heel of the 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:31.770
 floor to be effective second 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.690
 a classic quadriceps this one that works 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.610
 very much also of right back me 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.619
 I take the toe from the heel to the tail 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.959
 there we always have to be careful 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.789
 with the posture put strong everything 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.190
 is the area of the abdomen to avoid 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.110
 looting it up a person formed of 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.900
 exactly the heel 12 to the tail 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.970
 As much as possible 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:58.940
 to 20 seconds we also tell if 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:02:00.590
 we change legs and I'm better 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.130
 the theme of the chair for you is 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.130
 important 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.110
 Of course you can progress 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.380
 tibial is that they are the back if 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.730
 well we work the previous part now 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.470
 we work the back is the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.090
 team who dare and be of a 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.910
 little bit always with this from the chair 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.890
 to be able to not leave something and not 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.540
 to fall down so it's important in this the 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.270
 toe comes up leg 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.670
 fully extended and that is aligned 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.650
 with the hip so we can go from there to 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.090
 little looking for a point of reference if 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.760
 I do not get to the tip of the foot it does not matter 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.320
 but always trying to have a place 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.510
 where the body can stay as 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.280
 right possible so and there we go to 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.680
 stretch everything that is the abyss feel 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.730
 that intentionally stretches 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.190
 exactly the same to the same concept 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.500
 changed leg work the other there 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.510
 always back right and one thing very 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.030
 important is to avoid I know it's the most 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.709
 difficult perhaps to prevent the knee that 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.360
 reflect on these types of exercises 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.709
 well, if we do not fulfill the function that 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.989
 we want it to stretch the whole part 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.940
 later yes then although not 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.140
 we get too much always during the 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.600
 late and finally the buttocks the part 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.640
 let's say you work more in the area of 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.830
 waist and also middle area as if I 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.170
 I was crossing my legs back 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.150
 right I'm going to put the ankle to the 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.459
 knee height and slowly I'll 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.080
 press down there we go to 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.790
 do this go to the entire middle area and 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.500
 buttocks and always with the right back 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.120
 maybe with adding a little 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.400
 intensity we can go a little bit 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.170
 lowering the trunk forward and 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.390
 also without launching all this 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.730
 singing the greatness not the whole area 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.010
 all the trunk there always right 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.569
 avoid doing this to work 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.920
 correctly if we go flying but 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.770
 we can say that you are going to practice for 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.490
 next Saturday 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.140
 but we easily remind you then to 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.100
 the people what is the website so that 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.380
 can see this content 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.820
 www I will look from bezana dot com.ar or in 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.710
 facebook can also find us and 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.030
 I will be telling you everything 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.410
 they want to know about elongation 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.410
 we will give pause
