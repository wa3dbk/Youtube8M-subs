00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.719
 Hello Today I would like to think the way you together bowline 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.960
 Even though this is you, it is often that not remember very much 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:17.000
 There is no need to climb separately 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.110
 Consider what the hem is going to do and what to do for that 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.750
 By 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.400
 I can do it without thinking so I would like to think about it together now 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.720
 At first these 2 schools 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.480
 There is something I want to fix, there is a walk 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.240
 so 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.120
 If you think about what kind of better way of saying a strong tie 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.810
 The more you pull it 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.040
 Such as that tighten your neck 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.060
 I think it would be good if you could tie it 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.470
 To that end 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.560
 stay up 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:53.850
 When the rope is gradually caught Manaku to yourself 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:57.469
 I think it would be good if I could do something like that 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.469
 Let's try making it for a little kid 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:13.180
 Then I guess you through the Which I I think you will wanna this teacher 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.970
 I'm going below or going from above 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.770
 How about that 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.990
 You are at first lost 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.860
 If you say from the conclusion why is this above why 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.090
 If you look at this, the rope will be on you 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.350
 Because I am down there 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.510
 I wonder if it passes if I do 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.950
 Cat 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.030
 I can not go through it 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:46.770
 So I have to pass from above 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:50.060
 In this case, depending on which one is on you to look at here 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.430
 The rope from here is from here 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:00.340
 It is that thought of a click from the click from the top eh 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.560
 At this moment, I think it's not good enough and what I want to do next is to hang in the park 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.600
 If you do 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.660
 Maybe I think that I can have a structure that can be tightened my own neck 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.180
 Hook was hooked 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.190
 Te went from was I What about at this time 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.850
 Do you hook or say from the top 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.610
 I I'm Masu before this 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.410
 Anyway, so for the time being is good by multiplying coffee 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.880
 Let's do a song 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.830
 I made it 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.940
 Oh 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.520
 This is it 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.110
 I made it first 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.300
 I think you will want to through in the teeth 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.560
 That is the problem here 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.020
 Or enter from the bottom or enter from the top 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.090
 is not it 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.540
 So this is the same as before 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.300
 This rope is coming from the top in this case now 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.530
 This rope 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.610
 Passing from top to bottom 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.140
 It through if that want all come over because it is in the same place as hooking less than the rope 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.060
 Not 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.750
 It is to say that I go because I do this is to say the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.750
 It is such a thing 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.330
 I was able to 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.099
 voodoo 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.099
 Hmm 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.790
 Hmm 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.560

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.450
 voodoo 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.060
 voodoo 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.960
 Boom fan
