me<00:00:09.010> who've<00:00:09.160> been<00:00:09.309> standing<00:00:09.700> here<00:00:09.730> for<00:00:10.000> a

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
me who've been standing here for a

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.660 
me who've been standing here for a
couple<00:00:10.150> minutes<00:00:10.389> take<00:00:11.049> a<00:00:11.080> look<00:00:11.290> around<00:00:11.670> are

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
couple minutes take a look around are

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.140 
couple minutes take a look around are
you<00:00:12.790> seeing<00:00:13.059> any<00:00:13.209> lighting<00:00:13.480> changes<00:00:14.049> yeah

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
you seeing any lighting changes yeah

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.749 
you seeing any lighting changes yeah
right<00:00:16.150> you<00:00:16.660> see<00:00:16.869> a<00:00:17.080> pain<00:00:17.380> here<00:00:17.830> in<00:00:18.460> particular

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:18.759 
right you see a pain here in particular

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.320 
right you see a pain here in particular
as<00:00:19.630> we<00:00:20.410> make<00:00:20.619> adjustments<00:00:21.460> here<00:00:21.849> who

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
as we make adjustments here who

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.230 
as we make adjustments here who
processor<00:00:23.050> is<00:00:23.230> driving<00:00:23.919> the<00:00:24.310> entire<00:00:24.430> visual

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
processor is driving the entire visual

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.990 
processor is driving the entire visual
experience<00:00:26.170> so<00:00:26.859> this<00:00:27.100> is<00:00:27.130> what's<00:00:27.490> driving<00:00:27.580> it

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
experience so this is what's driving it

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.960 
experience so this is what's driving it
guys<00:00:28.210> no<00:00:29.109> extra<00:00:29.529> graphics<00:00:30.039> card<00:00:30.340> the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
guys no extra graphics card the

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.060 
guys no extra graphics card the
processor<00:00:31.570> is<00:00:31.599> making<00:00:32.050> this<00:00:32.199> entire<00:00:32.619> display

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
processor is making this entire display

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.189 
processor is making this entire display
happen<00:00:33.670> so<00:00:34.120> can<00:00:34.449> you<00:00:34.480> hear<00:00:34.720> a<00:00:34.750> little<00:00:34.930> bit<00:00:35.050> of

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
happen so can you hear a little bit of

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.220 
happen so can you hear a little bit of
difference<00:00:35.290> in<00:00:35.620> sound<00:00:36.570> he<00:00:37.570> might<00:00:37.839> you<00:00:37.870> want<00:00:38.019> to

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
difference in sound he might you want to

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.900 
difference in sound he might you want to
help<00:00:38.350> him<00:00:38.500> out<00:00:38.589> with<00:00:38.650> some<00:00:38.949> sound<00:00:39.250> as<00:00:39.489> well<00:00:39.699> it

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
help him out with some sound as well it

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.000 
help him out with some sound as well it
poses<00:00:40.180> him<00:00:40.690> to<00:00:41.110> maybe<00:00:41.230> show<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.620> folks<00:00:41.770> we're

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
poses him to maybe show the folks we're

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.040 
poses him to maybe show the folks we're
talking<00:00:42.309> about<00:00:42.399> as<00:00:42.670> you<00:00:42.820> can<00:00:42.879> see<00:00:43.090> this<00:00:43.809> kind

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
talking about as you can see this kind

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.990 
talking about as you can see this kind
of<00:00:44.140> pulsating<00:00:44.770> happening<00:00:45.370> kind<00:00:45.520> of<00:00:45.670> movement

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
of pulsating happening kind of movement

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.779 
of pulsating happening kind of movement
of<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.420> images<00:00:47.110> it's<00:00:47.860> going<00:00:48.309> to<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.520> beat<00:00:48.760> of

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
of the images it's going to the beat of

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.450 
of the images it's going to the beat of
his<00:00:49.020> techno<00:00:50.020> lounge<00:00:50.530> music<00:00:50.770> that<00:00:51.160> we<00:00:51.250> have

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
his techno lounge music that we have

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.580 
his techno lounge music that we have
here<00:00:51.670> in<00:00:51.730> it<00:00:51.910> down<00:00:52.149> and<00:00:52.690> it<00:00:52.809> always<00:00:53.079> being

you<00:00:56.050> guys<00:00:56.140> can<00:00:56.350> see<00:00:56.500> if<00:00:56.590> we're<00:00:56.710> back<00:00:56.890> here<00:00:57.160> but

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
you guys can see if we're back here but

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.590 
you guys can see if we're back here but
the<00:00:57.820> graphics<00:00:58.180> are<00:00:58.660> right<00:00:59.170> there<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:01.120> built<00:01:01.449> it

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
the graphics are right there we built it

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.499 
the graphics are right there we built it

to<00:01:32.140> bring<00:01:32.409> up<00:01:32.619> my<00:01:32.770> game<00:01:33.010> let's<00:01:33.850> get<00:01:33.939> light<00:01:34.210> on

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
to bring up my game let's get light on

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.170 
to bring up my game let's get light on
our<00:01:34.450> feet<00:01:34.479> up<00:01:34.869> here<00:01:35.159> we're<00:01:36.159> going<00:01:36.369> vertical

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
our feet up here we're going vertical

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.240 
our feet up here we're going vertical
I<00:01:38.240> think<00:01:38.900> we<00:01:38.990> should<00:01:39.020> go<00:01:39.290> vertical<00:01:39.710> man<00:01:39.890> come

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
I think we should go vertical man come

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.310 
I think we should go vertical man come
on<00:01:40.340> here<00:01:41.150> we<00:01:41.270> go<00:01:41.390> we've<00:01:41.630> brought<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.960> up<00:01:42.080> I

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
on here we go we've brought it up I

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.780 
on here we go we've brought it up I
don't<00:01:43.070> like<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.250> same<00:01:43.430> negative

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
don't like the same negative

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
don't like the same negative
even<00:01:45.510> though<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:45.720> what<00:01:45.870> it<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.080> it's

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
even though that's what it is it's

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.350 
even though that's what it is it's
negative<00:01:46.470> gravity

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
negative gravity

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.940

let's<00:01:48.510> get<00:01:48.660> back<00:01:48.840> down<00:01:48.870> earth<00:01:49.230> we're<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
let's get back down earth we're going to

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.670 
let's get back down earth we're going to
get<00:01:50.070> ground<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.610> pulse<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:52.410> you<00:01:52.560> can

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
get ground in your pulse and as you can

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.180 
get ground in your pulse and as you can
see<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.070> smooth<00:01:53.520> seamless<00:01:54.170> transitions<00:01:55.190> you

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
see the smooth seamless transitions you

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.850 
see the smooth seamless transitions you
see<00:01:56.400> that<00:01:56.610> from<00:01:56.790> back<00:01:57.060> there<00:01:57.330> is<00:01:58.200> rendering<00:01:58.620> in

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
see that from back there is rendering in

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.450 
see that from back there is rendering in
this<00:01:59.040> real-time<00:01:59.400> space<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.900> real-time<00:02:01.890> 3d

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
this real-time space in real-time 3d

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.570 
this real-time space in real-time 3d
space<00:02:03.590> because<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.740> what<00:02:04.860> we've<00:02:05.010> done<00:02:05.190> really
