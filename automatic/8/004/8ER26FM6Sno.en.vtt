so<00:00:27.180> for<00:00:28.849> $19,995<00:00:29.849> your<00:00:30.179> basic<00:00:30.750> math<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
so for $19,995 your basic math is the

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.530 
so for $19,995 your basic math is the
5/3<00:00:33.090> closes<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.570> 9<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.930> 3<00:00:34.079> again<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:35.059> an<00:00:36.059> inline

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.480 
a little bit of lack of sensation in the
on<00:01:47.670> center<00:01:48.119> feel<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.799> car<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.250> basically

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
on center feel but this car is basically

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.319 
on center feel but this car is basically
a<00:01:51.210> family<00:01:51.869> hauler<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.280> added<00:01:53.729> driving

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
a family hauler with that added driving

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.980 
a family hauler with that added driving
enthusiasm<00:01:55.290> for<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.829> enthusiast<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.659> was

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
enthusiasm for the enthusiast so I was

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.469 
enthusiasm for the enthusiast so I was
talking<00:01:58.290> about<00:01:58.350> versatility<00:01:59.360> here's<00:02:00.360> an

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
talking about versatility here's an

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.510 
talking about versatility here's an
example<00:02:00.840> or<00:02:01.200> another<00:02:01.619> example<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.189> should<00:02:02.369> say

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
example or another example I should say

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.940 
example or another example I should say
of<00:02:02.850> what<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.360> do<00:02:03.450> them<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.930> five<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
of what you can do them as the five it

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.809 
of what you can do them as the five it
actually<00:02:05.399> has<00:02:05.630> seating<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.659> six<00:02:07.350> people

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
actually has seating for six people

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.249 
actually has seating for six people
obviously<00:02:08.819> with<00:02:09.270> seating<00:02:09.599> for<00:02:09.780> six<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.229> have

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
obviously with seating for six you have

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.290 
obviously with seating for six you have
to<00:02:10.500> expect<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.520> third<00:02:11.730> row<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.120> up

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
to expect that one the third row is up

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.790 
to expect that one the third row is up
that<00:02:12.810> you'll<00:02:12.959> have<00:02:13.140> some<00:02:13.319> women

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
that you'll have some women

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.890 
that you'll have some women
cargo<00:02:14.100> space<00:02:14.400> how<00:02:15.120> often<00:02:15.540> really<00:02:15.750> are<00:02:15.840> you

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
cargo space how often really are you

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.450 
cargo space how often really are you
gonna<00:02:15.990> have<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.230> third<00:02:16.410> row<00:02:16.440> up<00:02:16.770> maybe<00:02:17.250> when

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
gonna have the third row up maybe when

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.530 
gonna have the third row up maybe when
you're<00:02:17.580> driving<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.030> kids<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.300> soccer

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
more interior space you got a load up

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.130 
more interior space you got a load up
for<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.430> back<00:02:59.610> and<00:03:00.270> I<00:03:00.360> put<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.540> lot<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.780> stuff<00:03:00.930> in

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
there watch this another little strap

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.360 
there watch this another little strap
you<00:03:03.840> pull<00:03:04.490> little<00:03:05.490> lever<00:03:06.290> fold<00:03:07.290> flat<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:08.250> can

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
you pull little lever fold flat you can

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.010 
you pull little lever fold flat you can
do<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.550> exact<00:03:08.940> same<00:03:09.030> thing<00:03:09.390> with<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.720> seat

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
do the exact same thing with that seat

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.530 
do the exact same thing with that seat
so<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.770> have<00:03:10.920> yourself<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.490> huge<00:03:11.820> cargo<00:03:12.270> area

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
so you have yourself a huge cargo area

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.090 
so you have yourself a huge cargo area
now<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.690> never<00:03:13.080> think<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.740> compact

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
now you never think that in the compact

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.220 
now you never think that in the compact
car<00:03:14.370> like<00:03:14.550> this<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.970> you'd<00:03:15.480> have<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:16.080> much

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
car like this that you'd have so much

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.810 
car like this that you'd have so much
volume<00:03:16.530> especially<00:03:17.130> when<00:03:17.490> you<00:03:17.550> think<00:03:17.700> that

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
volume especially when you think that

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.630 
volume especially when you think that
it's<00:03:17.970> based<00:03:18.239> on<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.510> Mazda<00:03:18.870> 3<00:03:19.110> sport<00:03:19.640> so

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
it's based on a Mazda 3 sport so

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.430 
it's based on a Mazda 3 sport so
stepping<00:03:20.940> aboard<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.390> Matta<00:03:21.570> 5<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:22.080> obviously

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
stepping aboard the Matta 5 is obviously

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.140 
stepping aboard the Matta 5 is obviously
very<00:03:22.530> very<00:03:23.010> easy<00:03:23.310> thanks<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.000> dual

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
very very easy thanks to the dual

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.210 
very very easy thanks to the dual
sliding<00:03:24.630> doors<00:03:24.840> here's<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.800> little<00:03:26.040> trick<00:03:26.190> that

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
sliding doors here's a little trick that

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.540 
sliding doors here's a little trick that
the<00:03:26.430> engineers<00:03:26.790> at<00:03:26.940> NASA<00:03:27.180> thought<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:28.550> let's

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
the engineers at NASA thought of let's

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.970 
the engineers at NASA thought of let's
put<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.760> little<00:03:29.910> tray<00:03:30.209> under<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.050> seat<00:03:31.260> which

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
put a little tray under the seat which

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.140 
put a little tray under the seat which
you<00:03:32.070> can<00:03:32.190> actually<00:03:32.459> use<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.610> store<00:03:32.940> some<00:03:33.120> stuff

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
you can actually use to store some stuff

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.990 
you can actually use to store some stuff
if<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.600> really<00:03:33.840> need<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.200> hay<00:03:34.920> wallah<00:03:35.190> there's

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
if you really need to hay wallah there's

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.300 
if you really need to hay wallah there's
even<00:03:36.270> a<00:03:36.330> little<00:03:36.570> bag<00:03:36.750> in<00:03:36.989> here<00:03:37.200> so<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:38.010> can<00:03:38.130> put
