your<00:01:42.390> invention<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.050> in<00:01:43.229> two<00:01:43.620> parts<00:01:44.100> there's

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
your invention is in two parts there's

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.990 
your invention is in two parts there's
this<00:01:45.060> part<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.750> there's<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:47.340> part<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.910> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
this part and there's this part and the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.490 
this part and there's this part and the
beauty<00:01:48.300> is<00:01:48.420> when<00:01:48.600> they<00:01:48.720> come<00:01:48.960> together<00:01:49.110> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
beauty is when they come together and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.000 
beauty is when they come together and
release<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.910> um<00:01:51.210> we've<00:01:51.720> sort<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.050> seen<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
release so um we've sort of seen the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.310 
release so um we've sort of seen the
release<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.760> when<00:01:54.330> it's<00:01:54.510> released<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.110> left

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
release and when it's released it's left

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.760 
release and when it's released it's left
in<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.500> position<00:01:55.800> but<00:01:56.640> before<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.119> cast<00:01:57.390> off

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
in that position but before you cast off

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.620 
in that position but before you cast off
you<00:01:58.770> put<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.160> that<00:01:59.310> position<00:01:59.550> and<00:02:00.030> then

water with my dad's boats so I really

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.970 
water with my dad's boats so I really
like<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:57.269> invention<00:03:57.750> when<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.290> when<00:03:58.800> you're

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
like this invention when you when you're

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.009 
like this invention when you when you're
actually<00:03:59.190> releasing<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.269> boat<00:04:00.450> I'm<00:04:00.660> I'm

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
actually releasing the boat I'm I'm

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.570 
actually releasing the boat I'm I'm
interested<00:04:01.170> in<00:04:01.440> what<00:04:01.560> happens<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:02.040> there<00:04:02.549> a

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
interested in what happens is there a

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.970 
interested in what happens is there a
chance<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.330> you<00:04:03.600> could<00:04:03.840> actually<00:04:03.989> hit<00:04:04.799> the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
chance that you could actually hit the

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.710 
chance that you could actually hit the
water<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.850> boat<00:04:06.030> gets<00:04:06.269> released<00:04:06.540> by

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
water and the boat gets released by

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.900 
water and the boat gets released by
accident<00:04:07.170> it's<00:04:07.290> possible<00:04:07.890> it's<00:04:08.160> possible<00:04:08.250> but

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
accident it's possible it's possible but

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.960 
accident it's possible it's possible but
again<00:04:09.330> it's<00:04:09.780> it's<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.620> knowledge<00:04:11.489> fact

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
again it's it's the the knowledge fact

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.970 
again it's it's the the knowledge fact
and<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.269> use<00:04:12.450> of<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:13.049> was<00:04:13.620> an<00:04:13.830> idiot

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
and the use of that it was an idiot

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.310 
and the use of that it was an idiot
factor<00:04:14.489> with<00:04:14.640> all<00:04:14.790> these<00:04:15.000> things<00:04:15.269> although<00:04:15.720> in

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
factor with all these things although in

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.890 
factor with all these things although in
that<00:04:16.950> situation<00:04:17.639> where<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.030> two<00:04:18.239> things

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
that situation where the two things

that situation where the two things
locked<00:04:19.109> together<00:04:19.320> you've<00:04:19.739> got<00:04:19.769> round<00:04:20.250> about<00:04:20.519> a

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
locked together you've got round about a
