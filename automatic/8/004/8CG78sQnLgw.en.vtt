and<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.829> built<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.880> motor<00:01:39.240> last<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:40.170> misty

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
and I built the motor last with misty

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.370 
and I built the motor last with misty
and<00:01:41.100> tried<00:01:41.820> her<00:01:42.119> first<00:01:42.390> because<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.689> hear<00:01:42.960> some

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.719 
and tried her first because I hear some
rumors<00:01:43.710> were<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.130> doesn't<00:01:44.430> matter<00:01:44.579> what

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
character is you just have to build the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.440 
character is you just have to build the
motor<00:01:47.009> last<00:01:47.310> that's<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.119> make<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
motor last that's going to make the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.020 
motor last that's going to make the
tramplesteam<00:01:48.810> stronger<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:50.070> then<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.670> found<00:01:50.850> an

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
tramplesteam stronger so then I found an

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.480 
tramplesteam stronger so then I found an
area<00:01:51.360> where<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.930> could<00:01:52.500> kill<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.920> zombies<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
area where I could kill the zombies and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.310 
area where I could kill the zombies and
kind<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.759> count<00:01:54.060> them<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.689> as<00:01:54.810> they<00:01:54.990> come<00:01:55.170> up

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
kind of count them and as they come up

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.170 
kind of count them and as they come up
one<00:01:55.500> at<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.680> time<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.890> started<00:01:56.340> out<00:01:56.460> at<00:01:56.610> round<00:01:56.880> one

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
one at a time I started out at round one

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.700 
one at a time I started out at round one
and<00:01:57.439> then<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.829> went<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.159> round<00:01:59.430> two<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.680> then<00:02:01.680> I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and then I went to round two and then I

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.190 
and then I went to round two and then I
also<00:02:01.920> went<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.399> round<00:02:02.759> three<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
also went to round three and so the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.639 
also went to round three and so the
trample<00:02:04.530> steam<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.890> still<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.649> you'll

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
trample steam is still going and you'll

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.180 
trample steam is still going and you'll
see<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.369> about<00:02:08.819> round<00:02:09.330> four<00:02:09.810> I've<00:02:10.110> killed<00:02:10.560> 27

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
see here about round four I've killed 27

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.910 
see here about round four I've killed 27
zombies<00:02:11.730> at<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.090> end<00:02:12.270> of

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
zombies at the end of

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.470 
zombies at the end of
three<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.940> round<00:02:14.450> force<00:02:14.840> coming<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:16.480> when

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
three so round force coming and when

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.580 
three so round force coming and when
this<00:02:17.660> zombie<00:02:17.989> gets<00:02:18.200> here<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.959> trample<00:02:21.560> steam

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
this zombie gets here the trample steam

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.870 
this zombie gets here the trample steam
breaks<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:22.910> 28<00:02:23.599> zombies<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.650> how<00:02:25.370> many<00:02:25.580> it

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
breaks so 28 zombies is how many it

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.770 
breaks so 28 zombies is how many it
killed<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:27.410> this<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.370> two<00:02:28.670> longer<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.209> built

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
killed and so this is two longer I built

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.170 
killed and so this is two longer I built
a<00:02:29.900> ternopil<00:02:30.260> steam<00:02:30.470> with<00:02:30.709> him<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.819> built

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
a ternopil steam with him and I built

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.199 
a ternopil steam with him and I built
the<00:02:32.420> motor<00:02:32.660> last<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:34.010> he's<00:02:34.370> gone<00:02:34.580> around<00:02:34.880> three

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
the motor last so he's gone around three

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.540 
the motor last so he's gone around three
and<00:02:35.450> here's<00:02:35.660> four<00:02:35.989> that<00:02:36.200> was<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.560> 28th<00:02:37.010> zombie

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
and here's four that was the 28th zombie

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.080 
and here's four that was the 28th zombie
so<00:02:38.120> again<00:02:38.750> only<00:02:38.900> lasted<00:02:39.470> until<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.800> 28th<00:02:40.310> so

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
so again only lasted until the 28th so

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.320 
so again only lasted until the 28th so
