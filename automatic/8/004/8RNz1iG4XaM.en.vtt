00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.650
 the first thing I knew from 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.940
 plaster these are actually the posters 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.210
 the little books and descriptions 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.800
 concerning invasive care and care 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.840
 among others and exams the first 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.099
 thing that got me that hit me that 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.039
 it was all at the beginning before I was 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.940
 more uncultivated rice is the fact that this 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.070
 be a very good 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.730
 a very good tool to use with the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.770
 families a super interesting support 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.510
 because usable and with the child and 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.040
 with the parent in fact and then 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.230
 now that I'm professional in 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.080
 done it's mostly tracks of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.170
 training and then ideas ideas 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.150
 tracks also of reflection always 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.070
 in taking care of the child and 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.100
 its environment what is it 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.050
 overall actually me it's a serious 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.580
 leaning on the site of plaster and 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.720
 what they described as distraction 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.030
 that I had the idea to do the next 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.160
 the service I would not have had this idea there 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.810
 meaning 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.040
 to turn to this paradise for my all 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.960
 first was to be created in fact 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.790
 a distraction box with objects 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.720
 and then by planking on the question I 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.060
 realized that on the one hand 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.680
 had the training and that on the other hand 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.220
 before before getting items 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.659
 it was necessary to reflect on their use 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.460
 how to introduce them how 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.520
 use with whom how how or why 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.060
 than 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.460
 we decided to do this project there in 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.570
 forming the maximum number of people 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.090
 it has nothing to do with a care that is done 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.469
 so 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.520
 we think or at least not 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.799
 enough and what is done 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.840
 now when we were going 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.819
 professionals who are trained by that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.780
 for the distraction 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.369
 concretely care is faster 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.439
 is going better and families are saying it 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.670
 almost systematically in fact 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.319
 was going well in terms of the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.390
 pain it's true the grinders hall the 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.939
 cream is positive puts it in not that 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.009
 is it too but it was often when 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.240
 even difficult because even though 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.709
 the child does not feel pain but 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.149
 opposes or simple fact that we start from 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.799
 whatever it was I found myself 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.299
 often found in failure with 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.670
 care that trailed who were long who 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.959
 was difficult really trying to 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.579
 everyone is blatant 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.260
 families are getting better kids are going 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.420
 better care is better we win 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.010
 time in the end it's very 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.230
 important to make clear to all the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.620
 world because it's not always 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.040
 including English and children less 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.420
 poorly taken care of the pain 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.959
 children less bad with the 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.890
 distraction 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.890
 that's obvious
