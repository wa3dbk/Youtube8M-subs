of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.250> time<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:05.670> tend<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.210> minor<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
of the time they tend to be in minor a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.260 
of the time they tend to be in minor a
lot<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> times<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.159> natural<00:01:08.700> minor<00:01:08.909> keys

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
lot of the times in natural minor keys

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.170 
lot of the times in natural minor keys
so<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.869> minor<00:01:10.320> D<00:01:10.830> minor<00:01:10.860> G<00:01:11.640> minor<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
so like a minor D minor G minor and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.090 
so like a minor D minor G minor and
that's<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.140> gives<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.470> its<00:01:13.619> kind<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.950> its

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
that's what gives it its kind of its

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.940 
that's what gives it its kind of its
street<00:01:14.640> sound<00:01:15.060> rap<00:01:15.930> songs<00:01:16.200> are<00:01:16.350> rarely<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
street sound rap songs are rarely in a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.310 
street sound rap songs are rarely in a
major<00:01:17.250> key<00:01:17.640> minor<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.900> sounds<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.200> little

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
major key minor just sounds a little

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.859 
major key minor just sounds a little
more<00:01:19.619> heavy<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.040> dark<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:21.210> what<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.780> do

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
more heavy and dark so what I like to do

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.149 
more heavy and dark so what I like to do
when<00:01:22.049> I'm<00:01:22.170> writing<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.500> rap<00:01:22.650> melody<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.130> guitar

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
when I'm writing a rap melody on guitar

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.640 
when I'm writing a rap melody on guitar
is<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.820> use<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> basic<00:01:24.360> arpeggio<00:01:25.080> usually

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
is just use a basic arpeggio usually

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.539 
is just use a basic arpeggio usually
like<00:01:30.049> and<00:01:31.049> usually<00:01:31.320> rap<00:01:31.770> melodies<00:01:32.250> aren't

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
like and usually rap melodies aren't

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.609 
like and usually rap melodies aren't
much<00:01:32.790> more<00:01:33.150> complex<00:01:33.600> than<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.869> if<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.320> starts

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
much more complex than that if it starts

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.990 
much more complex than that if it starts
to<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.799> more<00:01:34.860> complicated<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.729> not<00:01:35.790> going

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
to get more complicated it's not going

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.219 
to get more complicated it's not going
to<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.119> memorable<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.810> not<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.140> be

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
to be memorable and it's not going to be

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.230 
to be memorable and it's not going to be
catchy<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.400> I'll<00:01:38.490> do<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> basic

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
catchy so what I'll do is do a basic

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.240 
catchy so what I'll do is do a basic
minor<00:01:39.689> arpeggio<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.799> add<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> beat

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
minor arpeggio like that and add a beat

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.010 
minor arpeggio like that and add a beat
to<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.939> sounds<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> rap<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.930> your

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
to it and it sounds like a rap that your

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.510
