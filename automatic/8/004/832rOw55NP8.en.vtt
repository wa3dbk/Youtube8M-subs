00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.940
Journalist: Excuse me, here are some italian colleagues who'd like to ask you some questions...

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.480
They have a flight shortly, in three hours.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.620
Leo: We came over in Uruguay to make a documentary about happiness

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.400
and we'l love to know what is the secret recipe to be happy and whether you have a suggestion for italian people 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.240
who's living a period of economic and cultural crysis, and above all a crysis on values.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.080
Mujica: I would say that the first value... we are grown up in a christian world

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.380
who used to say that this is a tears' valley

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.900
and that afterwards we'll find the heaven.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.400
Please!!

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.700
This couldn't be a tears' valley, the heaven is this.

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:09.755
and everyone must build it 

00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:10.874
socially.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.373
You can be happy with so little...

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.120
the biblic saying "born without a shirt"

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.880
if you take it letter by letter it is an absurd, if you stop on the content 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.340
I think that people have the ambition to have too many futile things, too many fees to pay, too much of this, too much of that 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.954
and you don't have the time to live at the end 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.380
and to live you need time for the most important things: some friends, 

00:01:37.594 --> 00:01:39.594
the one you love, children

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.360
and the rest is almost quite unnecessary.

00:01:44.434 --> 00:01:46.434
we need to value these things.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.960
We need to work for a living,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.740
but not the contrary, it's not living for working.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.760
We need to keep our time to live, because it's the only thing that you cannot buy is the time for your life.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.940
This is the first value of life.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.700
There is a need to teach to people to live their life completely

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.780
giving up material excesses

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:19.734
without living on anyone shoulders 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.500
with honest and community spirit, surrounded with people who want it for real.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.180
It seems they are the most ancient keys, antropologically speaking, that humans have..

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.920
but we keep on turning around, too much around, and we overcomplicate this

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.700
Sociologist, theories, bla bla bla... but shut up!

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.240
When are very young, no adventure is worth the love...

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.760
when you are old, love is just a sweet attitude...

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.360
if you couldn't grow it when you were young, you'll be loosing the attitude when older...

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.860
Don't will a young love when you're old 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.100
and don't be wrong on willing an old love when you're young..

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.300
Live your time 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.240
because in every age there is a piece of possible happiness in this world.
