00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.700
 Good day to all I want to show you that 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.700
 such a found dessert 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.960
 actually such a construction to the ditch 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.960
 from all sides 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.690
 now we have 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.330
 trolleybus cars are driving 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.540
 and I will try to show how this works. 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.930
 miracle mirror it is very convenient 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.930
 he can be seen 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:44.820
 left rows when rebuilding let's say 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.820
 somewhere seen 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.460
 cars and do not have to turn 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.850
 head many times to appreciate 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.329
 the situation is road so if i am now 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.329
 in sight 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.620
 but here's the phone doesn't really focus on 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.620
 actually but visible from behind 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.190
 rear views behind me pedestrian path 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.750
 so now I will try to go on the road and 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:26.740
 turn on again show how he is 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:31.149
 running now sings cars and we will see 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.540
 as they are seen in the mirror well, here we are 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:38.040
 proper roads and apparently these same 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.040
 cars that pass 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.950
 but at the same time I can try a little head 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.250
 to the left and see what happens for my 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.060
 I can back my back on the right and see all 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.630
 the road is completely mirror convex 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.509
 so the cars that travel in the distance and with 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.119
 thieves included them from afar very 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.119
 clearly seen here 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.370
 this is how this mirror works 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.640
 thank you all bye see you mine 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.640
