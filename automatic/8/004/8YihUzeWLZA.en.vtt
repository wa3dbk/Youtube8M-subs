00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.040
 speak today about the North American automotive industry is to try a 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.650
 completely different subject with regard to what was customary some 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.999
 years ago 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:22.699
 the complex strategic change that put the 3 big brands to the test 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.679
 Americans recorded important changes 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.809
 for each one resulting in a huge change in the perception of 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.239
 quality that the cars produced in the United States had 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.130
 the most positive example is the new all durango 2011 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.850
 a model that has gone from being a masked peak 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.800
 to a true three-row SUV developed to meet the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.380
 needs of those drivers 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.880
 who enjoy the pleasure of driving 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.420
 new aesthetics 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.140
 new mechanics and above all 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.510
 new chassis 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.710
 they are the clear example of betraying has been taken seriously to put in 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.480
 high your name 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.970
 in a few words with this new durango we are facing a true 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.740
 quantum leap in terms of quality development and effectiveness 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.330
 at first glance the image of the new durango takes some and implants from the 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.070
 ecliptic nightcloth here its immense external dimensions 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.370
 allow to offer a spacious cabin that accommodates up to seven 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.910
 adult passengers in three rows of seats inside the chain is 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.830
 a real surprise 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.470
 the cabin has a level of quality and fine finishes makes feel in 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.930
 a much higher cost vehicle 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.400
 the instrument panel manufactured in one piece 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.110
 with which the annoying noises on roads are eliminated 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.799
 soft materials to the pact 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.909
 in practically the entire interior 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.709
 panels and hundreds of leather in direction through Boston 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.079
 two zone air conditioner 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.519
 steering wheel adjustable in height and depth 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.159
 electric glasses and locks 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.929
 reverse camera 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:30.959
 Radar 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.530
 travel computer 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.669
 controls on the steering wheel and so on 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:40.869
 undoubtedly a sample of technology flexibility and defines the wind 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:46.279
 that try to place the new durango as a point of reference in this market 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.369
 by roads highlight their pigs or performance 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.029
 its unexpected stability 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:03:00.439
 It results in a firm walk and quite fun to be a model of 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.729
 almost five thousand five hundred pounds of weight 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:05.819
 to control this beast 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.689
 it has active security systems such as stability control 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.849
 traction control 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.619
 brakes late that contingent 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:17.619
 among other elements 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:28.489
 the maximum speed is electronically self-limited at 180 kilometers 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:29.349
 hour 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.389
 mechanically speaking equipped with the new v6 pentastar engine 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:41.539
 of 24 valves that develops a maximum power of 290 horses to 6 thousand 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:43.609
 four hundred revolutions 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.180
 and a five-way sequential automatic transmission 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.589
 having checked the virtues on roads of our 2011 durango 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:02.120
 the next challenge was to test his braking ability and we must 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:08.349
 say that the system composed of four ventilated discs already bs us 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.180
 surprised by the mordant ing good holding capacity 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:17.669
 the overall balance on the road left us with a good taste in our mouths and 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.689
 we believe that the competition will have to sweat the fat drop to match it 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.550
 no doubt the new durango is one of those that I have been so great 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.479
 owner of an attractive silhouette 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.770
 level of luxury equipment 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.120
 and a tasty mechanic
