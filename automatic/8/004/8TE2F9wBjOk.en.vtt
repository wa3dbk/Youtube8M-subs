00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.230 
need to stop from zero to 100% gives us
precise<00:01:07.710> speed<00:01:08.100> control<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.820> dial<00:01:09.119> in

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
precise speed control so we can dial in

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.090

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the dial simply stops anywhere we want

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.120 
the dial simply stops anywhere we want
to<00:01:15.360> move<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.259> big<00:01:16.500> enough<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.009> be

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
to move it and it's big enough to be

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.130 
to move it and it's big enough to be
used<00:01:17.430> with<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> heavy<00:01:18.150> boots<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.689> cold
