00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
easy to use interface and just like this

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.190 
easy to use interface and just like this
we're<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> create<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> very<00:00:42.510> new<00:00:42.780> branch

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
we're going to create a very new branch

let's call this one to do click done and
then<00:00:49.010> have<00:00:50.010> another<00:00:50.370> sub<00:00:50.730> branch<00:00:51.059> here<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
then have another sub branch here and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.110 
then have another sub branch here and
say<00:00:52.590> we're<00:00:52.829> gonna<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.309> buy<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.579> plane

more so I'll demonstrate here that we'll
add<00:01:06.479> an<00:01:06.630> icon<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.260> bind<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> plane<00:01:07.890> ticket

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
add an icon to bind the plane ticket

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.429 
add an icon to bind the plane ticket
we'll<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.180> airplane<00:01:09.390> symbol<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.320> we

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
we'll have the airplane symbol here we

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.810 
we'll have the airplane symbol here we
can<00:01:10.560> add<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> picture<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.460> change<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
can add a picture we can change the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760 
can add a picture we can change the
color<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.689> something<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.229> orange

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
color of this to something like orange

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.480 
color of this to something like orange
and<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.210> say<00:01:15.360> we've<00:01:15.509> got<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.960> it

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
and then we can say we've got to do it

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.550 
and then we can say we've got to do it
by<00:01:19.189> December<00:01:20.189> 5th<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.360> run<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> bit<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
by December 5th so we run a bit of a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.020 
by December 5th so we run a bit of a
time<00:01:22.770> crunch<00:01:22.799> here<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.400> we're<00:01:23.520> halfway<00:01:23.729> done

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
time crunch here and we're halfway done

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.580 
time crunch here and we're halfway done
with<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.409> pay

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
with it because we we just have to pay

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.560 
with it because we we just have to pay
for<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.890> now<00:01:26.040> let's<00:01:26.640> add<00:01:26.790> another<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.180> here

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
for it now let's add another one here

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.390 
for it now let's add another one here
and<00:01:27.689> say<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.080> we've<00:01:28.229> got<00:01:28.470> booked<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.189> hotel

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
and say that we've got booked the hotel

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
and say that we've got booked the hotel
because<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.060> one's<00:01:30.240> also<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:31.229> as

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
because that one's also just as

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.039 
because that one's also just as
important<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.610> definitely<00:01:33.000> want<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.240> book<00:01:33.930> a

place<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.500> stay<00:01:34.740> at<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.130> now<00:01:35.280> we've<00:01:35.460> got<00:01:35.670> two

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
place to stay at so now we've got two

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.640 
place to stay at so now we've got two
and<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> did<00:01:36.869> there<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> actually<00:01:37.350> made

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
and what I did there is I actually made

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.050 
and what I did there is I actually made
it<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> sub<00:01:38.009> branch<00:01:38.250> from<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> buy<00:01:38.759> plane

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
it a sub branch from the buy plane

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.999 
it a sub branch from the buy plane
ticket<00:01:39.390> which<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.630> wrong<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.409> let's<00:01:40.619> go<00:01:40.770> ahead

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
ticket which is wrong so let's go ahead

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.319 
ticket which is wrong so let's go ahead
and<00:01:41.360> do<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.869> move<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.149> just<00:01:45.149> like

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and do that and move it and just like

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.120 
and do that and move it and just like
that<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.600> could<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.560> move<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.890> one

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
that I could do that I can move this one

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.060 
that I could do that I can move this one
around<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.759> could<00:01:48.270> hold<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
around I could hold it here so that it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.590 
around I could hold it here so that it
will<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.310> move<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.700> one<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.090> let's<00:01:51.270> hold<00:01:51.450> it

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
will just move this one so let's hold it

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.510 
will just move this one so let's hold it
here<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> could<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.040> move<00:01:53.340> this

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
here and now I could just move this

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.460 
here and now I could just move this
without<00:01:53.880> moving<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> sub-branches<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.320> can

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
without moving the sub-branches you can

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.690 
without moving the sub-branches you can
do<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> ton<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.040> kind<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.280> stuff<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.549> now

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
do a ton of that kind of stuff so now

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.609 
do a ton of that kind of stuff so now
let's<00:01:56.909> go<00:01:57.060> ahead<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.420> create<00:01:57.630> another<00:01:57.659> branch

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
let's go ahead and create another branch

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.490 
let's go ahead and create another branch
here<00:01:58.950> from<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.250> main<00:01:59.810> spot<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.110> we'll<00:02:01.259> say

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
here from the main spot so we'll say

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.819 
here from the main spot so we'll say
that<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.770> want<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.810> check<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:03.960> some<00:02:04.200> spots<00:02:04.530> so

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
that we want to check out some spots so

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.089 
that we want to check out some spots so
spots<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.490> check<00:02:05.729> out<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:09.500> it's<00:02:10.500> add<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> few<00:02:10.979> in

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
spots to check out and it's add a few in

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.290 
spots to check out and it's add a few in
here

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.880 

if<00:02:16.300> I'd<00:02:16.510> like<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.840> hide<00:02:17.020> any<00:02:17.260> particular

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
if I'd like to hide any particular

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.620 
if I'd like to hide any particular
branches<00:02:18.340> just<00:02:18.580> double<00:02:18.880> tap<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.120> there<00:02:19.480> they

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
branches just double tap and there they

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.210 
branches just double tap and there they
are<00:02:19.780> hidden<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:20.260> you've<00:02:20.380> got<00:02:20.560> more<00:02:20.740> space<00:02:21.010> to

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
are hidden so you've got more space to

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.920 
are hidden so you've got more space to
play<00:02:21.400> around<00:02:21.640> with<00:02:21.790> I've<00:02:22.330> added<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.720> few<00:02:22.870> more

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
play around with I've added a few more

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.500 
play around with I've added a few more
spots<00:02:23.410> here<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:23.950> now<00:02:24.640> what<00:02:24.850> I'll<00:02:24.970> do<00:02:25.180> is<00:02:25.450> just

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
spots here and now what I'll do is just

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.330 
spots here and now what I'll do is just
add<00:02:26.050> an<00:02:26.200> icon<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.890> because<00:02:27.100> I've<00:02:27.190> also

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
add an icon to it because I've also

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.740 
add an icon to it because I've also
already<00:02:27.580> changed<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.180> color<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.540> the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
already changed the color of the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.080 
already changed the color of the
branches<00:02:29.290> we'll<00:02:29.830> add<00:02:30.010> something<00:02:30.340> like<00:02:30.670> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
branches we'll add something like the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.870 
branches we'll add something like the
star<00:02:31.930> icon<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.260> think<00:02:32.530> that's<00:02:32.710> well<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.250> there

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
star icon I think that's well and there

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.700 
star icon I think that's well and there
we<00:02:34.060> go<00:02:34.300> we've<00:02:34.510> added<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.960> beginning<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.590> our

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710
