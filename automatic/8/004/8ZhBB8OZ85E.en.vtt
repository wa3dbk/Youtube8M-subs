00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
that was too immature Bueller I could

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.060 
that was too immature Bueller I could
understand<00:06:00.000> that<00:06:00.120> I<00:06:00.440> especially<00:06:01.440> when<00:06:01.800> I<00:06:01.830> was

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
understand that I especially when I was

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.890 
understand that I especially when I was
when<00:06:02.610> he<00:06:02.640> was<00:06:02.820> a<00:06:02.850> senior<00:06:03.240> I<00:06:03.330> had<00:06:03.480> a<00:06:03.510> little<00:06:03.690> bit

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
when he was a senior I had a little bit

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.360
