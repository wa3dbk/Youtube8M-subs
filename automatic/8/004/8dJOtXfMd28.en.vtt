easily<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:15.960> them<00:01:16.080> by<00:01:16.200> leveling<00:01:16.590> up<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
easily just get them by leveling up and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.859 
easily just get them by leveling up and
I<00:01:17.430> don't<00:01:17.909> know<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:18.150> some<00:01:18.330> random<00:01:18.720> ones

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
I don't know you get some random ones

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.840 
I don't know you get some random ones
here<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.350> well<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.400> don't<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.640> need<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
here as well so you don't really need to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
here as well so you don't really need to
worry<00:01:20.970> about<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.630> will<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.740> l

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
worry about that but I will see that l

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.710 
worry about that but I will see that l
in<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> game<00:01:23.700> what<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:23.939> want<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.479> kind

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
in the game what you want to do is kind

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.030

of spend your squad points wisely

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.130 
of spend your squad points wisely
because<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:27.869> strong

we're<00:02:05.219> just<00:02:05.280> going<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.490> focus<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.939> one<00:02:06.240> class

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
we're just going to focus on one class

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.550 
we're just going to focus on one class
in<00:02:06.630> particular<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.170> that's<00:02:07.229> going<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.500> be

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
in particular and that's going to be

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.499 
in particular and that's going to be
based<00:02:07.770> around<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.190> USR<00:02:08.670> sniper<00:02:09.000> rifle<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
based around the USR sniper rifle the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.390 
based around the USR sniper rifle the
USR<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.229> kind<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.560> similar<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.890> something<00:02:11.310> like

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
USR is kind of similar to something like

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.960 
USR is kind of similar to something like
a<00:02:11.459> ballista<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:12.300> even<00:02:12.629> an

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
a ballista or even an

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.480 
a ballista or even an
sar<00:02:13.180> from<00:02:13.390> mw3<00:02:13.840> it's<00:02:14.500> slightly<00:02:14.800> faster<00:02:15.310> than

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
sar from mw3 it's slightly faster than

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.340 
sar from mw3 it's slightly faster than
another<00:02:15.610> bolt-action<00:02:16.180> sniper<00:02:16.210> rifle<00:02:16.840> it's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
another bolt-action sniper rifle it's

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.590 
another bolt-action sniper rifle it's
got<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.500> slightly<00:02:17.710> larger<00:02:17.890> magazine<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:19.420> does

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
got a slightly larger magazine it does

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.060 
got a slightly larger magazine it does
slightly<00:02:20.080> less<00:02:20.290> damage<00:02:20.710> or<00:02:20.830> it's<00:02:20.950> got<00:02:21.040> a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
slightly less damage or it's got a

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.640 
slightly less damage or it's got a
slightly<00:02:21.340> smaller<00:02:21.640> one<00:02:22.240> shot<00:02:22.510> hitbox<00:02:22.990> but<00:02:23.410> in

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
slightly smaller one shot hitbox but in

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.500 
slightly smaller one shot hitbox but in
all<00:02:23.980> honesty<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.640> don't<00:02:25.000> give<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.150> many<00:02:25.360> hit

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
all honesty you don't give that many hit

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.030 
all honesty you don't give that many hit
markers<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:25.930> game<00:02:26.110> at<00:02:26.230> all<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:26.740> I

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
markers in this game at all so I

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.830 
markers in this game at all so I
honestly<00:02:27.610> haven't<00:02:27.970> noticed<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.450> difference

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
honestly haven't noticed the difference

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.650 
honestly haven't noticed the difference
between<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.230> L<00:02:29.350> 11<00:02:29.740> and<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.280> USR<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.060> mean<00:02:31.330> they

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
between the L 11 and the USR I mean they

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.720 
between the L 11 and the USR I mean they
both<00:02:31.840> seem<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.170> kill<00:02:32.440> very<00:02:32.950> consistently<00:02:33.610> in

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
both seem to kill very consistently in

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.580 
both seem to kill very consistently in
one<00:02:33.760> shot<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.690> really<00:02:35.050> isn't<00:02:35.260> an<00:02:35.470> issue

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
one shot so that really isn't an issue

however<00:03:58.090> that<00:03:58.269> you<00:03:58.780> can<00:03:58.900> only<00:03:59.019> have<00:03:59.170> one<00:03:59.200> item

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
however that you can only have one item

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.949 
however that you can only have one item
from<00:03:59.799> each<00:03:59.890> category<00:04:00.280> so<00:04:00.700> for<00:04:00.850> example<00:04:01.299> I<00:04:01.450> can

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
from each category so for example I can

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.320 
from each category so for example I can
have<00:04:01.989> extended<00:04:02.980> mags<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.400> also<00:04:03.760> an<00:04:03.940> ACOG

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
have extended mags and also an ACOG

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.050 
have extended mags and also an ACOG
sight<00:04:04.570> but<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:05.470> can't<00:04:05.830> have<00:04:06.070> extended<00:04:06.640> mags<00:04:06.820> and

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
sight but I can't have extended mags and

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.699 
sight but I can't have extended mags and
also<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.930> armor-piercing

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
also the armor-piercing

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.310 
also the armor-piercing
only<00:04:09.340> let<00:04:09.670> me<00:04:09.760> have<00:04:09.910> one<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.120> those<00:04:10.299> so<00:04:10.600> I<00:04:10.810> would

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
only let me have one of those so I would

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.720 
only let me have one of those so I would
say<00:04:11.440> that<00:04:11.560> extended<00:04:11.920> mags<00:04:12.100> is<00:04:12.370> probably<00:04:12.640> a

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
say that extended mags is probably a

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.949 
say that extended mags is probably a
priority<00:04:13.209> that's<00:04:13.360> something<00:04:13.630> you<00:04:13.690> should<00:04:13.810> get

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
priority that's something you should get

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.690 
priority that's something you should get
in<00:04:14.080> as<00:04:14.320> soon<00:04:14.500> as<00:04:14.650> possible<00:04:15.070> so<00:04:15.220> for<00:04:15.610> the

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
in as soon as possible so for the

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.159 
in as soon as possible so for the
secondaries<00:04:16.150> are<00:04:16.180> lethal<00:04:16.450> Zanda<00:04:16.690> titles<00:04:17.109> I'm

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
secondaries are lethal Zanda titles I'm

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.000 
secondaries are lethal Zanda titles I'm

gameplay<00:04:21.220> that<00:04:21.459> much<00:04:21.640> and<00:04:21.880> I<00:04:21.910> mean<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.330> really

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
gameplay that much and I mean you really

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.909 
gameplay that much and I mean you really
shouldn't<00:04:22.750> make<00:04:22.840> it<00:04:22.900> too<00:04:23.110> much<00:04:23.260> of<00:04:23.380> a<00:04:23.410> priority

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
shouldn't make it too much of a priority

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.740 
shouldn't make it too much of a priority
to<00:04:24.039> buy<00:04:24.190> a<00:04:24.220> new<00:04:24.460> pistol<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:25.030> start<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.419> game<00:04:25.450> or

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
to buy a new pistol to start the game or

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.460 
to buy a new pistol to start the game or
something

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
something

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.660 
something
because<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:26.980> pestles<00:04:27.280> in<00:04:27.370> this<00:04:27.460> game<00:04:27.610> are

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
because the pestles in this game are

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.220 
because the pestles in this game are
actually<00:04:28.000> pretty<00:04:28.210> crap<00:04:28.540> they're<00:04:28.780> pre<00:04:28.990> pure

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
actually pretty crap they're pre pure

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.710 
actually pretty crap they're pre pure
they're<00:04:29.980> not<00:04:30.130> like<00:04:30.310> black<00:04:30.490> ops<00:04:30.730> 2<00:04:30.910> pistols<00:04:31.180> so

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
they're not like black ops 2 pistols so

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.690 
they're not like black ops 2 pistols so
don't<00:04:32.320> go<00:04:32.470> relying<00:04:32.830> on<00:04:32.920> your<00:04:33.100> pistols<00:04:33.430> at<00:04:33.550> all

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
don't go relying on your pistols at all

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.250 
don't go relying on your pistols at all
the<00:04:33.880> only<00:04:34.030> time<00:04:34.240> you'll<00:04:34.390> really<00:04:34.600> use<00:04:34.870> them<00:04:35.080> as

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
the only time you'll really use them as

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.990 
the only time you'll really use them as
for<00:04:35.650> example<00:04:36.100> if<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.250> get<00:04:36.370> hep<00:04:36.550> marker<00:04:36.880> up

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
for example if you get hep marker up

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.610 
for example if you get hep marker up
close<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.750> you<00:04:37.780> want<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.050> train<00:04:38.200> pistol<00:04:38.530> whip

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
close and you want to train pistol whip

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.840 
close and you want to train pistol whip
the<00:04:38.740> game<00:04:38.860> finish<00:04:39.190> them<00:04:39.370> off<00:04:39.460> or<00:04:39.610> something

like that the parents Essman ghost does

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.080 
like that the parents Essman ghost does
look<00:04:41.770> a<00:04:41.860> little<00:04:42.040> bit<00:04:42.190> crazy<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.700> first<00:04:42.850> time

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
look a little bit crazy the first time

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.310 
look a little bit crazy the first time

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
you see it does look a little bit

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.020 
you see it does look a little bit
intimidating<00:04:44.890> but<00:04:45.400> it's<00:04:45.580> actually<00:04:45.820> really

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
intimidating but it's actually really

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
class at once and obviously you've just

you<00:05:02.440> can<00:05:02.650> obviously<00:05:02.800> have<00:05:03.190> more<00:05:03.430> than<00:05:03.550> eight

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
you can obviously have more than eight

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.730

points<00:05:04.090> worth<00:05:04.240> of<00:05:04.360> perks<00:05:04.660> so<00:05:05.140> for<00:05:05.290> sniping<00:05:05.590> I'd

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
points worth of perks so for sniping I'd

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.770 
points worth of perks so for sniping I'd
say<00:05:05.890> there's<00:05:06.070> two<00:05:06.340> really<00:05:06.970> essential<00:05:07.540> perks

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
say there's two really essential perks

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.330 
say there's two really essential perks
and<00:05:08.050> then<00:05:08.200> the<00:05:08.320> rest<00:05:08.560> are<00:05:08.830> kind<00:05:09.040> of<00:05:09.100> down<00:05:09.310> to

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
and then the rest are kind of down to

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.370 
and then the rest are kind of down to
more<00:05:09.640> so<00:05:09.820> our<00:05:09.910> personal<00:05:10.360> preference<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:11.200> two

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
more so our personal preference the two

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.870 
more so our personal preference the two
essential<00:05:11.620> ones<00:05:12.040> are<00:05:12.190> going<00:05:12.280> to<00:05:12.340> be<00:05:12.400> focused

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
essential ones are going to be focused

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.360 
essential ones are going to be focused
and<00:05:13.030> quick-draw<00:05:14.020> I<00:05:14.200> know<00:05:14.440> what<00:05:14.590> focus<00:05:14.830> does<00:05:15.130> is

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
and quick-draw I know what focus does is

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.190 
and quick-draw I know what focus does is
it<00:05:15.880> reduces<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.600> flinch<00:05:16.870> that<00:05:17.080> your

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
it reduces the flinch that your

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.020 
it reduces the flinch that your
character<00:05:17.620> will<00:05:17.710> take<00:05:17.920> when<00:05:18.370> you<00:05:18.460> get<00:05:18.580> shot<00:05:18.850> so

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
character will take when you get shot so

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.280 
character will take when you get shot so
for<00:05:19.270> example<00:05:19.600> if<00:05:19.660> your<00:05:19.780> scope<00:05:20.020> then<00:05:20.200> on

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
for example if your scope then on

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.990 
for example if your scope then on
someone<00:05:20.650> and<00:05:20.800> you<00:05:21.100> try<00:05:21.280> to<00:05:21.310> take<00:05:21.520> them<00:05:21.640> out<00:05:21.790> but

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
someone and you try to take them out but

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.730 
someone and you try to take them out but
your<00:05:22.090> shoots<00:05:22.270> you<00:05:22.390> back<00:05:22.570> normally<00:05:23.380> your<00:05:23.530> scope

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
your shoots you back normally your scope

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.650 
your shoots you back normally your scope
way<00:05:24.130> off<00:05:24.250> target<00:05:24.460> and<00:05:24.910> you<00:05:25.270> probably<00:05:25.420> miss<00:05:25.630> a

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
way off target and you probably miss a

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.060 
way off target and you probably miss a
shot<00:05:25.960> whereas<00:05:26.230> focus<00:05:26.560> will<00:05:26.710> keep<00:05:26.860> you<00:05:26.980> on

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
shot whereas focus will keep you on

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.980 
shot whereas focus will keep you on
target<00:05:27.280> you<00:05:27.760> still<00:05:27.970> do<00:05:28.120> flinch<00:05:28.450> a<00:05:28.630> little<00:05:28.660> bit

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
target you still do flinch a little bit

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.780 
target you still do flinch a little bit
but<00:05:29.380> it's<00:05:29.590> nowhere<00:05:29.770> near<00:05:30.100> as<00:05:30.220> bad<00:05:30.250> as<00:05:30.400> it<00:05:30.640> would

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
but it's nowhere near as bad as it would

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.420 
but it's nowhere near as bad as it would
be<00:05:30.820> without<00:05:31.360> focus<00:05:31.930> so<00:05:32.110> focus<00:05:32.680> is<00:05:32.830> extremely

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
be without focus so focus is extremely

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.890 
be without focus so focus is extremely
extremely<00:05:33.730> important<00:05:34.090> in<00:05:34.180> this<00:05:34.300> game<00:05:34.419> it

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
extremely important in this game it

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.120 
extremely important in this game it
would<00:05:35.020> definitely<00:05:35.169> make<00:05:35.440> sure<00:05:35.500> that's<00:05:35.770> one<00:05:36.070> of

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
would definitely make sure that's one of

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.560 
would definitely make sure that's one of
your<00:05:36.250> priority<00:05:36.669> perks<00:05:36.940> you<00:05:37.060> take<00:05:37.270> in<00:05:37.419> this

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
your priority perks you take in this

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.850 
your priority perks you take in this
game<00:05:37.750> and<00:05:37.900> you're<00:05:37.990> Snape<00:05:38.200> and<00:05:38.380> quick-draw<00:05:38.800> is

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
game and you're Snape and quick-draw is

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.230 
game and you're Snape and quick-draw is
pretty<00:05:39.130> obvious<00:05:39.280> that's<00:05:39.669> the<00:05:39.760> parent<00:05:39.940> lecture

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
pretty obvious that's the parent lecture

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.420 
pretty obvious that's the parent lecture
school<00:05:40.450> pen<00:05:40.630> faster<00:05:41.169> it's<00:05:41.650> quite<00:05:41.830> expensive<00:05:42.010> I

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
school pen faster it's quite expensive I

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.460 
school pen faster it's quite expensive I
think<00:05:42.460> it<00:05:42.669> cost<00:05:42.850> main<00:05:43.210> squad<00:05:43.600> points<00:05:44.020> so<00:05:44.230> you

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
think it cost main squad points so you

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.230 
think it cost main squad points so you
may<00:05:44.740> have<00:05:44.919> to<00:05:45.010> save<00:05:45.190> up<00:05:45.340> after<00:05:45.610> a<00:05:45.700> few<00:05:45.850> games<00:05:46.000> to

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
may have to save up after a few games to

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.790 
may have to save up after a few games to
actually<00:05:46.510> get<00:05:46.690> it<00:05:46.840> but<00:05:47.050> it's<00:05:47.290> definitely<00:05:47.440> one

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
actually get it but it's definitely one

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.500 
actually get it but it's definitely one
you<00:05:47.860> want<00:05:48.130> to<00:05:48.190> begin<00:05:48.400> as<00:05:48.550> soon<00:05:48.760> as<00:05:48.850> possible

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
just to have that sort of speed

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.530 
just to have that sort of speed
