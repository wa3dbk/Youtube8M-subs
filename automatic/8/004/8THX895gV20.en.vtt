Browning colored nude it looks pretty

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.830 
Browning colored nude it looks pretty
dark<00:00:58.520> almost<00:00:59.520> watch<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.329> don't<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.660> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
dark almost watch but you don't have to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840 
dark almost watch but you don't have to
make<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.199> dark<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.649> looks<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
make it as dark as it looks on the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.369 
make it as dark as it looks on the
swatch<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.329> mean<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.660> feel<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.229> looks

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
swatch I mean I feel like it looks

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.509 
swatch I mean I feel like it looks
little<00:01:04.500> lighter<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.159> put<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
little lighter when you put it on the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.940 
little lighter when you put it on the
lips<00:01:05.729> that's<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.750> my<00:01:06.900> opinion

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
lips that's just my opinion

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.480 
lips that's just my opinion
I<00:01:08.010> think<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.630> would<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.409> great<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
I think that it would be great for a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.609 
I think that it would be great for a
variety<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.909> skin<00:01:12.180> tones<00:01:12.390> probably<00:01:12.900> not<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
variety of skin tones probably not the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.580 
variety of skin tones probably not the
best<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.060> very<00:01:15.420> very<00:01:15.780> fair<00:01:16.170> skin

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
best for like the very very fair skin

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.940 
best for like the very very fair skin
tones<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:18.810> again<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.259> your<00:01:19.500> taste<00:01:19.740> in

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
tones but again it's just your taste in

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.039 
tones but again it's just your taste in
your<00:01:19.979> opinion<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.729> really<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.869> it's

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
your opinion I really like it it's

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.810 
your opinion I really like it it's
really<00:01:22.170> creamy<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:23.100> goes<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.400> really<00:01:23.430> nice

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
really creamy and it goes on really nice

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.730 
really creamy and it goes on really nice

taste I think I might save it for when I
do<00:02:10.020> makeup<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.500> someone<00:02:10.860> else<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.250> if<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.370> darker
