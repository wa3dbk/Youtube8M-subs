I'm explain about mouse configuration
and<00:00:26.449> mouse<00:00:26.660> settings<00:00:27.369> to<00:00:28.369> kick<00:00:28.520> things<00:00:28.730> off

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
and mouse settings to kick things off

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.250 
and mouse settings to kick things off
let's<00:00:28.940> go<00:00:29.210> into<00:00:29.360> the<00:00:29.449> drivers<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:30.140> I'll

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
speed which is at 6 and I keep it there

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.290 
speed which is at 6 and I keep it there
because<00:00:57.710> you<00:00:57.920> can<00:00:58.070> have<00:00:58.190> tracking<00:00:58.670> problems

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
because you can have tracking problems

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.819 
because you can have tracking problems
and<00:00:59.510> negative<00:00:59.750> acceleration<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.500> positive

and negative acceleration and positive

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.189 
and negative acceleration and positive
acceleration<00:01:01.040> which<00:01:01.550> can<00:01:02.000> result<00:01:02.149> in

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.860 

different<00:01:05.920> variables<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.400> will<00:01:06.909> mess<00:01:07.690> you

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
different variables that will mess you

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.899 
different variables that will mess you
up<00:01:07.900> in<00:01:08.170> game<00:01:08.409> I'll<00:01:09.010> get<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.370> that<00:01:09.400> later<00:01:09.490> though

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
up in game I'll get to that later though

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.540 
up in game I'll get to that later though
I<00:01:11.040> keep<00:01:12.040> my<00:01:12.220> CPI<00:01:12.880> or<00:01:13.210> dpi<00:01:13.720> 800<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:15.250> that's<00:01:15.430> what

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
I keep my CPI or dpi 800 and that's what

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.120 
I keep my CPI or dpi 800 and that's what
we<00:01:15.610> need<00:01:15.729> are<00:01:16.210> moving<00:01:16.479> per<00:01:16.690> inch<00:01:16.869> I<00:01:17.260> used<00:01:18.040> to

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
we need are moving per inch I used to

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.190 
we need are moving per inch I used to
play<00:01:18.220> 800<00:01:18.700> 600<00:01:19.180> not<00:01:19.300> use<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.479> really<00:01:19.840> low<00:01:19.990> dot

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
play 800 600 not use a really low dot

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.150 
play 800 600 not use a really low dot
per<00:01:20.440> inch<00:01:20.500> like<00:01:21.280> 400<00:01:21.910> 450<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:23.200> sixth<00:01:23.590> one<00:01:23.830> and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
per inch like 400 450 the sixth one and

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.130 
per inch like 400 450 the sixth one and
now<00:01:24.520> I<00:01:24.550> use<00:01:24.610> 800<00:01:25.330> cuz<00:01:25.509> I<00:01:25.600> plan<00:01:25.840> thanks<00:01:25.990> for

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
now I use 800 cuz I plan thanks for

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.730 
now I use 800 cuz I plan thanks for
coming<00:01:26.320> by<00:01:26.410> 1080<00:01:26.740> all<00:01:26.979> my<00:01:27.160> games<00:01:27.400> and<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.869> use<00:01:29.170> a

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
coming by 1080 all my games and I use a

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.859 
coming by 1080 all my games and I use a
thousand<00:01:30.400> polling<00:01:30.820> rate<00:01:30.970> which<00:01:31.180> is<00:01:31.330> Hertz<00:01:31.600> and

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
thousand polling rate which is Hertz and

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.740 
thousand polling rate which is Hertz and
that<00:01:31.930> results<00:01:32.650> to<00:01:32.830> about<00:01:33.420> theoretically<00:01:34.420> one

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
that results to about theoretically one

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.300 
that results to about theoretically one
millisecond<00:01:35.229> response<00:01:35.350> time<00:01:35.740> report<00:01:36.220> and

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
millisecond response time report and

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.130 
millisecond response time report and
receive<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:36.759> your<00:01:36.880> CPU<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:37.840> that's<00:01:37.960> pretty

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
receive to your CPU so that's pretty

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.639 
receive to your CPU so that's pretty
fast

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
fast

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.760 
fast
that's<00:01:39.310> how<00:01:39.520> much<00:01:39.640> information<00:01:40.300> is<00:01:40.390> being

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
that's how much information is being

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.560 
that's how much information is being
reported<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.160> received<00:01:42.580> back<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.330> you

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
reported and received back to you

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.170 
reported and received back to you
so<00:01:44.110> that<00:01:44.259> can<00:01:44.440> result<00:01:44.710> in<00:01:44.920> really<00:01:45.399> fast<00:01:45.640> Layton

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
so that can result in really fast Layton

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.230 
so that can result in really fast Layton
sees<00:01:46.740> or<00:01:47.740> really<00:01:48.100> low<00:01:48.250> latency<00:01:48.460> si<00:01:48.880> should<00:01:49.060> say

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
sees or really low latency si should say

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.139 
sees or really low latency si should say
rather<00:01:50.070> from<00:01:51.070> your<00:01:51.190> mouse<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.580> your<00:01:51.700> computer

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
rather from your mouse to your computer

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.240 
rather from your mouse to your computer
so<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:53.020> might<00:01:53.200> get<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.500> click<00:01:53.740> off<00:01:53.860> before

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
so you might get the click off before

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.990 
so you might get the click off before
that<00:01:54.280> guy<00:01:54.960> other<00:01:55.960> things<00:01:56.259> you<00:01:56.890> know<00:01:57.009> result<00:01:57.940> on

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
that guy other things you know result on

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.990 
that guy other things you know result on
that<00:01:58.149> see<00:01:58.330> you<00:01:58.390> like<00:01:58.479> muscle<00:01:58.869> memory<00:01:58.899> I

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
that see you like muscle memory I

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.940 
that see you like muscle memory I
recommend<00:02:01.000> playing<00:02:01.149> at<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.420> set<00:02:01.869> dpi<00:02:02.500> or<00:02:02.590> CPI

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
recommend playing at a set dpi or CPI

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.740 
recommend playing at a set dpi or CPI
don't<00:02:03.399> be<00:02:03.580> changing<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.119> around<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.660> know

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
just cuz one these pro players use that

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.490 
just cuz one these pro players use that
it's<00:02:07.179> all<00:02:07.330> preference<00:02:07.600> use<00:02:07.990> what<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.289> want<00:02:08.440> to

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
get used to it and then you'll be able

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.050 
get used to it and then you'll be able
to<00:02:14.620> move<00:02:14.860> really<00:02:15.340> fluently<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:18.360> yeah<00:02:19.360> so

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
to move really fluently and yeah so

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.740 
to move really fluently and yeah so
that's<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.480> drivers<00:02:24.269> not<00:02:25.269> much<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.600> it

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
that's the drivers not much to it

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.340 
that's the drivers not much to it
just<00:02:26.620> some<00:02:27.370> dpi<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.120> earth<00:02:28.720> settings<00:02:29.170> and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
just some dpi and earth settings and

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.110 
just some dpi and earth settings and
stuff<00:02:29.560> it's<00:02:30.370> really<00:02:30.400> simple

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
stuff it's really simple

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.640

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
load in a config from a role player but

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.229 
load in a config from a role player but
like<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.530> said<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:35.829> all<00:02:35.980> preference<00:02:36.250> use<00:02:37.060> what

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
like I said it's all preference use what

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:46.860 
like I said it's all preference use what
you<00:02:37.360> want<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.600> use<00:02:41.220> all<00:02:42.220> right<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:44.400> next<00:02:45.870> it

you want to use all right so next it

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.490 
you want to use all right so next it
against<00:02:47.110> your<00:02:47.200> CPL<00:02:47.590> mouse<00:02:47.799> config<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:50.200> what

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
against your CPL mouse config and what

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.170 
against your CPL mouse config and what
this<00:02:50.739> is<00:02:51.070> I<00:02:51.100> know<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.549> lot<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.760> people<00:02:51.970> know<00:02:52.090> what

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
this is I know a lot of people know what

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.819 
this is I know a lot of people know what
this<00:02:52.299> is<00:02:52.480> if<00:02:52.750> you're<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:52.989> competitive<00:02:53.380> player

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
this is if you're a competitive player

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.800 
this is if you're a competitive player
and<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.820> get<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.209> registry

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
and you get to registry

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.160 
and you get to registry
values<00:03:01.330> what<00:03:02.330> they<00:03:02.450> do<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.780> they<00:03:02.930> remove

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
values what they do is they remove

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.420 
values what they do is they remove
acceleration<00:03:03.770> on<00:03:03.890> your<00:03:04.010> mouse

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
acceleration on your mouse

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.990 
acceleration on your mouse
so<00:03:04.870> normally<00:03:06.310> acceleration<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.430> on<00:03:07.520> Windows

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
so normally acceleration is on Windows

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.970 
so normally acceleration is on Windows
even<00:03:08.480> if<00:03:08.569> you<00:03:08.630> turn<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.930> off<00:03:09.080> there<00:03:09.500> can<00:03:09.680> still

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
even if you turn it off there can still

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.949 
even if you turn it off there can still
be<00:03:10.040> traces<00:03:10.340> of<00:03:10.580> acceleration<00:03:11.300> and<00:03:11.569> what<00:03:11.780> that

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
be traces of acceleration and what that

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.890 
be traces of acceleration and what that
is<00:03:12.110> is<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.560> if<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:13.069> move<00:03:13.220> your<00:03:13.400> mouse<00:03:13.780> we're<00:03:14.780> in

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
is is is if you move your mouse we're in

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.240 
is is is if you move your mouse we're in
real<00:03:15.110> time<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:15.650> in<00:03:15.770> real<00:03:15.890> time<00:03:16.040> if<00:03:16.160> you

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
real time this is in real time if you

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.860 
real time this is in real time if you
move<00:03:16.430> your<00:03:16.580> mouse<00:03:16.610> like<00:03:16.970> an<00:03:17.060> inch<00:03:17.270> they'll

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
move your mouse like an inch they'll

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.809 
move your mouse like an inch they'll
move<00:03:18.080> two<00:03:18.290> inches<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.890> know<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.430> lot<00:03:19.610> of<00:03:19.640> your

move two inches I know a lot of your

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.000 
move two inches I know a lot of your
team<00:03:20.000> players<00:03:20.239> use<00:03:20.480> acceleration<00:03:21.080> I<00:03:21.230> don't<00:03:21.590> I

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
team players use acceleration I don't I

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.460 
team players use acceleration I don't I
hate<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:23.180> can<00:03:23.330> get<00:03:23.420> this<00:03:23.600> at<00:03:23.750> SK<00:03:24.110> gaming's
