00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029 
here but I'm gonna try to get this swarm

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.660 
here but I'm gonna try to get this swarm
it's<00:00:08.029> high<00:00:08.510> up<00:00:08.750> and<00:00:08.960> it's<00:00:09.170> harder<00:00:09.469> to<00:00:09.590> get<00:00:09.740> so

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
it's high up and it's harder to get so

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.020

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
watch me put the hide that swarm in the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:01:35.050 
watch me put the hide that swarm in the
high

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.620

good<00:01:56.609> sized<00:01:56.880> hive<00:01:57.179> I'll<00:01:57.509> say<00:02:00.109> four<00:02:01.109> to<00:02:01.200> five

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
good sized hive I'll say four to five

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.370 
good sized hive I'll say four to five
pounds<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.039> bees<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.959> this<00:02:03.959> is<00:02:04.049> pretty<00:02:04.140> good

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
pounds the bees so this is pretty good

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
maybe you can see they're a kind of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.160 
maybe you can see they're a kind of
stage<00:02:10.829> seven<00:02:11.220> bound<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.879> going<00:02:12.720> back<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.049> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
stage seven bound and going back in the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.240 
stage seven bound and going back in the
hive

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
hive

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.470 
hive
so<00:02:15.810> I'm<00:02:16.810> going<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:18.030> try<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.060> coach<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:21.820> swarm

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
so I'm going to try to coach the swarm

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.510 
so I'm going to try to coach the swarm
the<00:02:23.170> rest<00:02:23.350> of<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.530> bunch<00:02:23.680> on<00:02:23.890> top<00:02:24.130> I'm<00:02:24.370> going

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
the rest of the bunch on top I'm going

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.760 
the rest of the bunch on top I'm going
to<00:02:24.580> try<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.730> try<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.000> encourage<00:02:25.300> him<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.630> go<00:02:25.840> go

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
to try to try to encourage him to go go

00:02:26.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
to try to try to encourage him to go go
into<00:02:27.010> have<00:02:27.190> also

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.440 

I'm<00:03:03.180> going<00:03:03.450> like<00:03:03.629> like<00:03:03.989> my<00:03:04.230> smoker

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
I'm going like like my smoker

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.039 
I'm going like like my smoker
and<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.290> I'll<00:03:07.500> use<00:03:07.769> a<00:03:07.799> smoker<00:03:08.219> then<00:03:08.810> help<00:03:09.810> coach

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
and so I'll use a smoker then help coach

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:44.059 
and so I'll use a smoker then help coach
behind

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.489 

yep<00:03:44.700> get<00:03:44.879> the<00:03:45.030> smoke<00:03:45.180> going<00:03:45.719> real<00:03:45.900> good<00:03:45.930> or

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:46.499 
yep get the smoke going real good or

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:54.630 
yep get the smoke going real good or
it'll<00:03:46.950> go<00:03:47.069> out<00:03:47.099> on<00:03:47.430> you

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.580 

now<00:03:55.090> maybe<00:03:55.330> you<00:03:55.540> can<00:03:56.370> see<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.490> bunch<00:03:57.670> on<00:03:57.910> top

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
now maybe you can see the bunch on top

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.680 
now maybe you can see the bunch on top
and<00:03:59.590> we'll<00:03:59.860> smoke<00:04:00.100> them<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:01.390> encourage

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
and we'll smoke them and to encourage

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.330 
and we'll smoke them and to encourage
him<00:04:01.960> going<00:04:02.230> down<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.770> interest<00:04:03.100> is<00:04:03.190> going

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
him going down and the interest is going

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:46.480 
him going down and the interest is going
in<00:04:03.520> hand

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.570 

the<00:04:46.850> reason<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:48.260> bees<00:04:48.440> are<00:04:48.740> hesitant<00:04:49.430> to

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
the reason the bees are hesitant to

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.450 
the reason the bees are hesitant to
leave<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.600> original<00:04:51.590> landing<00:04:51.980> place<00:04:52.220> up

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
leave the original landing place up

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.910 
leave the original landing place up
there<00:04:52.640> is<00:04:53.300> because<00:04:53.630> they<00:04:53.930> still<00:04:54.230> smell<00:04:54.650> the

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
there is because they still smell the

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.610 
there is because they still smell the
scent<00:04:55.220> of<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.580> queen<00:04:55.820> bee<00:04:56.030> up<00:04:56.240> there<00:04:56.620> but

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
scent of the queen bee up there but

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.560 
scent of the queen bee up there but
hopefully<00:04:58.100> I've<00:04:58.220> got<00:04:58.400> her<00:04:58.550> in<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.880> hive<00:04:59.060> and

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
hopefully I've got her in the hive and

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.840 
hopefully I've got her in the hive and
and<00:04:59.960> it'll<00:05:00.710> take<00:05:00.890> some<00:05:01.100> time<00:05:01.340> but<00:05:01.640> then

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
and it'll take some time but then

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:09.529 
and it'll take some time but then
they'll<00:05:02.120> all<00:05:02.330> go<00:05:02.540> down<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:03.020> go<00:05:03.110> in<00:05:03.290> the<00:05:03.410> high

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.010 

I<00:05:09.569> had<00:05:10.469> to<00:05:10.650> build<00:05:10.860> a<00:05:11.069> I<00:05:11.370> had<00:05:12.210> to<00:05:12.360> build<00:05:12.539> a<00:05:12.689> stand

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
I had to build a I had to build a stand

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.379 
I had to build a I had to build a stand
because<00:05:13.379> they<00:05:13.590> were<00:05:13.650> up<00:05:13.860> higher<00:05:14.129> so<00:05:14.520> you<00:05:15.240> can

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
because they were up higher so you can

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.600 
because they were up higher so you can
see<00:05:15.599> I<00:05:15.629> had<00:05:15.960> to<00:05:15.990> kind<00:05:16.800> of<00:05:16.860> do<00:05:17.099> a<00:05:17.129> makeshift

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
see I had to kind of do a makeshift

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.489 
see I had to kind of do a makeshift
stand<00:05:19.460> to<00:05:20.460> to<00:05:20.759> fill<00:05:21.479> me<00:05:21.629> a<00:05:21.659> platform<00:05:21.960> where<00:05:22.439> I

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:22.499 
stand to to fill me a platform where I

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:24.200 
stand to to fill me a platform where I
could<00:05:22.740> get<00:05:22.889> that<00:05:23.009> the<00:05:23.219> hive<00:05:23.430> approaching

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
could get that the hive approaching

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.040 
could get that the hive approaching
through<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.449> bees<00:05:24.919> if<00:05:25.919> I<00:05:26.099> didn't<00:05:26.400> then<00:05:26.639> I

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
through the bees if I didn't then I

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.809 
through the bees if I didn't then I
would<00:05:28.050> have<00:05:28.110> had<00:05:28.199> trouble

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
would have had trouble

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.950 
would have had trouble
the<00:05:30.210> bees<00:05:30.389> are<00:05:30.419> even<00:05:31.110> lighting<00:05:31.349> on<00:05:31.710> my<00:05:32.219> tripod

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960
