00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.720
 I want to try at least a leaf 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.320

 another round was called mann and me 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.010
 I have planned for the round here 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.950
 that I just have a leaf too 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:00.790
 paper will find 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:04.300
 and what's going on here has something 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.240
 I found leaf where is that loud 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.950
 with me I hardly hear all my 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.810
 Do not even agree that loud 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.890
 noises on my ears if now 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.210
 countries would arrive 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.950
 boa still three pages must be found 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.180
 become 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:25.210
 then lendermann is defeated here 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.820
 still somewhere a leaf paper be 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.610
 or 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.170
 or I do not know, I'm listening 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.420
 I walked close where I somehow 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.750
 Steps are my only here 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:47.770
 but more or no fire here 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:49.180
 a fire is something damn what 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.660
 I'm still doing a side now 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:56.110
 lacks the ladder luck that was 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.000
 exactly does not describe me what is that 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.350
 you have a lot of noise then someone is in the 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.940
 lava the segment the parliament liked 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.530
 put away we have to go the side 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.730
 Priority has lost the orientation 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:13.890
 where we have not been back for a long time 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.890
 killed because so 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:23.090
 my friends goose bumps pure good people 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.970
 These were three round countries one in 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.750
 minecraft yes the ip can be found in the 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.990
 description 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.100
 I hope that has fallen times 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.880
 here with me on the channel in one 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.880
 completely different direction 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.540
 yes I'm not really the horror 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.880
 game play would not have thought that 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.160
 that really gives me that goose bump 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.570
 but you can miss it 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.600
 maybe done with the 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.280
 conditions like I'm currently playing with 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.810
 All together well if you guys 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:57.130
 Just like me, I totally liked it 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:58.520
 harmless after triggered by sender yes 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.130
 was enlarged 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.990
 Let me have a thumbs up there if 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.330
 I leave it pure skin I wish 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.260
 Have a nice day and me 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.260
