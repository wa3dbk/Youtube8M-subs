floor<00:02:06.690> of<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.870> room<00:02:07.290> when<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.800> get<00:02:07.979> in

floor of that room when you get in
around<00:02:09.840> here<00:02:10.289> all<00:02:11.160> right

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459

around here all right
this<00:02:11.820> is<00:02:11.970> where<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.690> start<00:02:13.020> off<00:02:13.200> on

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
this is where I like to start off on

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.060 
this is where I like to start off on
black<00:02:13.590> ops<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.250> black<00:02:14.430> ops<00:02:14.610> I'd<00:02:15.770> come<00:02:16.770> up<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
black ops the black ops I'd come up the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.710 
black ops the black ops I'd come up the
right<00:02:17.640> side<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.390> go<00:02:18.900> down<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.410> bridge

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
right side and go down to this bridge

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.940 
right side and go down to this bridge
but<00:02:21.720> not<00:02:21.900> cross<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.410> don't<00:02:22.590> want<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.770> cross

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
but not cross it I don't want to cross

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.410 
but not cross it I don't want to cross
that<00:02:23.100> bridge<00:02:23.220> because<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.550> run<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.030> risk<00:02:24.240> of

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
that bridge because I run the risk of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.630 
that bridge because I run the risk of
being<00:02:25.290> hit<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.680> there's<00:02:25.860> very<00:02:26.130> little<00:02:26.310> cover

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
being hit and there's very little cover

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.460 
being hit and there's very little cover
out<00:02:27.030> on<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.300> bridge<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.080> always<00:02:28.170> want<00:02:28.440> to

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
out on that bridge so I always want to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.470 
out on that bridge so I always want to
go<00:02:28.590> into<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.950> building<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.489> come<00:02:30.150> behind

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
go into the building and come behind

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.610 
go into the building and come behind
these<00:02:30.600> barrels<00:02:30.870> because<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.290> barrels<00:02:31.560> are

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
these barrels because the barrels are

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.100 
these barrels because the barrels are
indestructible<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:33.390> when<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.660> come<00:02:33.810> up<00:02:33.840> this

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
indestructible so when you come up this

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.720 
indestructible so when you come up this
side<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.620> always<00:02:34.980> let<00:02:35.100> me<00:02:35.160> behind<00:02:35.520> cover

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
side you always let me behind cover

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.790 
side you always let me behind cover
because<00:02:36.540> all<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> cover<00:02:37.020> on<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.470> you

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
because all the cover on this is you

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.710 
because all the cover on this is you
can't<00:02:38.040> fire<00:02:38.340> through<00:02:38.610> not<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.300> thin

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
can't fire through not like the thin

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.180 
be hiding from cover to cover as you
push<00:02:51.390> up<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.630> map<00:02:51.810> try<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.500> get<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.860> spawn

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
push up the map try to get to that spawn

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.010 
push up the map try to get to that spawn
there<00:02:53.730> are<00:02:53.790> two<00:02:53.940> main<00:02:54.120> spawns<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.660> this<00:02:54.810> map

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
there are two main spawns in this map

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.500 
there are two main spawns in this map
which<00:02:55.320> is<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.530> where<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.580> showed<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.239> sky

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
which is a where I showed you in the sky

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.220 
which is a where I showed you in the sky
view<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:58.640> if<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.820> push<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.299> view<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.049> most

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
view and if you push to view the most

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.720 
view and if you push to view the most
your<00:03:01.500> team<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.739> on<00:03:01.860> one<00:03:02.040> side<00:03:02.070> they<00:03:02.489> will<00:03:02.640> be

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
your team is on one side they will be

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.830 
your team is on one side they will be
spawning<00:03:02.940> on<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.209> other<00:03:03.330> side<00:03:03.510> it's<00:03:03.660> called<00:03:03.750> a

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
spawning on the other side it's called a

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.979 
spawning on the other side it's called a
spawn<00:03:04.080> flip<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.540> clip<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.930> what

check<00:03:48.409> behind<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:48.799> just<00:03:49.040> in<00:03:49.159> case<00:03:49.219> they've

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
check behind you just in case they've

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:50.709

already<00:03:49.760> been<00:03:49.909> a<00:03:49.969> spawn<00:03:50.150> flip<00:03:50.389> because<00:03:50.599> I've

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:50.719 
already been a spawn flip because I've

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:52.899 
already been a spawn flip because I've
had<00:03:50.900> matches<00:03:51.290> where<00:03:51.439> we<00:03:51.980> spawn<00:03:52.249> the<00:03:52.760> team

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
had matches where we spawn the team

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.479 
had matches where we spawn the team
within<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.299> neck<00:03:53.480> first<00:03:53.719> 20<00:03:53.989> seconds<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:54.499> this

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
within the neck first 20 seconds so this

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.339 
within the neck first 20 seconds so this
is<00:03:55.639> where<00:03:55.849> you<00:03:56.329> want<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.569> hide<00:03:56.719> behind<00:03:57.139> this

you can't actually get into the war and

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.429 
you can't actually get into the war and

by climbing up those uh those modules

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:21.110 
by climbing up those uh those modules
and<00:05:19.949> I'll<00:05:20.039> probably<00:05:20.219> do<00:05:20.430> another<00:05:20.580> video<00:05:20.939> on

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
and I'll probably do another video on

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.540 
and I'll probably do another video on
that<00:05:21.499> here's<00:05:22.499> some<00:05:22.590> effective<00:05:23.039> kill<00:05:23.279> streaks

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550

that here's some effective kill streaks
I<00:05:23.759> wouldn't<00:05:24.360> use<00:05:24.629> the<00:05:24.840> gunship<00:05:25.139> on<00:05:25.430> Summit

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
I wouldn't use the gunship on Summit

I wouldn't use the gunship on Summit
pretty<00:05:26.939> much<00:05:27.090> because<00:05:27.449> everyone<00:05:28.020> is<00:05:28.169> in<00:05:28.439> the

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
pretty much because everyone is in the
