00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.290
 I am all who lived in the USA I have such a question 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.210
 sets 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.639
 Mikhail Zadornov it launched and 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.460
 continue to push that not stupid 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.300
 is it really or partially not 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.080
 so or is it not at all and what 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.779
 the difference between us and them first yourself 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.880
 Americans say Russians are smart they are like 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.250
 would be good with the investment 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.619
 speak over there Sirozha Serge 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.079
 talked to a local cop when 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.920
 I learned that the Russian Seryozh you say yes 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.550
 Russians are smart here I have a son there or there 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.430
 my daughter went to a Russian school but in Africa 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.329
 up in america there in our city there 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.340
 Russian school 1 mathematical in my opinion 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.770
 so he says he seems to be in 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.250
 normal school he studied very well there 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.930
 came on do not pull and that's all 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.050
 bitter and how many with the Russians spoke 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.430
 smart we kind of hear it 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.369
 often we have heard here when they 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.920
 respects there is no way 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.869
 there that they do not like us at all ever 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.469
 on this they did not meet well to all 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.009
 there are a lot of migrants from Nastya 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:19.649
 so they are somehow respectful to everyone and 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.139
 besides, I wonder if you are allowed on 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.469
 box office start with you cashier 

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:27.299
 talk and ask where are you from 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.819
 say where they start right away 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.090
 look but my grandmother was there from 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:37.729
 Russia here somehow they try to find 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:42.569
 Relatives about the stupid was with us 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.299
 the incident is such that at the end of October to 31 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:48.020
 October 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:51.390
 it is a snowfall in Russia 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.020
 he is presented there a number of cataclysms 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.590
 Russian news means being presented in 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.200
 America there so everything everything fell all 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.539
 bad there are people without faith without all a 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.899
 often as if mom calls me 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.459
 Natasha here they will be told everything you have 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.670
 bad all you have is a terrible enemy 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.500
 typhoon all that sort of it somewhere 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.739
 the sky is fine everything is fine well then 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.799
 There are often Russian drying but embellished 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.099
 then it really happened 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.560
 what a night it snowed 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:30.060
 a lot of snow fell trees 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.430
 consisted in foliage and here it is in general 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.860
 the trees became heavy a lot where they 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.299
 fell under the weight of snow and in the morning we 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.510
 when such snowdrifts came out were high and 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:44.100
 then there are many power lines 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.350
 torn there was no electricity about 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.109
 there was no electricity for a week 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.269
 from our apartment complex 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.190
 almost everything is well a lot of people 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:58.200
 skis friends acquaintances others in 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:01.109
 hotel why because the heating on 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.650
 electricity is largely de by the way there 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.669
 often either gas is recessed or 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.280
 electricity either oil 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:10.200
 that's where we lived heating was 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.049
 electric and then it was just 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:18.239
 cold but there was a gas before it braided 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.430
 Russian drowned in the wrong and you look 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.780
 gas turns on the stove and everything is fine 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:31.290
 when the husband is there at work said and we are there 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:34.799
 not going anywhere we be strong and gas 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:38.069
 he was asked yes and you know how 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.099
 turn on the gas stove without electricity 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.200
 not just on such a button 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.690
 electricity work and here they are just 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.790
 So 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.590
 heal them no way here's the problem 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.070
 had them not find matches 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.290
 they have cigarettes sold and that's where 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.010
 cigarettes there we often give matches 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.650
 such are thin some paper 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.160
 Well, as if not really with cigarettes 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:07.900
 I communicate therefore I do not know how there but here 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.500
 matches I could not find the evil there anywhere 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.200
 Russia 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.720
 and here we are healed matches and here it is they 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.230
 so here it is so serious and you know how 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.359
 ignite 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.880
 that is, they don't know for them and 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.870
 so many people left for him lighters 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.410
 there is here by the way lighters also not 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.220
 especially the fact that they have cigarettes 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.960
 sold in selected stores either in 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.120
 individual departments in the store and and 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:41.380
 Lighters, too, because I have 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.920
 I shop when I'm not looking for lit 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.250
 found 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.160
 can usually there is where I sell cigarettes 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.590
 they can eat and it surprised us. 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.919
 so it is possible not to think so 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.850
 just set fire to gas with something we will not live 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:01.180
 up to like and take and go just somewhere 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.290
 easier to settle than here at home 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.580
 bask gases 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:09.790
 the account is still clever but when I'm a slave I 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.340
 worked there for a short time 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.680
 bored was the house sitting settled too 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.980
 surgery husband worked on settled there 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.090
 such manual labor collected small 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:26.100
 boxes for lasers in general manual here 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:29.919
 Neat need to work with the device 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.990
 which well how is the device specifically he 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:35.020
 connected to the computer there are some 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.240
 sensors what is this when i came on 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.169
 work but it is not an indicator scary 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:45.910
 Americans but it's all sorts of Chinese 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:49.510
 South Americans I worked 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:52.449
 three months and here is the guide there is Russian 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:59.660
 they said that the Russians were there 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:06:02.900
 appreciate for quick wits and when i 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.510
 worked here these girls there 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.600
 often sit in the workplace here they are 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.630
 Could there 2 year 3 year they sit 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.880
 much less able than me after 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.560
 three months i mean i have some 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:22.580
 I wondered, I tried everything. 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.919
 dig in how it works but in the end 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.410
 in three months much more skillfully than 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.870
 those who have been sitting for several years and and 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.600
 my boss told me that they were 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.120
 do not even try to understand that they were told 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.090
 Here is suitable if you have such a problem 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.580
 arises call here the main thing is she to you 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.710
 fix comes the main thing under turns 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.870
 fix there easy fix i like 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.949
 I realized what's the matter I do not own it all 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:52.490
 twisted yet nobody called them not 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:56.810
 they are not sitting here, they will even call 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:07:00.260
 no desire but we do not know this 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:03.530
 not Americans then Americans including 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.389
 America is generally a solid continuous run 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.780
 that 's why you can hold 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:11.180
 Americans they live there for many years 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:15.669
 it works already here therefore Russians in general 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.669
 I love the sea gathered for
