00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hi all, so 2 series of video 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.319
 battery tool paradise by and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.660
 now i will tell 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:17.460
 battery on the Bulgarian here is such a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.500
 Bulgarian there is a security button 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.640
 which does not allow to press the switch 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.640
 didn't go out to this button 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:35.370
 Bulgarians calculated under the 115 circle there 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.760
 quick adjustment of casing position with 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.230
 such clamps 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.559
 side grip which is provided 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.280
 in three positions and serves as a cover for 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.969
 key 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.090
 but for such a small grinder such 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.260
 huge grip immediately wants her 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.050
 saw off a little basically i use 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.760
 with a grinding cup to work on 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.090
 tree to chamfer 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.090
 something like this 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:23.150
 she takes quite aggressive and now I 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:28.619
 I'll show you how she cuts iron here with me 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.080
 iron band 4 millimeter by 40 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.520
 width 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:39.210
 since I have 115 laps then I 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:45.899
 took a hundred and 125 and he's pretty fat 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:49.050
 it is 2 millimeters thick therefore 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:56.119
 load the Bulgarians, he will be pretty 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:56.119
 Okay, so I'm starting to cut the plate 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.900
 here is of course cut such a tool not 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.510
 can compete with the network tool 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:47.380
 but work where there is no network 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:47.380
 let's say cut some kind of bar 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.780
 and it is possible and now I want 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.959
 check 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:01.690
 residual battery capacity i am not 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:06.410
 charged it after working as a saw 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:10.850
 that is, on this charge, I cut polished 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:15.489
 grinder chamfer and cut metal here 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.670
 left half the tank 2 divisions and 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.910
 last thing 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.320
 i want to say this tool even though he 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.070
 and does not belong to the class 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.940
 professional but made it pretty 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:33.100
 soundly and at its price let's say for 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.900
 set of two batteries grinders 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.300
 saw and charger i paid 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.489
 just over 300 dollars at its price 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.489
 this is a very good tool 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.050
 Well, that's probably all thanks to all 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.160
 sign up for attention and 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.160
 all up to the next video
