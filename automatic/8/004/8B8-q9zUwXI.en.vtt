reason why I do that on my second

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.249 
reason why I do that on my second
channel<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.030> put<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.299> lot<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.750> effort

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
channel is because I put a lot of effort

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.440 
channel is because I put a lot of effort
in<00:01:16.409> my<00:01:17.100> second<00:01:17.400> channel<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.240> is

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
in my second channel because it is

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.830 
in my second channel because it is
Danish<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.920> more<00:01:20.580> easily<00:01:20.850> make<00:01:21.450> videos

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
Danish and I can more easily make videos

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.230 
Danish and I can more easily make videos
on<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.200> channel<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.729> channel<00:01:24.000> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
on that channel and on this channel it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.450 
on that channel and on this channel it
takes<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.720> bit<00:01:24.990> longer<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.979> make<00:01:26.009> videos

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
takes a bit longer to make videos

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.550 
takes a bit longer to make videos
because<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.570> make<00:01:27.720> goals<00:01:27.990> compilation

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
because I have to make goals compilation

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.300 
because I have to make goals compilation
and<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.720> say<00:01:33.960> coulis<00:01:34.530> while<00:01:34.829> most<00:01:35.100> of

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
and you can say coulis while most of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.980 
and you can say coulis while most of
videos<00:01:36.740> where<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.820> almost<00:01:38.820> school<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.869> high

school<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.380> FIFA<00:01:40.860> 13<00:01:41.119> so<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.390> takes<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.899> little

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
school in FIFA 13 so it takes a little

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.740 
school in FIFA 13 so it takes a little
bit<00:01:43.350> time<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.070> my<00:01:44.640> english<00:01:45.030> isn't<00:01:45.329> bad<00:01:45.780> will<00:01:47.750> -
