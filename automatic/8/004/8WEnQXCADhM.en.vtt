what's going on guys I was on Twitter

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.510 
what's going on guys I was on Twitter
earlier<00:00:03.090> and<00:00:03.659> I<00:00:03.720> saw<00:00:03.959> JT<00:00:04.319> 2020<00:00:05.040> was<00:00:05.160> answering

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
earlier and I saw JT 2020 was answering

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.130 
earlier and I saw JT 2020 was answering
questions<00:00:05.850> about<00:00:05.910> black<00:00:06.240> ops<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.839> someone

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
questions about black ops and someone

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.690 
questions about black ops and someone
asked<00:00:07.470> him<00:00:07.529> will<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:07.830> still<00:00:08.160> be<00:00:08.220> able<00:00:08.340> to

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
asked him will I still be able to

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.480 
asked him will I still be able to
quickscope<00:00:09.120> he<00:00:09.840> said<00:00:10.110> no<00:00:10.500> quickscoping<00:00:11.309> as<00:00:11.460> a

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
quickscope he said no quickscoping as a

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.580 
quickscope he said no quickscoping as a
cheap<00:00:11.790> way<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.000> play<00:00:12.330> we're<00:00:12.960> specifically

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
cheap way to play we're specifically

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.010 
cheap way to play we're specifically
going<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.160> GIMP<00:00:14.400> quickscoping<00:00:15.120> sorry<00:00:15.570> plays

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
going to GIMP quickscoping sorry plays

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.370 
going to GIMP quickscoping sorry plays
straight<00:00:16.350> up<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:17.240> I<00:00:18.240> felt<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.869> logic<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
straight up and I felt the logic and

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.810 
straight up and I felt the logic and
this<00:00:19.470> was<00:00:19.619> completely<00:00:19.740> wrong<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.490> decided

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
this was completely wrong so I decided

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.390 
this was completely wrong so I decided
to<00:00:20.910> address<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.630> video<00:00:22.160> my<00:00:23.160> first

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
to address it in this video my first

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.670 
to address it in this video my first
question<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.820> JT<00:00:24.090> 2020<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.720> how<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.410> cheap

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
question to JT 2020 is how is it cheap

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.429 
question to JT 2020 is how is it cheap
I'm<00:00:26.580> assuming<00:00:27.150> JT<00:00:27.330> 2020<00:00:27.930> thinks<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.289> quick

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
I'm assuming JT 2020 thinks that quick

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.019 
I'm assuming JT 2020 thinks that quick
scoping<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.859> cheap<00:00:29.130> because<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> power<00:00:29.880> of

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
scoping is cheap because of the power of

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.730 
scoping is cheap because of the power of
the<00:00:30.150> sniper<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.840> kill<00:00:31.019> someone<00:00:31.439> with<00:00:31.590> one

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the sniper to kill someone with one

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.880 
the sniper to kill someone with one
bullet<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.610> quickly<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:34.050> explosives<00:00:34.500> can

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
bullet so quickly but explosives can

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.709 
bullet so quickly but explosives can
kill<00:00:35.100> someone<00:00:35.309> or<00:00:35.700> even<00:00:36.090> multiple<00:00:36.420> people

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
kill someone or even multiple people

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.020 
kill someone or even multiple people
just<00:00:37.079> as<00:00:37.200> quickly<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> sniper<00:00:37.950> except<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
just as quickly as a sniper except a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.540 
just as quickly as a sniper except a
sniper<00:00:39.300> sniper<00:00:39.660> actually<00:00:40.410> requires<00:00:40.829> aim<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
sniper sniper actually requires aim and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.639 
sniper sniper actually requires aim and
requires<00:00:42.329> way<00:00:42.540> more<00:00:42.780> aim<00:00:42.899> than<00:00:43.110> an<00:00:43.170> explosive

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
requires way more aim than an explosive

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.700 
requires way more aim than an explosive
to<00:00:43.800> use<00:00:44.600> quick<00:00:45.600> scoping<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.020> less<00:00:46.200> cheap<00:00:46.559> than

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
to use quick scoping is less cheap than

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.220 
to use quick scoping is less cheap than
explosives<00:00:47.450> because<00:00:48.450> explosives<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
explosives because explosives have a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.959 
explosives because explosives have a
large<00:00:49.469> blast<00:00:49.770> radius<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.579> even<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.850> used

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
large blast radius and can even be used

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.000 
large blast radius and can even be used
to<00:00:51.239> kill<00:00:51.390> multiple<00:00:51.840> enemies<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.680> even

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
to kill multiple enemies and even

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.319 
to kill multiple enemies and even
enemies<00:00:53.250> around<00:00:53.640> corners<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.300> sniper<00:00:55.140> rifle

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
enemies around corners a sniper rifle

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.119 
enemies around corners a sniper rifle
usually<00:00:57.329> requires<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.260> direct<00:00:58.710> line<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.949> sight

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
usually requires a direct line of sight

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.130 
usually requires a direct line of sight
to<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.850> target<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> crosshairs<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:01.050> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
to the target and the crosshairs have to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.110 
to the target and the crosshairs have to
be<00:01:01.260> perfectly<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.129> target<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> kill<00:01:02.879> them

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
be perfectly on that target to kill them

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
be perfectly on that target to kill them
which<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.449> even<00:01:03.719> more<00:01:03.899> difficult<00:01:04.110> when<00:01:04.470> you

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
which is even more difficult when you

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.810 
which is even more difficult when you
factor<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.460> stuff<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:05.790> lag<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:07.460> my<00:01:08.460> second

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
factor in stuff like lag and my second

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
factor in stuff like lag and my second
point<00:01:08.939> well<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.510> first<00:01:09.689> point<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.140> pretty

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
point well the first point was pretty

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.219 
point well the first point was pretty
much<00:01:10.650> summed<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.630> explosives<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:12.840> way

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
much summed up is explosives are way

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.840 
much summed up is explosives are way
cheaper<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.340> want<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> put<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.729> way

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
cheaper if you want to put it that way

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.899 
cheaper if you want to put it that way
then<00:01:15.509> snipers<00:01:16.280> especially<00:01:17.280> quickscoping

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
then snipers especially quickscoping

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.230 
then snipers especially quickscoping
which<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.210> harder<00:01:18.540> than<00:01:18.900> actual<00:01:19.430> sniping<00:01:20.430> but

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
which is harder than actual sniping but

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.260 
which is harder than actual sniping but
our<00:01:21.360> second<00:01:22.229> my<00:01:22.710> second<00:01:23.070> topic<00:01:23.250> was<00:01:23.610> asking<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
our second my second topic was asking a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.820 
our second my second topic was asking a
person<00:01:24.420> who<00:01:24.689> loves<00:01:24.900> quickscoping<00:01:25.560> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
person who loves quickscoping and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.410 
person who loves quickscoping and
whether<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.369> easier<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:26.880> harder<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.299> get

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
whether it's easier or harder to get

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.050 
whether it's easier or harder to get
kills<00:01:27.689> or<00:01:27.960> even<00:01:28.170> win<00:01:28.350> games<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.920> every<00:01:29.850> single

kills or even win games and every single

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.760 
kills or even win games and every single
one<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.390> them<00:01:30.630> will<00:01:30.780> tell<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.200> they

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
one of them will tell you that they

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.319 
one of them will tell you that they
could<00:01:31.920> perform<00:01:32.280> better<00:01:32.460> using<00:01:32.790> an<00:01:32.880> automatic

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
could perform better using an automatic

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.749 
could perform better using an automatic
weapon<00:01:33.860> quickscoping<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.579> itself
