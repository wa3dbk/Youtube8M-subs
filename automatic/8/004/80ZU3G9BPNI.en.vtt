00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello everyone saw today you 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.710
 learn to change the room is from 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.389
 your that to change your outfit or 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.950
 fix something else dream with 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.210
 patches 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.570
 so first of all you have to start with 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.520
 to remove the road it seems obvious 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.410
 must first loose the brake as 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.490
 that's it we remove the frames the ends 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.400
 from his book then some tasks 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.869
 the king kz2 laugh two front wheels and one 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.260
 removes mud as if once this 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.360
 that we must remove the tire me is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.910
 already done for a time saving and then 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.680
 with a dea on tires or if you get there 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.320
 I recommend to you without worlds 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.770
 pleases because misused one can 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.800
 pinch 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:57.050
 the inner tube a good tire changer 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:57.050
 so we take their tires up and that's it 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.600
 always started well when we take off 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:09.900
 when we go back first to the ex 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.950
 at the other end of the good here is me 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.869
 tell me now 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.330
 the air chamber here is the room r 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.939
 so I'll teach you now to m 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.939
 a patch my patch like like 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.180
 this one so first of all what it 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.299
 must do is take a scraper and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.310
 scratch from the area where there is a hole 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.939
 important is why the glue 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.630
 hold better 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.070
 then apply the glue and tomorrow 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.259
 advice is to wait one or two 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.229
 minutes history that Russia does not hold 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.540
 moved afterwards once expected two 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.140
 minutes after the glue after we 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.670
 have applied the glue we will put our 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.399
 patch on and we go there the tight one 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.369
 can also use a server or 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.180
 something like that once it's done 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.560
 we can go back up our group so we go 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:11.360
 put his brother back in 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.459
 we do not find so that's important 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.340
 also it is to check the few signs 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.290
 not a thorn is annoying to burst 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:25.190
 several times in a row like that 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:28.970
 happened to me so we put in the downstream 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.569
 like this again it takes 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.780
 start at the end and the ball is 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.709
 well important I really advise of 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:43.010
 to put the wheel back without dismounting 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:48.560
 tire it will avoid two pinches the 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.900
 inner tube this is the hardest is 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.599
 someone who are new so once that 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:02.090
 can we put our wheel on our 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:03.500
 first lots so also we can in 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.750
 what sense eur m or it is a matter 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.330
 that people are asking then it takes the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.579
 put in the sense that is written on the 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.709
 tire if there is no sense to refer 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.690
 to the faithful who on the grounds of the arrows who 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.859
 are on the known here they are towards 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:26.870
 the front I loved them forward a 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:31.910
 concert below the acce here and we 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:35.209
 put the brakes on we're done 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.269
 than to ride the bike and our group 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.690
 will be strong hoping that this video 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:45.430
 you pleased I find you one senses 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.430
 not for a next octo has more
