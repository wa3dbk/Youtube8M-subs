00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.850
 frank from android next on the 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.520
 2014 what I hold here in my hands 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.750
 currently the thinnest smartphone in the world 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:32.620
 that johnny live it's 5.5 that's the way it is 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.960
 because that's only 5.5 millimeters deep and 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.850
 that is really extremely slim you can 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.550
 Here I can see for comparison 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.530
 my galaxy note 3 next to it 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.210
 there you see that is really crazy 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.250
 thin and not only that, too 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.350
 processed extremely chic so we have 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.390
 yes at the front and something edgy 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.220
 design but slightly rounded 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.550
 its a little bit to the 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.550
 sony ericsson smartphone from 2011 and 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.600
 Just go around completely the device 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.910
 So we have the front camera 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.350
 Light sensor down here are capacitive 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.360
 buttons are not 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.460
 Lit that means you have to quasi 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.590
 blindly press this a bit 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.259
 whole works but after one 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.149
 short acclimatization time just fine and 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.080
 is actually an interesting one too 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.080
 design feature 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.950
 power button volume rocker is here 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.680
 on the right side we have the 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:32.940
 the sim slot down here is the one of 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.780
 headphone output and another microphone 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.600
 we do not have anything else upstairs now 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.970
 also micro usb slot yes inner values 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.470
 here is a mediatek upbeat in it 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.000
 with 1 7 gigahertz 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.310
 we were a bit 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.530
 that's not really surprising everywhere 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.300
 So runs smoothly now wobbles here 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.270
 Not at the moment, but there are situations there 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.460
 had and very little berappelt 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.470
 yes, but that may be 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.330
 a thing that is still optimized by 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.360
 johnny what you can do is one 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.470
 Android 4.2 but in one 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.350
 requested version 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.220
 That 's the operating system called itself 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.290
 at johnny amigo it's a bit bizarre 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.060
 designation looks very good overall 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.690
 Send out so we have two here 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:21.580
 icons very much at ios 7 on the iphone 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:25.090
 remember and also the fonts here 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.209
 and the art as the menu for the like 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.459
 Settings menu is animated 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.600
 everything reminds me of ios or one 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.709
 little at 18 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.840
 yes, that johnny live 5.5 comes 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.970
 of course in other color variants 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.519
 we'll show you some frames 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.240
 colors and here I have the 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.710
 black version hold well 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.320
 We do not have any here, though 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.550
 Google services is also preinstalled 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.320
 not yet known if the device is so 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.270
 will ever come out in europe 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.190
 safe to obtain via import dealer 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.560
 his is definitely very 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.700
 interesting device so I still have 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.020
 not at all said to the display 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.910
 sorry we have one here 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.980
 five inches in the diagonal measure of the 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.030
 full hd display that is the resolution 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.370
 is 1920 x 1080 two gigabytes of ram 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.890
 are built in 16 GB of internal memory 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.980
 can not be extended and that 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.450
 Of course, display is like a flat one 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.010
 Equipment is usually a super amoled 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.690
 display that on a very good 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.400
 impression is a bit dark 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.090
 but has very good views of the 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.910
 page 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.220
 yes and that is on the back 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.980
 we have his glass back 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.240
 that's a bit of a fingerprint 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.950
 vulnerable that is who does not 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.120
 should want to see fingerprints 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.390
 happy but the white version 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.010
 run because you do not see this as well 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.400
 and yes reminds as I said a bit 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.770
 sony that's that johnny leaves 5.5 that 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.630
 currently black smartphone in the world 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.740
