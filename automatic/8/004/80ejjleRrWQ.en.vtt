00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
Killer Instinct just so far but to add

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.559 
Killer Instinct just so far but to add
to<00:04:00.389> that<00:04:00.630> we<00:04:00.989> get<00:04:01.230> an<00:04:01.410> indie<00:04:01.769> game<00:04:02.420> again<00:04:03.420> I

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
to that we get an indie game again I

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:04.610 
to that we get an indie game again I
haven't<00:04:03.780> played<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.019> because<00:04:04.170> it's<00:04:04.319> just<00:04:04.440> an

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
haven't played it because it's just an

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.099 
haven't played it because it's just an
indie<00:04:04.829> game<00:04:04.859> but<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.489> think<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.209> look<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:06.959> this

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
indie game but I think the look of this

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.080 
indie game but I think the look of this
next<00:04:07.349> one<00:04:07.560> which<00:04:07.739> is<00:04:07.889> super<00:04:08.280> time<00:04:08.549> force<00:04:08.579> is

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
next one which is super time force is

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.860 
next one which is super time force is
very<00:04:09.720> very<00:04:10.139> very<00:04:10.500> cool<00:04:10.769> so<00:04:11.069> here<00:04:11.549> is<00:04:11.730> six<00:04:12.540> skins

very very very cool so here is six skins
from<00:04:13.139> super<00:04:13.470> time<00:04:13.650> force<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.190> just<00:04:14.849> look<00:04:14.970> at

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
from super time force and just look at

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.520 
from super time force and just look at
the<00:04:15.150> art<00:04:15.329> style<00:04:15.630> on<00:04:15.780> these<00:04:15.870> skins<00:04:16.229> they<00:04:16.380> look

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
the art style on these skins they look

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.740 
the art style on these skins they look
incredible<00:04:17.280> just<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.150> way<00:04:18.239> they're<00:04:18.450> all<00:04:18.539> cel

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
incredible just the way they're all cel

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.300 
incredible just the way they're all cel

I I'm definitely converted these skins
the<00:04:22.860> most<00:04:23.070> namely<00:04:23.849> the<00:04:23.970> Frog<00:04:24.270> on<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.510> right

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
the most namely the Frog on the right

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.439 
the most namely the Frog on the right
just<00:04:26.130> look<00:04:26.250> at<00:04:26.340> that<00:04:26.370> frog<00:04:26.669> is<00:04:26.729> a<00:04:26.880> very<00:04:27.240> cool

frog so these are super time foreskins
and<00:04:30.270> as<00:04:30.690> well<00:04:30.840> as<00:04:30.930> this<00:04:31.110> for<00:04:31.620> both<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.830> Dragon

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.760 
and as well as this for both the Dragon
Age<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.610> super<00:04:32.790> time<00:04:32.940> force<00:04:32.970> we<00:04:33.330> got

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
Age and the super time force we got

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.110 
Age and the super time force we got
extreme<00:04:34.770> shots<00:04:34.949> on<00:04:35.130> so<00:04:35.550> here's<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.910> one<00:04:36.000> we

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
extreme shots on so here's the one we

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.870 
extreme shots on so here's the one we
got<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.449> super<00:04:36.780> time<00:04:36.990> force<00:04:37.020> so<00:04:37.620> as<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.760> can

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
got the super time force so as you can

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.390 
got the super time force so as you can
see<00:04:39.120> it's<00:04:40.020> just<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.680> four<00:04:40.830> characters

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
see it's just the four characters

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.670 
see it's just the four characters
jumping<00:04:41.850> around<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.270> blocks<00:04:42.540> you<00:04:43.290> can<00:04:43.410> really

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
jumping around and blocks you can really

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.170 
jumping around and blocks you can really
see<00:04:43.830> just<00:04:44.040> how<00:04:44.130> incredible<00:04:44.550> they<00:04:44.699> look<00:04:44.880> if<00:04:45.060> you

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
see just how incredible they look if you

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.370 
see just how incredible they look if you
get<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.479> right<00:04:45.660> kind<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:45.930> perspective<00:04:46.290> can

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
get the right kind of perspective can

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.990 
get the right kind of perspective can
you<00:04:46.410> make<00:04:46.590> our<00:04:46.710> world<00:04:46.889> and<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.400> really<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.910> I

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
you make our world and it really I I

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.850 
you make our world and it really I I
think<00:04:48.690> they<00:04:48.810> did<00:04:49.050> go<00:04:49.199> really<00:04:49.320> well<00:04:49.500> with<00:04:49.710> some

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
think they did go really well with some

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.620 
think they did go really well with some
of<00:04:49.949> the<00:04:50.010> skin<00:04:50.190> Pat<00:04:50.370> some<00:04:50.760> detection<00:04:51.090> packs<00:04:51.270> and

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
of the skin Pat some detection packs and

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.590 
of the skin Pat some detection packs and
just<00:04:51.960> in<00:04:52.050> general<00:04:52.110> they<00:04:52.470> look<00:04:52.620> really<00:04:52.949> cool<00:04:53.100> so

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
just in general they look really cool so

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.820 
just in general they look really cool so
definitely<00:04:54.600> a<00:04:54.660> reason<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.050> buy<00:04:55.199> skin<00:04:55.440> pack<00:04:55.590> six

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
definitely a reason to buy skin pack six

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.950 
definitely a reason to buy skin pack six
maybe<00:04:56.010> even<00:04:56.130> by<00:04:56.340> itself<00:04:56.639> right<00:04:56.850> there<00:04:56.960> and

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
maybe even by itself right there and

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.510 
maybe even by itself right there and
that's<00:04:58.169> all<00:04:58.440> of<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.650> skins<00:04:58.889> we've<00:04:59.070> had<00:04:59.250> so<00:04:59.490> far

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
that's all of the skins we've had so far

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.000 
that's all of the skins we've had so far
and<00:04:59.940> I<00:05:00.389> think<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:00.870> that<00:05:01.199> adds<00:05:01.380> up<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:01.560> a<00:05:01.770> whole

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
and I think that that adds up to a whole

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.219 
and I think that that adds up to a whole
bunch<00:05:02.039> of<00:05:02.430> skins<00:05:02.760> we've<00:05:03.030> got<00:05:03.210> I<00:05:03.389> think<00:05:03.449> 30<00:05:03.900> plus

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
bunch of skins we've got I think 30 plus

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.960 
bunch of skins we've got I think 30 plus
so<00:05:04.710> right<00:05:04.919> now<00:05:05.070> we're<00:05:05.250> missing<00:05:05.669> if<00:05:05.850> we

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
so right now we're missing if we

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.370 
so right now we're missing if we
obviously<00:05:06.150> any<00:05:06.479> we're<00:05:06.630> only<00:05:06.780> missing<00:05:06.960> like

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
obviously any we're only missing like

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.110 
obviously any we're only missing like
five<00:05:07.710> or<00:05:07.919> so<00:05:08.130> and<00:05:08.310> they're<00:05:08.610> pretty<00:05:08.699> just<00:05:08.970> more

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
five or so and they're pretty just more

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.400 
five or so and they're pretty just more
generic<00:05:09.479> minecraft<00:05:09.870> skins<00:05:10.080> like<00:05:10.199> more

villages more costumes maybe another

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.750 
villages more costumes maybe another

in 117 I'm gonna quickly come back to
this<00:05:16.590> one<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:17.310> think<00:05:17.970> horses<00:05:18.180> are<00:05:18.510> definitely

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199

almost definitely coming Intel out 17

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.300 
almost definitely coming Intel out 17
now<00:05:21.030> because<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:22.710> fact<00:05:22.889> that<00:05:22.919> they<00:05:23.070> hinted

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310

the weather and the fact that it's

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.969 
the weather and the fact that it's
pretty<00:05:25.020> almost<00:05:25.380> you<00:05:25.680> know<00:05:25.770> it's<00:05:25.889> almost

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
pretty almost you know it's almost

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.680 
pretty almost you know it's almost
guaranteed<00:05:26.250> and<00:05:26.789> they<00:05:26.940> kind<00:05:27.210> of<00:05:27.330> made<00:05:27.510> it<00:05:27.539> a

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
guaranteed and they kind of made it a

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.270 
guaranteed and they kind of made it a
hundred<00:05:27.810> percent<00:05:28.020> guarantee<00:05:28.530> I<00:05:28.740> think<00:05:29.220> the

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
hundred percent guarantee I think the

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.620 
hundred percent guarantee I think the
fact<00:05:29.460> that<00:05:29.520> they're<00:05:29.700> painting<00:05:30.060> your<00:05:30.180> horses

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
fact that they're painting your horses

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.080 
fact that they're painting your horses
this<00:05:30.960> early<00:05:31.289> on<00:05:31.410> I<00:05:31.860> don't<00:05:32.430> they<00:05:32.490> do<00:05:32.639> that<00:05:32.849> if<00:05:32.940> it

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
this early on I don't they do that if it

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.370 
this early on I don't they do that if it
wasn't<00:05:33.240> coming<00:05:33.630> out<00:05:33.720> in<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:33.960> next<00:05:34.200> update
