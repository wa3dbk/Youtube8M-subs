alright so we got ourselves a nice
little<00:01:49.340> boil<00:01:49.670> going<00:01:49.789> here<00:01:50.179> it's<00:01:50.329> just

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
little boil going here it's just

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.289 
little boil going here it's just
starting<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.350> boil<00:01:51.590> actually<00:01:52.159> it<00:01:52.939> would<00:01:53.060> be<00:01:53.179> at

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
starting to boil actually it would be at

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:54.969 
starting to boil actually it would be at
this<00:01:53.450> point<00:01:53.719> that<00:01:53.869> I<00:01:53.990> would<00:01:54.140> suggest<00:01:54.409> if<00:01:54.859> you

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:12.270 
this for about ten minutes only and then
I'm<00:02:03.049> going<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.200> take<00:02:03.380> it<00:02:03.439> off<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.770> heat

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.369 

ok<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:13.340> I've<00:02:13.640> got<00:02:13.849> this<00:02:14.060> thing<00:02:14.390> set<00:02:14.720> there's<00:02:15.260> a

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
ok so I've got this thing set there's a

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.649 
ok so I've got this thing set there's a
piece<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.250> cloth<00:02:16.580> stuffed<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.360> drain

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
piece of cloth stuffed in the drain

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.440 
piece of cloth stuffed in the drain
underneath<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.440> pot<00:02:18.830> here<00:02:19.120> that's<00:02:20.120> cold

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
underneath the pot here that's cold

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.720 
underneath the pot here that's cold
water<00:02:20.750> running<00:02:21.230> around<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:21.920> give<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.459> stir

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
water running around it I give it a stir

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.149 
water running around it I give it a stir
just<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.090> keep<00:02:23.269> it<00:02:23.390> circulated<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.920> cold

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
just to keep it circulated the cold

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.399 
just to keep it circulated the cold
water<00:02:25.459> is<00:02:25.700> draining<00:02:25.970> equally<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.170> amount

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
water is draining equally to the amount

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.800 
water is draining equally to the amount
that<00:02:27.530> it's<00:02:27.769> going<00:02:28.129> in<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:29.329> this<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.510> keeping

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
that it's going in so this is keeping

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.050 
that it's going in so this is keeping
the<00:02:30.019> water<00:02:30.140> super<00:02:30.680> close<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:30.950> allowing<00:02:31.760> this

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
the water super close and allowing this

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.410 
the water super close and allowing this
work<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.959> chill<00:02:33.319> this<00:02:33.799> quick<00:02:34.099> response<00:02:34.519> there

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
work to chill this quick response there

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.140 
work to chill this quick response there
are<00:02:35.540> much<00:02:35.780> better<00:02:35.810> ways<00:02:36.849> including<00:02:37.849> a<00:02:37.940> work

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
are much better ways including a work

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.789 
are much better ways including a work
chiller<00:02:38.450> which<00:02:38.720> would<00:02:38.959> set<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.349> back<00:02:39.409> about

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
chiller which would set you back about

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:48.819 
chiller which would set you back about
65<00:02:40.519> bux<00:02:40.909> American<00:02:41.510> but<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.670> simple

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.039 

now<00:02:49.829> if<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:50.040> might<00:02:50.219> suggest<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:51.209> rehydrate

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
now if I might suggest you rehydrate

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.449 
now if I might suggest you rehydrate
your<00:02:52.200> yeast<00:02:52.439> you<00:02:52.709> give<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.040> little<00:02:53.189> boost

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
your yeast you give it a little boost

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.000 
your yeast you give it a little boost
I've<00:02:54.239> got<00:02:54.510> just<00:02:54.780> slightly<00:02:55.140> warm<00:02:55.500> water<00:02:55.769> in

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010

to<00:03:05.280> give<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.609> a<00:03:05.670> little<00:03:05.790> stir<00:03:10.010> just<00:03:11.010> enough<00:03:11.400> to

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
to give it a little stir just enough to

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.229 
to give it a little stir just enough to
get<00:03:11.879> it<00:03:12.060> all<00:03:12.209> in<00:03:12.420> there<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:14.670> I'm<00:03:14.879> going<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.060> put

minutes we'll take a look in the second
now<00:03:22.680> if<00:03:22.799> your<00:03:22.919> kit<00:03:23.099> came<00:03:23.340> with<00:03:23.370> anything<00:03:23.879> extra

acidity level it suggests you add that

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.479 
acidity level it suggests you add that
to<00:03:33.689> your<00:03:33.719> imitator<00:03:34.319> before<00:03:34.829> you<00:03:35.250> had<00:03:35.459> your

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.300 
still a little bit for me as you can see
the<00:04:27.870> thermometers<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.560> red<00:04:28.740> top<00:04:28.979> and<00:04:29.250> you

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
the thermometers the red top and you

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.760 
the thermometers the red top and you
can't<00:04:29.490> really<00:04:29.699> uh<00:04:29.909> you<00:04:30.900> can't<00:04:31.110> really<00:04:31.229> see<00:04:31.380> the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
can't really uh you can't really see the

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.129 
can't really uh you can't really see the
hydrometer<00:04:32.610> but<00:04:33.150> I'll<00:04:33.240> take<00:04:33.419> a<00:04:33.479> test<00:04:33.810> on<00:04:33.960> that

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
hydrometer but I'll take a test on that

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.430 
hydrometer but I'll take a test on that
here<00:04:34.409> and<00:04:35.060> I'll<00:04:36.060> let<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:36.240> know<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.990> here<00:04:37.259> is

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
here and I'll let you know and here is

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.409 
here and I'll let you know and here is
our<00:04:37.620> cup<00:04:38.250> of<00:04:38.280> yeast<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.849> can<00:04:38.970> see<00:04:39.120> how<00:04:39.270> it

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
our cup of yeast you can see how it

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.260 
our cup of yeast you can see how it
started<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.870> grow<00:04:40.190> it's<00:04:41.190> already<00:04:41.909> begun<00:04:42.030> its

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
started to grow it's already begun its

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.120 
started to grow it's already begun its
process<00:04:42.690> so<00:04:42.960> what<00:04:43.139> we<00:04:43.289> did<00:04:43.470> by<00:04:43.770> adding<00:04:44.099> the

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
process so what we did by adding the

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.430 
process so what we did by adding the
warm<00:04:44.370> water<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.699> sugar<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.300> giving<00:04:46.080> it<00:04:46.169> 20

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
warm water and sugar and giving it 20

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.320 
warm water and sugar and giving it 20
minutes<00:04:46.710> is<00:04:46.830> just<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:47.220> slight<00:04:47.639> head<00:04:47.909> start

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
minutes is just a slight head start

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.089 
minutes is just a slight head start
before<00:04:48.479> you<00:04:48.750> pour<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.080> into<00:04:49.199> your<00:04:49.320> work<00:04:49.560> so

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
before you pour it into your work so

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.600 
before you pour it into your work so
into<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.490> word<00:04:50.699> we<00:04:51.060> go<00:04:51.289> basically<00:04:52.310> with<00:04:53.310> our

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
into the word we go basically with our

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.360 
into the word we go basically with our
cup<00:04:53.909> of<00:04:54.060> East

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.970 

dumping<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.460> all<00:04:59.580> in<00:04:59.820> basically<00:05:00.270> and<00:05:01.050> I'm<00:05:01.800> not

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
dumping it all in basically and I'm not

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.690 
dumping it all in basically and I'm not
overly<00:05:02.580> worried<00:05:03.650> but<00:05:04.650> I<00:05:04.710> am<00:05:04.950> going<00:05:05.280> to<00:05:05.490> just

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
overly worried but I am going to just

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.820 
overly worried but I am going to just
add<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:07.220> touch<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.250> water<00:05:09.500> get<00:05:10.500> that<00:05:10.680> other

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
add a touch of water get that other

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.460 
add a touch of water get that other
yeast<00:05:11.160> out<00:05:14.360> and<00:05:15.360> basically<00:05:15.660> that's<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:16.110> she's

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
yeast out and basically that's it she's

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.260 
yeast out and basically that's it she's
in<00:05:16.620> there<00:05:16.800> it's<00:05:17.220> going<00:05:17.400> to<00:05:17.460> start<00:05:17.730> going<00:05:17.940> nuts

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
in there it's going to start going nuts

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.620 
in there it's going to start going nuts
25<00:05:19.080> degrees<00:05:19.500> which<00:05:19.770> is<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:19.950> touch<00:05:20.310> warm<00:05:20.760> but<00:05:21.540> not

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
25 degrees which is a touch warm but not

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.320 
25 degrees which is a touch warm but not
too<00:05:21.690> bad<00:05:22.020> and<00:05:22.370> our<00:05:23.370> specific<00:05:23.880> gravity<00:05:24.240> at

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
too bad and our specific gravity at

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.680 
too bad and our specific gravity at
starting<00:05:24.720> was<00:05:24.890> 1.05<00:05:25.890> one<00:05:26.330> which<00:05:27.330> isn't<00:05:27.600> too

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
starting was 1.05 one which isn't too

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.820 
starting was 1.05 one which isn't too
bad<00:05:28.010> on<00:05:29.010> with<00:05:29.310> the<00:05:29.400> lid<00:05:30.350> make<00:05:31.350> sure<00:05:31.380> you<00:05:31.650> got<00:05:31.770> a

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
bad on with the lid make sure you got a

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.710 
bad on with the lid make sure you got a
good<00:05:31.920> lid<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.640> got<00:05:32.880> to<00:05:33.030> be<00:05:33.090> prepared<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.570> make

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
good lid and got to be prepared to make

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.380 
good lid and got to be prepared to make
sure<00:05:33.900> that<00:05:34.110> you<00:05:34.200> keep<00:05:34.380> your<00:05:34.820> permit<00:05:35.820> ater<00:05:36.030> your

sure that you keep your permit ater your

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.600 
sure that you keep your permit ater your
primary<00:05:36.750> fermentation<00:05:37.080> an<00:05:38.070> area<00:05:38.370> that<00:05:38.400> you

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
primary fermentation an area that you

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.070 
primary fermentation an area that you
don't<00:05:38.790> mind<00:05:38.970> getting<00:05:39.150> wet<00:05:39.330> because<00:05:39.630> there<00:05:39.960> is

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
don't mind getting wet because there is

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.630 
don't mind getting wet because there is
a<00:05:40.110> good<00:05:40.350> potential<00:05:40.680> more<00:05:41.010> with<00:05:41.160> wine<00:05:41.370> but

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
a good potential more with wine but

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.830 
a good potential more with wine but
there<00:05:41.790> is<00:05:41.880> a<00:05:41.910> good<00:05:42.120> potential<00:05:42.390> with<00:05:42.630> Peter

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
there is a good potential with Peter

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.470 
there is a good potential with Peter
that<00:05:43.560> it<00:05:43.650> will<00:05:43.770> overflow<00:05:44.240> because<00:05:45.240> it's<00:05:45.390> going

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
that it will overflow because it's going

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.640 
that it will overflow because it's going
to<00:05:45.540> be<00:05:45.660> going<00:05:45.780> nuts<00:05:45.990> there<00:05:46.230> will<00:05:46.410> check<00:05:46.620> on

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
to be going nuts there will check on

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:56.830 
to be going nuts there will check on
that<00:05:46.770> in<00:05:46.950> a<00:05:47.010> bit

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:07.920 

you

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.749 

okay<00:06:08.560> so<00:06:08.620> we're<00:06:08.860> going<00:06:08.949> to<00:06:09.039> get<00:06:09.160> ready<00:06:09.370> to<00:06:09.550> take

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 
okay so we're going to get ready to take

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.529 
okay so we're going to get ready to take
from<00:06:09.970> the<00:06:10.620> fermentation<00:06:11.620> into<00:06:12.190> the<00:06:12.539> carboy

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539 
from the fermentation into the carboy

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.340 
from the fermentation into the carboy
and<00:06:15.000> what<00:06:16.000> I've<00:06:16.150> done<00:06:16.270> is<00:06:16.449> I've<00:06:16.570> elevated<00:06:17.169> this

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
and what I've done is I've elevated this

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.110 
and what I've done is I've elevated this
you<00:06:17.770> want<00:06:17.949> it<00:06:18.039> to<00:06:18.130> be<00:06:18.160> obviously<00:06:18.580> higher<00:06:18.850> than

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
you want it to be obviously higher than

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.969 
you want it to be obviously higher than
the<00:06:19.300> top<00:06:19.630> of<00:06:19.810> your<00:06:19.900> cardboard<00:06:20.229> so<00:06:20.620> that<00:06:20.770> your

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
the top of your cardboard so that your

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.279 
the top of your cardboard so that your
siphon<00:06:21.490> works<00:06:21.669> correctly<00:06:22.030> due<00:06:22.750> to<00:06:22.870> gravity

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
siphon works correctly due to gravity

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.810 
siphon works correctly due to gravity
and<00:06:23.789> we're<00:06:24.789> just<00:06:24.940> going<00:06:25.120> to<00:06:25.150> siphon<00:06:25.810> this<00:06:26.110> off

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
and we're just going to siphon this off

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.450 
and we're just going to siphon this off
using<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:28.410> siphon<00:06:29.410> pardon<00:06:30.009> this<00:06:30.130> we're<00:06:30.400> in

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
using the siphon pardon this we're in

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.219 
using the siphon pardon this we're in
the<00:06:30.550> bathroom<00:06:31.000> this<00:06:31.419> is<00:06:31.570> all<00:06:31.720> sterilized

that's what's hanging here it's nice to

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.219 
that's what's hanging here it's nice to
have<00:06:34.240> a<00:06:34.330> little<00:06:34.389> siphon<00:06:34.930> like<00:06:35.050> that

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
have a little siphon like that

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:36.779 
have a little siphon like that
especially<00:06:35.440> with<00:06:35.740> this<00:06:35.860> little<00:06:36.100> black<00:06:36.280> topper
