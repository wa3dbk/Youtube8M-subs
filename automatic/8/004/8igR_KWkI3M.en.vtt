00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
another video today i'm going to disable

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.810 
another video today i'm going to disable
with<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.990> diabolical<00:00:16.560> box<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:17.550> let's<00:00:17.699> get

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
with the diabolical box so let's get

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.810 
with the diabolical box so let's get
started<00:00:18.000> first<00:00:18.710> things<00:00:19.710> first<00:00:20.039> i<00:00:20.220> need<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.520> get

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
started first things first i need to get

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.810 
started first things first i need to get
on<00:00:20.970> top<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:23.090> get<00:00:24.090> my<00:00:24.439> diabolical<00:00:25.820> disabling

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
on top and get my diabolical disabling

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.320 
on top and get my diabolical disabling
skills<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> run<00:00:28.609> alright<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.090> first

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
skills on the run alright so first

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.609 
skills on the run alright so first
things<00:00:30.599> first<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.929> need<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:31.199> able<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.410> drop

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
things first we need to be able to drop

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.400 
things first we need to be able to drop
some<00:00:31.980> blocks<00:00:32.250> onto<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.700> thing<00:00:33.230> it's<00:00:34.230> going

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
some blocks onto this thing it's going

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.990 
some blocks onto this thing it's going
to<00:00:34.469> be<00:00:34.620> relatively<00:00:35.219> quick<00:00:35.370> after<00:00:35.670> we've<00:00:35.880> done

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
to be relatively quick after we've done

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.880 
to be relatively quick after we've done
that<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:39.270> let's<00:00:39.540> let's<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:42.710> also<00:00:43.710> we're

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that and so let's let's do it also we're

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.260 
that and so let's let's do it also we're
going<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.100> probably<00:00:44.250> make<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.520> platform

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
going to probably make this platform

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.569 
going to probably make this platform
that<00:00:45.600> i'm<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> make<00:00:46.070> out<00:00:47.070> make<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
that i'm going to make out make it in a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.490 
that i'm going to make out make it in a
minute<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.910> five<00:00:50.910> blocks<00:00:50.989> wide<00:00:51.989> which<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
minute to be five blocks wide which is

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.170 
minute to be five blocks wide which is
why<00:00:52.680> i've<00:00:52.800> i've<00:00:53.039> made<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.640> three<00:00:53.940> blocks

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
why i've i've made this three blocks

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.889 
why i've i've made this three blocks
long<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.750> top<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:59.370> two<00:00:59.640> three<00:01:00.120> four<00:01:00.420> five

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
long on top so one two three four five

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.890 
long on top so one two three four five
six

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.010 

123456<00:01:09.070> sorry<00:01:13.180> 123456<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:14.510> basically

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
123456 sorry 123456 so basically

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.110 
123456 sorry 123456 so basically
droppable<00:01:15.500> blocks<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:16.010> figured<00:01:16.310> out<00:01:16.430> with<00:01:16.760> the

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
droppable blocks I figured out with the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.230 
droppable blocks I figured out with the
Achilles<00:01:17.750> heel<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:18.050> this<00:01:18.350> design<00:01:18.710> because

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
Achilles heel of this design because

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.820 
Achilles heel of this design because
they<00:01:20.240> don't<00:01:20.480> send<00:01:20.960> out<00:01:21.110> a<00:01:23.110> block<00:01:24.110> update<00:01:24.470> when

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
they don't send out a block update when

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.260 
they don't send out a block update when
they're<00:01:25.040> when<00:01:25.280> they're<00:01:25.310> dropped<00:01:26.650> so

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
they're when they're dropped so

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.020 
they're when they're dropped so
essentially<00:01:29.680> we've<00:01:30.680> just<00:01:31.190> I'm<00:01:31.730> already

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
essentially we've just I'm already

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.100 
essentially we've just I'm already
figured<00:01:32.510> out<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.720> key<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:33.110> solving<00:01:33.320> this

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
figured out the key to solving this

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.980 
figured out the key to solving this
let's<00:01:36.110> just<00:01:36.200> hope<00:01:36.350> when<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.430> dig<00:01:37.640> down<00:01:37.850> I<00:01:38.150> don't

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
let's just hope when I dig down I don't

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.110 
let's just hope when I dig down I don't
dig<00:01:39.140> down<00:01:39.320> on<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:40.190> wrong<00:01:40.340> part<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.700> piston

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
dig down on the wrong part of the piston

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.730 
dig down on the wrong part of the piston
because<00:01:41.540> if<00:01:41.630> I<00:01:41.720> do<00:01:42.530> this<00:01:42.920> could<00:01:43.190> be<00:01:43.340> very<00:01:43.370> messy

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
because if I do this could be very messy

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.740 
because if I do this could be very messy
all<00:01:45.740> right<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.190> anyway<00:01:46.400> we've<00:01:46.940> got<00:01:47.120> our<00:01:47.240> little

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
all right so anyway we've got our little

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.540 
all right so anyway we've got our little
platform<00:01:48.050> I<00:01:48.410> can<00:01:48.740> now<00:01:48.830> walk<00:01:49.070> on<00:01:49.460> here<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:54.550> and

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
platform I can now walk on here and and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.210 
platform I can now walk on here and and
with<00:01:55.790> now<00:01:56.630> we're<00:01:56.810> pretty<00:01:56.960> much<00:01:57.050> sold<00:01:57.140> ok<00:01:57.920> so

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
with now we're pretty much sold ok so

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.650 
with now we're pretty much sold ok so
the<00:01:58.400> basics<00:01:58.790> of<00:01:58.940> it<00:01:59.030> are<00:01:59.260> we<00:02:00.260> do<00:02:00.440> this<00:02:01.300> and<00:02:02.300> then

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
the basics of it are we do this and then

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.410 
the basics of it are we do this and then
we<00:02:02.720> place<00:02:02.869> redstone<00:02:03.160> on<00:02:04.160> all<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.210> sand<00:02:07.420> being

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
we place redstone on all the sand being

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.020 
we place redstone on all the sand being
careful<00:02:08.750> not<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.899> put<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.140> on<00:02:09.230> the<00:02:09.350> Redstone

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
careful not to put it on the Redstone

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.470 
careful not to put it on the Redstone
externally<00:02:11.030> because<00:02:11.989> that<00:02:12.650> would<00:02:12.800> be<00:02:12.890> bad<00:02:13.480> and

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
externally because that would be bad and

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.720 
externally because that would be bad and
we<00:02:14.660> don't<00:02:14.780> need<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.200> right<00:02:15.260> now<00:02:15.670> now<00:02:16.670> the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
we don't need that right now now the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.920 
we don't need that right now now the
reason<00:02:16.910> I've<00:02:17.090> done<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.330> five<00:02:17.540> white<00:02:17.810> is

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
reason I've done it five white is

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.780 
reason I've done it five white is
because<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.440> tested<00:02:18.980> with<00:02:19.100> three<00:02:19.400> wide<00:02:19.610> and

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
because I tested with three wide and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.490 
because I tested with three wide and
that<00:02:19.880> doesn't<00:02:20.180> work<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:20.660> five<00:02:20.959> white<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.350> how

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
that doesn't work so five white is how

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.949 
that doesn't work so five white is how
it<00:02:21.620> has<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:21.800> happen<00:02:22.750> essentially<00:02:23.750> what<00:02:23.840> you're

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
it has to happen essentially what you're

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.460 
it has to happen essentially what you're
doing<00:02:24.200> here<00:02:24.380> is<00:02:24.410> we're<00:02:24.830> going<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:24.980> drill<00:02:25.310> into

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
doing here is we're going to drill into

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.750 
doing here is we're going to drill into
as<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.590> can<00:02:27.709> see<00:02:27.830> i'm<00:02:27.920> placing<00:02:28.100> straight<00:02:28.640> on

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
as you can see i'm placing straight on

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.349 
as you can see i'm placing straight on
the<00:02:28.820> red<00:02:28.970> stone

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.869 

and<00:02:33.359> we<00:02:34.260> should<00:02:34.469> almost<00:02:34.680> be<00:02:34.950> able<00:02:35.159> to<00:02:35.250> dig<00:02:35.489> into

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
and we should almost be able to dig into

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.229 
and we should almost be able to dig into
it<00:02:36.090> with<00:02:36.810> ages<00:02:37.379> to<00:02:37.530> go<00:02:37.700> spend<00:02:38.700> about<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:38.879> minute

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
it with ages to go spend about a minute

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.099 
it with ages to go spend about a minute
making<00:02:39.659> that<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:43.790> we'll<00:02:44.790> call<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.540> our

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
making that and we'll call this our

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.830 
making that and we'll call this our
drill<00:02:46.560> spot<00:02:47.329> counter<00:02:48.329> we<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.599> move<00:02:48.689> over

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
drill spot counter we have to move over

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.750 
drill spot counter we have to move over
one<00:02:51.620> all<00:02:52.620> right<00:02:52.739> drilling<00:02:53.219> has<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.579> recommence

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
one all right drilling has to recommence

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.069 
one all right drilling has to recommence
see<00:02:56.760> it's<00:02:56.879> a<00:02:56.939> trial<00:02:57.389> and<00:02:57.510> error<00:02:57.629> like<00:02:57.810> if<00:02:57.930> I've

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
see it's a trial and error like if I've

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.050 
see it's a trial and error like if I've
done<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.799> perfectly<00:02:59.189> if<00:02:59.519> I'd<00:02:59.670> land<00:02:59.879> it

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
done it perfectly if I'd land it

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.280 
done it perfectly if I'd land it
perfectly<00:03:00.090> would<00:03:00.569> have<00:03:00.659> been<00:03:00.750> fine<00:03:00.959> three

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
perfectly would have been fine three

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:10.789 
perfectly would have been fine three
four<00:03:02.359> five<00:03:03.829> six<00:03:05.359> seven<00:03:08.180> another<00:03:09.180> one<00:03:09.709> it's<00:03:10.709> not

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
four five six seven another one it's not

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.879 
four five six seven another one it's not
an<00:03:10.950> exact<00:03:11.459> science<00:03:11.549> but<00:03:12.200> it's<00:03:13.200> very<00:03:13.560> good<00:03:15.889> at

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
an exact science but it's very good at

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.250 
an exact science but it's very good at
getting<00:03:17.250> us<00:03:17.310> where<00:03:17.519> we<00:03:17.609> want<00:03:17.639> to<00:03:17.819> be<00:03:18.260> once

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
getting us where we want to be once

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.970 
getting us where we want to be once
again<00:03:19.439> we<00:03:19.650> start<00:03:19.919> at<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.069> very<00:03:20.099> beginning

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
again we start at the very beginning

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:30.280 
again we start at the very beginning
don't<00:03:22.980> argue<00:03:23.159> just<00:03:23.400> do<00:03:23.669> it<00:03:26.060> all<00:03:27.060> right<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:28.189> now

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
don't argue just do it all right and now

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.940 
don't argue just do it all right and now
we<00:03:31.290> drill<00:03:31.500> in<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.889> find<00:03:32.819> out<00:03:33.030> gun<00:03:33.950> so

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
we drill in and find out gun so

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.819 
we drill in and find out gun so
essentially<00:03:35.370> now<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.959> one<00:03:37.139> thing<00:03:37.319> this<00:03:37.620> is

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
essentially now the one thing this is

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.270 
essentially now the one thing this is
what<00:03:37.979> triggers<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:38.549> right<00:03:39.139> here<00:03:40.139> now<00:03:41.040> with<00:03:41.190> the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
what triggers it right here now with the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.699 
what triggers it right here now with the
side<00:03:41.459> with<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.609> bomb<00:03:42.049> now<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.079> wanted<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.530> say

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
side with the bomb now I wanted to say

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.099 
side with the bomb now I wanted to say
everything<00:03:44.250> that's<00:03:44.609> possibly<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.959> could

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
everything that's possibly that could

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.289 
everything that's possibly that could
possibly<00:03:46.470> turn<00:03:46.769> on<00:03:46.949> everything<00:03:47.519> so<00:03:47.699> I'm

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
possibly turn on everything so I'm

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.210 
possibly turn on everything so I'm
turning<00:03:48.540> off<00:03:48.750> all<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.049> levers<00:03:49.379> and<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:50.040> should

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
turning off all the levers and I should

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.619 
turning off all the levers and I should
be<00:03:50.250> enough<00:03:50.549> we're<00:03:51.419> done<00:03:52.879> the<00:03:53.879> bomb<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.419> sound

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
be enough we're done the bomb the sound

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.599 
be enough we're done the bomb the sound
in<00:03:54.989> like<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.829> minute<00:03:56.220> in<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.430> bit<00:03:57.919> break<00:03:58.919> that<00:03:59.400> as

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
in like a minute in a bit break that as

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.949 
in like a minute in a bit break that as
well<00:03:59.819> because<00:04:00.180> i<00:04:00.329> don't<00:04:00.540> like<00:04:00.599> live<00:04:01.470> wires<00:04:01.799> and

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
well because i don't like live wires and

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.330 
well because i don't like live wires and
yeah<00:04:03.959> we<00:04:04.139> should<00:04:04.319> have<00:04:04.409> at<00:04:04.590> least<00:04:04.620> two<00:04:05.040> minutes

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
yeah we should have at least two minutes

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.749 
yeah we should have at least two minutes
left<00:04:06.650> three<00:04:07.650> minutes<00:04:07.829> still<00:04:08.069> so<00:04:08.400> we<00:04:08.489> did<00:04:08.639> that

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:08.759 
left three minutes still so we did that

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:10.189 
left three minutes still so we did that
in<00:04:08.879> two<00:04:09.090> minutes<00:04:09.389> and<00:04:09.540> then<00:04:09.720> most<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.079> was

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
in two minutes and then most of that was

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.289 
in two minutes and then most of that was
building<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.709> so<00:04:11.519> I'm<00:04:11.699> yeah<00:04:11.970> thanks<00:04:12.269> for
