back up alright then the next question
is<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.900> arm<00:01:14.600> packages<00:01:15.600> won't<00:01:15.780> work<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
is the arm packages won't work like the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.710 
is the arm packages won't work like the
FTP<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.729> file<00:01:17.970> manager<00:01:18.380> you<00:01:19.380> need<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.650> find
