00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
and take a look and I'll explain each of

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.499 
and take a look and I'll explain each of
these<00:00:13.590> things<00:00:14.030> all<00:00:15.030> right<00:00:15.150> let's<00:00:15.299> start<00:00:15.450> with

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
these things all right let's start with

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.269 
these things all right let's start with
pedals<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:17.180> running<00:00:18.180> first<00:00:18.449> into<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.949> little

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
pedals so running first into this little

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.109 
pedals so running first into this little
box<00:00:20.460> here<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:21.150> actually<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.980> mini<00:00:23.640> buffer

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
box here it's actually a a mini buffer

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.320 
box here it's actually a a mini buffer
that<00:00:24.660> splits<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.439> signal<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.210> sends<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.300> my

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
that splits the signal and sends to my

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.410 
that splits the signal and sends to my
tuner<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.099> then<00:00:29.099> sends<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.789> rest<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.300> my

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
tuner and then sends to the rest of my

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.470 
tuner and then sends to the rest of my
signal<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.990> then<00:00:32.000> then<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.059> go<00:00:33.210> into<00:00:33.420> this

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
signal and then then I go into this

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.870 
signal and then then I go into this
little<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.899> bee<00:00:34.110> box<00:00:34.380> which<00:00:34.890> allows<00:00:35.550> me<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
little a bee box which allows me to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.660 
little a bee box which allows me to
switch<00:00:36.120> between<00:00:36.270> my<00:00:37.200> wireless<00:00:37.559> guitar<00:00:38.010> which

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
switch between my wireless guitar which

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.920 
switch between my wireless guitar which
is<00:00:38.820> actually<00:00:39.090> mounted<00:00:40.250> under<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.280> pedalboard

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
is actually mounted under the pedalboard

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.799 
is actually mounted under the pedalboard
hope<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.559> my<00:00:43.710> pedals<00:00:44.040> coming<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.809> you

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
hope with my pedals coming with it you

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.869 
hope with my pedals coming with it you
can<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.710> bit<00:00:46.920> under<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.670> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
can see a little bit under I have that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.479 
can see a little bit under I have that
mounted<00:00:48.360> underneath<00:00:48.660> hope<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.800> NC<00:00:50.100> cables

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
mounted underneath hope the NC cables

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.080 
mounted underneath hope the NC cables
running<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> outside<00:00:52.050> over<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:53.059> I'm<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
running to the outside over here I'm a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.500 
running to the outside over here I'm a
mess<00:00:54.390> right<00:00:54.420> now<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.090> I'm<00:00:57.329> running

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
mess right now and and so I'm running

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.139 
mess right now and and so I'm running
wireless<00:00:58.079> primarily<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.699> know<00:00:59.820> if<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.000> get

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
wireless primarily but you know if I get

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.270 
wireless primarily but you know if I get
in<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.300> jam<00:01:00.629> I've<00:01:01.199> also<00:01:01.379> got<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> direct<00:01:02.010> input

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
in the jam I've also got a direct input

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.369 
in the jam I've also got a direct input
and<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.030> just<00:01:03.059> hit<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.140> switches

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and I can just hit that and it switches

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.429 
and I can just hit that and it switches
right<00:01:04.619> away<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.369> that's<00:01:06.240> pretty<00:01:06.420> sweet<00:01:06.540> then

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
explain that this is my primary

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.319 
explain that this is my primary
overdrive<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.610> just<00:01:35.610> gives<00:01:35.790> kind<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> light

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
overdrive and just gives kind of a light

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.700 
overdrive and just gives kind of a light
a<00:01:37.759> light<00:01:38.759> crunch<00:01:39.360> not<00:01:39.840> nothing<00:01:40.350> over<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> top

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
a light crunch not nothing over the top

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.240 
a light crunch not nothing over the top
but<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.790> wanted<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.439> get<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> little<00:01:43.950> more

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
but if I wanted to get it a little more

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.490 
but if I wanted to get it a little more
crunchy<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:45.390> I'll<00:01:45.509> actually<00:01:45.689> throw<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
crunchy then I'll actually throw on the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.500 
crunchy then I'll actually throw on the
the<00:01:47.100> tube<00:01:47.340> screamer<00:01:47.579> side<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.149> this

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.890 

and<00:01:51.510> it<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.750> patents<00:01:52.440> it<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.650> a<00:01:52.770> little<00:01:52.920> bit

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
and it just patents it up a little bit

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.690 
and it just patents it up a little bit
and<00:01:54.900> so<00:01:55.470> that's<00:01:55.590> boosting<00:01:55.980> into<00:01:56.220> that<00:01:56.370> then<00:01:56.670> i

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
and so that's boosting into that then i

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.030 
and so that's boosting into that then i
use<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.240> fat<00:01:57.480> boost<00:01:57.750> that's<00:01:58.410> kind<00:01:58.650> of<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.800> lead

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
use the fat boost that's kind of a lead

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.490 
use the fat boost that's kind of a lead
boost<00:01:59.340> out<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.150> a<00:02:00.300> volume<00:02:03.170> if<00:02:04.170> i<00:02:04.260> want

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
boost out of it just a volume if i want

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.780 
boost out of it just a volume if i want
just<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.830> little<00:02:05.040> bit<00:02:05.160> more<00:02:05.370> over<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.330> top

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
just a little bit more over the top

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.180 
just a little bit more over the top
alright<00:02:08.790> then<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.090> come<00:02:09.540> it<00:02:09.929> actually<00:02:10.190> then

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
alright then I come it actually then

or<00:02:36.990> four<00:02:37.440> for<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.220> nacc<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.690> set<00:02:40.200> up<00:02:40.320> all<00:02:40.560> my

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
or four for the nacc I I set up all my

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.580 
or four for the nacc I I set up all my
presets<00:02:41.630> already<00:02:42.630> ahead<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.020> time<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.440> I

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
presets already ahead of time and I

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.640 
presets already ahead of time and I
control<00:02:44.070> them<00:02:44.340> with<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:45.480> tech<00:02:46.050> 21<00:02:46.470> Minnie

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
control them with this tech 21 Minnie

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.500 
control them with this tech 21 Minnie
Mouse<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.610> can<00:02:47.700> see<00:02:47.820> if<00:02:47.910> i<00:02:48.090> press<00:02:48.450> this

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
Mouse so you can see if i press this

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.560 
Mouse so you can see if i press this
then<00:02:49.380> it's<00:02:49.620> switching<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.700> presets<00:02:51.180> there

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
then it's switching the presets there

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.690 
then it's switching the presets there
and<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.350> I've<00:02:52.470> already<00:02:52.709> predetermined<00:02:53.160> you

and so I've already predetermined you

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.290 
and so I've already predetermined you

know our bpms so you know this one's 122

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.910 
know our bpms so you know this one's 122
beats<00:02:57.570> per<00:02:57.750> minute<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:58.200> then<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.860> little

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
beats per minute and then a little

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.460 
beats per minute and then a little
abbreviation<00:02:59.850> like<00:02:59.880> freedom<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.780> here<00:03:00.810> you

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
abbreviation like freedom is here you

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
run into the line 6 m9 which does a

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.420 
run into the line 6 m9 which does a
number<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.690> things<00:03:18.840> really<00:03:19.440> really<00:03:19.890> well<00:03:20.070> but

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430

number of things really really well but
for<00:03:21.030> this<00:03:21.209> conference<00:03:21.510> I'm<00:03:22.140> only<00:03:22.410> using<00:03:22.560> it

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
for this conference I'm only using it

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.199 
for this conference I'm only using it
for<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.070> few<00:03:23.310> things<00:03:23.370> since<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:24.060> my

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.780 
for a few things since this is my
primary<00:03:24.450> delay<00:03:24.900> i'm<00:03:25.110> using<00:03:25.410> an<00:03:25.530> octave<00:03:26.400> affect

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
primary delay i'm using an octave affect

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.740 
primary delay i'm using an octave affect
every<00:03:27.390> once<00:03:27.600> in<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> while

always know that kind of thing and then

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.110 
always know that kind of thing and then
I<00:03:39.650> use<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.800> for<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:41.010> reverb<00:03:41.520> it's<00:03:41.880> like<00:03:42.000> an

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
I use it for a reverb it's like an

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.150 
I use it for a reverb it's like an
octave<00:03:42.510> verb<00:03:42.750> with<00:03:43.140> my<00:03:43.380> other<00:03:43.590> reverb<00:03:43.980> pedal

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
octave verb with my other reverb pedal

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.310 
octave verb with my other reverb pedal
if<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.460> want<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.760> do<00:03:44.910> like<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.390> know<00:03:45.510> really

Spacey you know swelly house Apple drawn
tons<00:03:54.690> of<00:03:54.810> reverb<00:03:55.130> do<00:03:56.130> that<00:03:56.370> but<00:03:57.240> then<00:03:57.390> this

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
tons of reverb do that but then this

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.840 
tons of reverb do that but then this
reverb<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.740> last<00:03:58.920> thing<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.250> my<00:03:59.280> chain<00:03:59.610> and

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
reverb is the last thing in my chain and

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.740 
reverb is the last thing in my chain and
it's<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.450> it's<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.530> hardwired<00:04:01.920> rv7<00:04:02.520> and<00:04:02.940> it's

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
it's a it's the hardwired rv7 and it's

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.430 
it's a it's the hardwired rv7 and it's
awesome<00:04:04.110> it's<00:04:04.530> got<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.860> lexical<00:04:05.370> lexicon

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
awesome it's got the lexical lexicon

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.960 
awesome it's got the lexical lexicon
algorithms<00:04:07.440> in<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.739> and<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:08.250> usually<00:04:08.730> just<00:04:08.760> use

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
algorithms in it and I usually just use

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.360 
algorithms in it and I usually just use
the<00:04:09.180> hall<00:04:09.360> setting<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:10.530> modulated<00:04:11.070> settings

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
the hall setting the modulated settings

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.250 
the hall setting the modulated settings
pretty<00:04:12.000> good<00:04:12.150> for<00:04:12.330> some<00:04:12.480> things<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.870> Hall's

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
pretty good for some things to Hall's

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.340 
pretty good for some things to Hall's
awesome<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.070> I<00:04:15.000> have<00:04:15.390> it<00:04:15.540> like<00:04:15.660> way<00:04:15.930> over<00:04:16.140> here
