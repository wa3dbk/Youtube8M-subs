00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 all hello to your struggle the world if you 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.549
 tired d-trigger guys have a new 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.690
 toy zombie objects game is very similar 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.880
 on the d-trigger but it's a slightly different thing 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.840
 with different graphics but sense basically 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.369
 remains the same you are the same 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.949
 outfit, although here it is very cool 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.940
 let us drop armor let's see 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.460
 say what's covered here 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.550
 the armor, that is, which can be worn on 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.040
 character and buyer but when you 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.010
 develop your character enough torah 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.620
 I think this whole thing will open also 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.960
 there are cannon various melee weapons 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.120
 here's a lot of weapons here but 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.890
 General guys all the way to trigger all 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.680
 you can buy it let's get started 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.359
 actually to the game you must choose one 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.489
 kind of weapon before starting the game 1 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:09.090
 oh yes I accidentally canceled my weapon 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.520
 here it is equipment and all we can now 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.979
 push start mrs complexity here 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.030
 average toy unpretentious 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.890
 and go in principle at all possible 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.229
 Someone d-trigger does not work although I 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.380
 I think there is hardly any such d-trigger 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.380
 the square toy is well optimized 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:38.100
 protect this this this box 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.770
 really this box here even if in 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.329
 this shooter is such a nice thing as 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:49.649
 180 degree turn this here these 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:53.340
 Arrows is now on auto shooting 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.070
 and automatically I love 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.640
 although sometimes there is such a fuck 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.780
 chair 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.050
 that the zombie is already dead and our character 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.900
 continues 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.770
 shoot me just a little upset 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.979
 in general in the game 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:14.500
 that's why you gave up this box of the segment 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:16.810
 same interesting zombie shooter and this is not 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.120
 some kind of shooting gallery there 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.640
 wait and walk can not be called zombies here and 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.410
 just need to sit still 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:35.040
 you can really shoot back 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:35.040
 walk create action like this 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.520
 fun thing, of course with the beta thriller 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.970
 this toys don't get lost since 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:50.260
 d-trigger is a very popular name then 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.380
 game and it is unlikely this toy will be able 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.420
 prove to be the best trigger here but this 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.550
 the game is basically worthy to be with you 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.470
 installed so you can generally 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.510
 familiarize yourself with her shoot zombies 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.030
 generally see what else there is 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.690
 interesting zombie shooter and they are some 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.820
 kiriko or other games of other subjects 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.040
 zombie kill related 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.720
 but the zombie shooter shooter is the one 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.200
 In general, download the game to get acquainted with 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.040
