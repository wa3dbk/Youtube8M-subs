00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.539
 And now, for the party tent Packers von Waldenfels, my anxiety about their job is getting 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.089
 in their podcast, the basic rights of the North are their position 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.130
 as soon as I find myself on a gravel road or a field 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.559
 I have in this position to have maximum for controlling and everyone 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.559
 To be able to dodge the obstacle reasonably we are required 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.290
 Technique the zoos 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.960
 These are very slightly bent arms and legs on the bike 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.960
 here bites to pay attention 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.900
 that you focus on "The Kid &amp; Ride like that 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.410
 In addition, Apple should this technology in the second round behind at &amp; t be so that one 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.470
 In the case of the case, the biggest mistakes can occur immediately 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.520
 are that you either with completely stretched arms and legs off 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.920
 this is the problem 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.240
 that he does not give anything back to the body 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 Ashlee's customers have previously had the more articulate 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.150
 that you have to mean with a lot and smothered when drying 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.460
 maybe this is 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.830
 The team may need to keep this attitude working and eventually a lot 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.830
 Need strength to stand on the bike 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.040
 Really, the arms and legs only lightly heat the Beijing 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.180
 If my focus Ulrich is not in the right position 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.330
 not at its best when in composition role a hand off the handlebar 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.050
 take in the arms do not have the handlebars 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.090
 pulls on this 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.240
 I'm too far behind with the weight 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240
 in the front of the handlebars I'm pushing too far forward 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.990
 Munich on the left or almost a finger can hold 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.990
 I'm exactly right with the weight 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.230
 elementary building block the dad save it lay a good base for maximum 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.179
 Driving pleasure under control 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:14.119
 to wait until the last day for a Swiss
