00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
like a lens on a magnifying glass angle

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.880 
like a lens on a magnifying glass angle
this<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.329> way<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.170> light<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.620> enters

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
this in a way that the light that enters

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.160 
this in a way that the light that enters
through<00:00:35.510> here<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:37.050> channeled<00:00:38.540> into<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.810> spot

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
through here is channeled into one spot

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 
through here is channeled into one spot
where<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.590> will<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:41.310> magnified<00:00:41.730> into<00:00:42.150> a<00:00:42.210> point

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
where it will be magnified into a point

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.600 
where it will be magnified into a point
this<00:00:42.660> light<00:00:42.840> was<00:00:42.990> a<00:00:43.020> magnifying<00:00:43.470> glass<00:00:43.560> now<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
this light was a magnifying glass now I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.370 
this light was a magnifying glass now I
use<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.180> because<00:00:45.330> it's<00:00:45.600> easier<00:00:45.990> to<00:00:46.050> find

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
use this one because it's easier to find

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.060 
use this one because it's easier to find
a<00:00:46.560> bottle<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:48.050> I<00:00:49.050> found<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.620> works<00:00:49.860> really

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
a bottle and I found this works really
