00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.060 
quite quite solid and bouncy I wonder if
we<00:01:44.719> could<00:01:44.869> make<00:01:45.140> anything<00:01:45.500> from<00:01:45.859> it<00:01:46.130> Oh<00:01:46.840> huh

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.680 
quite fun to play with feels quite good
I'm<00:02:09.640> not<00:02:09.849> sure<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.300> could

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
I'm not sure you could

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.479 
I'm not sure you could
oh<00:02:10.720> maybe<00:02:10.959> you<00:02:11.230> could<00:02:11.440> make<00:02:11.620> things<00:02:11.920> from<00:02:12.310> it

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
oh maybe you could make things from it

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.780 
oh maybe you could make things from it
it's<00:02:12.670> um<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.270> think<00:02:13.720> it's<00:02:14.050> more<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.590> just<00:02:14.830> pull

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
it's um I think it's more to just pull

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.740 
it's um I think it's more to just pull
apart<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:17.130> maybe<00:02:18.130> make<00:02:18.430> balls<00:02:19.360> from<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.660> I

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
apart and maybe make balls from it I

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.570 
apart and maybe make balls from it I
don't<00:02:19.959> think<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.140> could<00:02:20.350> model<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.920> into<00:02:21.340> and

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
don't think you could model it into and

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.770 
don't think you could model it into and
hing<00:02:22.420> because<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.959> won't<00:02:23.200> hold<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.590> shape<00:02:24.780> it's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
hing because it won't hold a shape it's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.680 
hing because it won't hold a shape it's
quite<00:02:25.989> fun<00:02:29.459> it's<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.550> quite<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:30.850> lot<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.180> it

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
quite fun it's a quite a lot of it

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.800 
quite fun it's a quite a lot of it
so<00:02:32.580> yeah<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:33.610> should<00:02:33.880> think<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.239> would<00:02:34.630> be

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
so yeah I should think it would be

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.789
