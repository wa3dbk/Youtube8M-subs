00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello and arseny mikhalchenko and today 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:13.679
 we photon with photons than tell about 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:16.920
 aperture and so what is a diaphragm 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.410
 diaphragm is an adjustable septum in 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.000
 your lens can see a hole in 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.340
 the lens can do more or 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.689
 less, respectively, through it will be 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.970
 pass more or less light 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.060
 diaphragm usually denoted by Latin 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.070
 letter number after it usually 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.079
 and is its value than this number 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.160
 the larger the aperture opening the smaller 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.670
 for example 2 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:47.070
 this aperture is wide open a 16 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:49.260
 small aperture as well as shutter speed 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.260
 denoted by a fraction but usually its 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.579
 numerator lowered different lenses 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.100
 may have different diaphragm 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.230
 meanings but usually they are very similar than 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.690
 less than the aperture value which can 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.910
 to be at the lens so it is considered more 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.280
 holy strong i mean the greater flow 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.530
 light can pass through it in this 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.930
 the minimum value is important the more 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.960
 the digital value of the topics aperture is more 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.210
 closed and vice versa the smaller the digital 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.250
 the value of the themes the diaphragm is considered more 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.750
 open for what is needed a diaphragm with 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.880
 using the diaphragm you control 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.430
 the amount of light that falls on 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.119
 matrix of your camera or speaking 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.250
 differently 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.960
 exposure but this is not the only 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.420
 what is the diaphragm used for and here 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.820
 here we learn a new concept of depth 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.280
 sharpness of the depicted space or 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.920
 the flu what is the flu depth 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.430
 Sharpness characterizes the size of the area in 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.860
 which 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.420
 the objects you photograph will be 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.700
 sharp or in focus 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.159
 the smaller the f-number 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.590
 less depth of field and vice versa 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.229
 more than the aperture value the depth 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.880
 sharpness more depth of field one of 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.799
 basic techniques to 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.790
 focus on some 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.799
 object in the photo 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.750
 very important to be able to manage 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.880
 depth of field when you shoot 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.250
 portrait because depth of field 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.079
 should be on man and all the rest 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.300
 objects in the frame are desirable to have 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.760
 blurry if you shoot a frame in 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.900
 which every detail is important you need 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.239
 a big 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.400
 on sharpness and accordingly large 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.040
 f-number with you was arseny 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.040
 Mikhalchenko and photon photo bye bye
