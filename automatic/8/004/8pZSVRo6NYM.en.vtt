 you may ask the devil 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.790
 a good radio play is like a 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.920
 theater but on radio is like a play 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.810
 theatrical but on radio that only 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.550
 it works through the voice obviously 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:57.430
 that can be heard through 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.720
 triple internet www.hondanews.com and 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.340
 I will obviously leave them the 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.160
 tax so that you can access 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.170
 to him and they can hear him later on 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.090

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.550
 bard that promotes this good as 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:14.350

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.910
 a radio theater and now I have to appear 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.979
 in this I also have a super role 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.900
 small in the radio theater I speak a little 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.520
 about little but if they want me 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.830
 listen to something different not in 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.660

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.970

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.620
 important character that appears now 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.600
 in this radio theater if you 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.600
 they ask who they listen 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.780
 I think they went to the forest of the hundred 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.760
 acres with winnie pooh the safest thing is 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.040
