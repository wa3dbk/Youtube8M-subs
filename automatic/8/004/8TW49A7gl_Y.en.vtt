00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 just doing antics and without 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:12.900
 submit no proposal on the 3rd of 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:16.770
 October 2010 with 1.353.820 95 votes 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.020
 Sao Paulo elected to federal deputy 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.199
 Trio Clown 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.630
 with this expressive vote in clown 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.449
 tained our history by becoming the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.810
 second most voted federal deputy 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.850
 from Brazil only losing to the longing 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.399
 eeas mutton and former federal deputy 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.950
 by the extinct prone 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.210
 happens that behind all this 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.149
 clownery 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.070
 TIRICA still had enough votes 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.550
 to pull three more candidates from the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.539
 coalition and who were these candidates 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.870
 the couriers genuine josé do pt joão 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.850
 paulo cunha do pt and valdemar costa grandson 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.000
 foot using phrases like worse 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.479
 that is not there and you're tired of 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.700
 Who do you think is the best? 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.640
 ironically the clown voters 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.010
 gave the opportunity to 3 corrupt 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.920
 that would never be accepted by the vote 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.250
 of being elected as MPs 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.509
 with the phrases what makes a 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.580
 Congressman 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.119
 I really do not know, but I'll tell you later. 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.600
 tale and Congressman nutsedge 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.530
 vote in abestado and clown managed 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.810
 to make clowns in one million three hundred 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.470
 It's forty-eight thousand two hundred and ninety 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.350
 and five voters more than half of 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.540
 population of the state of sergipe and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.360
 clownery did not stop there 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.210
 the clown deputy managed to make 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.759
 clowns the evaluators who elected him 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.380
 as one of the 20 best MPs in the 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.200
 National Congress 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.229
 but how was this possible if simple 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.770
 because it was two things that weighed 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.459
 for the good evaluation of the clown deputy 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.619
 the first physical presence ie he 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.739
 did not lack any 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.140
 are deliberative in plenary but this is 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.049
 pure inversion of values 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.450
 to be present is not merit 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.129
 try to miss your job 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.349
 to see what happens 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.870
 or better ask your boss for a 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:31.489
 will not miss any 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.250
 work and listen to what he has to say 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.459
 already the second thing that weighed for good 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.610
 evaluation of the clown was the deputy 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.579
 quality of the projects presented 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.910
 According to the evaluators, the 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:51.140
 clown had an important focus on the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.269
 artistic and cultural areas 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.829
 You want to know what were your proposals 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:03.349
 I will cite the three most important 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:06.030
 first bill 3544 bar 2012 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.900
 grant exemption from the tax on 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.040
 ipi incident industrialized products 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.459
 on vehicles for use in 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:22.739
 circus activities second project of 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:25.799
 law 3546 bar 2012 to guarantee children 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.370
 of circus performers in the age group of 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:33.090
 4 to 17 years whose activity is 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:38.449
 traveling in public or private schools. 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:41.879
 third party bill 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:46.220
 3542 bar 2012 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:49.650
 to institute the diploma friend of the circus 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.480
 so this is it if you were one of the one 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.209
 million, three hundred and forty-eight thousand 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.430
 two hundred and ninety-five voters who 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.799
 they voted a clown 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.560
 I hope you're feeling this way. 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:06.660
 very well represented moment 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.720
 It happens that deep down I believe that 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.879
 put a clown in the federal chamber does not 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.930
 has gone from being a great way to 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.720
 protest 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.910
 the protest against the lack of hospitals 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:22.049
 against the lack of security against 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.110
 corruption but protesting this way does not 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.990
 brings 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.800
 in practice no benefit to the 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.870
 society 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.469
 on the contrary it is only for 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.740
 legally place new clowns and 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:39.280
 possible corrupt in power 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.159
 so my friend stays here not the appeal 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.860
 come back in the clown in superman no 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:47.979
 batman and much less gave him I think 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.530
 do not even have the slightest condition 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.199
 to complete a sentence that starts 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.080
 in the middle and end 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:58.539
 no 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.900
 waste more of your vote with a 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.900
 clown
