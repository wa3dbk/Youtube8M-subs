00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.600 

when<00:00:01.140> you're<00:00:01.260> rehearsing<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.800> fight<00:00:02.040> it's

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
when you're rehearsing a fight it's

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.770 
when you're rehearsing a fight it's
really<00:00:02.820> important<00:00:03.210> that<00:00:03.240> once<00:00:03.629> you've

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
really important that once you've

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.900 
really important that once you've
decided<00:00:04.080> what<00:00:04.380> your<00:00:04.529> choreography<00:00:05.130> is<00:00:05.339> your

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
decided what your choreography is your

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.540 
decided what your choreography is your
horse<00:00:06.180> correctly<00:00:06.690> so<00:00:07.200> you're<00:00:07.500> first<00:00:08.040> slowly

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
horse correctly so you're first slowly

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.160 
horse correctly so you're first slowly
but<00:00:09.179> you<00:00:09.269> also<00:00:09.420> want<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.660> have<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.840> certain

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
but you also want to have a certain

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.020 
but you also want to have a certain
amount<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.440> fluidity<00:00:10.769> in<00:00:11.070> your<00:00:11.250> work<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:11.849> that

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
amount of fluidity in your work so that

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.789 
amount of fluidity in your work so that
you're<00:00:12.210> not<00:00:12.300> moving<00:00:12.690> from<00:00:12.870> one<00:00:13.049> move<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
you're not moving from one move to the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.440 
you're not moving from one move to the
next<00:00:13.980> trying<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.460> move<00:00:14.610> what<00:00:14.790> trying<00:00:15.420> to

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
next trying to move what trying to

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.510 
next trying to move what trying to
remember<00:00:15.660> what<00:00:15.870> comes<00:00:16.080> next<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.560> one<00:00:17.010> fight<00:00:17.279> a

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
remember what comes next and one fight a

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.849 
remember what comes next and one fight a
parry<00:00:18.029> would<00:00:18.240> move<00:00:18.420> really<00:00:18.630> naturally<00:00:19.260> into

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
parry would move really naturally into

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.800 
parry would move really naturally into
an<00:00:19.980> attack<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.970> real<00:00:21.119> fight<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.660> works

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
an attack in a real fight and it works

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.359 
an attack in a real fight and it works
that<00:00:21.960> way<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.170> stage<00:00:22.350> combat<00:00:22.619> too<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.130> sells

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
that way in stage combat too it sells

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.220 
that way in stage combat too it sells
better<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.240> helps<00:00:24.510> develop<00:00:24.810> your<00:00:24.930> muscle

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
better and it helps develop your muscle

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.570 
better and it helps develop your muscle
memory<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.920> remember<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.369> fight

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
memory so that you remember that fight

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.970 
memory so that you remember that fight
as<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.880> work<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.180> up<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.779> speed<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.140> then<00:00:28.590> it's

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
as you work it up to speed and then it's

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.800 
as you work it up to speed and then it's
it's<00:00:29.220> safer<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:29.789> more<00:00:29.939> convincing<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.630> look

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
it's safer it's more convincing you look

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.720 
it's safer it's more convincing you look
better<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.500> let's<00:00:31.949> go<00:00:32.070> through<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.309> slowly

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
better so let's go through that slowly

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.299 
better so let's go through that slowly
but<00:00:33.390> fluidly<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.130> how<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.430> looks<00:00:37.309> so

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
but fluidly you see how that looks so

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.920 
but fluidly you see how that looks so
we've<00:00:38.460> already<00:00:38.579> memorized<00:00:38.879> our<00:00:39.239> choreography

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
we've already memorized our choreography

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.709 
we've already memorized our choreography
we're<00:00:40.590> taking<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.040> deliberately<00:00:41.790> more<00:00:42.450> slowly

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
we're taking it deliberately more slowly

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.990 
we're taking it deliberately more slowly
than<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> make<00:00:44.579> sure<00:00:44.610> that

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
than we have to just to make sure that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.090 
than we have to just to make sure that
you're<00:00:45.600> getting<00:00:45.719> your<00:00:45.899> fight<00:00:46.200> into<00:00:46.950> your

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
you're getting your fight into your

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.650 
you're getting your fight into your
muscle<00:00:47.399> memory<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.760> moves<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.329> as

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
muscle memory so that it moves just as

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.950 
muscle memory so that it moves just as
fluidly<00:00:52.440> when<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> build<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> up<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.550> speed

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.260 

so<00:01:00.960> once<00:01:01.680> you've<00:01:01.859> rehearsed<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.640> many

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
so once you've rehearsed like that many

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.230 
so once you've rehearsed like that many
many<00:01:03.570> times<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.890> start<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.610> get<00:01:05.700> faster

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
many times you can start to get faster

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.320 
many times you can start to get faster
after<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.320> add<00:01:07.470> speed<00:01:07.860> oh<00:01:08.210> remember<00:01:09.210> when

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
after you add speed oh remember when

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.700 
after you add speed oh remember when
you're<00:01:09.450> adding<00:01:09.600> speed<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.260> add<00:01:10.380> force

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you're adding speed not to add force

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.109 
you're adding speed not to add force
it's<00:01:10.950> easy<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> four<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:11.970> when

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
it's easy when you get a four it when

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.340 
it's easy when you get a four it when
you<00:01:12.210> start<00:01:12.420> getting<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.659> fight<00:01:12.840> faster<00:01:13.229> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
you start getting a fight faster and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.499 
you start getting a fight faster and
faster<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.159> when<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> hit<00:01:14.610> harder<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.360> when<00:01:15.479> a

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
faster so when a hit harder so when a

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.780 
faster so when a hit harder so when a
parry<00:01:15.810> emotionally<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:17.159> that's<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
parry emotionally but that's going to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.820 
parry emotionally but that's going to
slow<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.360> down<00:01:18.479> ultimately<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.470> also<00:01:19.680> make

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
slow you down ultimately and also make

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.830 
slow you down ultimately and also make
your<00:01:19.950> work<00:01:20.100> collette<00:01:20.490> safe<00:01:20.700> also<00:01:21.270> might<00:01:21.659> make

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
your work collette safe also might make

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.660 
your work collette safe also might make
your<00:01:21.990> opponent<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.590> bit<00:01:22.680> mad<00:01:22.920> at<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.220> so

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
your opponent a little bit mad at you so

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.240 
your opponent a little bit mad at you so
keep<00:01:24.270> keep<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> force<00:01:25.080> light<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.040> build

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
keep keep the force light as you build

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.310 
keep keep the force light as you build
speed<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.150> very<00:01:27.360> last<00:01:27.570> thing<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.960> add<00:01:28.110> is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
speed and the very last thing you add is

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.499 
speed and the very last thing you add is
the<00:01:28.710> acting<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.220> those<00:01:29.670> reactions<00:01:30.150> that

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
the acting is those reactions that

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.660 
the acting is those reactions that
really<00:01:30.750> sell<00:01:30.990> your<00:01:31.530> move<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.070> at<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> end<00:01:32.460> you

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
really sell your move so at the end you

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.660 
really sell your move so at the end you
have<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.790> really<00:01:33.090> satisfying<00:01:34.159> fight<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
have a really satisfying fight that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.460 
have a really satisfying fight that
looks<00:01:35.880> good<00:01:36.119> that's<00:01:36.570> safe<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.350> was<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
looks good that's safe and that was a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.740 
looks good that's safe and that was a
lot<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.619> fun<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> put<00:01:37.950> together<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> hope

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
lot of fun to put together so I hope

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.390 
lot of fun to put together so I hope
that<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.560> enough<00:01:40.829> tools<00:01:41.070> to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that you have enough tools to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.460 
that you have enough tools to
choreograph<00:01:41.880> your<00:01:42.390> own<00:01:42.990> fights

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
choreograph your own fights

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.590 
choreograph your own fights
should<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> play<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> film<00:01:45.390> or

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
should they be for a play for a film or
