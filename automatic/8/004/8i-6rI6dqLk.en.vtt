00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.730
 to anticipate the mood in 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.890
 Both derbys were playoff worthy of the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.260
 Fans from both camps floated theirs 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.469
 team without ifs and buts forwards 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.179
 devil wanted to watch in front of 7000 spectators 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.800
 Goalkeeper thomas over his chest 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.029
 Of course, on Fridays as long as 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.130
 keep it clean as possible 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.439
 but the topic was fast 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.330
 takes just two minutes 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.710
 were played and the frankfurters were 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.710
 with 1 0 in leadership 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.730
 short time later, pay attention to this situation 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.060
 right after the fight behind you 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.400
 gate 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:44.530
 the left with the high stick into 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:47.830
 face of frankfurters with the whole 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.770
 injury order because it was said for the bathroom 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.780
 nauheimer shower go 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.730
 Frankfurt 5 minutes in the above number 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.200
 best chances of this time however 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.600
 had bad nauheim 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.950
 But Chris Stanley fails on 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.960
 Frankfurter SchluÃŸmann Frankfurt afterwards 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.610
 with a lot of steam and train to 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.860
 gate 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.220
 broader branca on patrick schmidt and 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.660
 this increases to 2 0 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.530
 frankfurt let the devil ever 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.530
 do not come into play 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:27.160
 it was amazing he was full 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:28.899
 the team held together and when 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.970
 but once a bad nauheimer 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.330
 chance should result was closing man 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.979
 kovacic on the post 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.870
 the fans in frankfurt with standing 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.870
 ovations after the first third 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.440
 and it should continue like this 40 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.780
 seconds in the second section played 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.230
 and the new hit this time is it 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:58.200
 conversely schmidt on prohaska and that 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:59.940
 13 trainer jiranek could with his 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.930
 team more than satisfied 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.220
 it was really in a great mood now 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.830
 Patrick Smith degrades the bathroom 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.479
 nauheimer to slalomstangen but goalkeeper 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.479
 thomas over on the post 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.520
 in the end, the lions still laid 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.190
 on top of it to the end of 4 0 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.880
 frankfurt on this day clearly the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.880
 better team 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.700
 yes they played well we have to 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.560
 field 1000 spectators 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.000
 we started poorly and have 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.560
 never found to our game 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.120
 frankfurt is better than a month ago 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.129
 when we last against her 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.079
 and the tory is allowed too 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.219
 We played a really strong game 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.019
 We do not have to play both games 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.470
 we must win now on sunday 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.299
 win 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.560
 They seem to be a happy team too 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.389
 its the last time and the two 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.879
 days later it went to the return match 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:55.189
 Bad nauheim and one had the 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.549
 devil made it will not be yet 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.470
 once a match like friday and that 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.840
 It was not quite the opposite 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.629
 the devil from the beginning to the 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.000
 dominating team frankfurter 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.629
 your kovacic at the heart of 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.879
 particular presentation 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.760
 the game compared to friday 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:17.590
 completely turned bad nauheim let 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.590
 this time the lions do not come into play 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.700
 the first notable torchance for 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.910
 Frankfurt only in the ninth 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.910
 play minute 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.030
 I think we already have today 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.010
 seen early superior game 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.510
 at a very high level of further show 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.020
 if it's a bit heavy in the mirror 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.180
 come in the beginning 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.490
 came in the second third better 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.890
 than then two players at the 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.740
 People sitting on the punishment bench struck 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:57.220
 the devil to daniel oppolzer is dusting off 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.220
 and get the much acclaimed 1 to 0 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.510
 the shots just blocked the 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.490
 Trivia made a good one 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.560
 Team with a lot of talent but in the end 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.220
 The will and will always decide 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.650
 decided I believe 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.660
 chance in the first third made the 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.660
 lions in the second section a little more 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.350
 pressure but he held his box 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.940
 still clean 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.580
 even the devils had their own 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.010
 Opportunities on a preliminary decision a lot 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.900
 traffic in front of the frankfurter box, after all 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.700
 somehow the hosts manage it 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.970
 Do not slice over the line too 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.970
 to get 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.210
 in the 33 minute game were two again 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.300
 player on the criminal bank 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.270
 this time on the part of the devil and the 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.979
 uses the compensation patrick schmid 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.229
 gets the rebound from the gang 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:56.249
 the trowel and sinks the disc without 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:58.680
 problems with the 1 1 bad nauheim thereby 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:00.259
 again with four field players but always 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.969
 still outnumbered 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.249
 but that does not matter to him at all 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.680
 nice combinations and nine seconds 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:20.330
 after compensation , the red devils are 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:20.330
 from bad nauheim back in the lead 2 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.060
 frankfurt has to play longer 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:28.710
 becoming more offensive and doing so too 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:36.560
 But what bad nauheim place to counter 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:36.560
 but without being successful 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.820
 frankfurt uses the last offer 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.000
 in the straw and takes the keeper off 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.970
 ice thomas over but nothing leaves 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.730
 burn and thus wins bad nauheim 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.630
 and thus pulls in as a table leader 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.630
 the playoffs
