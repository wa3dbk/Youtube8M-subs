00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
description below now one thing I'd like

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.870 
description below now one thing I'd like
to<00:00:31.650> mention<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:32.070> I'm<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.610> using<00:00:32.730> my

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
to mention is I'm going to be using my

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.630 
to mention is I'm going to be using my
HD<00:00:33.180> camera<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.570> record<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.280> it's<00:00:35.280> gonna<00:00:35.370> give

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
HD camera to record this it's gonna give

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.040 
HD camera to record this it's gonna give
pretty<00:00:35.820> good<00:00:35.910> quality<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:36.660> reason<00:00:36.930> why<00:00:37.020> i

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
pretty good quality but one reason why i

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.479 
pretty good quality but one reason why i
don't<00:00:37.350> use<00:00:37.469> fraps<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.309> totally

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
don't use fraps is because it totally

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.580 
don't use fraps is because it totally
ruins<00:00:38.790> your<00:00:39.000> score<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.329> throws<00:00:39.719> off<00:00:39.960> your<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
ruins your score and throws off your the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.920 
ruins your score and throws off your the
score<00:00:41.489> at<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> end<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.390> i<00:00:42.420> want<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.809> give

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
score at the end and so i want to give

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.080 
score at the end and so i want to give
you<00:00:42.960> guys<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> most<00:00:43.559> accurate<00:00:43.850> score<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.059> i

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
you guys the most accurate score that i

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.459 
you guys the most accurate score that i
could<00:00:45.239> possibly<00:00:45.570> give<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.020> that's<00:00:46.170> why<00:00:46.320> i'm

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
could possibly give so that's why i'm

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.290 
could possibly give so that's why i'm
going<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.890> using<00:00:46.920> my<00:00:47.160> camera<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.579> one

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
going to be using my camera and one

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.479 
going to be using my camera and one
other<00:00:48.539> thing<00:00:48.780> i<00:00:48.870> did<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.260> i<00:00:49.410> enlarged<00:00:50.070> i<00:00:50.280> tried

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
other thing i did is i enlarged i tried

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.520 
other thing i did is i enlarged i tried
to<00:00:50.579> enlarge<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> frame<00:00:51.210> rate<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> bottom

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
to enlarge the frame rate at the bottom

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.479 
to enlarge the frame rate at the bottom
so<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.680> guys<00:00:52.800> could<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.129> what<00:00:53.309> i'm<00:00:53.399> actually

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
so you guys could see what i'm actually

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.270 
so you guys could see what i'm actually
getting<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:54.059> real<00:00:54.750> time<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.199> first<00:00:55.860> off<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.160> got

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
getting in real time so first off we got

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.990 
getting in real time so first off we got
the<00:00:56.430> first<00:00:56.730> benchmark<00:00:57.050> this<00:00:58.050> actually<00:00:58.500> is

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
the first benchmark this actually is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.580 
the first benchmark this actually is
designed<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.270> test<00:01:00.480> your<00:01:00.809> geometry<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
designed to test your geometry and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.200 
designed to test your geometry and
illumination<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.520> done<00:01:02.640> by<00:01:02.670> hundreds<00:01:03.149> of

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
illumination this is done by hundreds of

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.030 
illumination this is done by hundreds of
this<00:01:03.359> little<00:01:03.570> spot<00:01:03.780> lights<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.559> both<00:01:04.710> cast

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
this little spot lights that both cast

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.690 
this little spot lights that both cast
shadows<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.610> doubt<00:01:05.729> cast<00:01:05.970> shadows<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> it's

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
shadows and doubt cast shadows so it's

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.109 
shadows and doubt cast shadows so it's
really<00:01:08.880> stress<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.549> GPU<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:11.729> far<00:01:11.939> as

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
really stress in the GPU as far as

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
really stress in the GPU as far as
geometric<00:01:12.810> lighting<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.619> stuff<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:13.860> that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
geometric lighting and stuff like that

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.670 
geometric lighting and stuff like that
and<00:01:17.240> what<00:01:18.240> i<00:01:18.270> did<00:01:18.450> was<00:01:18.600> i<00:01:18.750> cut<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.350> load

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and what i did was i cut out the load

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.960 
and what i did was i cut out the load
times<00:01:19.920> three<00:01:20.250> guys<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> way

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
times three guys so we have the way

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.789 
times three guys so we have the way
through<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> second

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
through that here we have the second

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.370 
through that here we have the second
test<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.060> second<00:01:24.509> graphical<00:01:24.930> test<00:01:25.200> is

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
test now the second graphical test is

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.010 
test now the second graphical test is
designed<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.890> test<00:01:26.100> particles<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.600> GPU

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
designed to test particles and the GPU

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.690 
designed to test particles and the GPU
simulates<00:01:28.470> by<00:01:28.710> using<00:01:28.890> lots<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.250> smoke<00:01:29.460> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
simulates by using lots of smoke and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.340 
simulates by using lots of smoke and
spotlights<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.329> create<00:01:30.659> detailed<00:01:30.900> scenes

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
spotlights to create detailed scenes

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.649 
spotlights to create detailed scenes
they're<00:01:32.009> also<00:01:32.159> heavily<00:01:32.490> stressed<00:01:32.909> GPU<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.570> you

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
they're also heavily stressed GPU as you

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.770 
they're also heavily stressed GPU as you
can<00:01:33.780> see<00:01:34.340> in<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.820> scene<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
can see in the scene you can see just a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.749 
can see in the scene you can see just a
bunch<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.409> particles<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:38.430> across<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
bunch of particles going across the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.210 
bunch of particles going across the
screen<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.299> totally<00:01:40.079> overdone<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:41.040> my

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
screen you know totally overdone in my

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.120 
screen you know totally overdone in my
opinion<00:01:41.780> but<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.200> why<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:43.890> meant

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
opinion but this is just why it's meant

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.940 
opinion but this is just why it's meant
to<00:01:44.340> stress<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.270> your<00:01:45.450> GPU<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.110> much<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.619> this

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
to stress as your GPU so much and this

00:01:46.950 --> 00:02:00.000 
to stress as your GPU so much and this
new<00:01:47.159> software<00:01:47.520> futuremark<00:01:48.479> put<00:01:48.720> out

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.650 

and<00:02:01.010> here<00:02:01.490> we<00:02:01.520> have<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.940> third<00:02:02.150> test<00:02:02.360> now<00:02:02.630> this

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
and here we have the third test now this

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.750 
and here we have the third test now this
third<00:02:03.110> test<00:02:03.440> is<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.620> physics<00:02:04.040> test<00:02:04.250> is<00:02:04.550> designed

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
third test is a physics test is designed

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.430 
third test is a physics test is designed
to<00:02:05.150> put<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.450> least<00:02:05.630> amount<00:02:05.840> of<00:02:05.960> stress<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.350> the

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
to put the least amount of stress on the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.830 
to put the least amount of stress on the
GPU<00:02:06.740> as<00:02:06.920> possible<00:02:07.430> and<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.540> will<00:02:08.660> focus

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
GPU as possible and so it will focus

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.140 
GPU as possible and so it will focus

here<00:02:18.230> we<00:02:18.350> have<00:02:18.380> my<00:02:18.530> favorite<00:02:18.740> test<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.580> this

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
here we have my favorite test and this

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.120 
here we have my favorite test and this
is<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.080> final<00:02:21.080> test<00:02:21.200> it's<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.500> combined<00:02:21.860> test

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
is the final test it's a combined test

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.090 
is the final test it's a combined test
and<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:23.540> combines<00:02:24.140> all<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.530> elements<00:02:24.800> of<00:02:24.980> the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
and it combines all the elements of the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.770 
and it combines all the elements of the
previous<00:02:25.430> three<00:02:25.460> tests<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.060> addition<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.600> does

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
previous three tests in addition it does

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.290 
previous three tests in addition it does
use<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.980> tessellation<00:02:28.520> volumetric

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
use a tessellation volumetric

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.720 
use a tessellation volumetric

noticed<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:36.050> before<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.740> can<00:02:36.890> see<00:02:37.010> the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
noticed this before you can see the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.740 
noticed this before you can see the
whole<00:02:37.220> background<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.970> collapsing<00:02:38.480> behind

whole background is collapsing behind

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.650 
whole background is collapsing behind
them<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:40.090> we'll<00:02:41.090> go<00:02:41.209> ahead<00:02:41.240> and<00:02:41.420> see<00:02:41.630> what

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
them so we'll go ahead and see what

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:50.199 
them so we'll go ahead and see what
score<00:02:42.200> i<00:02:42.230> got<00:02:42.500> it's<00:02:43.490> loading<00:02:44.180> oh<00:02:48.490> I<00:02:49.490> won<00:02:49.970> over

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
score i got it's loading oh I won over

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.740 
score i got it's loading oh I won over
10,000<00:02:50.780> that's<00:02:50.930> pretty<00:02:51.170> good<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.620> guess<00:02:52.750> not

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
10,000 that's pretty good I guess not

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.470 
10,000 that's pretty good I guess not
too<00:02:53.870> much<00:02:53.990> to<00:02:54.170> compare<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.620> yet<00:02:55.360> we'll<00:02:56.360> go

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
too much to compare it to yet we'll go

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.330 
too much to compare it to yet we'll go
ahead<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.660> zoom<00:02:56.780> in<00:02:57.020> there<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.290> see<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:58.130> show

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
ahead and zoom in there and see so show

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.240 
ahead and zoom in there and see so show
you<00:02:58.400> guys<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:59.270> detailed<00:02:59.930> score<00:03:00.260> now<00:03:01.010> again

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
you guys the detailed score now again

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.190 
you guys the detailed score now again
this<00:03:01.970> is<00:03:02.150> my<00:03:02.239> first<00:03:02.450> time<00:03:02.570> running<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.959> test

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
this is my first time running the test

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.770 
this is my first time running the test
and<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:03.860> haven't<00:03:04.370> found<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.760> best<00:03:05.480> score

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
and so I haven't found the best score

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.750 
and so I haven't found the best score
for<00:03:06.050> me<00:03:06.140> yet<00:03:06.320> but<00:03:06.950> what<00:03:07.160> I'll<00:03:07.250> do<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.489> I'll<00:03:07.610> go

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
for me yet but what I'll do is I'll go

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.180 
for me yet but what I'll do is I'll go
ahead<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.260> keep<00:03:09.260> doing<00:03:09.680> tests<00:03:09.920> and

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
ahead and keep doing tests and

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.710 
ahead and keep doing tests and
overclocking<00:03:10.550> and<00:03:10.910> playing<00:03:11.090> tinkering<00:03:11.660> with

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
overclocking and playing tinkering with

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.780 
overclocking and playing tinkering with
things<00:03:11.840> until<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.410> get<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.560> better<00:03:13.400> school<00:03:13.670> or

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
things until I get a better school or

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.610 
things until I get a better school or
maybe<00:03:13.940> if<00:03:14.090> i<00:03:14.150> beat<00:03:14.300> this<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:15.290> what<00:03:15.440> I'll<00:03:15.530> do

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
maybe if i beat this and I what I'll do

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.800 
maybe if i beat this and I what I'll do
