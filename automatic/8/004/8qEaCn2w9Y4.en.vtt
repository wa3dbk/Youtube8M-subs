the menstrual cup actually comes down
into<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> center<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.710> cup<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.370> and

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
into the center of the cup like that and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.690 
into the center of the cup like that and
you<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:36.899> see<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.260> better<00:00:37.469> at<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.860> angle<00:00:38.100> see

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
you can see it better at this angle see

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.389 
you can see it better at this angle see
I'm<00:00:38.790> pushing<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.300> down<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.950> that's<00:00:40.950> kind<00:00:41.309> of

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
I'm pushing it down and that's kind of

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.850 
I'm pushing it down and that's kind of
what<00:00:41.640> your<00:00:41.790> cervix<00:00:42.239> actually<00:00:42.750> does<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.290> again

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860

and for some people that can come down

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.479 
and for some people that can come down
pretty<00:00:47.940> low<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.539> actually<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:49.440> only<00:00:50.039> this

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
pretty low it can actually be only this

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.540 
pretty low it can actually be only this
far<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.289> were<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.469> case<00:00:52.620> then

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
far in and if that were the case then

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.779 
far in and if that were the case then
the<00:00:53.910> walls<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.660> your<00:00:55.050> menstrual<00:00:55.530> cup<00:00:55.800> would<00:00:56.610> be

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the walls of your menstrual cup would be

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.529 
the walls of your menstrual cup would be
sitting<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.410> kind<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.309> around<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
sitting like this kind of around the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.560 
sitting like this kind of around the
edges<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.649> these<00:01:02.340> pockets<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.149> form<00:01:03.420> in

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
edges here in these pockets that form in

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.450 
edges here in these pockets that form in
the<00:01:03.660> back<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.589> other<00:01:04.710> words<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.189> would<00:01:05.309> be

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
the back so in other words it would be

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.530 
the back so in other words it would be
like<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.479> were<00:01:06.630> inside

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.570 

and<00:01:13.750> because<00:01:14.470> this<00:01:14.590> cup<00:01:14.830> is<00:01:14.980> clear<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:15.430> can

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
and because this cup is clear you can

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.510 
and because this cup is clear you can
kind<00:01:15.850> of<00:01:15.910> see<00:01:16.150> through<00:01:16.420> here<00:01:16.810> but<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:18.010> cervix

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
kind of see through here but the cervix

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.090 
kind of see through here but the cervix
would<00:01:18.760> kind<00:01:19.000> of<00:01:19.090> slightly<00:01:19.810> dip<00:01:20.260> inside<00:01:20.740> of<00:01:20.980> it

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
would kind of slightly dip inside of it

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.240 
would kind of slightly dip inside of it
like<00:01:21.130> that<00:01:21.580> tell<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:22.780> if<00:01:22.810> it's<00:01:23.230> high<00:01:23.620> or<00:01:23.980> low

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
like that tell you if it's high or low

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:34.290 
like that tell you if it's high or low
or<00:01:24.660> somewhere<00:01:25.660> in<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.810> middle

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:45.940 

you

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.190 

one<00:01:46.610> thing<00:01:46.850> I<00:01:47.000> will<00:01:47.210> say<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:47.659> that<00:01:47.689> it<00:01:47.990> doesn't

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
one thing I will say is that it doesn't

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.620 
one thing I will say is that it doesn't
matter<00:01:48.470> if<00:01:48.770> your<00:01:48.920> cervix<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.460> high<00:01:49.729> or<00:01:50.060> low<00:01:50.299> it

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
matter if your cervix is high or low it

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.289 
matter if your cervix is high or low it
does<00:01:50.869> have<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.229> at<00:01:51.380> least<00:01:51.409> be<00:01:51.740> pointing<00:01:52.549> toward

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
does have to at least be pointing toward

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.899 
does have to at least be pointing toward
the<00:01:53.450> opening<00:01:54.320> of<00:01:54.560> your<00:01:54.830> cup<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.580> can<00:01:55.729> see

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
the opening of your cup and you can see

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.510 
the opening of your cup and you can see
how<00:01:56.030> it's<00:01:56.210> inserted<00:01:56.540> here<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.740> rim<00:01:58.040> of<00:01:58.340> the

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
how it's inserted here the rim of the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.289 
how it's inserted here the rim of the
orange<00:01:58.880> Cup<00:01:59.180> is<00:01:59.450> open<00:02:00.080> toward<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.790> cervix

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
orange Cup is open toward the cervix

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.899 
orange Cup is open toward the cervix
because<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.140> cervix<00:02:03.649> is<00:02:03.830> actually<00:02:04.460> what<00:02:04.729> the

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
because the cervix is actually what the

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.149 
because the cervix is actually what the
blood<00:02:05.149> comes<00:02:05.420> out<00:02:05.750> of<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.289> your<00:02:06.560> uterus<00:02:07.009> is

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
right behind it it's about the size and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.009 
right behind it it's about the size and
shape<00:02:09.709> of<00:02:10.100> your<00:02:10.130> fist<00:02:10.550> like<00:02:10.819> this<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.480> when

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
shape of your fist like this and when

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.840 
shape of your fist like this and when
you're<00:02:12.170> pregnant<00:02:12.470> your<00:02:12.890> baby<00:02:13.100> sits<00:02:13.489> up<00:02:13.700> in

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
you're pregnant your baby sits up in

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.720 
you're pregnant your baby sits up in
here<00:02:14.209> in<00:02:14.480> your<00:02:14.720> uterus<00:02:15.019> your<00:02:15.980> cervix<00:02:16.580> is

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
here in your uterus your cervix is

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.910 
here in your uterus your cervix is
basically<00:02:17.269> what<00:02:17.599> blocks<00:02:17.959> anything<00:02:18.620> from

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
basically what blocks anything from
