retractable cable which can extend to 70
70<00:01:39.930> 70<00:01:40.850> centimeters<00:01:41.850> sorry<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.299> then

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
70 70 centimeters sorry and then

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.960 
70 70 centimeters sorry and then
obviously<00:01:42.899> retracts<00:01:43.470> back<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:44.220> inside<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
obviously retracts back now inside the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.340 
obviously retracts back now inside the
cable<00:01:45.450> you've<00:01:45.600> got<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> spring-loaded

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
cable you've got a spring-loaded

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.560 
cable you've got a spring-loaded
mechanism<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.970> just<00:01:48.000> pull<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.390> out

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
mechanism so if I just pull it out

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.569 
mechanism so if I just pull it out
you'll<00:01:49.020> hear<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> click<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.829> then<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.430> means

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you'll hear a click and then that means

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.960 
you'll hear a click and then that means
your<00:01:50.850> cable<00:01:51.210> will<00:01:51.360> stay<00:01:51.689> loose<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.759> just
