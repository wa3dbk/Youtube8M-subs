00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.780 
you know and so the best thing I can do
is<00:04:23.229> sort<00:04:23.500> of<00:04:23.590> stay<00:04:23.770> out<00:04:23.890> of<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.070> way<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:24.520> I

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
is sort of stay out of the way and I

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.340 
is sort of stay out of the way and I
feel<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.060> same<00:04:25.210> way<00:04:25.330> about<00:04:25.419> lock<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:25.930> key<00:04:26.110> I

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
feel the same way about lock and key I

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.780 
feel the same way about lock and key I
think<00:04:26.800> it's<00:04:26.919> tremendous

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
think it's tremendous

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.940 
think it's tremendous
lock<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.240> key<00:04:28.360> was<00:04:28.540> optioned<00:04:28.930> for<00:04:28.960> film<00:04:29.110> and<00:04:29.560> I

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
lock and key was optioned for film and I

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.170 
lock and key was optioned for film and I
think<00:04:30.100> if<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:30.310> is<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.430> film<00:04:30.700> if<00:04:30.790> they<00:04:30.880> decide<00:04:31.150> to

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
think if it is a film if they decide to

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.760 
think if it is a film if they decide to
make<00:04:31.360> a<00:04:31.420> franchise<00:04:31.930> out<00:04:32.200> of<00:04:32.320> it<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:32.470> there's
