and<00:00:30.280> is<00:00:31.200> we<00:00:32.200> have<00:00:32.500> phasing<00:00:33.130> teleport<00:00:33.640> right

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
and is we have phasing teleport right

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.300 
and is we have phasing teleport right
now<00:00:34.210> we<00:00:34.690> have<00:00:35.490> live<00:00:36.490> wire<00:00:36.970> has<00:00:37.540> the<00:00:38.320> phasing

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
now we have live wire has the phasing

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.210 
now we have live wire has the phasing
teleport<00:00:40.000> ability<00:00:40.470> give<00:00:41.470> this<00:00:41.680> character<00:00:42.190> a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
teleport ability give this character a

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.610 
teleport ability give this character a
move<00:00:42.550> action<00:00:42.850> and<00:00:43.300> move<00:00:43.510> it<00:00:43.720> up<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:43.990> its<00:00:44.290> speed

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
move action and move it up to its speed

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.770 
move action and move it up to its speed
value<00:00:44.890> with<00:00:45.550> ignores<00:00:45.910> the<00:00:46.090> effects<00:00:46.660> of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
value with ignores the effects of

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.520 
value with ignores the effects of
characters<00:00:47.770> and<00:00:48.010> terrain<00:00:48.370> on<00:00:48.579> movement

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
characters and terrain on movement

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.130 
characters and terrain on movement
livewire<00:00:50.530> could<00:00:50.980> in<00:00:51.100> fact<00:00:51.310> break<00:00:51.910> away<00:00:52.120> from<00:00:53.110> a

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
livewire could in fact break away from a

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.560 
livewire could in fact break away from a
bomb<00:00:53.440> me<00:00:53.620> from<00:00:54.100> abomination<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.030> move<00:00:55.270> up<00:00:55.420> to

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
bomb me from abomination and move up to

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.170 
bomb me from abomination and move up to
ten<00:00:55.780> squares<00:00:56.110> in<00:00:56.350> any<00:00:56.500> direction<00:00:57.180> ignoring

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
ten squares in any direction ignoring

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.470 
ten squares in any direction ignoring
blocking<00:00:59.079> terrain<00:00:59.440> ignoring<00:01:00.210> elevated<00:01:01.210> train

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
blocking terrain ignoring elevated train

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.369 
blocking terrain ignoring elevated train
so<00:01:02.140> she<00:01:02.260> could<00:01:02.620> in<00:01:02.739> fact<00:01:03.749> phase<00:01:04.749> teleport

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
so she could in fact phase teleport

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.440 
so she could in fact phase teleport
right<00:01:05.560> there<00:01:05.829> and<00:01:06.639> not<00:01:06.789> worry<00:01:07.060> about<00:01:07.149> the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
right there and not worry about the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.230 
right there and not worry about the
ladder<00:01:07.689> she<00:01:08.079> could<00:01:08.259> move<00:01:08.439> behind<00:01:08.770> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
ladder she could move behind the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.289 
ladder she could move behind the
blocking<00:01:10.240> terrain<00:01:11.369> phasing<00:01:12.369> and<00:01:12.579> teleport<00:01:13.179> is

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
blocking terrain phasing and teleport is

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.559 
blocking terrain phasing and teleport is
nice<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.990> have<00:01:14.170> you<00:01:14.350> can<00:01:14.469> move<00:01:14.590> through<00:01:14.829> walls

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:15.569 
nice to have you can move through walls

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:18.539 
nice to have you can move through walls

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
kind of phase and yeah micro the good

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.989 
kind of phase and yeah micro the good
example<00:01:22.719> of<00:01:22.749> this<00:01:22.990> yes<00:01:23.649> well<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.700> attack

a range combat action half its range
value<00:01:33.609> until<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:34.299> action<00:01:34.659> has<00:01:34.779> been<00:01:34.959> resolved

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
value until the action has been resolved

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:38.309 
value until the action has been resolved
and<00:01:36.159> we'll<00:01:36.279> stop<00:01:36.490> right<00:01:36.700> there<00:01:36.880> right<00:01:37.119> now<00:01:37.359> the

characters<00:03:18.320> I<00:03:18.470> think<00:03:18.680> that's<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:18.980> change

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
characters I think that's a change

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.340

recently<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:20.180> can<00:03:20.360> pulse<00:03:20.540> wave<00:03:20.810> when<00:03:21.110> base

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
recently you can pulse wave when base

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.670 
recently you can pulse wave when base
yeah<00:03:21.890> before<00:03:22.520> you<00:03:22.910> had<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.480> be<00:03:23.660> away<00:03:24.230> from<00:03:24.290> some

yeah before you had to be away from some

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.460 
yeah before you had to be away from some

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
women compare the attack total to the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.290 
women compare the attack total to the
defense<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:28.010> all<00:03:28.280> other<00:03:28.640> characters<00:03:29.150> with

and I of yr 16 Wonder Woman in mira both

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.250 
and I of yr 16 Wonder Woman in mira both
have<00:04:12.470> with<00:04:12.680> even<00:04:13.370> higher<00:04:13.580> than<00:04:13.750> 16<00:04:14.750> so<00:04:15.080> they

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
have with even higher than 16 so they

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.930 
have with even higher than 16 so they
wouldn't<00:04:15.500> take<00:04:15.709> damage<00:04:15.980> so<00:04:16.250> pulse<00:04:16.489> wave<00:04:16.700> is

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
wouldn't take damage so pulse wave is

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.539 
wouldn't take damage so pulse wave is
