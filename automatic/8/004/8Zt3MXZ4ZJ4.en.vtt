00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.589 
took these cards that were in the pad
here<00:03:00.340> that's<00:03:01.120> upside<00:03:01.540> down<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:04.239> cut<00:03:04.480> the

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
here that's upside down and I cut the

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.100 
here that's upside down and I cut the
tops<00:03:04.840> off<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.220> they<00:03:06.430> were<00:03:06.489> like<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.720> and

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
tops off so that they were like that and

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.170 
tops off so that they were like that and
I<00:03:08.950> just<00:03:09.010> realized<00:03:09.489> that<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:09.700> meant<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:09.970> punch

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
I just realized that I meant to punch

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.809 
I just realized that I meant to punch
holes<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.720> put<00:03:11.500> some<00:03:11.739> ridden<00:03:12.099> some<00:03:12.430> narrow

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819

holes and put some ridden some narrow
ribbon<00:03:13.060> in<00:03:13.299> there<00:03:13.420> but<00:03:13.599> I<00:03:13.630> didn't<00:03:14.319> do<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:15.390> so

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
ribbon in there but I didn't do that so

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.900 
ribbon in there but I didn't do that so
