aircraft which means it's a very very

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.790 
aircraft which means it's a very very
good<00:03:36.959> flying<00:03:37.350> machine<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:39.440> one<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.590> this

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
good flying machine so one of this

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.460 
good flying machine so one of this
aircraft<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.820> yeah<00:03:42.420> yeah<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.959> pain<00:03:43.170> is<00:03:43.320> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
aircraft and yeah yeah the pain is the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.500 
aircraft and yeah yeah the pain is the
same<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:44.190> already<00:03:44.489> can<00:03:44.730> tell<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:45.090> which<00:03:45.270> one

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
same so I already can tell you which one

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.700 
same so I already can tell you which one
one<00:03:46.020> of<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.290> two<00:03:46.320> aircraft<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:47.100> equipped<00:03:47.310> with

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
one of the two aircraft is equipped with

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.450 
one of the two aircraft is equipped with
it's<00:03:49.710> a<00:03:50.160> few<00:03:50.670> hammer<00:03:51.000> 19<00:03:51.510> times<00:03:52.470> 3d<00:03:53.070> aircraft

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
it's a few hammer 19 times 3d aircraft

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.970 
it's a few hammer 19 times 3d aircraft
which<00:03:53.730> makes<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.240> I<00:03:57.110> just<00:03:58.110> learned<00:03:58.380> the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
which makes it I just learned the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.710 
which makes it I just learned the
aircraft<00:03:59.430> through<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.640> lights<00:03:59.850> on<00:04:00.150> basic

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
aircraft through the lights on basic

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.270 
aircraft through the lights on basic
script<00:04:00.960> for<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.170> two<00:04:01.320> engines<00:04:01.740> so<00:04:03.860> 90<00:04:04.860> engines

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
script for the two engines so 90 engines

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.780 
script for the two engines so 90 engines
which<00:04:06.270> makes<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.750> very<00:04:06.870> very<00:04:07.140> screen<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:08.100> the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
which makes it very very screen and the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.060 
which makes it very very screen and the
other<00:04:08.910> aircraft<00:04:09.120> that's<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.840> one<00:04:10.020> Martin<00:04:10.860> is

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
other aircraft that's the one Martin is

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.340 
other aircraft that's the one Martin is
flying<00:04:11.340> it's<00:04:11.940> just<00:04:12.300> included<00:04:12.990> with<00:04:13.140> one

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
flying it's just included with one

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.620 
flying it's just included with one
engine<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:13.890> if<00:04:13.980> Mark<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:14.340> using<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.850> 180<00:04:15.180> engine

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
engine so if Mark is using a 180 engine

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.340 
engine so if Mark is using a 180 engine
and<00:04:16.440> now<00:04:16.830> you<00:04:17.190> have<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.610> choice<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.780> put<00:04:19.200> the

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
and now you have the choice to put the

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.900 
and now you have the choice to put the
engine<00:04:19.500> somewhere<00:04:20.220> in<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.430> center<00:04:20.700> section

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
engine somewhere in the center section

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.120 
engine somewhere in the center section
of<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.270> fuselage<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:22.230> use<00:04:22.380> one<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:22.950> these

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
of the fuselage and use one of these

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.540 
of the fuselage and use one of these
very<00:04:23.460> very<00:04:23.790> expensive<00:04:24.180> for<00:04:24.660> whites<00:04:25.380> use<00:04:25.830> si

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
very very expensive for whites use si

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:34.280 
very very expensive for whites use si
exhausted<00:04:31.640> under<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.730> two<00:04:32.910> engines<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:33.450> the

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
exhausted under the two engines and the

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.320 
exhausted under the two engines and the
excess<00:04:34.710> flying<00:04:34.980> a<00:04:35.130> bit<00:04:35.310> higher<00:04:35.550> now<00:04:35.700> going<00:04:36.180> to

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
excess flying a bit higher now going to

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330 
excess flying a bit higher now going to
the<00:04:36.360> left<00:04:36.600> term<00:04:36.840> its<00:04:37.350> mark<00:04:37.650> ended<00:04:37.980> on<00:04:38.130> one

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
the left term its mark ended on one

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.760 
the left term its mark ended on one
engine<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:39.180> I<00:04:39.210> talked<00:04:39.540> to<00:04:39.570> mark<00:04:40.080> this<00:04:40.320> morning

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
engine so I talked to mark this morning

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.630 
engine so I talked to mark this morning
instead<00:04:41.370> of<00:04:41.580> using<00:04:41.820> this<00:04:42.090> expensive<00:04:43.050> Q<00:04:43.640> which

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
instead of using this expensive Q which

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.490 
instead of using this expensive Q which
sometimes<00:04:45.090> produces<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.660> strange<00:04:46.020> sound<00:04:46.290> on

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
sometimes produces a strange sound on

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.680 
sometimes produces a strange sound on
the<00:04:46.620> engine<00:04:46.950> mark<00:04:47.460> just<00:04:47.700> mounted<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.390> engine

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
the engine mark just mounted the engine

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.210 
the engine mark just mounted the engine
on<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.020> left<00:04:49.200> side<00:04:49.440> of<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.740> fuselage

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
on the left side of the fuselage

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.090 
on the left side of the fuselage
actually<00:04:51.020> he's<00:04:52.020> using<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.500> very<00:04:52.650> very<00:04:52.860> short

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
actually he's using a very very short

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.430 
actually he's using a very very short
type<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:53.730> he's<00:04:54.180> standing<00:04:54.360> air<00:04:54.780> from<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.260> left

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
type so he's standing air from the left

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.370 
type so he's standing air from the left
side<00:04:55.740> of<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.130> intake<00:04:56.520> is<00:04:57.030> exhausting<00:04:58.020> on<00:04:58.170> the

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
side of the intake is exhausting on the

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.050 
side of the intake is exhausting on the
left<00:04:58.560> side<00:04:58.800> of<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.130> exhaust<00:04:59.370> system<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.940> the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
left side of the exhaust system of the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.500 
left side of the exhaust system of the
full-size<00:05:00.450> and<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:01.800> angle<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.640> the<00:05:02.820> turbine

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
full-size and the angle of the turbine

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.960 
full-size and the angle of the turbine
is<00:05:03.720> just<00:05:04.020> a<00:05:04.110> couple<00:05:04.410> of<00:05:04.590> degrees<00:05:04.830> offsets<00:05:05.700> so

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
is just a couple of degrees offsets so

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.530 
is just a couple of degrees offsets so
it<00:05:06.060> compensates<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:07.890> slide<00:05:08.460> isometric<00:05:09.210> fast

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
it compensates the slide isometric fast

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.280 
it compensates the slide isometric fast
and<00:05:09.810> here<00:05:10.260> to<00:05:10.440> talk<00:05:10.680> me<00:05:11.060> except<00:05:12.060> if<00:05:12.330> you<00:05:12.990> fly

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
and here to talk me except if you fly

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.650 
and here to talk me except if you fly
extremely<00:05:14.190> low<00:05:14.400> and<00:05:14.430> adding<00:05:14.970> all<00:05:15.180> of<00:05:15.300> a<00:05:15.360> sudden
