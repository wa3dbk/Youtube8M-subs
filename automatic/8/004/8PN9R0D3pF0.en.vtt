00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.060
 Hi, I'm Tony Northrop and Chapter 4 of my amazing photography book, 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.490
 My daughter, Chelsea and me 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.860
 Get out in the baseball diamond to prove why you are 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.190
 You should learn how to use the back button focus. Focus back button is the method you 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.429
 Turn off the camera from auto focus when you push this shutter button 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:19.109
 Midway 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.669
 Usually you press the shutter button halfway, and auto focus of the camera then when focusing 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.800
 You pay all the way to take a picture. This is awfully comfortable 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.679
 Especially if you do not know how to use the camera. 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.730
 But if you separate the focus 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.180
 And capture the picture, it opens up a whole new world of possibilities 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.070
 Allows you to take pictures a lot 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.520
 Quickly. One of the best examples of when to use this 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.420
 Is sports photography. But also useful to 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.340
 Photography, Nightlife, Weddings 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.329
 Frank shots. Just about anything you may play, the Back button 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.329
 Focus can make it better. So first I'm gonna show you just how much better 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.609
 By taking a few screenshots of my daughter here. right Now, 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.730
 It's beating and when it's at the plate house I would use the Recombus focus so I can 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.810
 Place the herverite on the edge of the frame and use that base of space to leave plenty of room in 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.390
 In front of her, see her. 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.140
 But when you land in the baseline, the auto camera focus system needs everything 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.130
 The help you can get to keep up with them. And therefore, 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.790
 In other words when it's beating, I want to use one focus, 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.170
 Known as a single shot for Canon cameras or AF-S just for anything else. 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.030
 And then when I'm running I want to use constant focus, AVC 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.100
 Or complications of Amnesty International only 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.570
 On Canon cameras. It will be a little hard 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.530
 To switch modes while I try to take pictures for 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.680
 I do not know when she'll hit the ball, right, but once she does not have 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.360
 To switch modes you can take a bit. 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.540
 So I will show taking pictures without 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.140
 Using the focus again button first. 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.580
 Nice one, mad. So there you can see, I 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.110
 I managed to shift from one focused focus to a continuous couple 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.470
 Screenshots before I got the 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.620
 The first rule, but I also really practiced with the camera. 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.800
 If you are not very good at switching modes it will take you longer. 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.790
 But with the focus back button I will not have to switch modes cause I will leave my 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.780
 The camera is in constant focus 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.440
 When I want to do the recompos focus I just press down 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.819
 Button F-Un or whatever but I have dedicated to use the Focus button again 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.540
 I will keep it until I focus on it on the hill and I can re-recommend 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.920
 Do not worry about refocusing your camera. Then when I start running I just hold it 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.580
 Down and keep the focus point on her. 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.319
 Because it is already in a constant focus mode, there is no need to change the situation. 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.399
 So let's see how many shots I get to use focus back button. 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.600
 Great amazing. 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.540
 So you can see there was almost no delay there. All I had to do was 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.219
 Place the focus point on it and press and hold this button again for focus. It took me 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:09.260
 Less than a second 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.560
 Which gave me 10 times more clips 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.859
 From falling in the baseline. So now that you've sold out on your utility 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.329
 Focus on the back button, how do you actually get it set up? Unfortunately it is 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:20.959
 Different for 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.680
 Every single camera. All I can do is to tell you to search 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.099
 For the camera number model and the phrase "back button 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.639
 Focus "in Google for example, so you might say" Canon 70D back button " 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.790
 You will find someone who has nice delivery instructions for you. generally, 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.450
 It can be a one-step process or a multi-step process. Usually you have to find 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.530
 Set in the camera that stops 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.220
 Auto focus when you press the shutter button halfway down. Then if the camera 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.430
 It does not have a dedicated AF-ON button, 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.959
 You need to set auto focus on one of the buttons on the back 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.689
 From the camera. These steps are enough to allow anyone to use it 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:01.639
 Back button autofocus. It will take some practice though. 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.489
 You will need to use it for a few days until the muscle kicks in 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.010
 Learn to focus automatically with this button again. 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.389
 Until you reach this point, you may miss a few shots, so I encourage you to set it up 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.180
 Then practice practice practice. If you ever need to switch back 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.260
 To your traditional focus system, just put that camera in more green mode or 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.550
 The mode is fully automatic and usually the camera will override all of your 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.370
 The current settings. 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.380
