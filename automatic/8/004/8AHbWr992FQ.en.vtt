00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.450
 bench press excellent basic exercise 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.850
 defining basic strength requirements 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.150
 muscles of the shoulder girdle front and middle 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.400
 a bunch of deltas and further triceps besides 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.630
 this athlete must possess sufficient 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.310
 leg muscle tone 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.450
 back and press have good coordination 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.370
 originally press was used 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.610
 weightlifting competitions 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.200
 there we laid the main points 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.809
 associated with the technique of this 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.850
 Exercises in this video will be 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.409
 talked about the correct bench press technique 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.409
 standing in strength training 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.370
 pre-start position athlete 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.070
 is in front of the bar which 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.559
 located on racks the athlete performs 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.559
 uniform gripping neck you put the barbell 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.120
 on the basis of the neck as high as possible 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.460
 simultaneously carried la 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.189
 type barbell so that you can 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.369
 carry it off with racks having 

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:06.200
 completely relaxed arms as a rule 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.720
 optimal grip is selected on the basis of 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.590
 streamers for chat summer and its strengths and 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.049
 weaknesses 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.720
 many experts agree 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.009
 that the most correct grip is grip 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.009
 slightly wider than shoulder width 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.810
 many are located directly under 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.670
 bar so that the projection of the rod 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.340
 passed through the middle of the foot 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.280
 I will remove the bar by 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.470
 leg effort while back vertically and 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.450
 tensely bent rod 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.860
 located at the base of the neck 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.689
 athlete's arms are completely relaxed and 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.200
 waste is performed economically in two or three 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.450
 steps 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.539
 setting legs wide enough 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.929
 wearing shoulders or slightly wider after which 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.420
 the athlete takes the starting position 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.310
 knees straight or slightly bent shoulders and 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.390
 chest chin forward 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.550
 raised arms still relaxed 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.490
 athlete's torso slightly back of the hearth 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.979
 account of a slight backbeat 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.349
 starting the exercise athlete 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.649
 sends the barbell vertically up behind 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.720
 score 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.599
 vigorous stretching of hands in elbows 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.310
 and the shoulder joints may be 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.380
 some additional deviation 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.500
 torso back on a minor 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.410
 head distance in a natural way 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.849
 deviates somewhat backwards 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.190
 you must try to perform the starting 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.040
 movements with relaxed rub performing 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.500
 a powerful blow to the post legs without 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.720
 involved movement exercise 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.080
 stabilizing functions together with 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.730
 back muscles and abdominals in the starting 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.580
 poster of the bar to try to keep 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.400
 moving vertically up without deflecting 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.560
 vulture unnecessarily from the vertical line after 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.600
 passing the headline task 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.940
 athletes coordinate and lead 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.489
 torso under the bar to projection neck 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.830
 passed through the head and shoulders 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.660
 joints athlete 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.030
 thus pushing the barbell top 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.970
 point is carried out in a single plane 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.819
 with the torso bar while continuing 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.530
 its movement vertically up after 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.230
 straightening elbows performed 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.840
 fixing shells then running it 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.790
 lowering the chest summarize 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.910
 said and highlight the main provisions 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:24.170
 correct technology is already a hundred and first 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.150
 the movement is carried out without the help of the legs 2 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.970
 and in the initial position the bar is 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.220
 on the chest and on the base of the neck of the arm 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.799
 relaxed third 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.049
 of course the position of the barbell over your head and 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.470
 forms a single vertical with the body 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.769
 athlete thank you for your attention and to new 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.769
 meeting
