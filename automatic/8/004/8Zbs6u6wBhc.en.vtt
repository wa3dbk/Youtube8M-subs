just<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.520> use<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.119> little<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.689> well

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
just go in and use a little one as well

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.410 
just go in and use a little one as well
so<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.830> did<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.250> all<00:01:17.549> around<00:01:17.759> my<00:01:17.970> hair<00:01:18.210> as

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
so I just did this all around my hair as

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.469 
so I just did this all around my hair as
you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.780> say<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:20.610> easy<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.270> I'm

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you can say it is so so easy and I'm

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.390 
you can say it is so so easy and I'm
gonna<00:01:21.630> go<00:01:21.810> down<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.200> bottom<00:01:22.380> base<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.950> used

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
gonna go down to the bottom base I used

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.490 
gonna go down to the bottom base I used
big<00:01:23.850> ones<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.570> curls<00:01:24.780> would<00:01:24.930> configure<00:01:25.200> at

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
big ones so the curls would configure at

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.170 
big ones so the curls would configure at
the<00:01:25.619> bottom<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.790> give<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the bottom and I think it give it a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.120 
the bottom and I think it give it a
really<00:01:27.360> nice<00:01:27.570> effect<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.710> after<00:01:28.860> you're

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
really nice effect so after you're

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.670 
really nice effect so after you're
finished<00:01:29.159> you've<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:29.939> gotta<00:01:30.450> wait<00:01:30.750> 20

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
finished you've just gotta wait 20

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.210 
finished you've just gotta wait 20
minutes<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:33.360> after<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.920> just

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
minutes and then after that you can just

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.399 
minutes and then after that you can just
take<00:01:35.490> them<00:01:35.670> out<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.630> two<00:01:36.750> big<00:01:37.049> easy<00:01:37.229> to

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
