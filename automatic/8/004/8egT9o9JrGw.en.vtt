00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
student is exiting the aircraft so it

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.609 
student is exiting the aircraft so it
makes<00:01:04.059> it<00:01:04.210> easy<00:01:04.420> for<00:01:04.540> me<00:01:04.750> to<00:01:04.780> edit<00:01:04.989> just<00:01:05.409> drop

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
makes it easy for me to edit just drop

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.649 
makes it easy for me to edit just drop
the<00:01:05.770> video<00:01:06.010> files<00:01:06.340> in<00:01:06.640> make<00:01:07.330> some<00:01:07.510> minor

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
the video files in make some minor

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.080 
the video files in make some minor
tweaks<00:01:07.960> on<00:01:08.320> those<00:01:08.500> files<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:09.130> then<00:01:09.460> drop<00:01:09.880> the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
tweaks on those files and then drop the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.149

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
songs in in specific places so I don't

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.800 
songs in in specific places so I don't
have<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.399> guess<00:01:12.609> I<00:01:12.820> really<00:01:13.270> don't<00:01:13.479> even<00:01:13.689> have

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
have to guess I really don't even have

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.690 
have to guess I really don't even have
to<00:01:13.930> listen<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.409> audio<00:01:14.710> I<00:01:14.950> just<00:01:15.430> dropped

to listen to the audio I just dropped
those<00:01:15.850> files<00:01:16.149> in<00:01:16.420> where<00:01:16.689> I<00:01:16.719> know<00:01:16.869> they<00:01:17.140> go

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
those files in where I know they go

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.060 
those files in where I know they go
here's<00:01:18.729> an<00:01:18.880> example<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.899> specific<00:01:20.140> order<00:01:20.829> of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
here's an example of a specific order of

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.859 
here's an example of a specific order of
scenes<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.609> we<00:01:21.759> use<00:01:22.000> at<00:01:22.210> our<00:01:22.240> local<00:01:22.570> drop

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
scenes that we use at our local drop

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.889 
scenes that we use at our local drop
zone<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:24.070> helps<00:01:24.429> that<00:01:24.490> all<00:01:24.820> skydivers<00:01:25.509> all<00:01:25.750> of

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
zone it helps that all skydivers all of

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.690 
zone it helps that all skydivers all of
the<00:01:25.990> videographers<00:01:26.590> on<00:01:26.799> our<00:01:26.920> drop<00:01:27.130> zone<00:01:27.369> use

the videographers on our drop zone use

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.730 
the videographers on our drop zone use
this<00:01:27.939> same<00:01:28.210> order<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:28.810> makes<00:01:29.350> it<00:01:29.469> easy<00:01:29.619> for

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
this same order that makes it easy for

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.560 
this same order that makes it easy for
the<00:01:30.039> one<00:01:30.219> editor<00:01:30.609> because<00:01:30.909> you<00:01:31.030> can<00:01:31.060> edit<00:01:31.390> them
