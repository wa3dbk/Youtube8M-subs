00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.629
 I hope you on the farm anyway 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.290
 I never read to increase this 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.639
 new video 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.530
 so we are all once again 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.880
 for a little tutorial on call of duty 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.980
 ghost honestly I really hope 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.049
 that you will like I saw none on 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.400
 youtube tutorials like the one I 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.930
 will introduce you in this video 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.039
 and so here is right away the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.720
 gaffes I ask you a product a little 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.810
 little video today it's a tutorial 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.279
 quite special a tutorial that's going 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.660
 arrange a lot of people on 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.150
 prologis his kids since 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.329
 it's a game where you die very very fast 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.930
 and the knowledge of spin is so 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.370
 imperative that is to say that it is necessary 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.730
 know all the sprints on each 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.410
 map 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.210
 and I give you a little advice 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.410
 that I'm doing that I used that is very 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.050
 effective to know them 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.129
 so first of all you get into the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.980
 menus play online 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.239
 in the mode by private party me I 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.399
 advise you to do that with two 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.840
 pals confesses to be maximum three by that 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.100
 to get to know the spots 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.420
 so after that it's pretty simple guys 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.640
 you have in the configuration of the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.039
 part you choose the map where you 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.030
 you want to forgive to know the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.100
 costs so I will choose at random 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.899
 hospital but I particularly appreciate 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.670
 after in the game mode you 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.170
 obviously choose the mode in 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.869
 which one you want to know the elbows 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.770
 I took domination 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.140
 after that it's in the options so there 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.790
 it's pretty interesting damage at the level 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.170
 options of the party so there you 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.490
 give me time I do not have the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.740
 point it's up to you to see also 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.360
 finally the option forgiveness points played so 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.820
 there we do not touch and it is optional 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.229
 equipped with it will be quite interesting that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.150
 is going to be in the radar always with tish 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.350
 lake simply have to activate it here 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.600
 like the up 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.030
 so why who radars simply 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.079
 because when are you going to do when 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.540
 you're going to play your party that's at 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.430
 to say that your enemies are indicated 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.140
 now all the part of your 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.110
 radar angos and microstation for those 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.220
 who do not know and so that's it 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.020
 game options after it seems to me that 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.189
 do not touch it default settings no 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.549
 more and so here 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.689
 then we come back to the reception for 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.549
 start the game 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.590
 there I advise you to put if you 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.240
 are all alone of boots finally confesses of 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.100
 allied boots that will be with you more 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.780
 early to extend united cuba when you will be 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.579
 solo on the map the spins sound pretty 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.469
 vast usually when you add 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.149
 two people with you spins are 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.390
 in quotation marks a little bit more 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.340
 stable 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.890
 so that's the difficulty we have it 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.600
 boots in rookie is there is enough 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.970
 interesting is that we must put 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.470
 sibot enemy that is to say that I you 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.060
 explain how that's going and so 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.180
 you will play your party with your 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.650
 two battles and where your two mates 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.660
 against six and a half pals as there will be 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.400
 the microstation finally as there will be 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.780
 rather the radar still active and well 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.000
 as soon as you go kill an enemy you 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.650
 you will have to concentrate 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.510
 on the enemy and on his respawn especially 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.610
 and little by little you will see that 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.870
 will become a reflex as soon as you have 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.319
 killed someone you'll see where they 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.000
 respawn 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.320
 when you go jean private party and 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.709
 it's going to become a habit and you're going 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.380
 begin memorizing where it respawn 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.269
 so in multiplayer the reflexes have 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.280
 started coming you will learn 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.580
 little by little, little by little 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.450
 not come the first time to know 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.010
 the risks are many there for those 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.550
 who kill everything I hope he will have you 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.470
 pleases 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.090
 do not hesitate to do all the maps 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.150
 I took octane to an example 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.320
 I recommend maps like for example 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.700
 stone havana the map he had taken 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.440
 just before jarkko is here 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.690
 seven my place is a very very brand 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.190
 interesting and very interesting forgiveness 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.480
 and so that's so I hope this little 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.519
 tutorial will have made you happy 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.110
 not to let go of a maximum of like to the 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.760
 video if you liked it do not hesitate
