00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
would that marinate we're going to pour

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.509 
would that marinate we're going to pour
over<00:02:18.629> in<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.050> minute

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
over in a minute

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.100 
over in a minute
smelling<00:02:20.519> good<00:02:20.640> already<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.480> garlic<00:02:21.930> and
