 houses 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.620
 before you start to make a roast you choose to grill and you passed a 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.620
 little oil 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.390
 to start the fire they light up narrates smaller ones to then place over 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.359
 the pieces of firewood 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.729
 Then you must wait until the embers turn reddish 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.399
 usually a roast begins with widths like kidneys and chinchulines 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.399
 sweetbread 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.650
 It is also commented that a blood sausage was originated before passing to the cuts of 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.650
 meat 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.880
 the most usual cuts are to see 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.760
 strange roasting top and the inevitable ribs 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.900
 Many people also consume pork cuts and chicken chivito 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.920
 the meat is prepared by removing the thickest pieces of fat and 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.920
 salanueva to taste 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.970
 the roast strip is put with turned rib eye ice cream 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.970
 principle that applies to all cuts 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.720
 the thinner cuts like the matambre should be exposed to heat by the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.720
 side of its shell 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.660
 the cooking of the meat must be controlled regularly by moving the cuts 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.320
 on the grill as they need more or less exposure to embers
