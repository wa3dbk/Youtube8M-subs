here and that's pretty dark in here
I<00:04:33.620> just<00:04:33.919> run<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.220> BRS<00:04:34.669> reactors<00:04:35.530> usually<00:04:36.530> I

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
I just run the BRS reactors usually I

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.740 
I just run the BRS reactors usually I
have<00:04:37.010> GFL<00:04:37.610> in<00:04:37.790> there<00:04:37.970> with<00:04:38.120> some<00:04:38.240> carbon<00:04:38.660> only

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
have GFL in there with some carbon only

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.740 
have GFL in there with some carbon only
run<00:04:39.050> them<00:04:39.200> about<00:04:39.889> three<00:04:40.100> days<00:04:40.250> a<00:04:40.280> week<00:04:40.570> at<00:04:41.570> the

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
run them about three days a week at the

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.580 
run them about three days a week at the
bubble<00:04:42.050> maggot<00:04:42.440> smack<00:04:42.830> 9<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.930> I<00:04:45.200> just<00:04:45.380> picked

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
bubble maggot smack 9 and I just picked

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.150 
bubble maggot smack 9 and I just picked
up<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.830> pretty<00:04:46.070> sweet<00:04:46.990> auto<00:04:47.990> top<00:04:48.440> off<00:04:48.650> container

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
up a pretty sweet auto top off container

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.909 
up a pretty sweet auto top off container
so<00:04:49.460> you<00:04:49.550> think<00:04:49.729> of<00:04:49.820> some<00:04:49.940> light<00:04:50.710> it's<00:04:51.710> a<00:04:51.740> little

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
so you think of some light it's a little

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.000 
so you think of some light it's a little
hard<00:04:52.070> to<00:04:52.190> see<00:04:52.780> it's<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:53.840> 10<00:04:54.080> gallon<00:04:54.289> auto<00:04:54.680> top

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
hard to see it's a 10 gallon auto top

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.600 
hard to see it's a 10 gallon auto top
off<00:04:55.190> container<00:04:55.669> had<00:04:55.940> custom<00:04:56.360> made<00:04:57.340> other<00:04:58.340> than

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
off container had custom made other than

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.110 
off container had custom made other than
that<00:04:58.760> I<00:04:59.060> just<00:04:59.870> drip<00:05:00.500> it<00:05:00.680> over<00:05:01.370> a<00:05:01.400> splash<00:05:01.729> tray

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
that I just drip it over a splash tray

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.870 
that I just drip it over a splash tray
through<00:05:02.510> some<00:05:02.750> filter<00:05:03.220> over<00:05:04.220> top<00:05:04.430> some<00:05:04.669> live

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
through some filter over top some live

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.779 
through some filter over top some live
rock<00:05:05.240> into<00:05:05.630> a<00:05:05.690> refugium<00:05:06.370> then<00:05:07.370> it<00:05:07.580> gets

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
rock into a refugium then it gets

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:09.670 
rock into a refugium then it gets
skimmed<00:05:08.210> runs<00:05:08.720> through<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:08.990> reactors<00:05:09.470> and

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
skimmed runs through the reactors and

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.100 
skimmed runs through the reactors and
that's<00:05:09.800> it<00:05:13.030> but<00:05:14.030> this<00:05:14.210> is<00:05:14.389> it<00:05:14.599> running<00:05:14.930> out<00:05:15.080> of

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
that's it but this is it running out of

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.710 
that's it but this is it running out of
room<00:05:15.349> already
