00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.270
 the side 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.270
 if you need the system 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.219
 No, I'm not going to tell you guys today about what we 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.810
 Yes, you can. 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.009
 the cover of the as it indicates the people 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.919
 how do you think it's best 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.999
 carlos and d are the agreements in several designs in that sense lapa 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.259
 from there sun 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.749
 dismiss 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.770
 about 70% of these 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.930
 Then I'll have a chord 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.250
 and this form will serve to make other agreements 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.250
 fish day it has chords of river greater 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.480
 for that reason the death of michael 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.900
 no need to put pressure 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.740
 Why do they already have this party? 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.080
 but they went to the account 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.720
 thus 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.750
 besides having other agreements I need to move 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.560
 with this party that in the case 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.250
 It's going to happen as a hobby. 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.810
 so folks 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.440
 my biggest fine I'll do when edu 2 3 and 4 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.070
 this cd of the English league of defense 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.980
 in the initial part is a curtain 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.060
 then 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.910
 until the next a next deal that is easy 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.540
 lily 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.640
 I'm like this 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.120
 after finished 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.810
 and so on 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.210
 if I go back 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 the landmarks has been demonized 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.190
 a larger deal can only regenerate another michael color 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.780
 so if I want to draw the design from the twinning agreement 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.080
 I came back all the minor chords see the example 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.190
 I'll do it with level 3 and 4 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.300
 it gets easier 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.300
 no mello 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.170
 the partnership 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.370
 W 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.800
 partners in day and so on 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.110
 the same thing will happen with the other ten minutes 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.199
 for example this 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.419
 need a little more opening 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.360
 so what I'm going to tell you 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.739
 the simplest examples, right? 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.919
 This allows you to stay the most 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.319
 I have to talk 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.949
 this house here 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.019
 I'll stay there again. 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.999
 at this time this part 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.019
 foot in part scene 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.619
 the dvd of the river left the channel by subscription of proposals 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.169
 only sometimes even more used 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.169
 by the vast majority of people but following the same reasoning 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.169
 I have a greater consciousness for example 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:42.930
 because of the bandit's exact 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.959
 nobody to party 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.629
 and then I'm moving from the biggest 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.890
 fearless 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.529
 and so on why 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.449
 now you can have is larger for example 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.829
 enter with dedication 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.790
 I'm going to have to jump this house because when I do my faith 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.789
 in the resting place is there 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.669
 when I move 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.669
 hence the same thing happens 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.449
 francini and so on okay 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:12.899
 another example 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.969
 drawing dr now with the continental 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.709
 Christmas packages 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.649
 he does not happen by any means 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:24.639
 so when I go that way to make the other agreements 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:27.009
 I will not talk either 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.009
 an important observation that when acting with chords 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:32.069
 no injuries 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.549
 or with the fundamental disease 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.669
 when the art colleague 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.429
 fourth placed on m 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:40.430
 cut 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.839
 no need for my pressure on me on foot 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.569
 the 5th place to the sixth place 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.779
 but if you experience difficulties 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:52.089
 or find it easier to put in everything 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:54.659
 noting that the note 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.659
 but low grade on that date corp 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.279
 so it's like this 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.739
 following 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.129
 resist is less 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.999
 moore 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.319
 we know each other 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.319
 then this region has the best 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.459
 a neighbor of minerva the modern 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.729
 in time - the article also 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.729
 a form of government who 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.580
 other examples a larger cut 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.580
 brandt opposed mail 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.580
 an agreement with the 6th largest will give rise to something else the dealer 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.699
 so it will be good 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.210
 here is an agreement 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.210
 from there with the seventh largest 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.659
 if I walk 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.259
 following the same rationale 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.259
 I'll have other actors then 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:53.059
 for murder 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.419
 to sustain this so on 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:04.129
 but in this process 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.129
 I'm sorry 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.629
 after 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.300
 each year 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.610
 the rnp brandÃ£o see all these agreements are smaller because it went out of the way 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.349
 dynamic not 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.070
 So I noticed these people. 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.650
 if you are in the area 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.909
 Why does he come to help a lot? 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.330
 he gets lots of high heels 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.880
 I will exemplify that for example not only this question of the more assaults 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:34.589
 also of tinga 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:36.620
 this introduction and expenditure 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.020
 start kill but mimi may 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.389
 in this larger context 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.539
 I had the supposed new scene 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.330
 is to be able to sell because I wanted a team a little more acute 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
 Look how it turned out 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.110
 in a bit 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.240
 in the same drama 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.900
 I worked 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.919
 then, in addition to enabling 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:22.119
 to facilitate 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:25.119
 you can also explore much more works than this because 

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:27.909
 because it made good view of evidence
