this video I'm going to talk about my
first<00:00:24.390> impressions<00:00:24.900> when<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.140> think<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
first impressions when I think of the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.859 
first impressions when I think of the
game<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.010> far<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.390> time<00:00:27.660> I've<00:00:27.840> been

game so far and the time I've been
having<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:28.740> far<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:28.980> guess<00:00:29.189> well<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.240> start<00:00:30.449> off

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
having so far I guess well to start off

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.299 
having so far I guess well to start off
call<00:00:31.019> duty<00:00:31.199> ghost<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.710> definitely<00:00:32.250> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
call duty ghost is definitely a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.160 
call duty ghost is definitely a
different<00:00:32.850> Call<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> Duty<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> game<00:00:33.840> feels

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
different Call of Duty the game feels

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.479 
different Call of Duty the game feels
much<00:00:34.440> different<00:00:34.829> than<00:00:34.890> previous<00:00:35.309> Call<00:00:35.460> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
much different than previous Call of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.610 
much different than previous Call of
Duty<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:36.450> people<00:00:36.719> are<00:00:36.780> saying<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.320> feels

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.440 
Duty some people are saying it feels
pretty<00:00:37.829> similar<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> mw3<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:39.000> personally<00:00:39.390> I

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
pretty similar to mw3 but personally I

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.600 
pretty similar to mw3 but personally I
think<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.899> game<00:00:40.079> plays<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:41.040> much<00:00:41.190> different

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
think the game plays so much different

of<00:00:48.750> Duty<00:00:48.930> game<00:00:49.140> there<00:00:49.710> might<00:00:49.920> be<00:00:49.950> some<00:00:50.280> bigger

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460

this game has the biggest maps all the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.279 
this game has the biggest maps all the
maps<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.980> played<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.510> much<00:00:57.690> bigger<00:00:57.960> than

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
sure why they decided to make bigger

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.640 
sure why they decided to make bigger
Maps<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:03.359> they<00:01:03.989> don't<00:01:04.140> even<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.379> ground

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.859 
6v6 games on these large maps seem to go
extremely<00:01:17.009> slow<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.880> gameplay<00:01:18.330> seems<00:01:18.600> very

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
extremely slow the gameplay seems very

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.420 
extremely slow the gameplay seems very
slow<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.710> pretty<00:01:20.040> much<00:01:20.189> play

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
slow and you have to pretty much play

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.219 
slow and you have to pretty much play
differently<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.360> try<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.900> rush<00:01:22.080> around

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
differently if you try and rush around

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.440 
differently if you try and rush around
to<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.619> kills<00:01:22.830> quickly<00:01:23.250> you're<00:01:23.820> gonna<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.210> bad

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
to get kills quickly you're gonna do bad

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.300 
to get kills quickly you're gonna do bad
now<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> know<00:01:25.110> there's<00:01:25.409> exceptions<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.130> some

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
now I know there's exceptions and some

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.830 
now I know there's exceptions and some
players<00:01:26.610> actually<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.180> play<00:01:27.390> better<00:01:27.570> while

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
players actually do play better while

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.569 
players actually do play better while
rushing<00:01:28.290> personally<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.860> used<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.280> play<00:01:29.430> better

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
rushing personally I used to play better

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.609 
rushing personally I used to play better
while<00:01:29.850> rushing<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.869> Call<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.079> Duty<00:01:31.140> ghosts

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.920 
while rushing but in Call of Duty ghosts
that<00:01:31.890> doesn't<00:01:32.280> exactly<00:01:32.520> work<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.630> said<00:01:33.840> in

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930

also<00:01:46.680> seems<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.340> many<00:01:48.030> many<00:01:48.479> more<00:01:48.750> camping

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
also seems to be many many more camping

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.440 
also seems to be many many more camping
spots<00:01:49.680> since<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.399> maps<00:01:50.610> are<00:01:50.790> bigger<00:01:51.030> there's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
spots since the maps are bigger there's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.090 
spots since the maps are bigger there's
gonna<00:01:51.570> be<00:01:51.720> more<00:01:51.840> chem<00:01:52.079> expose<00:01:52.470> no<00:01:52.829> really

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
gonna be more chem expose no really

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.590 
gonna be more chem expose no really
stopping<00:01:53.490> them<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.090> bigger<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.420> maps

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
stopping them and the bigger the maps

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.810 
stopping them and the bigger the maps
are<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.290> more<00:01:55.530> players<00:01:56.040> tend<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.549> camp

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
are the more players tend to camp

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.370 
are the more players tend to camp
because<00:01:57.329> they're<00:01:57.570> afraid<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.899> run<00:01:58.110> out<00:01:58.229> they

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
because they're afraid to run out they

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.630 
because they're afraid to run out they
don't<00:01:58.530> know<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.710> map<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.040> wall<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.549> they

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
don't know the map that wall so they

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.609 
don't know the map that wall so they
just<00:01:59.820> post<00:02:00.149> up<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.479> send<00:02:00.719> one<00:02:00.869> spot<00:02:01.229> my

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
just post up and send one spot my

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.590 
just post up and send one spot my
recommendation<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.460> play<00:02:02.759> these<00:02:02.939> maps<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.540> to

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
recommendation to play these maps and to

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.450 
recommendation to play these maps and to
do<00:02:03.719> well<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.380> travel<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> outside<00:02:05.189> I

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
do well is to travel the outside I

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.069 
do well is to travel the outside I
always<00:02:05.759> say<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.420> tip<00:02:06.659> helps<00:02:06.930> out

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
always say this but this tip helps out

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.169 
always say this but this tip helps out
so<00:02:07.380> much<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.979> find<00:02:08.250> myself<00:02:08.369> doing<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.940> all

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
so much and I find myself doing this all

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.790 
so much and I find myself doing this all
the<00:02:09.330> time<00:02:09.569> whenever<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.080> play<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> game<00:02:10.619> where

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
the time whenever I play a game where

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.470 
the time whenever I play a game where
I'm<00:02:10.890> unfamiliar<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.580> map<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.940> travel<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
I'm unfamiliar with the map I travel the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.610 
I'm unfamiliar with the map I travel the
outsides<00:02:12.840> even

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
outsides even

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.589 
outsides even
I'm<00:02:13.830> already<00:02:14.069> familiar<00:02:14.250> with<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.940> traveled<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
I'm already familiar with I traveled the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.570 
I'm already familiar with I traveled the
outside<00:02:15.930> especially<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.890> big-match<00:02:17.310> this

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
outside especially on big-match this

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.979 
outside especially on big-match this
helps<00:02:17.879> because<00:02:18.239> if<00:02:18.540> you're<00:02:18.660> running<00:02:18.780> through

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
helps because if you're running through

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.839 
helps because if you're running through
the<00:02:19.050> middle<00:02:19.200> on<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> big<00:02:19.680> map<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.370> said<00:02:20.640> and

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
the middle on a big map like I said and

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.160 
the middle on a big map like I said and
like<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.090> guys<00:02:21.239> already<00:02:21.450> know<00:02:21.660> you'll<00:02:21.959> die

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
like you guys already know you'll die

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.630 
like you guys already know you'll die

that's how I look at it and that's how I

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.930 
that's how I look at it and that's how I
do<00:02:35.370> best

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
do best

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.089 
do best
whenever<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.480> travel<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.930> outside<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.590> do<00:02:37.680> so

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
whenever I travel the outside I do so

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.949 
whenever I travel the outside I do so
much<00:02:38.280> better<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.610> get<00:02:38.910> longer<00:02:39.150> killing<00:02:39.599> sprees

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959

I get my big kill streaks and it's so

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000 
I get my big kill streaks and it's so
much<00:02:42.180> more<00:02:42.420> rewarding<00:02:42.599> if<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.349> try<00:02:43.590> rush<00:02:43.799> in<00:02:43.920> the

much more rewarding if I try rush in the

I think they did a great job with it it

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.039 
I think they did a great job with it it

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
feels smooth it is smooth but it's just

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.180 
feels smooth it is smooth but it's just
a<00:03:01.110> lot<00:03:01.260> different<00:03:01.620> than<00:03:01.680> what<00:03:01.829> we're<00:03:01.950> used<00:03:01.980> to

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
a lot different than what we're used to

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.970 
a lot different than what we're used to
and<00:03:02.519> generally<00:03:03.120> these<00:03:03.420> changes<00:03:04.019> people<00:03:04.560> don't

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
change in Call of Duty yet change is

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.400 
change in Call of Duty yet change is
what<00:03:09.000> everyone's<00:03:09.329> asking<00:03:09.510> for<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.200> this<00:03:10.379> is

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
what everyone's asking for so this is

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.960 
what everyone's asking for so this is
what<00:03:10.590> they<00:03:10.709> brought<00:03:10.920> it's<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.370> change<00:03:11.670> game

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
what they brought it's a change game

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.460 
what they brought it's a change game
it's<00:03:12.450> different<00:03:12.750> than<00:03:12.900> all<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.170> other<00:03:13.290> Call

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
it's different than all the other Call

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.199 
it's different than all the other Call
of<00:03:13.500> Duty's<00:03:13.769> this<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.069> what<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.190> think<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.670> it

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
of Duty's this is what I think and it

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.000 
of Duty's this is what I think and it
plays<00:03:15.629> so<00:03:15.870> much<00:03:15.930> different<00:03:16.440> that's<00:03:16.860> my

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
plays so much different that's my

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.190 
plays so much different that's my
opinion<00:03:17.280> on<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.670> maps<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.660> sizes<00:03:19.049> of

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
opinion on the maps and the sizes of

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.780 
opinion on the maps and the sizes of
them<00:03:19.350> now<00:03:19.859> when<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.069> comes<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.430> weapons

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
them now when it comes to the weapons

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.370 
them now when it comes to the weapons
and<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.060> time<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.389> kill<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.870> how<00:03:21.989> powerful

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
and the time to kill and how powerful

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.410 
and the time to kill and how powerful
they<00:03:22.590> are<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.980> personally<00:03:23.639> think<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:23.970> weapons

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
they are I personally think that weapons

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.849 
they are I personally think that weapons
and<00:03:24.660> Call<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:24.870> Duty<00:03:25.079> ghosts<00:03:25.410> are<00:03:25.530> much

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
and Call of Duty ghosts are much

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.890 
and Call of Duty ghosts are much
stronger<00:03:26.459> they<00:03:26.910> seem<00:03:27.209> more<00:03:27.420> accurate<00:03:27.780> they

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
stronger they seem more accurate they

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.330 
stronger they seem more accurate they
seem<00:03:28.139> easier<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.470> use<00:03:28.650> there's<00:03:28.950> less<00:03:29.130> recoil

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
seem easier to use there's less recoil

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.370 
seem easier to use there's less recoil
they<00:03:29.790> seem<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.090> have<00:03:30.150> more<00:03:30.389> damage<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.049> they

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
they seem to have more damage and they

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.199 
they seem to have more damage and they
just<00:03:31.530> seem<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.799> kill<00:03:32.099> so<00:03:32.370> much<00:03:32.579> quicker<00:03:32.849> I

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
just seem to kill so much quicker I

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.210 
just seem to kill so much quicker I
found<00:03:33.569> myself<00:03:33.720> getting<00:03:34.079> killed<00:03:34.440> very<00:03:34.709> very

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
found myself getting killed very very

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.220 
found myself getting killed very very
quickly<00:03:35.549> without<00:03:35.970> me<00:03:36.359> able<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:36.750> do<00:03:37.019> anything

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
quickly without me able to do anything

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.759 
quickly without me able to do anything
about<00:03:37.440> it

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
about it

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.470 
about it
as<00:03:38.099> soon<00:03:38.340> as<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.519> start<00:03:38.760> getting<00:03:38.940> shot<00:03:39.180> at<00:03:39.329> I'm

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.900 
as soon as I start getting shot at I'm
dead<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.930> rarely<00:03:40.260> ever<00:03:40.440> get<00:03:41.220> away<00:03:41.370> from<00:03:41.549> being
