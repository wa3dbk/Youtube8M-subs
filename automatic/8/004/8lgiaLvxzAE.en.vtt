00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.300 

so<00:00:00.510> when<00:00:00.810> I'm<00:00:00.900> gonna<00:00:01.110> pick<00:00:01.469> eggs<00:00:01.709> up<00:00:01.949> them<00:00:02.159> up

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
so when I'm gonna pick eggs up them up

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.769 
so when I'm gonna pick eggs up them up
I'll<00:00:02.909> put<00:00:03.480> some<00:00:03.720> water<00:00:04.080> in<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.500> petri<00:00:04.770> dish<00:00:04.980> and

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
I'll put some water in a petri dish and

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.009 
I'll put some water in a petri dish and
then<00:00:06.779> I'll<00:00:06.930> add<00:00:07.560> some<00:00:07.700> drops<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:09.019> dye

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
then I'll add some drops of dye

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.020 
then I'll add some drops of dye
methylene<00:00:10.950> blue<00:00:11.179> that<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:13.490> the<00:00:14.490> growth<00:00:14.790> of

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
methylene blue that in the growth of

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.960 
methylene blue that in the growth of
fungus<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.680> water<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.010> used<00:00:17.609> natural

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
fungus in the water I used natural

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.929 
fungus in the water I used natural
aquarium<00:00:18.750> water<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:19.949> it's<00:00:20.250> biologically

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
aquarium water and so it's biologically

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.560 
aquarium water and so it's biologically
reactive<00:00:22.010> this<00:00:23.010> stuff<00:00:23.369> doesn't<00:00:23.730> seem<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.359> hurt

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
reactive this stuff doesn't seem to hurt

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:33.530 
reactive this stuff doesn't seem to hurt
fertile<00:00:25.050> eggs<00:00:27.830> well<00:00:29.269> the<00:00:30.920> growth<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.510> sand<00:00:33.510> I

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
fertile eggs well the growth of sand I

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.350 
fertile eggs well the growth of sand I
use<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> very<00:00:34.140> dilute<00:00:34.500> solution<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:36.059> base

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
use a very dilute solution the base

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.430 
use a very dilute solution the base
solution<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.110> 10<00:00:37.380> drops<00:00:38.780> per<00:00:39.780> liter<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.140> water

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
solution is 10 drops per liter of water

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.369 
solution is 10 drops per liter of water
and<00:00:41.300> then<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:43.340> had<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.550> loot<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.600> water

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and then I had to loot that in the water

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.799 
and then I had to loot that in the water
so<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.100> not<00:00:47.280> very<00:00:47.460> much<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.210> seems<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.629> do

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
so it's not very much but it seems to do

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:49.479 
so it's not very much but it seems to do
the<00:00:48.840> trick

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
the trick

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.610 
the trick
and<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.940> only<00:00:51.180> use<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:52.219> in<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.550> case<00:00:53.760> where<00:00:54.620> some

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and I only use it in the case where some

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.330 
and I only use it in the case where some
of<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.770> eggs<00:00:55.920> are<00:00:56.160> focusing<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.239> then

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.729 

there's<00:01:02.340> mop<00:01:02.760> there's<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.899> petri<00:01:04.260> dish<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
there's mop there's the petri dish and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.910 
there's mop there's the petri dish and
now<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.519> photographs<00:01:06.360> actually<00:01:06.920> getting

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
now if you photographs actually getting

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.480 
now if you photographs actually getting
some<00:01:08.100> thanks<00:01:08.990> no<00:01:09.990> let's<00:01:10.860> see<00:01:10.979> there<00:01:11.250> so

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
some thanks no let's see there so

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.910 
some thanks no let's see there so
there's<00:01:11.790> egg<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:12.689> fingertip<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.619> found

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
there's egg on my fingertip that I found

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.539 
there's egg on my fingertip that I found
them<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:15.090> here's<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.630> close-up<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.070> see

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
them up and here's a close-up so you see

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.969 
them up and here's a close-up so you see
it<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.210> my<00:01:18.750> fingertips<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.560> looks<00:01:19.770> like

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
it here and my fingertips it looks like

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.390 
it here and my fingertips it looks like
a<00:01:20.009> small<00:01:20.840> clear<00:01:21.840> sphere<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:24.200> place<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:26.009> in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
a small clear sphere and place it in in

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.649 
a small clear sphere and place it in in
the<00:01:26.700> water<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.930> petri<00:01:28.409> dish<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.210> over<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the water in petri dish and over a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.090 
the water in petri dish and over a
period<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:31.610> some<00:01:32.610> days<00:01:33.470> I'll<00:01:34.470> watch<00:01:34.890> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
period of some days I'll watch it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.300 
period of some days I'll watch it
develop<00:01:35.610> into<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> small<00:01:36.450> fish<00:01:36.950> you<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
develop into a small fish you see the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.780 
develop into a small fish you see the
dark<00:01:38.579> eyes<00:01:38.790> appear<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.369> then<00:01:41.369> it'll<00:01:41.579> hatch

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
dark eyes appear and then it'll hatch

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.789 
dark eyes appear and then it'll hatch
out<00:01:42.060> into<00:01:42.390> small<00:01:42.689> fry<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.490> at<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.729> point<00:01:45.090> I

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
out into small fry and at that point I

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.530 
out into small fry and at that point I
move<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.100> eggs<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.700> almost<00:01:47.880> impossible<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
move the eggs it's almost impossible to

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.560 
move the eggs it's almost impossible to
catch<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.930> little<00:01:49.020> fry<00:01:49.640> they're<00:01:50.640> very<00:01:50.850> fast<00:01:51.060> so

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
catch a little fry they're very fast so

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.010 
catch a little fry they're very fast so
I<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.960> move<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> eggs<00:01:53.070> into<00:01:53.729> another<00:01:54.149> dish<00:01:54.479> or

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
I I move the eggs into another dish or

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.260 
I I move the eggs into another dish or
onto<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> lid<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.920> petri<00:01:56.340> dish<00:01:56.549> with

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
onto the lid of the petri dish with

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.590 
onto the lid of the petri dish with
water<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.840> then<00:01:58.770> pour<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.369> fry<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.119> new

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
water and then pour the fry in a new

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.149 
water and then pour the fry in a new
water<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:02.420> return<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.750> eggs<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> petri

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
water and return the eggs to the petri

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.160 
water and return the eggs to the petri
dish<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:06.210> that's<00:02:06.479> my<00:02:06.659> procedure<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:09.050> when<00:02:10.050> you

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
dish so that's my procedure and when you

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.630 
dish so that's my procedure and when you
come<00:02:10.319> over<00:02:10.440> I'll<00:02:10.739> show<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.220> fish<00:02:11.400> for

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
come over I'll show you the fish for

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.030 
come over I'll show you the fish for
work<00:02:11.819> on
