00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
entirely different way if they taught us

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.780 
entirely different way if they taught us
to<00:02:48.700> be<00:02:49.030> carnivorous<00:02:49.739> through<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:51.040> belief

systems<00:02:52.299> daddy<00:02:52.720> taught<00:02:53.019> us<00:02:53.049> to<00:02:53.459> eat<00:02:54.459> meat<00:02:55.090> and

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
systems daddy taught us to eat meat and

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.320 
systems daddy taught us to eat meat and
eat<00:02:55.690> lead<00:02:56.650> flesh<00:02:57.130> uh-huh<00:02:57.610> well<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:58.030> lowers<00:02:58.299> the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
eat lead flesh uh-huh well it lowers the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.830 
eat lead flesh uh-huh well it lowers the
body's<00:02:58.690> vibration<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:01.239> lowers<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.510> body's

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
body's vibration it lowers the body's

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.680 
body's vibration it lowers the body's
vibration<00:03:02.380> so<00:03:02.739> if<00:03:03.579> our<00:03:03.700> body<00:03:03.940> vibrated<00:03:04.450> at<00:03:04.600> a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
vibration so if our body vibrated at a

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.120 
vibration so if our body vibrated at a
higher<00:03:04.840> length<00:03:05.200> we<00:03:05.440> would<00:03:05.590> spiritually<00:03:06.010> be

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
higher length we would spiritually be

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.160 
higher length we would spiritually be
evolving<00:03:06.840> regardless<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.989> what<00:03:08.140> our

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
evolving regardless of what our

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.960 
evolving regardless of what our
religions<00:03:08.650> were<00:03:08.799> teaching<00:03:09.160> us<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.640> they

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
religions were teaching us and they

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.910 
religions were teaching us and they
can't<00:03:10.209> have<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:10.600> they<00:03:11.049> can't<00:03:11.320> have<00:03:11.500> us<00:03:11.530> being

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
can't have that they can't have us being

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.190 
can't have that they can't have us being
free<00:03:12.220> they<00:03:13.060> can't<00:03:13.329> us<00:03:13.450> not<00:03:13.690> being<00:03:13.959> in<00:03:14.170> control

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
free they can't us not being in control

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.960 
free they can't us not being in control
because<00:03:14.890> then<00:03:15.190> we're<00:03:15.340> responsible<00:03:15.700> for

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
because then we're responsible for

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.300 
because then we're responsible for
ourselves<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:16.600> as<00:03:16.840> we<00:03:17.019> move<00:03:17.230> away<00:03:17.380> from<00:03:17.530> eating

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
ourselves so as we move away from eating

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.710 
ourselves so as we move away from eating
meat<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.940> more<00:03:19.329> towards<00:03:19.690> vegetarianism<00:03:21.720> we

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
meat and more towards vegetarianism we

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.410 
meat and more towards vegetarianism we
we<00:03:23.350> begin<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:24.010> raise<00:03:24.190> our<00:03:24.400> vibrational<00:03:25.060> level

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
we begin to raise our vibrational level

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.819 
we begin to raise our vibrational level
and<00:03:25.630> B<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.760> break<00:03:27.760> this<00:03:27.940> cycle<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:29.440> helps

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
and B and and break this cycle it helps

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.569 
and B and and break this cycle it helps
not<00:03:30.730> everybody<00:03:31.150> has<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.390> stop<00:03:31.750> eating<00:03:32.049> meat

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
not everybody has to stop eating meat

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.190 
not everybody has to stop eating meat
it's<00:03:33.579> not<00:03:33.760> an<00:03:33.940> absolute<00:03:34.239> requirement<00:03:34.540> it

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
it's not an absolute requirement it

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.190 
it's not an absolute requirement it
certainly<00:03:35.709> helps<00:03:36.360> but<00:03:37.360> some<00:03:37.570> people's<00:03:37.930> belief

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
certainly helps but some people's belief

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.420 
certainly helps but some people's belief
systems<00:03:38.590> will<00:03:38.709> be<00:03:38.829> that<00:03:38.980> they<00:03:39.070> just<00:03:39.280> need<00:03:39.400> a

systems will be that they just need a

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.490 
systems will be that they just need a
