00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:05.284
 Welcome to Tech a Look, I am Yao Wei. 

00:00:05.284 --> 00:00:10.662
 Today I will introduce the Padbook launched by Gigabyte, model number S1185. 

00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:15.176
 Now let's see what accessories are in the package? 

00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:21.592
 Ok, now we see what Yao Yao’s hand is going to introduce. 

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:24.176
 Padbook S1185 

00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:30.262
 And we will see a copy of the instructions and a copy of the guarantee. 

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:32.185
 There are related product CDs 

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:38.988
 And there is a keyboard for Gigabyte. 

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:44.846
 Then we can see that it will have this power cord! 

00:00:44.846 --> 00:00:50.460
 Ok, then the next thing we see is the Padbook S1185. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.258
 That Padbook, it actually is either front or back 

00:00:55.258 --> 00:00:56.840
 Each has a lens 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.155
 So you want to take a selfie or take a photo of someone else can use this lens 

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:04.075
 And we can see that there is a Window button on this side. 

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:12.132
 And this is the mouse to match the two buttons on the side to switch left and right 

00:01:12.132 --> 00:01:16.033
 Then we can see that there is a jack for headphones here. 

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:19.483
 And the USB jack also has the rotation mode turned off. 

00:01:19.483 --> 00:01:21.934
 And Power's buttons 

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:24.711
 The other side we can see 

00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:28.649
 If you want to adjust this volume, the sound is adjusted here. 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.486
 And here you can insert a SIM card and there is an SD card. 

00:01:33.486 --> 00:01:38.391
 There are also two jacks, one for VGA and one for HDMI. 

00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:42.181
 Then we can see that this is the USB3.0 jack. 

00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:45.807
 And the power jack is here 

00:01:45.807 --> 00:01:50.411
 If you want to stand up this Gigabyte Padbook 

00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:52.713
 There is a bracket at the back to stand it up 

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:55.247
 It will be very convenient at work 

00:01:55.247 --> 00:02:01.219
 Next, let's take Yao Yao to teach you how to use this Padbook. 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.087
 We now see this Padbook on the desktop that is the S1185. 

00:02:05.087 --> 00:02:08.259
 Ok, the screen size of the Padbook is 11.6吋

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.487
 Full HD IPS for this touch screen 

00:02:11.487 --> 00:02:15.849
 Ok, we just mentioned the button for this rotation mode. 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.092
 Show it to everyone 

00:02:17.092 --> 00:02:19.993
 Then we are not turning off the button for this rotation mode 

00:02:19.993 --> 00:02:23.519
 It will rotate with the rotation of our screen. 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.391
 Now we turn it off 

00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:27.101
 Ok, it will show off 

00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:29.654
 Then it won’t rotate again 

00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:31.263
 Have you seen it? 

00:02:31.263 --> 00:02:32.741
 Ok, we are opening again now. 

00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:36.770
 After turning it on, it goes back to this rotating mode. 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.127
 Ok, then we are combining this screen with our keyboard. 

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:44.010
 This keyboard is a magnet 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.263
 So it is very convenient to combine 

00:02:46.263 --> 00:02:50.770
 And it’s easy to work by setting up the rear brackets. 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.399
 And we are going to introduce one now is this 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:57.088
 Mouse! Have you seen it! Deng! The mouse is here! 

00:02:57.088 --> 00:02:59.085
 Then we are going to the weather now. 

00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:01.308
 The main application to this weather 

00:03:01.308 --> 00:03:05.427
 We will go to the page of this app with a little click. 

00:03:05.427 --> 00:03:07.387
 Ok, let's quit now. 

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:10.760
 OK, go back to the main page and exit 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.853
 Ok, let's go to this weather again now. 

00:03:13.853 --> 00:03:17.344
 At this time, we don’t want to use this method on this side. 

00:03:17.344 --> 00:03:18.937
 We can use this left button 

00:03:18.937 --> 00:03:21.896
 Just introduced the switch of the left and right buttons, we press the left button 

00:03:21.896 --> 00:03:25.204
 Is it convenient to return to this weather? 

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:28.166
 Ok, now let's take a look 

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:33.878
 This system function inside this GIGABYTE 

00:03:33.878 --> 00:03:40.966
 Ok, it shows that the processor is the CPU of the Intel Core 3337U. 

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:43.426
 OK, it is the third generation of this processor 

00:03:43.426 --> 00:03:48.001
 And that memory RAM is so big as 4G 

00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:51.765
 And its hard disk memory is 128G 

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:55.832
 Ok, let's go back to the main page. 

00:03:55.832 --> 00:04:00.205
 Come back to us at this time, we will close this screen first. 

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:05.433
 Sometimes we want to know directly how much this battery is. 

00:04:05.433 --> 00:04:09.508
 We just press the volume button of the volume of this sound 

00:04:09.508 --> 00:04:11.856
 Ok, side volume size button, then we hold it down 

00:04:11.856 --> 00:04:16.248
 It will show electricity, hehe! There are still two grids of electricity. 

00:04:16.248 --> 00:04:21.378
