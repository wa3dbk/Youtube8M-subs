called the flute I'll show you what this

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.840 
called the flute I'll show you what this
one<00:00:43.410> uh<00:00:44.059> actually<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.120> got<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:46.430> little<00:00:47.430> lane<00:00:47.670> here

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
one uh actually I got a little lane here

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.779 
one uh actually I got a little lane here
that<00:00:48.000> came<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.450> well<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.079> uh

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
that came with it as well this one is uh

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.569 
that came with it as well this one is uh
it's<00:00:53.789> what's<00:00:53.969> called<00:00:54.149> knurling<00:00:54.719> where

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
it's what's called knurling where

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.209 
it's what's called knurling where
there's<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> machine<00:00:57.469> that<00:00:58.469> basically<00:00:58.680> runs

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
there's a machine that basically runs

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.049 
there's a machine that basically runs
across<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.059> metal<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.190> raises<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
across the metal and it raises it to a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.820 
across the metal and it raises it to a
certain<00:01:03.390> extent<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.019> presses<00:01:04.589> into<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
certain extent so it presses into the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.200 
certain extent so it presses into the
metal<00:01:05.159> as<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.339> goes<00:01:05.489> along<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.119> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
metal as it goes along it's just a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.710 
metal as it goes along it's just a
regular<00:01:06.570> piece<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.930> titanium<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.360> creates

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
regular piece of titanium and it creates

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.969 
regular piece of titanium and it creates
these<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.530> pattern<00:01:11.070> called<00:01:11.670> knurling<00:01:12.979> those

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
these this pattern called knurling those

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.260 
these this pattern called knurling those
of<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.220> guys<00:01:14.310> haven't<00:01:14.640> seen<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.820> before<00:01:15.000> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
of you guys haven't seen this before so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.590 
of you guys haven't seen this before so
it's<00:01:15.570> uh<00:01:16.820> looks<00:01:17.820> very<00:01:19.100> very<00:01:20.100> intricate<00:01:20.600> then

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
it's uh looks very very intricate then

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.880 
it's uh looks very very intricate then
there's<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:22.170> what's<00:01:22.409> called<00:01:22.619> raised

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
there's like what's called raised

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.679 
there's like what's called raised
knurling<00:01:23.369> where<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:23.700> above<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.330> actual

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
knurling where it's above the actual

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.200 
knurling where it's above the actual
piece<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.229> titanium<00:01:25.909> and<00:01:26.909> that's<00:01:27.060> what

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
piece of the titanium and that's what

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.120 
piece of the titanium and that's what
this<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.049> raised<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.590> above<00:01:28.920> it

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
this one is so it's raised up above it

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.240 
this one is so it's raised up above it
you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.369> see<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.640> little<00:01:29.729> bit<00:01:29.939> there<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:31.250> uh

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
you can see it a little bit there but uh

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.649 
very cool-looking nonetheless not a very
big<00:01:37.079> light<00:01:37.350> as<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.890> my<00:01:38.040> hand<00:01:38.659> I'll

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
big light as you can see it my hand I'll

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.240 
big light as you can see it my hand I'll
grab<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> couple<00:01:40.140> other<00:01:40.380> lights<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.829> sucky<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
grab a couple other lights and sucky to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.380 
grab a couple other lights and sucky to
see<00:01:41.430> it

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
see it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.219 
see it
it's<00:01:42.810> got<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.200> think<00:01:43.439> six<00:01:44.720> six<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.840> Trance<00:01:46.079> I

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
it's got I think six six of Trance I

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.249 
it's got I think six six of Trance I
believe<00:01:46.909> yeah<00:01:47.909> six<00:01:48.240> traits<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> tail<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
believe yeah six traits in the tail and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.580 
believe yeah six traits in the tail and
then<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.700> centerpiece<00:01:51.530> when<00:01:52.530> I

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
then one in this centerpiece when I

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.310 
then one in this centerpiece when I
first<00:01:52.890> saw<00:01:53.850> these<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.119> thought<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.960> this

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
first saw these I thought that the this

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.539 
first saw these I thought that the this
was<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> press<00:01:55.920> button<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.450> actually<00:01:57.840> not

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
was a press button and it's actually not

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.010 
was a press button and it's actually not
it's<00:01:59.549> more<00:01:59.759> for<00:01:59.969> designed<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.689> where<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.869> can

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
it's more for designed to where you can

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.350 
it's more for designed to where you can
see<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> reflection<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:02.159> all<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.909> tritium

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
see the reflection of all the tritium

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.870 
see the reflection of all the tritium
around<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.110> they<00:02:04.979> they<00:02:05.250> reflect<00:02:05.700> through

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
around it and they they reflect through

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.589 
around it and they they reflect through
and<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.149> makes<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.390> cool<00:02:06.659> little<00:02:08.599> pattern

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
and it makes this cool little pattern

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.350 
and it makes this cool little pattern
kind<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:10.050> thing<00:02:10.640> it's<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.849> reflective

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
kind of thing it's just a reflective

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.640 
kind of thing it's just a reflective
material<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.840> there<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.110> what<00:02:13.230> you're<00:02:13.379> seeing

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
material in there so what you're seeing

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.619 
material in there so what you're seeing
it<00:02:13.980> looks<00:02:14.129> like<00:02:14.280> there's<00:02:14.489> tritium<00:02:14.970> lining<00:02:15.360> in

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
it looks like there's tritium lining in

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.199 
it looks like there's tritium lining in
that<00:02:15.720> swoopy<00:02:16.409> piece<00:02:16.590> -<00:02:16.799> it's<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.099> cone<00:02:17.489> but

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
that swoopy piece - it's like a cone but

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.869 
that swoopy piece - it's like a cone but
it's<00:02:18.329> actually<00:02:18.720> these<00:02:18.900> guys<00:02:19.250> right<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:20.310> that

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
it's actually these guys right here that

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.300 
it's actually these guys right here that
are<00:02:21.000> shining<00:02:21.299> from<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.900> inside<00:02:22.230> from<00:02:23.220> the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
are shining from the inside from the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.190 
are shining from the inside from the
inside<00:02:23.579> you<00:02:23.610> can<00:02:23.819> see<00:02:23.939> them<00:02:24.030> as<00:02:24.090> well<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:25.079> this

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
inside you can see them as well and this

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.869 
inside you can see them as well and this
is<00:02:25.379> I<00:02:25.530> think<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.829> is<00:02:25.890> blue<00:02:26.280> or<00:02:26.459> ice<00:02:26.579> blue<00:02:26.849> I

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
is I think this is blue or ice blue I

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.759 
is I think this is blue or ice blue I
never<00:02:27.209> find<00:02:27.390> out<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.599> minute<00:02:27.689> with<00:02:28.650> an

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
never find out in a minute with an

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.559 
never find out in a minute with an
orange<00:02:29.069> tritium<00:02:29.489> in<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.700> center<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.329> it<00:02:30.420> looks

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
orange tritium in the center so it looks

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.780 
orange tritium in the center so it looks
pretty<00:02:30.629> cool<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.459> has<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:34.400> some<00:02:35.400> type<00:02:35.549> of<00:02:35.579> a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
pretty cool and it has a some type of a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.140 
pretty cool and it has a some type of a
glow<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.810> LED<00:02:37.079> I<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.439> no<00:02:37.650> clue<00:02:38.040> how<00:02:38.879> it's

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
glow in the LED I have no clue how it's

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.899 
glow in the LED I have no clue how it's
doing<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.599> I<00:02:39.629> don't<00:02:39.750> know<00:02:39.810> if<00:02:39.870> it's<00:02:39.989> paint

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
doing and I don't know if it's paint

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.920 
doing and I don't know if it's paint
that's<00:02:41.909> what<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.090> think<00:02:42.329> it<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.480> but<00:02:42.780> it's

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
that's what I think it is but it's

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.720 
that's what I think it is but it's
charged<00:02:43.439> by<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.739> light<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.310> we'll<00:02:44.459> see<00:02:44.609> that

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
charged by the light so we'll see that

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.059 
charged by the light so we'll see that
in<00:02:44.819> a<00:02:44.879> sec<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:46.049> is<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> twisty<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:46.950> you

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
in a sec so this one is a twisty so you

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.479 
in a sec so this one is a twisty so you
twist<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.579> on<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:49.530> get<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.829> see<00:02:50.010> it's<00:02:50.129> on<00:02:50.220> there

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
twist it on to get you see it's on there

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.729 
twist it on to get you see it's on there
and<00:02:50.940> that's<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.359> low<00:02:51.599> you<00:02:52.560> twist<00:02:52.920> further<00:02:54.739> and

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
and that's the low you twist further and

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.089 
and that's the low you twist further and
that's<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.340> high<00:02:57.379> it's<00:02:58.379> actually<00:02:58.709> pretty

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
that's the high it's actually pretty

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.910 
that's the high it's actually pretty
bright<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.780> lot<00:03:00.780> brighter<00:03:01.019> than<00:03:01.260> what<00:03:01.530> what<00:03:01.829> it

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
bright a lot brighter than what what it

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.940 
bright a lot brighter than what what it
looks<00:03:02.099> like<00:03:02.220> on<00:03:02.370> here<00:03:03.379> now<00:03:04.379> let<00:03:04.530> me<00:03:04.620> turn<00:03:04.769> this

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
looks like on here now let me turn this

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.420 
looks like on here now let me turn this
light<00:03:05.189> off<00:03:07.790> didn't<00:03:08.790> help<00:03:08.939> that<00:03:09.060> much<00:03:09.209> did<00:03:09.450> it

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
light off didn't help that much did it

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.929 
light off didn't help that much did it
but<00:03:11.430> anyway<00:03:11.730> maybe<00:03:11.879> I'll<00:03:12.150> be<00:03:12.269> able<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:13.849> turn<00:03:14.849> it

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
but anyway maybe I'll be able to turn it

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.659 
but anyway maybe I'll be able to turn it
off<00:03:15.060> now<00:03:15.359> there<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.569> go<00:03:16.099> so<00:03:17.099> somehow<00:03:17.489> or

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
off now there you go so somehow or

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.569 
off now there you go so somehow or
another<00:03:17.699> it<00:03:18.030> charges<00:03:18.709> whatever<00:03:19.709> is<00:03:19.949> down<00:03:20.129> by

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
another it charges whatever is down by

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.280 
another it charges whatever is down by
that<00:03:20.760> LED<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.299> believe<00:03:21.629> it's<00:03:21.810> like<00:03:21.989> some

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
that LED and I believe it's like some

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.949 
that LED and I believe it's like some
type<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.650> glow-in-the-dark<00:03:23.069> paint<00:03:23.870> but<00:03:24.870> it

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
type of a glow-in-the-dark paint but it

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.000 
type of a glow-in-the-dark paint but it
looks<00:03:25.109> awesome<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.780> it's<00:03:28.019> pretty<00:03:28.109> neat<00:03:28.349> so

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
looks awesome so it's pretty neat so

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.559 
looks awesome so it's pretty neat so
let's<00:03:29.220> let<00:03:29.819> me<00:03:29.879> see<00:03:29.970> if<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.060> can<00:03:30.180> turn<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.389> light

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
let's let me see if I can turn the light

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.569 
let's let me see if I can turn the light
off

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
off

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.509 
off
and<00:03:32.579> see<00:03:32.819> if<00:03:32.909> we<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.239> get<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:34.310> coloration<00:03:35.310> of

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
and see if we can get a coloration of

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.830 
and see if we can get a coloration of
the<00:03:35.609> tritium<00:03:35.849> you<00:03:36.090> can<00:03:36.209> start<00:03:36.449> to<00:03:36.540> see<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.720> a

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
the tritium you can start to see it a

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.979 
the tritium you can start to see it a
little<00:03:36.870> bit<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:39.060> center<00:03:39.389> one<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.659> orange

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
little bit and that center one is orange

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.789 
little bit and that center one is orange
but<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.709> lights<00:03:40.919> a<00:03:41.099> little<00:03:41.220> too<00:03:41.459> bright<00:03:41.730> you

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
but the lights a little too bright you

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.439 
but the lights a little too bright you
see<00:03:43.799> if<00:03:43.859> I<00:03:43.979> bring<00:03:44.370> us<00:03:44.519> in<00:03:44.699> here<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.120> cover<00:03:45.269> this

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
see if I bring us in here and cover this

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:49.520 
see if I bring us in here and cover this
up<00:03:47.090> this<00:03:48.090> camera<00:03:48.389> just<00:03:48.659> sucks<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.109> little<00:03:49.260> light

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
up this camera just sucks a little light

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.069 
up this camera just sucks a little light
so<00:03:49.859> let's<00:03:50.099> try<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.819> let's<00:03:51.000> see<00:03:51.209> uh<00:03:51.239> see<00:03:51.900> what<00:03:51.959> it

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
so let's try it let's see uh see what it

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:58.069 
so let's try it let's see uh see what it
looks<00:03:52.229> like<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.829> dark<00:03:56.569> and<00:03:57.569> if<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.840> shows

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
looks like in the dark and if it shows

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.830 
looks like in the dark and if it shows
up<00:03:58.109> at<00:03:58.409> all<00:04:01.639> so<00:04:02.639> there's<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.940> tritium<00:04:03.389> you<00:04:03.720> can

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
up at all so there's the tritium you can

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.339 
up at all so there's the tritium you can
see<00:04:04.049> the<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.530> believe<00:04:05.040> it's<00:04:05.250> ice<00:04:05.639> blue<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.349> then

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
see the I believe it's ice blue and then

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.559 
see the I believe it's ice blue and then
the<00:04:07.470> orange<00:04:07.709> in<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.129> center<00:04:08.459> but<00:04:09.269> see<00:04:09.449> the

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
the orange in the center but see the

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.420 
the orange in the center but see the
reflection<00:04:10.199> coming<00:04:10.500> off<00:04:10.620> of<00:04:10.650> these<00:04:10.949> trilliant

reflection coming off of these trilliant

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.740 
reflection coming off of these trilliant
you<00:04:11.519> know<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.729> tritium<00:04:11.909> on<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.180> outskirts

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
you know the tritium on the outskirts

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.469 
you know the tritium on the outskirts
here<00:04:13.019> which<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.979> reflecting<00:04:14.790> off<00:04:14.879> that<00:04:15.120> center

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
here which is reflecting off that center

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:20.420 
here which is reflecting off that center
piece<00:04:18.019> which<00:04:19.019> adds<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.409> you<00:04:19.739> know<00:04:19.859> their<00:04:20.010> cool

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
piece which adds a you know their cool

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.940 
piece which adds a you know their cool
effect<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.909> it<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.239> then<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.169> glow<00:04:22.440> piece<00:04:22.710> on

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
effect to it and then the glow piece on

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.249 
effect to it and then the glow piece on
the<00:04:23.099> front<00:04:23.370> so<00:04:24.710> turn<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.830> on<00:04:25.950> low

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
the front so turn it on low

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.869 
the front so turn it on low
turn<00:04:28.259> it<00:04:28.379> on<00:04:28.500> high<00:04:28.770> as<00:04:29.189> you<00:04:29.400> can<00:04:29.490> tell<00:04:29.699> it's<00:04:29.819> a

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879 
turn it on high as you can tell it's a

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.360 
turn it on high as you can tell it's a
lot<00:04:30.030> brighter<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.569> way<00:04:30.720> but<00:04:31.590> once<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:32.220> turn

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
lot brighter that way but once you turn

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.339 
lot brighter that way but once you turn

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
I'm sorry the knives are there uh the

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.439 
I'm sorry the knives are there uh the
tritium<00:04:55.800> grabs<00:04:56.189> me<00:04:56.430> is<00:04:56.520> really<00:04:56.759> what<00:04:56.909> it<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.150> so

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
tritium grabs me is really what it is so

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.809 
tritium grabs me is really what it is so
I<00:04:57.479> love<00:04:57.750> tritium<00:04:58.110> anyway<00:04:58.439> let's<00:04:59.039> uh<00:04:59.250> let<00:04:59.759> me

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
I love tritium anyway let's uh let me

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.610 
I love tritium anyway let's uh let me
turn<00:04:59.969> the<00:05:00.090> light<00:05:00.240> back<00:05:00.360> on<00:05:00.509> so<00:05:00.690> we<00:05:00.780> can<00:05:00.870> see

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.740 

let's<00:05:04.620> put<00:05:04.860> this<00:05:04.979> up<00:05:05.159> against<00:05:05.729> some<00:05:06.599> of<00:05:06.629> the

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
let's put this up against some of the

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.790 
let's put this up against some of the
other<00:05:06.810> ones<00:05:07.050> I've<00:05:07.169> got<00:05:09.199> this<00:05:10.199> is<00:05:10.409> the<00:05:10.440> zenith

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
other ones I've got this is the zenith

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.240 
other ones I've got this is the zenith
so<00:05:11.639> lengthwise<00:05:12.509> it's<00:05:13.080> actually<00:05:13.500> a<00:05:13.800> little<00:05:14.099> bit

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
so lengthwise it's actually a little bit

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.999 
so lengthwise it's actually a little bit
longer<00:05:15.080> and<00:05:16.080> not<00:05:16.199> only<00:05:16.289> white<00:05:16.560> does<00:05:16.830> that

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
longer and not only white does that

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:18.379 
longer and not only white does that
focusing<00:05:17.460> thing<00:05:17.610> but<00:05:17.759> it's<00:05:17.909> a<00:05:18.000> little<00:05:18.210> bit

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
focusing thing but it's a little bit

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.769 
focusing thing but it's a little bit
longer<00:05:18.690> than<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.860> zenith<00:05:20.039> but<00:05:20.340> much<00:05:20.779> smaller

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:21.779 
longer than the zenith but much smaller

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:27.800 
longer than the zenith but much smaller
in<00:05:22.610> diameter<00:05:25.219> so<00:05:26.219> the<00:05:26.490> zenith<00:05:26.879> Damascus<00:05:27.539> is<00:05:27.689> on

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
in diameter so the zenith Damascus is on

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.890 
in diameter so the zenith Damascus is on
the<00:05:27.900> right<00:05:28.139> and<00:05:28.669> then<00:05:29.669> the<00:05:30.000> flute<00:05:30.389> is<00:05:30.629> on<00:05:30.779> the

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
the right and then the flute is on the

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.689 
the right and then the flute is on the
left<00:05:31.139> now<00:05:32.009> just<00:05:32.159> I<00:05:32.190> have<00:05:32.279> another<00:05:32.520> one<00:05:32.669> of

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
left now just I have another one of

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.369 
left now just I have another one of
these<00:05:32.819> coming<00:05:33.000> too<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:33.690> it's<00:05:33.810> double<00:05:34.259> the

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:34.379 
these coming too and it's double the

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:36.230 
these coming too and it's double the
amount<00:05:34.650> of<00:05:34.740> trips<00:05:35.490> that<00:05:35.580> are<00:05:35.729> on<00:05:35.819> the<00:05:35.909> bottom

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
amount of trips that are on the bottom

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.959 
amount of trips that are on the bottom
or<00:05:36.840> on<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.080> UH<00:05:37.110> tail<00:05:37.520> so<00:05:38.520> I'm<00:05:38.610> looking<00:05:38.819> forward

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969 
or on the UH tail so I'm looking forward

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:40.129 
or on the UH tail so I'm looking forward
to<00:05:39.090> getting<00:05:39.210> that<00:05:39.300> into<00:05:39.599> it's<00:05:39.750> very<00:05:39.810> cool

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
to getting that into it's very cool

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.369 
to getting that into it's very cool
light<00:05:40.319> actually<00:05:40.860> a<00:05:40.889> good<00:05:41.159> size<00:05:42.199> whereas<00:05:43.199> this

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:43.379 
light actually a good size whereas this

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.550 
light actually a good size whereas this
one's<00:05:43.620> a<00:05:43.710> little<00:05:44.960> thicker<00:05:45.960> and<00:05:46.080> a<00:05:46.259> little<00:05:46.469> more

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
one's a little thicker and a little more

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.800 
one's a little thicker and a little more
difficult<00:05:46.620> to<00:05:47.009> carry<00:05:50.029> and<00:05:51.029> this<00:05:51.180> is<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.479> thud

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
difficult to carry and this is the thud

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:59.379 
difficult to carry and this is the thud
LT<00:05:53.629> put<00:05:54.629> the<00:05:54.750> same<00:05:54.960> diameter<00:05:55.259> as<00:05:55.819> the<00:05:58.250> zenith

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
LT put the same diameter as the zenith

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.939 
LT put the same diameter as the zenith
and<00:06:00.389> these<00:06:00.569> guys<00:06:00.779> are<00:06:00.990> exactly<00:06:01.409> the<00:06:01.740> same

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
and these guys are exactly the same

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.559 
and these guys are exactly the same
length<00:06:02.190> doesn't<00:06:02.940> look<00:06:03.029> that<00:06:03.060> way<00:06:03.210> because<00:06:03.479> of

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:03.569 
length doesn't look that way because of

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.610 
length doesn't look that way because of
the<00:06:03.629> angle<00:06:03.930> but<00:06:04.460> exact<00:06:05.460> same<00:06:05.639> length<00:06:06.620> so

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
the angle but exact same length so

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.860 
the angle but exact same length so
anyway<00:06:07.940> another<00:06:08.940> cool<00:06:09.240> little<00:06:09.270> piece<00:06:09.629> I<00:06:09.750> got

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
anyway another cool little piece I got
