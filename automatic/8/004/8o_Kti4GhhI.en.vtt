00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.380
 hello today I do not have a sewing machine 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.840
 because I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.519
 hidden stitch that is made by hand 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.570
 is targeted is very important because 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.220
 although the project we do 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.289
 completely to machine there is always a 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.640
 little piece that we have to finish by hand 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.350
 especially if we have to go around 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.750
 a liner like for example we did the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.609
 last week in the bag with a handle 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.920
 reversible or as we did also in your 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.439
 day with the bag of seeds I have caught 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:37.050
 a piece of cloth and I sewed it as if 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.660
 was the part of the lining of a bag in 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.149
 which right with fabric right 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.579
 I make a seam all along hand 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.379
 or a space here for later 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.750
 turn it around remember that here 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.700
 we always have to finish off so that 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.020
 then when you turn it over really 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.000
 although I did not know everything else 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.430
 because it's just a sample but if 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.920
 really this was a lining would have to 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.280
 make this space so small all 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.840
 the moment piece as it is only 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.420
 to show you how the stitch is made 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.040
 hidden only I'm going to 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.250
 I only get it on one side 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.720
 then here we would have the opening 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.720
 I'm going to take a little corner 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.270
 we have the opening here and now I'm going to 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.920
 go on to show you how the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.500
 hidden stitch 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.400
 before I start I like to mark a little 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.990
 with the nail the edge you can do 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.980
 also with the iron but the truth is 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.330
 that this is one is a good solution 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.460
 I have a needle threaded 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.820
 and the hidden stitch we're going to make 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.780
 always from right to left but the 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.640
 first stitch I like to put it before 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.560
 of the last 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.010
 of the last stitch that we saw with the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.010
 machine 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.250
 because in this way the knot 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.850
 I can hide it 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.910
 a little bit with him with the tip of the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.970
 needle first of all we'll have to 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.280
 take a little bit of the upper fabric 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.240
 and another bit of the bottom always 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.230
 we have to have the needle in parallel to 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.690
 the edges of the fabrics 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.150
 and give a stitch on the top 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.799
 and one in the bottom part this is the 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.290
 way in which we're going to get a 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.750
 stitching that will look quite like the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.890
 that we would have if we had sewn with 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.890
 the reverse machine 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.840
 the distance we have to do 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.180
 each stitch is if the thread is coming out 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.790
 here the next stitch has to 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.239
 start right up 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.370
 the smaller the stitch is 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.349
 better closed will always be lame 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.319
 little of the fabric above and a 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.549
 little bit of the one below in this moment 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.859
 you see that the stitch is quite 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.730
 let go because what I want is for you to see 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:16.489
 how it is done but then stretched and you see 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.489
 that is left by neither side 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.470
 you see the thread nothing more than here a 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.530
 little bit and it's pretty disguised 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.140
 on the top trying to catch 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.050
 always by the edge of the cloth in the 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.970
 part of above I take a pinch and in the 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.970
 from below I take another 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.650
 when I get to the end 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.650
 I make the last stretch 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.269
 so everything is well closed 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.269
 and with two stitches at the last point 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.730
 I close it to finish hiding what 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.190
 I can put the needle in here and take it out 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.770
 by any other point so that at 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.700
 cut here the thread is totally 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.700
 hidden 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.949
 and we have the position completely 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.060
 closed we have finished for today and I hope 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.350
 that has served you everything that you 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.610
 explained and if you have any questions 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.610
 tell me in the comments
