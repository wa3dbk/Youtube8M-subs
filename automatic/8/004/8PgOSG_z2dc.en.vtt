alright guys welcome to your seventh
computer<00:00:02.370> networking<00:00:02.730> tutorial<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:03.570> now

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170

computer networking tutorial and now
that<00:00:04.440> we<00:00:04.529> understand<00:00:05.040> what<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.339> server<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.940> I

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
that we understand what a server is I

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.810 
that we understand what a server is I
want<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.810> explain<00:00:07.170> exactly<00:00:07.500> how<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.250> works<00:00:08.490> and

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
want to explain exactly how it works and

want to explain exactly how it works and
also<00:00:09.389> it<00:00:10.050> will<00:00:10.200> help<00:00:10.349> me<00:00:10.530> explain<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.130> thing

called<00:00:11.610> clients<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.540> hosts<00:00:12.809> because<00:00:13.559> you

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
called clients and hosts because you

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.930 
called clients and hosts because you
guys<00:00:13.830> have<00:00:14.009> probably<00:00:14.070> heard<00:00:14.340> about<00:00:14.519> hosts

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
guys have probably heard about hosts

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.300 
guys have probably heard about hosts
before<00:00:15.150> but<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.049> may<00:00:16.260> not<00:00:16.440> know<00:00:16.619> exactly<00:00:16.740> what

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
before but you may not know exactly what

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.620 
before but you may not know exactly what
they<00:00:17.430> are<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:17.760> hopefully<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> can<00:00:18.420> clear<00:00:18.600> that

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
they are so hopefully I can clear that

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.099 
they are so hopefully I can clear that
up<00:00:18.920> so<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.279> very<00:00:20.730> simplistic<00:00:21.359> model<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
up so a very simplistic model of the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.540 
up so a very simplistic model of the
internet<00:00:22.500> would<00:00:22.619> look<00:00:22.830> something<00:00:22.980> like<00:00:23.189> this

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
internet would look something like this

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.060 
internet would look something like this
we<00:00:24.150> would<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> bunch<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.019> pcs<00:00:25.529> will<00:00:25.890> say

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
we would have a bunch of pcs will say

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.120 
we would have a bunch of pcs will say
that<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> Windows<00:00:27.180> PC<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.680> will<00:00:28.949> say

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
that this is a Windows PC and I will say

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.279 
that this is a Windows PC and I will say
you<00:00:29.189> know<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> laptop<00:00:30.359> I'll<00:00:30.960> draw<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you know this is a laptop I'll draw it a

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.260 
you know this is a laptop I'll draw it a
little<00:00:31.320> differently<00:00:32.000> it's<00:00:33.000> pretty

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
little differently it's pretty

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.970 
little differently it's pretty
good-looking<00:00:33.780> laptop<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.739> don't<00:00:34.800> know

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
good-looking laptop and I don't know

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.680 
good-looking laptop and I don't know
maybe<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> Mac<00:00:36.230> over<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:38.690> alright

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690

and we'll talk about you know exactly
how<00:02:00.390> your<00:02:00.570> router<00:02:00.810> knows<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.770> talk<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.250> my<00:02:02.490> web

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
how your router knows to talk to my web

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.539 
how your router knows to talk to my web
server<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.049> complicated<00:02:04.590> process<00:02:04.829> but

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
server that's a complicated process but

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.969 
server that's a complicated process but
basically<00:02:05.700> you're<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.689> eventually<00:02:07.020> get

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
basically you're going to eventually get

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.820 
basically you're going to eventually get
to<00:02:08.250> my<00:02:08.520> server<00:02:08.879> right<00:02:09.149> here<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.660> what<00:02:10.649> your

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
to my server right here and what your

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.949 
to my server right here and what your
computer<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.370> basically<00:02:11.790> asking<00:02:12.330> is

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
computer is basically asking is

this website in my web server hopefully
you<00:02:26.219> know<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.390> not<00:02:27.540> down<00:02:27.780> or<00:02:28.019> anything

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
you know if it's not down or anything

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.860 
you know if it's not down or anything
it's<00:02:28.769> going<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.040> say<00:02:29.219> yes<00:02:29.639> here<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.060> go<00:02:30.299> so

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
it's going to say yes here you go so

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.390 
it's going to say yes here you go so
it's<00:02:31.019> basically<00:02:31.379> going<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.709> take<00:02:31.889> those<00:02:32.129> files

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
it's basically going to take those files

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.240 
it's basically going to take those files
which<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.209> basically<00:02:33.659> data<00:02:34.079> and<00:02:34.500> send<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.159> over

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
which is basically data and send it over

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.059 
which is basically data and send it over
wire<00:02:35.700> or<00:02:36.120> Wireless<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.170> you're<00:02:37.650> going<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:37.829> get

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069

texts and videos whatever it is that you
can<00:03:11.040> see<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.879> basically<00:03:12.269> one<00:03:12.569> more<00:03:12.750> time

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
can see so basically one more time

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.429 
can see so basically one more time
servers<00:03:14.790> are<00:03:14.939> special<00:03:15.389> computers<00:03:15.930> that

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
servers are special computers that

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.580 
servers are special computers that
everyone<00:03:17.069> in<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.489> world<00:03:17.760> can<00:03:18.239> access<00:03:18.590> now

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
everyone in the world can access now

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.710 
everyone in the world can access now
whenever<00:03:19.859> you<00:03:20.159> want<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.459> see<00:03:20.609> my<00:03:21.060> website<00:03:21.510> for

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
whenever you want to see my website for

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.780 
whenever you want to see my website for
example<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:22.530> send<00:03:22.799> a<00:03:22.889> request<00:03:23.159> to<00:03:23.400> my<00:03:23.519> server

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
example you send a request to my server

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.270 
example you send a request to my server
then<00:03:24.659> you<00:03:24.930> basically<00:03:25.109> ask<00:03:25.620> can<00:03:25.859> I<00:03:25.949> see<00:03:26.159> your

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
then you basically ask can I see your

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.069 
then you basically ask can I see your
website<00:03:26.430> can<00:03:26.819> you<00:03:26.940> send<00:03:27.239> me<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.569> web<00:03:27.750> files

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
website can you send me the web files

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.949 
website can you send me the web files
and<00:03:28.500> then<00:03:28.889> my<00:03:29.099> server<00:03:29.459> automatically<00:03:30.359> takes

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
and then my server automatically takes

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.080 
and then my server automatically takes
those<00:03:31.139> files<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.889> sends<00:03:32.549> them<00:03:32.669> to<00:03:32.909> your

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
those files and sends them to your

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.119 
those files and sends them to your
computer<00:03:33.239> so<00:03:33.720> now<00:03:33.870> your<00:03:34.139> computer<00:03:34.650> has<00:03:34.889> those

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
computer so now your computer has those

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.550 
computer so now your computer has those
files<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.819> your<00:03:36.329> web<00:03:36.569> browser<00:03:36.840> interprets

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
files and your web browser interprets
