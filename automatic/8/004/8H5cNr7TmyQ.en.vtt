hey guys and welcome to this a preview
of<00:00:02.100> instant<00:00:02.610> heart<00:00:02.909> rate<00:00:03.179> now<00:00:04.049> this<00:00:04.319> is<00:00:04.529> an<00:00:04.650> app

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
of instant heart rate now this is an app

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.039 
of instant heart rate now this is an app
that<00:00:04.890> allows<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.640> calculate<00:00:05.850> your<00:00:06.690> heart

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
camera and it will calculate the beats

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.410 
camera and it will calculate the beats
the<00:00:12.420> pulse<00:00:12.719> they're<00:00:13.469> going<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.920> your<00:00:14.099> finger

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.660 
Charles own this will give you a guide
of<00:00:27.390> whether<00:00:27.990> your<00:00:28.199> heart<00:00:28.529> rate<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.010> good<00:00:29.460> or

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
of whether your heart rate is good or

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.889 
of whether your heart rate is good or
whether<00:00:29.849> what<00:00:30.570> you're<00:00:30.720> doing<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:32.009> right

whether what you're doing is the right

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.240 
whether what you're doing is the right
percentage<00:00:33.899> now<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.590> middle<00:00:34.860> button<00:00:35.040> is

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
percentage now the middle button is

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.650 
percentage now the middle button is
where<00:00:35.399> we<00:00:35.579> test<00:00:36.079> the<00:00:37.079> time<00:00:37.380> line<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:38.480> where<00:00:39.480> you

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
where we test the time line is where you

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.459 
where we test the time line is where you
can<00:00:39.809> record<00:00:40.170> basically<00:00:40.770> all<00:00:41.489> your<00:00:42.469> previous

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
can record basically all your previous

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.549 
can record basically all your previous
testings<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:45.210> settings<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:46.079> you've<00:00:46.350> got

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
testings the settings here you've got

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.200 
testings the settings here you've got
the<00:00:46.680> maximum<00:00:47.160> heart<00:00:47.399> rate<00:00:47.520> whether<00:00:48.030> you're

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the maximum heart rate whether you're

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.049 
the maximum heart rate whether you're
male<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:48.660> female<00:00:49.219> calculate<00:00:50.219> by<00:00:50.460> age<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.820> can

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
male or female calculate by age you can

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.939 
male or female calculate by age you can
manually<00:00:51.420> switch<00:00:51.809> them<00:00:52.050> off<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.559> set<00:00:52.860> your

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
manually switch them off and set your

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.299 
manually switch them off and set your
age<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.840> we're<00:00:54.960> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> testing

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
age here so we're going to go to testing

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.200 
age here so we're going to go to testing
so<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.879> place<00:00:57.120> our<00:00:57.329> finger<00:00:57.660> here<00:00:59.210> that's

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
so if we place our finger here that's

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.569 
so if we place our finger here that's
gonna<00:01:00.420> calculate<00:01:00.989> my<00:01:01.140> heart<00:01:01.440> rate<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:02.430> you

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
gonna calculate my heart rate so as you

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.130 
gonna calculate my heart rate so as you
can<00:01:02.699> see<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.120> where<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:03.960> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
can see that where it's going up and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.020 
can see that where it's going up and
down<00:01:04.260> as<00:01:04.589> soon<00:01:04.830> as<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.040> hits<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> top<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.909> I'll

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
down as soon as I hits the top that I'll

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.850 
down as soon as I hits the top that I'll
make<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.210> beep<00:01:06.510> noise<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.260> had<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> sound

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
make a beep noise if I had the sound

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.310 
make a beep noise if I had the sound
enabled<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.909> course<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.479> don't<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> sound

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
enabled of course I don't have the sound

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.219 
enabled of course I don't have the sound
and<00:01:10.500> abled<00:01:11.180> because<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.450> always<00:01:12.600> keep<00:01:12.720> my<00:01:13.020> phone

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and abled because I always keep my phone

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.480 
and abled because I always keep my phone
on<00:01:13.380> vibrate<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:15.650> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.799> see<00:01:17.009> mine's<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.460> bit

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
on vibrate so you can see mine's a bit

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.140 
on vibrate so you can see mine's a bit
high<00:01:17.939> today<00:01:18.830> higher<00:01:19.830> than<00:01:20.100> normal<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.700> think

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
high today higher than normal I think

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.580 
high today higher than normal I think
that's<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.689> with<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.930> weather<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.380> very

Facebook<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.770> Twitter<00:01:26.009> add<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.700> note<00:01:27.119> etc<00:01:28.049> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
Facebook and Twitter add a note etc you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.249 
Facebook and Twitter add a note etc you
can<00:01:28.590> save<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.340> course<00:01:29.630> by<00:01:30.630> hitting<00:01:30.840> there

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
can save it of course by hitting there

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.440 
can save it of course by hitting there
so<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.490> see<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.700> keeps<00:01:32.880> your<00:01:33.090> previous

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
so as you can see it keeps your previous

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.020 
so as you can see it keeps your previous
test<00:01:33.750> results<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.340> very<00:01:35.400> seamless<00:01:36.390> app<00:01:36.979> now

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
test results and very seamless app now

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.170 
test results and very seamless app now
this<00:01:39.030> app<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.450> course<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:41.460> would<00:01:41.549> think<00:01:41.850> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
this app of course you would think it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.179 
this app of course you would think it
was<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> high<00:01:42.869> side<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:43.799> actually

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
was on the high side but it's actually

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.740 
was on the high side but it's actually
not<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.880> only<00:01:45.119> $0.99<00:01:46.110> 69p<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> App<00:01:47.430> Store

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
not it's only $0.99 69p in the App Store
