 Naturally you beats audio all and elements 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.080
 latest models beats audio 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:32.099
 This is how this inscription is removed 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.880
 Now he and that here, too, B on the screen 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.399
 pre-sale film and written as 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.850
 the most important characteristics of the screen 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.129
 amoled 540 by 960 simultaneous 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.670
 photo-video material sound beats 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.010

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.840
 all you listened he is really natural 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.030
 very clear sound 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.160
 i listened to headphones from beats headphones and 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.100
 thin metal body 7 and 8 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.870
 millimeters here for some reason written 79 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.320
 although on all sites 7 and 8 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.519
 htc sense that now let's turn it on 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.519
 turns on very quickly 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.930
 make inclusion 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:22.630
 all phone is on no signal here 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.330
 By the way about this here is not a tick 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.250
 I have it when I looked at what phone 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.100
 I must choose a selection to 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.200
 such flasher flashes 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.180
 when a missed call or arrival 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.280
 a message or something 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.390
 any alert me she is very 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.009
 like she's cool that's why i 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.530
 for this, own took android 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:51.560
 I wanted to take an iphone like this 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.060
 very clearly I already used it 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.369
 phone so everything is set up 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.950
 then see how they sound on 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.479
 scientific killers ruin so much when they go 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.789
 headphones you are connected 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.460
 Headphones from the killers can be turned on now 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.140
 let's not turn it on 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.640
 let's see what is in the box 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:18.380
 the phone in the box is 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.600
 Naturally the power supply I already 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.549

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.980

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.730
 by which 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.269
 to synchronize with the computer and for 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.019
 charging the phone and headphones and the most 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.620
 figs like ordinary nokia models 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.580
 they are very fig altogether them 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.950
 sell by sight and for 100 rubles 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.200
 throw out or give to the homeless I do not know 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.870
 they are very fig they 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.550
 but they can be put on the remote 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.640
 pause and there is a microphone here is a microphone and 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.350

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.020
 other headphones and preferably baits 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.120
 because it beats audio phone with 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.530
 support beats audio and this is very 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.860
 cool so what those beats tour 2013 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.220

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.540

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.510

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.660

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.550
 points 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.709
 I stopped flashing because I already 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.450
 looked at what I have missed 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.580

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.389

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.870
 it is without sight 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.450
