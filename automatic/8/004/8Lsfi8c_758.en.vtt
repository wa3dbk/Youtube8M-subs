00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.300
 let's move on to the second phase 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.990
 that foresees the use instead of the 11 0 charges we start always continuing 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.739
 to the peyote to insert 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:16.379
 federica say yes like my grimaldi case 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:19.419
 doing 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:20.960
 I our case 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.390
 5 laps 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.569
 beautiful 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.569
 so now i write him something in the meantime about the work 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.830
 delica principles do not necessarily have to be 5 depends precisely 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.150
 from the thickness of the mother-of-pearl hard disk we use 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.820
 so maybe you can't tell me if I'm served though 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.460
 in my case I saw gossip problems of writing more or less of the same 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.640
 thickness 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.580
 milan - realized 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.010
 I made 5 gtd 11 0 even in this smi I'm doing I'll do 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.370
 5 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.660
 booklet 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.830
 you must always try the only thing I recommend not to tighten the job 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.600
 because it tightens up for work 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.480
 curls up 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.330
 ennamo porchetta couldn't insert the disc I can see that you have to stay a lot 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.980
 soft if the circle does not have to cry 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.950
 its shape must not enter 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.420
 curly 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.420
 and continue in this way 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.690
 5 gb 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.090
 so you do 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.710
 hi5 sisi sale 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.180
 the largely very simple realization of this 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.120
 of these embedding and is the same for all for all the ripples 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.920
 link 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.490
 d 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.490
 mother of pearl discs 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.180
 let's say it's pretty much the same 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.230
 change only we can set of 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.900
 gracias por sardegna the realization of anyway, if I need that 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.900
 obviously you do it at your leisure 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.669
 the idea of ​​what you can do with these 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.669
 exterior decorations using all types of fir beads 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.199
 in other words, the feathers of the sequins 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.979
 what you want 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:26.059
 in such a way as you - make the creation in particular perhaps different from the 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:27.509
 other 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.399
 I enjoy it very much 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.399
 to devour and the outside 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.099
 Here is the first round of dedication 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.299
 I'll do it then 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.349

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.260
 in the end it turns me start up I insert you go to the side cm 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.719
