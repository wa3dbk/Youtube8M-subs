00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.780 
philosophy and how she places this I
know<00:04:43.960> Mac<00:04:44.140> uses<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.800> lot<00:04:45.100> of<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.400> sighted

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
know Mac uses a lot of the sighted

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.200 
know Mac uses a lot of the sighted
eyeliner<00:04:46.090> blush<00:04:46.360> brush<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.730> they<00:04:48.730> also<00:04:48.880> use

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
eyeliner blush brush and they also use

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.560 
eyeliner blush brush and they also use
this<00:04:49.510> one<00:04:49.750> which<00:04:49.870> I<00:04:49.960> bought<00:04:51.210> six<00:04:52.210> months<00:04:52.480> ago

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
this one which I bought six months ago

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.960 
this one which I bought six months ago
and<00:04:53.020> I<00:04:53.680> don't<00:04:53.860> like<00:04:54.010> this<00:04:54.220> because<00:04:54.460> you<00:04:54.790> don't

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
and I don't like this because you don't

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.940 
and I don't like this because you don't
have<00:04:55.030> the<00:04:55.390> right<00:04:55.420> amount<00:04:55.990> of<00:04:56.080> control<00:04:56.650> in

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
have the right amount of control in

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.790 
have the right amount of control in
order<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.820> make<00:04:58.060> your<00:04:58.900> wings<00:04:59.170> or<00:04:59.410> really<00:04:59.650> it's

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
order to make your wings or really it's

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.720 
order to make your wings or really it's
just<00:04:59.980> too<00:05:00.370> flimsy<00:05:01.330> it's<00:05:01.690> floppy<00:05:02.110> it's

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
just too flimsy it's floppy it's

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.570 
just too flimsy it's floppy it's
annoying<00:05:03.730> I<00:05:03.940> really<00:05:04.840> think<00:05:05.110> that<00:05:05.290> this<00:05:06.070> gives

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
annoying I really think that this gives

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.960 
annoying I really think that this gives
you<00:05:06.790> so<00:05:07.150> much<00:05:07.390> more<00:05:07.450> of<00:05:07.840> a<00:05:07.960> smooth<00:05:08.530> line<00:05:09.430> you

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
you so much more of a smooth line you

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.000 
you so much more of a smooth line you
get<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.270> control<00:05:10.780> because<00:05:11.230> it's<00:05:11.380> both<00:05:11.560> flat

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
get the control because it's both flat

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.670 
get the control because it's both flat
and<00:05:12.340> thick<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:13.360> then<00:05:13.690> also<00:05:13.870> taper<00:05:14.290> it<00:05:14.470> at<00:05:14.530> the

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
and thick and then also taper it at the

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.700 
and thick and then also taper it at the
