heating and it allows the best the wat

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.250 
heating and it allows the best the wat
to<00:00:58.620> get<00:00:58.770> extremely<00:00:59.160> hot<00:01:00.110> this<00:01:01.110> will

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
to get extremely hot this will

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.729 
to get extremely hot this will
accommodate<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.690> comedy<00:01:03.739> accommodates

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
accommodate here comedy accommodates

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.300 
accommodate here comedy accommodates
very<00:01:04.949> firmly<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.639> securely<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:07.069> 16-inch<00:01:08.069> walk

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
very firmly and securely a 16-inch walk

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.989 
very firmly and securely a 16-inch walk
and<00:01:09.109> should<00:01:10.109> have<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.350> smaller<00:01:10.709> one<00:01:11.009> it<00:01:11.789> will

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:11.999 
and should have a smaller one it will

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:19.730 
and should have a smaller one it will
equally<00:01:12.270> accommodate<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.020> smaller<00:01:13.469> walk<00:01:18.740> now

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
equally accommodate a smaller walk now

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.010 
equally accommodate a smaller walk now
as<00:01:19.889> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.099> see<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.399> this<00:01:20.549> shot<00:01:20.849> the<00:01:21.420> flame<00:01:21.779> is

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
as you can see in this shot the flame is

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.989 
as you can see in this shot the flame is
coming<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.099> the<00:01:23.219> center<00:01:23.429> walk<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:23.999 
coming right up to the center walk and

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.779 
coming right up to the center walk and
then<00:01:24.959> because<00:01:25.319> of<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.529> sides<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:26.189> been<00:01:26.459> held

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
then because of the sides it's been held

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.809 
then because of the sides it's been held
the<00:01:27.450> heat<00:01:27.659> has<00:01:27.689> been<00:01:28.049> held<00:01:28.319> within<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.159> walk

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
the heat has been held within the walk

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.359 
the heat has been held within the walk
area<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.139> creating<00:01:31.619> extremely

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
area so this is creating extremely

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.609 
area so this is creating extremely
really<00:01:33.029> directly<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.899> the<00:01:34.020> best<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.439> walk

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
really directly to the best the walk

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.919 
really directly to the best the walk
this<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:36.090> good<00:01:36.240> system<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.779> got

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
this is a really good system it's got

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.239 
this is a really good system it's got
plenty<00:01:37.109> of<00:01:37.319> air<00:01:37.469> flow<00:01:37.649> so<00:01:37.799> you're<00:01:38.099> not

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
plenty of air flow so you're not

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:39.499 
plenty of air flow so you're not
compressing<00:01:38.609> the<00:01:38.849> flame<00:01:39.090> you're<00:01:39.389> not

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
compressing the flame you're not

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.080 
compressing the flame you're not
restricting<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.200> combustion<00:01:41.189> between<00:01:41.969> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
restricting the combustion between the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.269 
restricting the combustion between the
mix<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.569> air<00:01:42.719> and<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> gas<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.979> raised

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:44.279 
mix of the air and the gas it's raised

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:46.309 
mix of the air and the gas it's raised
above<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.789> weather<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.209> really<00:01:45.479> extreme<00:01:46.109> heat

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
above it weather is really extreme heat

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.479 
above it weather is really extreme heat
going<00:01:46.590> right<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.009> what<00:01:47.130> I'm<00:01:47.219> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.369> do

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:47.489 
going right to the what I'm going to do

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:50.239 
going right to the what I'm going to do
now<00:01:47.700> I'm<00:01:47.849> just<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.179> do<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.359> quick<00:01:49.249> quick

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
now I'm just going to do a quick quick

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.149 
now I'm just going to do a quick quick
stir<00:01:50.489> fry<00:01:50.929> this<00:01:51.929> is<00:01:52.109> not<00:01:52.259> an<00:01:52.409> example<00:01:52.919> of<00:01:53.009> how

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
stir fry this is not an example of how

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.339 
stir fry this is not an example of how
to<00:01:53.219> walk<00:01:53.520> up<00:01:53.759> trust<00:01:54.119> me<00:01:54.239> i<00:01:54.419> do<00:01:54.539> not<00:01:54.779> have
