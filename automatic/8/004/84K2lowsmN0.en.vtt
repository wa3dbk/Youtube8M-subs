look like a pass interference to me Dez
Bryant's<00:01:50.880> catch<00:01:51.149> was<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> catch<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.500> only

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
Bryant's catch was a catch the only

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.670 
Bryant's catch was a catch the only
reason<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.490> wasn't<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:54.030> casual<00:01:54.479> as<00:01:54.540> Dez<00:01:54.780> decided

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
reason it wasn't a casual as Dez decided

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.440 
reason it wasn't a casual as Dez decided
to<00:01:56.189> extend<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.880> little<00:01:57.030> bit<00:01:57.240> more<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.950> try<00:01:58.950> to
