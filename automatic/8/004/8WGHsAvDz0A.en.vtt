00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.920
 greet you subscribers and just 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.280
 effect of me watching this video speech 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.790
 will go about such a puzzle 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.219
 how is gear shift itself 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.830
 a little confusing at first the names but about 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.640
 I'll explain a little later this 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.740
 puzzle 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:27.240
 invented our well-known comrade 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.820
 it was Oscar vanda screw and head to by 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.110
 Essentially is to buy a sofa and 2 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.420
 outfitted with gears however rotates 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.120
 this cube and absolutely since 2 by 2 then 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.260
 there is it connected and worn by the mechanism and in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.469
 what's the trick of this cube 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.260
 The trick is that all the details but absolutely 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.289
 interconnected and involve from not 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.820
 the detail we get here is about something 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:01.109
 here is of course mixed 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 looped and here begins the ships 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.070
 yourself however notice if we will 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.930
 keep doing these actions in 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.470
 any side with whatever 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.740
 gears then sooner or later we 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.580
 cube will come in assembled and here's how 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.439
 In this case, it turned out 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.689
 in order to avoid this oscar 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.400
 orlando screw has supplied them this puzzle 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.470
 additional mechanism which 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.540
 allows you to share their criminal 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.310
 in half in any plane 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.290
 This is due to the fact that this is just 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.659
 column impossible to confuse as we would 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.520
 so screwed so that 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.060
 confusing puzzle is necessary 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.659
 periodically divide the cotton i equal 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.939
 half twist to 1 one half 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.640
 serve the other half of the concept 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.100
 remove something that 's shapeless 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.829
 about here it is then from collect 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.369
 actually this puzzle was bought 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.060
 alexander borisenko 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.219
 On air she is very rare indeed 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.090
 almost nowhere impossible to get at one 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.780
 chinese site 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.750
 that's why I am 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.270
 after all we add alexander for what 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.970
 he is grateful and who will he be plus not 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.150
 only Lenin tear for him too 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.819
 special thanks color scheme to this 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.620
 the puzzle is different from the standard well 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.420
 apparently because it's a fake version 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.069
 not to violate copyright 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.840
 at least you what a violation 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.480
 Copyright all gathered in feel 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.950
 Well, it doesn’t matter 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.250
 that the head is actually very and 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.940
 very entertaining if you divide to interfere 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.550
 fructis she seems very cool 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.430
 good as he just stood on today 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.160
 stop and when its just all was going 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.230
 stared in horror and we just looked at 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.760
 it is a miracle that it is not understood in 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.480
 naturally people usually don't know about 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.310
 the existence of similar yearling 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.920
 but as for this puzzle 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.239
 This puzzle as I said on 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.370
 correct color scheme 200 kim on it 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.500
 not very good quality therefore in 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.160
 this video i also want to ask you 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.590
 guys maybe someone can slice 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.480
 I like these stickers here 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.720
 fluorescent and so if someone 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.549
 can write me 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.299
 agree on her what and how much 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.549
 will cost 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.380
 That's because the stickers are all the same I want 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.230
 so that these speakers were 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.180
 beautiful and now these are now fast from 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.780
 3 fingers held 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.840
 on the eve of very exactly Latin prepare 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.840
 what it all looks like you need to mix 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.340
 actually how to put together this race I don’t 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.920
 I know I watched the video 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.810
 he explains it to Tsykov when 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:59.890
 put together I do not remember the accuracy of it 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:03.190
 talked about twitter so now i will 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.079
 revise here i'm trying to collect this 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.000
 puzzle you're going on principle 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.600
 quite elementary i think the first layer 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.630
 it will not be difficult to assemble 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.970
 short in flowers be cool spin 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.049
 turn around 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.780
 ready us a couple formed here and 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.920
 we will turn the second part 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:29.520
 against against spin spinning spinning 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:34.770
 twist joke twist and twist twist 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.110
 still twist another twist crucian wife 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.990
 Immediately I attached 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.040
 but still he is not going to 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.640
 got together 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.930
 this is our first layer 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.710
 spreading on another plane and trying 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.980
 gather side here with this twist 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.460
 we cool we twist we twist we twist 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:59.850
 function twist great and it turns out 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.790
 Here we have such a situation 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.230
 such a stay 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.140
 two gears is the most problematic 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.970
 the situation must be put every gear 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.940
 separately thanks to some 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.910
 algorithm which I tell you 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.770
 tsykov well well let's try from the us 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.690
 collect and hope you enjoyed it 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.850
