00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:13.480
 hello girls how are you today I come to 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:16.539
 show a new set that I made of the 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.200
 loco de mario bros good we will apply 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.740
 background the desired color 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.110
 and we will do with our eyeliner our 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.310
 decorator or a brush that we had 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:32.630
 cut well thin we are going to do in 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.630
 shape of a small square 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.430
 so that it's like the face of our 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.430
 shout ready 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.609
 choose the color they like in 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.040
 this case I chose this because if I 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.040
 the 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.040
 recommended 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.890
 it's not that I liked it at all but 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.890
 I hope that if you like it 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.330
 now we will apply 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:11.510
 a little color like skin 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.810
 It can be a clear process 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:19.680
 and we will continue drawing 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.700
 in the head of oblivion as the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.560
 little hat 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.560
 we will make it oval 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:41.390
 and we will apply color for our hat 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.729
 the one they prefer most can be red 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.899
 can be blue in this case I chose a 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:51.229
 rosadito frosty and now yes with the 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.549
 tip of a brush or something that 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.460
 let's have the unit, let's do some 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.180
 public 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.070
 whites and now we decorate this one 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.150
 and then we make the eyes with 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.760
 our brush redondito but acostadito 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.500
 not stopped the brush but small 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.550
 so that our eyes remain as 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.400
 elongated 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.700

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.010
