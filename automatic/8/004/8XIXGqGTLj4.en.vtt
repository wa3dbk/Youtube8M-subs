00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.129
 now 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.040
 now 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.220
 now that they at the same time 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.470
 hi everyone today I 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.780
 find for a new video and that 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.060
 will be a hairdressing tutorial for the 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.430
 back home as you know I am 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.380
 really a quiche in hairstyle I do not 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.760
 capped know it really happened to me 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.580
 very very rarely to do 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.010
 sophisticated hairstyles and there I had 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.390
 I made a nice little hairstyle 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.370
 since a few days I do this 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.739
 and I think she's really great 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.230
 quick to do and that it can be 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.480
 nice for him so I think that 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.430
 you guessed it's video will be a 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.770
 tutor the hairstyles and that will be the 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.810
 last in the back to school series that 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.489
 I'm doing on my channel really thanks 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.810
 thank you thank you and I know I have not 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.420
 delay to thank you 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.770
 a contest may not come 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.170
 because I really do not have the 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.550
 time I have to focus on 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.170
 other personal things but hey what 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.690
 is not the subject of the video 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.820
 so that's it if you want to know how 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.530
 I make them this super simple hairstyle 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.500
 do not hesitate to follow the explanations 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.770
 who will follow right after so this is 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.080
 left the first step but I do them 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.690
 gold camara since otherwise his letter or 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.620
 Too long is to smooth your hair 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.510
 and if you do not need it 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.880
 to straighten your hair you can jump 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.330
 this step so for this hairstyle 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.390
 you need a rubber band of one 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.780
 clamp of a flat clamp a coil on 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.330
 call that and a brush and if you 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.460
 want to put an accessory in I 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.310
 do you want to put a headband so that one 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.140
 here for example I you 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.149
 already spoken you can put what 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.590
 you want it is this hairstyle to super 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.960
 simple affair she releases anyway 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.960
 not bad the face and besides it is 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.899
 really super quick to do so that's 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.660
 party so first of all i'm going to brushed 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.030
 my hair backwards 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.220
 so you ask not if I look on 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.220
 this side is because I have my ice cream 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:24.150
 as this is what we are going to do 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.880
 we're going to take the hair from 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.910
 above like these we will take 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.350
 also here 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.840
 this is also on this side here be sure to 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.900
 even though it is very even on the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:50.010
 on it and then when we are going to arrive 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:57.950
 here we will take hair from there so 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:03:00.989
 you have one that me aloud has it 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:11.310
 then you take your brush and you 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:16.319
 Lily is simply it's still 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.660
 better than everything is smooth and that's it for 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.980
 this step and then simply 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:28.680
 you will come 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:31.260
 tie the hair behind you 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.900
 surely ask why I used 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.120
 the flat clip is simply 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.100
 to be able to attach mameche since I 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.200
 know that if I do that or if I'm going 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.900
 move my hair I know he's going there 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.910
 still have some small wicks 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.760
 who will fall when I was enough and 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.769
 I will remove the bad guys too far 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.849
 of the hull we can call that I do not 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:56.590
 do not know how 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:58.450
 if you have tarnished title that me 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.550
 it's nice if you're a little bit 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.410
 complexed with cold and want 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:12.519
 hide a little intimate and other 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:17.519
 funds are released fairly when 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:19.840
 even here is where you have your wick 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.030
 we would go high school but it's not 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.190
 serious 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:29.440
 so you can the tree it's a small 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.389
 little and after passed in your fingers and 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.040
 then simply what you 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.430
 go do it's come the task is on 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.180
 the side 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.639
 so that's what it gives so we have 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.800
 still something we have the 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.360
 ears a little loose we have the 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.000
 face full of clear no one has 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.760
 hair falling on the face but 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.520
 we still have a nice enough effect 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:05:00.130
 so I show you what it gives 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.870
 behind it you like a jewel I 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.190
 can you give a little advice it's 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.590
 to wear earrings 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.470
 dangling so that's it's decoudra 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:13.300
 candlestick that I had bought from me and 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:15.490
