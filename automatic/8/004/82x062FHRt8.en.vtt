bit concerned for Microsoft let's just

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.250 
bit concerned for Microsoft let's just
talk<00:03:11.980> this<00:03:12.010> through<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.390> ps4<00:03:13.660> launches

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
talk this through so the ps4 launches

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.320 
talk this through so the ps4 launches
one<00:03:14.470> week<00:03:14.650> before<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.190> xbox<00:03:15.580> one<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.150> ps4

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
one week before the xbox one and the ps4

also launches a hundred dollars less now

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.810 
also launches a hundred dollars less now
my<00:03:19.840> thought<00:03:20.079> process<00:03:20.560> would<00:03:20.739> be<00:03:20.799> if<00:03:21.160> anything

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
my thought process would be if anything

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.150 
my thought process would be if anything
Microsoft<00:03:22.360> at<00:03:22.630> coming<00:03:23.019> in<00:03:23.170> in<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.560> higher<00:03:23.739> price

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
Microsoft at coming in in a higher price

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.640 
Microsoft at coming in in a higher price
point<00:03:24.430> would<00:03:25.030> want<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.360> launch<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.750> one<00:03:26.200> two

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
point would want to launch it one two

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.890 
point would want to launch it one two
three<00:03:26.980> or<00:03:27.489> maybe<00:03:27.579> even<00:03:27.730> four<00:03:28.180> weeks<00:03:28.420> before

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
three or maybe even four weeks before

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.750 
three or maybe even four weeks before
the<00:03:29.019> PlayStation<00:03:29.560> 4<00:03:29.890> because<00:03:30.370> then<00:03:30.549> at<00:03:30.670> that

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
the PlayStation 4 because then at that

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.860 
the PlayStation 4 because then at that
point<00:03:30.820> you're<00:03:31.120> going<00:03:31.239> to<00:03:31.329> get<00:03:31.420> people<00:03:31.780> who

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870
