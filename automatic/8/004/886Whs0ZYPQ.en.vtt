this cube icon and click it and that

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.990 
this cube icon and click it and that
will<00:00:51.090> drop<00:00:51.300> down<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.570> cube<00:00:51.930> make<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.649> taller

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
will drop down a cube make this taller

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.709 
will drop down a cube make this taller
make<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.180> wider<00:00:54.920> longer<00:00:56.390> just<00:00:57.390> make<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.660> a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.279 
make it wider longer just make this a
pretty<00:00:58.050> good<00:00:58.260> sized<00:00:58.410> cube<00:00:58.770> here<00:01:00.289> almost

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
pretty good sized cube here almost

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.760 
pretty good sized cube here almost
rectangular<00:01:04.220> okay<00:01:05.220> now<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.640> bring<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.030> up

rectangular okay now just bring it up

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.310 
rectangular okay now just bring it up
above<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> floor<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.810> need<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.930> make<00:01:10.110> this

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
above the floor here I need to make this

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.690 
above the floor here I need to make this
a<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.770> bit<00:01:10.979> smaller<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:13.549> don't<00:01:14.549> know<00:01:14.640> you

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
a little bit smaller I don't know you

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.070 
a little bit smaller I don't know you
just<00:01:14.909> kind<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.299> hide<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.659> yourself

now we're going to come down here create

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.149 
now we're going to come down here create
a<00:01:18.180> material<00:01:18.590> we're<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> check<00:01:19.979> off

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
a material we're going to check off

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.710 
a material we're going to check off
specular<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.799> change<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> color<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.720> 150

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
specular and change the color to 150

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.010 
specular and change the color to 150
percent<00:01:25.369> just<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.119> drag<00:01:27.900> this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
percent just like that and drag this

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.289 
percent just like that and drag this
onto<00:01:28.229> your<00:01:28.320> cube<00:01:31.100> okay<00:01:32.100> now<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.790> zoom<00:01:33.060> into

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
onto your cube okay now just zoom into

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.480 
onto your cube okay now just zoom into
the<00:01:33.600> zoom<00:01:34.259> into<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> cube<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.100> till<00:01:35.400> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the zoom into the cube so you till you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.359 
the zoom into the cube so you till you
see<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> grid<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.650> keep<00:01:37.799> zooming<00:01:37.979> till<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
see a grid so just keep zooming till you

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.800 
see a grid so just keep zooming till you
see<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.700> right<00:01:38.909> there<00:01:38.939> that's<00:01:39.450> all<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.689> did

come down to the cube icon again drop
down<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> plane<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:06.680> create<00:02:07.680> another<00:02:07.829> new

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
down a plane and create another new

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.889 
down a plane and create another new
material<00:02:08.489> real<00:02:08.610> quick<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.000> we're<00:02:09.720> going<00:02:09.840> to

material real quick and we're going to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.650 
material real quick and we're going to
check<00:02:10.080> on<00:02:11.900> luminance<00:02:12.900> here

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
check on luminance here

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.260 
check on luminance here
bring<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:13.960> up<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.320> 200%<00:02:14.830> luminance<00:02:16.020> okay<00:02:17.020> and

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
bring this up to 200% luminance okay and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.610 
bring this up to 200% luminance okay and
with<00:02:19.270> their<00:02:19.390> plane<00:02:19.630> selected<00:02:20.200> we're<00:02:20.410> going<00:02:20.560> to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
with their plane selected we're going to

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.920 
with their plane selected we're going to
have<00:02:20.710> to<00:02:20.800> mograph<00:02:21.220> go<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.610> cloner<00:02:21.880> drag<00:02:22.780> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
have to mograph go to cloner drag the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.570 
have to mograph go to cloner drag the
plane<00:02:23.170> into<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.710> cloner<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.500> if<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.370> want<00:02:27.520> to

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
plane into the cloner and if you want to

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.070 
plane into the cloner and if you want to
bring<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:27.820> up<00:02:28.030> just<00:02:28.240> click<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.540> cloner<00:02:28.780> so

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
bring this up just click the cloner so

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.950 
bring this up just click the cloner so
it<00:02:29.200> moves<00:02:29.650> all<00:02:29.800> three<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.130> them<00:02:30.780> now<00:02:31.780> we're

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
it moves all three of them now we're

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.580 
it moves all three of them now we're
just<00:02:32.020> going<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.230> change<00:02:32.500> this<00:02:34.320> change<00:02:35.320> the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
just going to change this change the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.940 
just going to change this change the
count<00:02:35.920> go<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.790> grid<00:02:37.360> array<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.870> change<00:02:38.830> the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
count go to grid array and change the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.840 
count go to grid array and change the
count<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.310> two<00:02:39.520> by<00:02:39.820> one<00:02:40.410> by<00:02:41.410> two

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
count to two by one by two

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.830 
count to two by one by two
all<00:02:42.850> right<00:02:42.970> now<00:02:43.210> we're<00:02:43.360> just<00:02:43.510> going<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.660> have

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
all right now we're just going to have

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.230 
all right now we're just going to have
to<00:02:43.960> stretch<00:02:44.380> this<00:02:44.590> out<00:02:46.890> something<00:02:47.890> like<00:02:47.980> that

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
to stretch this out something like that

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.430 
to stretch this out something like that
and<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.650> can<00:02:50.860> see<00:02:51.600> we've<00:02:52.600> got<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:53.140> right

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
and so you can see we've got that right

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.970 
and so you can see we've got that right
there<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:58.230> we<00:02:59.230> need<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.470> bring<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.740> a<00:02:59.770> little

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
there and we need to bring it a little

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.050 
there and we need to bring it a little
bit<00:03:00.130> closer<00:03:02.100> now<00:03:03.100> this<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.460> up<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:03.850> guys

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.070 

I'm<00:03:07.060> just<00:03:07.120> going<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.390> do<00:03:07.510> something<00:03:07.780> like<00:03:07.840> that

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
I'm just going to do something like that

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.120 
I'm just going to do something like that

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
and then I'm just going to bring this up

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.260 
and then I'm just going to bring this up
to<00:03:12.130> where<00:03:12.160> it's<00:03:12.490> still<00:03:12.730> kind<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.030> in<00:03:13.180> the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
to where it's still kind of in the

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:24.360 
to where it's still kind of in the
camera's<00:03:13.630> view<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.950> I'm<00:03:23.950> going<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.130> bring<00:03:24.280> it

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
camera's view and I'm going to bring it

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.720 
camera's view and I'm going to bring it
back<00:03:24.520> do<00:03:25.450> apologize<00:03:25.959> for<00:03:25.990> my<00:03:26.260> computer

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
back do apologize for my computer

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.880 
back do apologize for my computer
freezing<00:03:27.730> up<00:03:27.820> here<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.660> seems<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.530> do<00:03:29.709> that

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
freezing up here it seems to do that

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.560 
freezing up here it seems to do that
quite<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.130> bit<00:03:30.310> when<00:03:30.490> I<00:03:30.520> record<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.240> I<00:03:31.450> do

there just so it's kind of like in the

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.110 
there just so it's kind of like in the
camera's<00:03:41.920> view<00:03:42.100> just<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.550> little<00:03:42.760> bit<00:03:42.850> of<00:03:42.970> it

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
camera's view just a little bit of it

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.270 
camera's view just a little bit of it
out<00:03:43.720> this<00:03:44.020> material<00:03:44.200> we<00:03:44.560> created<00:03:44.890> down<00:03:45.010> here

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
out this material we created down here

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.100 
out this material we created down here
the<00:03:45.459> one<00:03:45.640> with<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:46.000> luminance<00:03:46.630> checked<00:03:46.930> on

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
the one with the luminance checked on

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.229 
the one with the luminance checked on
and<00:03:47.410> 200%<00:03:48.280> just<00:03:49.239> drag<00:03:49.570> this<00:03:49.810> onto<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:52.000> plane

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
and 200% just drag this onto the plane

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.990 
and 200% just drag this onto the plane
here<00:03:52.510> onto<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.140> plane<00:03:53.520> but<00:03:54.520> now<00:03:54.640> whenever<00:03:54.820> you

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
here onto the plane but now whenever you

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.850 
here onto the plane but now whenever you
have<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.300> ambient<00:03:56.110> occlusion<00:03:56.290> in<00:03:56.590> global

have a ambient occlusion in global
illumination<00:03:57.010> checked<00:03:57.610> on<00:03:57.790> we<00:03:58.480> can<00:03:58.600> go<00:03:58.690> ahead

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
illumination checked on we can go ahead

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.810 
illumination checked on we can go ahead
and<00:03:58.900> press<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.290> render<00:03:59.800> preview<00:04:00.250> button<00:04:00.640> and

and press the render preview button and

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.800 
and press the render preview button and
this<00:04:01.540> should<00:04:01.720> give<00:04:01.810> us<00:04:01.989> a<00:04:02.110> nice<00:04:02.320> little

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
this should give us a nice little

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.360 
this should give us a nice little
lighting<00:04:04.810> lighting<00:04:05.380> studio<00:04:05.680> here<00:04:06.070> that<00:04:06.220> looks

looks pretty good so you can see here

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.380 
looks pretty good so you can see here
we've<00:04:11.290> got<00:04:11.500> those<00:04:12.070> kind<00:04:12.459> of<00:04:12.640> box<00:04:12.970> looking

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
we've got those kind of box looking

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.020 
we've got those kind of box looking
effect<00:04:13.660> here<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.590> we've<00:04:15.220> got<00:04:15.400> some<00:04:15.610> shadows

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
effect here and we've got some shadows

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.360 
effect here and we've got some shadows
on<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.270> wall<00:04:16.540> and<00:04:16.930> it's<00:04:17.830> going<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.010> darker

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
on the wall and it's going to darker

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.090 
on the wall and it's going to darker
gray<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:18.820> then<00:04:18.910> here<00:04:19.120> it's<00:04:19.239> kind<00:04:19.450> of<00:04:19.510> lighter

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
gray and then here it's kind of lighter

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.170 
gray and then here it's kind of lighter
now<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.160> make<00:04:21.520> this<00:04:21.640> a<00:04:21.700> little<00:04:21.910> bit<00:04:22.060> more

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
now to make this a little bit more

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.920 
now to make this a little bit more
impressive<00:04:22.419> we<00:04:23.080> can<00:04:23.350> drop<00:04:23.890> down<00:04:24.160> a<00:04:24.630> sphere

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
impressive we can drop down a sphere

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.030 
impressive we can drop down a sphere
and<00:04:28.360> I'm<00:04:29.360> not<00:04:29.540> I<00:04:29.570> spend<00:04:30.440> much<00:04:30.560> time<00:04:30.590> on<00:04:30.919> this

color<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.800> whatever<00:04:42.979> you<00:04:43.190> want<00:04:43.370> so<00:04:43.669> I'm<00:04:43.970> going

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
color to whatever you want so I'm going

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.770 
color to whatever you want so I'm going
to<00:04:44.150> make<00:04:44.300> this<00:04:44.479> a<00:04:45.100> red<00:04:46.100> sphere<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:47.479> I'm<00:04:47.630> going

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
to make this a red sphere and I'm going

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.570 
to make this a red sphere and I'm going
to<00:04:47.840> come<00:04:47.930> down<00:04:47.960> here<00:04:48.199> to<00:04:48.350> reflection<00:04:48.919> and<00:04:49.100> I'll

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
to come down here to reflection and I'll

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.350 
to come down here to reflection and I'll
do<00:04:49.760> about<00:04:50.590> 50%<00:04:51.590> and<00:04:52.580> maybe<00:04:52.790> a<00:04:52.880> little<00:04:53.030> bit<00:04:53.180> too

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
do about 50% and maybe a little bit too

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.460 
do about 50% and maybe a little bit too
much<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:53.660> don't<00:04:53.720> know<00:04:53.840> I'll<00:04:54.050> do<00:04:54.229> do<00:04:55.160> 45<00:04:56.199> okay<00:04:57.199> and

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
much I don't know I'll do do 45 okay and

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.490 
much I don't know I'll do do 45 okay and
now<00:04:58.040> that<00:04:58.160> we<00:04:58.250> have<00:04:58.370> that<00:04:58.520> we<00:04:58.910> can<00:04:58.940> just<00:05:02.320> well

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
now that we have that we can just well

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.080 
now that we have that we can just well
guess<00:05:03.740> my<00:05:03.889> sphere<00:05:04.070> got<00:05:04.340> deleted<00:05:04.550> somehow<00:05:05.590> odd

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
guess my sphere got deleted somehow odd

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.310 
guess my sphere got deleted somehow odd
so<00:05:08.090> I'm<00:05:08.210> going<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.389> go<00:05:08.539> and<00:05:08.840> create<00:05:09.020> another

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
so I'm going to go and create another

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.870 
so I'm going to go and create another
sphere<00:05:11.800> now<00:05:12.800> I'm<00:05:12.919> going<00:05:13.070> to<00:05:13.130> drag<00:05:13.280> this<00:05:13.490> onto

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
sphere now I'm going to drag this onto

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.529 
sphere now I'm going to drag this onto
the<00:05:14.180> sphere<00:05:14.240> and<00:05:15.310> if<00:05:16.310> we<00:05:16.580> render<00:05:16.850> preview<00:05:17.240> that

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
the sphere and if we render preview that

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:18.670 
the sphere and if we render preview that
we<00:05:17.840> should<00:05:18.020> have<00:05:18.169> some<00:05:18.380> pretty<00:05:18.530> nice

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
we should have some pretty nice

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:25.600 
we should have some pretty nice
reflections<00:05:19.310> on<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.840> on<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:21.020> sphere<00:05:21.289> here<00:05:24.610> so

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
reflections on the on the sphere here so

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.400 
reflections on the on the sphere here so
as<00:05:25.729> you<00:05:25.880> can<00:05:25.940> see<00:05:26.000> there<00:05:26.389> we've<00:05:26.870> kind<00:05:27.139> of<00:05:27.199> got

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
as you can see there we've kind of got

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.680 
as you can see there we've kind of got
these<00:05:28.160> lights<00:05:28.460> reflecting<00:05:29.030> off<00:05:29.150> of<00:05:29.180> this<00:05:29.389> ball

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
these lights reflecting off of this ball

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.260 
these lights reflecting off of this ball
and<00:05:29.960> then<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:30.830> ball<00:05:31.039> actually<00:05:31.639> reflecting

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
and then the ball actually reflecting

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.390 
and then the ball actually reflecting
the<00:05:32.630> floor<00:05:32.840> in<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.200> walls<00:05:33.470> so<00:05:33.770> that<00:05:34.039> does<00:05:34.220> look

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
the floor in the walls so that does look

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.089 
the floor in the walls so that does look
quite<00:05:34.639> nice<00:05:35.590> and<00:05:38.229> you<00:05:39.229> know<00:05:39.349> you<00:05:39.440> can<00:05:39.710> you<00:05:39.950> can

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
quite nice and you know you can you can

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.390 
quite nice and you know you can you can
play<00:05:40.220> around<00:05:40.430> with<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:40.760> brightness<00:05:41.270> and<00:05:41.570> the

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
play around with the brightness and the

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.270 
play around with the brightness and the
you<00:05:43.400> know<00:05:43.580> other<00:05:44.450> reflection<00:05:45.169> you<00:05:46.070> know<00:05:46.099> you

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
you know other reflection you know you

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.550 
you know other reflection you know you
turn<00:05:46.520> it<00:05:46.639> down<00:05:46.789> and<00:05:47.660> it<00:05:47.750> won't<00:05:47.870> reflect<00:05:48.229> near

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
turn it down and it won't reflect near

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.750 
turn it down and it won't reflect near
as<00:05:48.680> much<00:05:50.860> or<00:05:51.860> reflected<00:05:52.520> near<00:05:52.700> as<00:05:52.820> brightly

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
as much or reflected near as brightly

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.930 
as much or reflected near as brightly
but<00:05:55.760> whenever<00:05:56.240> we're<00:05:56.690> in<00:05:56.720> a<00:05:56.840> preview<00:05:57.139> this<00:05:57.940> you

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
but whenever we're in a preview this you

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.189 
but whenever we're in a preview this you
can<00:05:59.090> see<00:05:59.240> that<00:05:59.389> gives<00:05:59.510> us<00:05:59.690> a<00:05:59.810> nice<00:05:59.960> little

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
can see that gives us a nice little

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.860 
can see that gives us a nice little
reflection<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:01.460> you<00:06:02.330> know<00:06:02.419> you<00:06:02.479> can<00:06:02.720> play

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
reflection and you know you can play

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.839 
reflection and you know you can play
around<00:06:03.050> with<00:06:03.199> the<00:06:03.380> spacing<00:06:03.860> of<00:06:04.010> the<00:06:04.070> planes<00:06:04.610> up

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
around with the spacing of the planes up

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:06.670 
around with the spacing of the planes up
here<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.330> lights<00:06:05.570> to<00:06:06.139> make<00:06:06.260> this<00:06:06.410> look

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
here the lights to make this look

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.710 
here the lights to make this look
different<00:06:07.160> but<00:06:07.789> that's<00:06:08.090> essentially<00:06:08.599> the

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
different but that's essentially the

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.159 
different but that's essentially the
look<00:06:08.900> we're<00:06:09.050> going<00:06:09.080> for<00:06:09.349> so<00:06:10.280> that<00:06:11.000> was<00:06:11.120> a

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
look we're going for so that was a

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.900 
look we're going for so that was a
really<00:06:12.169> fairly<00:06:12.530> simple<00:06:12.650> to<00:06:13.039> do<00:06:13.190> and<00:06:13.430> as<00:06:13.880> a

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
really fairly simple to do and as a

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.129 
really fairly simple to do and as a
really<00:06:14.270> nice<00:06:14.479> effect<00:06:14.690> so<00:06:16.720> if<00:06:17.720> you<00:06:17.870> like<00:06:18.020> this

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139 
really nice effect so if you like this
