00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.820
 a beautiful cloth bow is one of the 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:05.259
 most refined grind and works 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.089
 especially at christmas time a lot 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.070
 festive they need for this 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.719
 loop about a meter long 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.849
 loop a little faster 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.650
 about 50 centimeters long band 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.140
 and another even thinner band 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.730
 In addition, a stable scissors pins 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.510
 as an aid and some stars to 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.820
 decoration 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.550
 how do you go first the loop tape 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.260
 and her hand should be here 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.260
 About six nights sleep arise 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.600
 Now carefully strip the tape 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.310
 by saying knocking on a level 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.110
 Underlay make sure that the 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.480
 loops lie clean on top of each other 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.300
 Now put the resulting circle in 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.770
 the middle together and fold it with 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.600
 sharp scissors cut them 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.600
 now the corners on the case stop 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.049
 Take a pin for help and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.049
 fix the bend in the middle 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.890
 place the grinding banks 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.570
 fasten them in the middle of the diaper strap 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.570
 it by means of a double knot 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.409
 now remove the pin as well 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.409
 if you have used one 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.240
 Now they are in the loops and 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.040
 pulling each individually to the outside through 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.049
 you can easily turn and pinch 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.049
 the individual loops a beautiful form 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.980
 put the resulting loop 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.930
 center on your gift and knot it 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.930
 The band is tied to the bottom 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.200
 now knot some of the decoration stars 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.200
 stuck on the thin band 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.190
 then attach the decoration 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.190
 tied to the ribbon of the loop 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.440
 in this way can be packet and 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.330
 especially at christmas time 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.330
 elegant and festive decorate
