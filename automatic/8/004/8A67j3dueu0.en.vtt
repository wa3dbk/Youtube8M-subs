left brain talk right brain banks and
this<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.819> something<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.479> do<00:01:03.600> to

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
this is something you can do to

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:05.509 
this is something you can do to
reinforce<00:01:03.989> yourself<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:05.129> take<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
reinforce yourself to take that

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.399 
reinforce yourself to take that
analytical<00:01:06.150> eye<00:01:06.180> make<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.510> work<00:01:06.690> so<00:01:07.170> again

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
analytical eye make it work so again

brain is busy banking just like that now
we'll<00:01:12.240> go<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.329> the<00:01:12.450> other<00:01:12.600> side<00:01:12.869> here<00:01:13.079> so<00:01:13.950> you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
we'll go to the other side here so you

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.550 
we'll go to the other side here so you
want<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.280> bank<00:01:14.460> them<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:15.149> the<00:01:15.270> left<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
want to bank them to the left and to the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.679 
want to bank them to the left and to the
right<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.610> reason<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.030> because<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.479> want

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
right and the reason is because you want

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.760 
right and the reason is because you want
to<00:01:18.780> get<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.990> brain<00:01:19.320> work<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.649> both

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
to get that brain work in both

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.679 
to get that brain work in both
directions<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.909> becomes<00:01:21.299> very<00:01:21.479> very

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
directions so that becomes very very

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.749 
directions so that becomes very very
consistent<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.469> you<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.189> here<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.430> go

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
consistent for you so here we go

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.580 
consistent for you so here we go
