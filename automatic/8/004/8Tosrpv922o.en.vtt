00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.090
 pursuits in a car is next to it

 holes 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.280
 also belongs to the specific 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.030
 traffic behavior while calling 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.440

 I think the first left on me left 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.360
 recordings are on the doorstep because I can 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.390
 my lawyers

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.330
 these directors are putters 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.100
 very good at it too 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.200
 ignore what you say to them and quickly 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.820
 eventually start talking about something else 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.070
 does not deliver the conversation with the lawyer 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.480
 something concrete but the pressure is one 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.480
 bit of the chain and ham 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.830
 well then I will continue with the matter 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.830
 for which we are past the odds 2 0 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.960
 we must now make a mark on it 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.960

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.129
 reason when you cross the old IJssel bridge 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.650
 The traffic had been searching for quite some time 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.650
 time to increase that with you 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.090
 The table is also drawn up in an official report 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.280

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.630
 replies required from the doorbell 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.630

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.349

 explanations

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.170
 made a positive contribution 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.819
 deliver to road safety on the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.740
 short term at least not so 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.580
