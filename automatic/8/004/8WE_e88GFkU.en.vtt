hi<00:00:08.250> today<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.790> want<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.000> talk<00:00:09.150> about<00:00:09.330> the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
hi today I want to talk about the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.970 
hi today I want to talk about the
desktop<00:00:09.900> overture<00:00:10.379> with<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.680> vision

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
desktop overture with the vision

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.039 
desktop overture with the vision
tracking<00:00:11.190> starter<00:00:11.639> kit<00:00:11.820> here<00:00:12.750> we've<00:00:12.869> got<00:00:12.990> our

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
tracking starter kit here we've got our

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.240 
tracking starter kit here we've got our
basic<00:00:13.320> Roma<00:00:13.770> trail

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
basic Roma trail

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.760 
basic Roma trail
it's<00:00:14.430> an<00:00:14.520> Arduino<00:00:14.850> based<00:00:15.059> platform<00:00:15.629> and<00:00:15.869> it's

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
it's an Arduino based platform and it's

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.710 
it's an Arduino based platform and it's
really<00:00:17.100> nice<00:00:17.279> because<00:00:17.550> once<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.150> program<00:00:18.570> it

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
really nice because once you program it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.900 
really nice because once you program it
can<00:00:18.960> run<00:00:19.080> independently<00:00:19.619> your<00:00:19.769> computer<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.880> I

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
can run independently your computer so I

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.550 
can run independently your computer so I
was<00:00:21.269> just<00:00:21.420> unplug<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.839> from<00:00:21.900> my<00:00:22.050> computer<00:00:22.380> once

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
was just unplug it from my computer once

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.409 
was just unplug it from my computer once
I<00:00:22.650> programmed<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.759> this<00:00:23.880> case<00:00:24.119> I've<00:00:24.390> got

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
I programmed it in this case I've got

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.900 
I programmed it in this case I've got
the<00:00:24.689> Nunchuk<00:00:25.140> program<00:00:25.589> routed<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.009> to<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.339> so<00:00:26.640> I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the Nunchuk program routed on to it so I

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.989 
the Nunchuk program routed on to it so I
can<00:00:27.240> use<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.449> nunchuck<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.960> control<00:00:28.289> it

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:28.999 
can use this nunchuck to control it

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.400 
can use this nunchuck to control it
sensor<00:00:29.999> shield<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.509> can<00:00:30.660> have<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:31.019> sorts<00:00:31.050> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
sensor shield so I can have all sorts of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.080 
sensor shield so I can have all sorts of
inputs<00:00:31.769> all<00:00:31.949> sorts<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.250> outputs<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.940> can

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
inputs all sorts of outputs and it can

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.660 
inputs all sorts of outputs and it can
independently<00:00:33.570> work<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.350> its<00:00:34.470> own<00:00:34.560> one<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
independently work on its own one of the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.090 
independently work on its own one of the
drawbacks<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.480> however<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.199> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
drawbacks is this however is that this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.920 
drawbacks is this however is that this
board<00:00:38.430> has<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.760> relatively<00:00:39.329> low<00:00:39.600> amount<00:00:39.870> of

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
board has a relatively low amount of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.450 
board has a relatively low amount of
processing<00:00:40.379> power<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.890> there<00:00:41.190> are<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> lot<00:00:41.430> of

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
processing power and there are a lot of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.430 
processing power and there are a lot of
devices<00:00:41.699> that<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.449> hook<00:00:42.660> up<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.870> say<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
devices that it can hook up to say a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.189 
devices that it can hook up to say a
webcam<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.399> that's<00:00:45.359> where<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.899> vision

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
webcam so that's where the vision

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.650 
webcam so that's where the vision
tracking<00:00:46.410> kit<00:00:47.010> comes<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:48.059> we've<00:00:48.210> got<00:00:48.390> here

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
tracking kit comes in so we've got here

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.170 
tracking kit comes in so we've got here
is<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.140> basic<00:00:49.500> turret<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.489> webcam<00:00:50.699> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
is the basic turret with a webcam and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.720 
is the basic turret with a webcam and
then<00:00:51.269> you<00:00:51.390> also<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.840> Robo<00:00:52.260> ROM<00:00:52.440> software<00:00:52.949> so

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
then you also get Robo ROM software so

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.490 
then you also get Robo ROM software so
what<00:00:54.269> we've<00:00:54.480> done<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.750> we've<00:00:55.050> loaded<00:00:55.289> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
what we've done is we've loaded a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.349 
what we've done is we've loaded a
program<00:00:55.920> onto<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.399> turret<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.879> allows<00:00:57.179> it

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
program onto the turret that allows it

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.970 
program onto the turret that allows it
to<00:00:57.390> act<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.840> an<00:00:57.960> extension<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:58.559> computer

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
to act as an extension of your computer

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.910 
to act as an extension of your computer
your<00:00:59.550> PC<00:01:00.000> will<00:01:00.179> send<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> commands<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.289> then<00:01:01.769> be

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
your PC will send a commands and then be

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.939 
your PC will send a commands and then be
able<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.129> control<00:01:02.550> your<00:01:02.940> servos<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:04.830> this

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
able to control your servos so what this

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.250 
able to control your servos so what this
allows<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.880> process<00:01:06.330> more<00:01:06.720> data<00:01:06.990> in

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
allows you to do is process more data in

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.170 
allows you to do is process more data in
this<00:01:07.380> case<00:01:07.440> we're<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.010> use<00:01:08.070> Rover<00:01:09.000> um

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
this case we're going to use Rover um

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.810 
this case we're going to use Rover um
software<00:01:09.660> to<00:01:09.780> process<00:01:10.050> webcam<00:01:10.860> data<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.640> then

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
software to process webcam data and then

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.790 
software to process webcam data and then
use<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.240> control<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.630> servos<00:01:13.080> that's

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
use it to control the servos that's

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.290 
use it to control the servos that's
going<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> allow<00:01:14.280> us<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.490> track<00:01:14.940> different

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
going to allow us to track different

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.630 
going to allow us to track different
objects<00:01:15.870> of<00:01:15.960> different<00:01:16.050> color<00:01:16.410> the<00:01:17.370> vision

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
objects of different color the vision

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.950 
objects of different color the vision
tracking<00:01:17.850> kit<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.450> gives<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.780> best

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
tracking kit really gives you the best

ease of use on Arduino board here we

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.850 
ease of use on Arduino board here we
have<00:01:27.120> our<00:01:27.240> Barone<00:01:27.600> software<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.440> as<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.710> can

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
have our Barone software and as you can

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.530 
have our Barone software and as you can
see<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.370> a<00:01:29.400> lot<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.640> different<00:01:30.150> modules

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
see we have a lot of different modules

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.870 
see we have a lot of different modules
we<00:01:30.660> can<00:01:30.840> work<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.230> so<00:01:32.040> here<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.610> our<00:01:32.700> main

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
we can work with so here in our main

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.910 
we can work with so here in our main
example<00:01:33.480> show<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.870> all<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.230> modules<00:01:34.410> we're

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
example show you all the modules we're

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.710 
example show you all the modules we're
using<00:01:35.190> to<00:01:35.580> get<00:01:36.210> our<00:01:36.420> color<00:01:36.600> tracking<00:01:38.720> here

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
using to get our color tracking here

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.390 
using to get our color tracking here
just<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.140> give<00:01:40.230> you<00:01:40.320> an<00:01:40.410> idea<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.100> show<00:01:41.370> you

just to give you an idea we can show you

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.220 
just to give you an idea we can show you
the<00:01:41.880> direct<00:01:42.690> control<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.200> servos<00:01:44.900> so<00:01:45.900> we'll

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
the direct control the servos so we'll

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.960 
the direct control the servos so we'll
leave<00:01:46.380> these<00:01:46.620> back<00:01:47.040> at<00:01:47.220> their<00:01:47.370> default<00:01:47.790> values

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
leave these back at their default values

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.430 
leave these back at their default values
here's<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> color<00:01:51.270> filter<00:01:51.750> that's<00:01:51.960> doing<00:01:52.260> all

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
here's the color filter that's doing all

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.440 
here's the color filter that's doing all
the<00:01:52.680> different<00:01:53.070> tracking<00:01:53.370> for<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.760> colors<00:01:54.090> so

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
the different tracking for the colors so

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.490 
the different tracking for the colors so
we<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.720> change<00:01:55.020> our<00:01:55.230> colors<00:01:55.560> here<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:57.500> then

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
we can change our colors here and then

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.920 
we can change our colors here and then
we<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:58.740> also<00:01:58.860> find<00:01:59.250> tuner<00:01:59.700> colors<00:02:00.120> so<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.690> we

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
we can also find tuner colors so if we

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.870 
we can also find tuner colors so if we
want<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.230> change<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.650> hue<00:02:02.010> so<00:02:02.370> we<00:02:02.490> get<00:02:02.670> more

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
want to change the hue so we get more

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.170 
want to change the hue so we get more
solid<00:02:03.360> colors<00:02:04.430> or<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.730> even<00:02:05.880> change<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
solid colors or we can even change the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.940 
solid colors or we can even change the
intensity<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.260> get<00:02:07.410> rid<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.620> sin<00:02:07.830> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
intensity to get rid of sin that

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.430 
intensity to get rid of sin that
background<00:02:08.369> noise

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.890 

this<00:02:12.100> blob<00:02:12.430> size<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.240> for<00:02:13.420> us<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.750> make

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
this blob size is just for us to make

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.030 
this blob size is just for us to make
sure<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.290> we're<00:02:14.410> getting<00:02:14.590> appropriate

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
sure that we're getting appropriate

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.220 
sure that we're getting appropriate
sized<00:02:15.460> objects<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.180> helps<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.630> cut<00:02:16.810> down<00:02:16.840> on

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
sized objects this helps to cut down on

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.590 
sized objects this helps to cut down on
smaller<00:02:17.590> objects<00:02:18.160> so<00:02:18.790> things<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.240> we<00:02:19.450> don't

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
smaller objects so things that we don't

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.780 
smaller objects so things that we don't
really<00:02:19.720> want<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.350> be<00:02:20.500> tracked<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.550> center

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
really want to be tracked and the center

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.400 
really want to be tracked and the center
of<00:02:21.910> gravity<00:02:22.060> shows<00:02:22.660> us<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.080> center<00:02:23.260> of

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
of gravity shows us the center of

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.410 
of gravity shows us the center of
gravity<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.830> being<00:02:24.160> calculated<00:02:24.580> from<00:02:25.090> that

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
gravity is being calculated from that

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.980 
gravity is being calculated from that
code<00:02:26.170> tracking<00:02:27.150> here<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:28.360> programming

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
code tracking here this programming

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.930 
code tracking here this programming
module<00:02:29.170> allows<00:02:29.860> us<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.250> do<00:02:30.370> all<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:30.670> the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
module allows us to do all of the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.820 
module allows us to do all of the
translations<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:31.840> we<00:02:31.960> can<00:02:32.110> take<00:02:32.320> that<00:02:32.470> center

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
translations so we can take that center

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.950 
translations so we can take that center
of<00:02:32.890> gravity<00:02:32.980> information<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.420> then<00:02:34.690> make

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
of gravity information and then make

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.570 
of gravity information and then make
sure<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.380> turret<00:02:35.740> keeps<00:02:36.010> that<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.340> middle

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
sure the turret keeps that in the middle

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.140 
sure the turret keeps that in the middle
of<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.760> frame<00:02:37.620> here<00:02:38.620> we've<00:02:38.800> even<00:02:39.070> got<00:02:39.310> our<00:02:39.520> pan

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
of the frame here we've even got our pan

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.280 
of the frame here we've even got our pan
and<00:02:40.390> tilt<00:02:40.570> values<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:42.040> as<00:02:42.130> we<00:02:42.280> change<00:02:42.670> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
and tilt values so as we change the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.600 
and tilt values so as we change the
position<00:02:44.290> we<00:02:44.680> can<00:02:44.830> see<00:02:45.070> those<00:02:45.220> values

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
position we can see those values

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.890 
position we can see those values
changing<00:02:47.220> finally<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.610> Arduino<00:02:48.940> module<00:02:49.600> is

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
changing finally this Arduino module is

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.900 
changing finally this Arduino module is
what<00:02:50.170> actually<00:02:50.650> allows<00:02:50.890> us<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.280> hook<00:02:51.520> up<00:02:51.700> to

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
what actually allows us to hook up to

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.480 
what actually allows us to hook up to
the<00:02:52.270> Arduino<00:02:52.690> board<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.290> change<00:02:53.950> its<00:02:54.100> values

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
the Arduino board and change its values

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.910 
the Arduino board and change its values
so<00:02:54.940> here<00:02:55.750> we<00:02:55.840> have<00:02:55.930> our<00:02:56.050> servos<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:56.740> can

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
so here we have our servos and you can

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.380 
so here we have our servos and you can
see<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.220> they're<00:02:57.400> locked<00:02:57.700> in<00:02:58.000> because

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
see that they're locked in because

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.140 
see that they're locked in because
they're<00:02:58.540> being<00:02:58.780> used<00:02:59.290> from<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.560> program<00:03:00.150> but

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
they're being used from the program but

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.420 
they're being used from the program but
we<00:03:01.180> can<00:03:01.510> also<00:03:01.630> control<00:03:02.020> analog<00:03:02.440> input<00:03:02.830> output

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
we can also control analog input output

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.460 
we can also control analog input output
and<00:03:03.700> digital<00:03:04.120> i/o<00:03:04.210> as<00:03:04.660> well<00:03:04.930> as<00:03:05.050> changing<00:03:05.440> the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
and digital i/o as well as changing the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.020 
and digital i/o as well as changing the
communication<00:03:06.160> part<00:03:06.430> in<00:03:06.610> case<00:03:06.790> we<00:03:06.940> have

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
communication part in case we have

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.060
