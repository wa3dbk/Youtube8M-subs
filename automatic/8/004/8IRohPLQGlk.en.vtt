00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:34.400
 with good guys 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:52.410
 the gap is 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.410
 but I had to kill 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.740
 I do not love it very much because 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.050
 I'm going to put a video with the lyrics in 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.150
 English so I hope you know English 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.800
 so they understand it best-selling because 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.990
 I do not know the wings of a letter was 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.569
 great I really like the lyrics of 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.760
 this song 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.760
 two exits that in the organ 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.390
 people are in the school 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.220
 they enabled it 7 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.640
 I am 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.420
 16 1 mom 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.150
 but it was not done 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.830
 I do not know whether to put the song back to them 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.910
 that we have men that would be a lot 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.210
 I relax quite rhythm 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.880
 general welcome here wars 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:59.080
 and that one that quickly disperses that face 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.080
 of good double 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.030
 and the song guys finished and started 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.730
 another one but it's not like that has copyright like that 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.670
 that I'm not going to put that on because 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.790
 matas paid that campero make quotas 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.910
 love me the champion to see you can and 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.459
 I have not killed anyone 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.060
 and said and done I did not kill anyone so 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.060
 I changed respawn 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.360
 to see if they want to come with parents 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.530
 the good guys win and the good thing about this 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.750
 song guys is that it is not copyright 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.060
 so I do not know is my super song 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.510
 preferred the truth because I love the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.160
 the letter considers the melody or of 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.420
 the song 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.670
 itself is very well is quite like 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.400
 moved and apart does not have copyright of 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.500
 I even climb this and it kills me to god 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.750
 mine and send my partner nothing really 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.940
 that's why I do not like to play alone 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.510
 guys because they give me the companions more 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:13.420
 possible bad that are connected 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:17.060
 so far in resources like 20 things 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:21.730
 We're not on the good side if you're already 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.730
 about to end 70 to 49 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:29.840
 to nobody 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.760
 seriously today 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.710
 the poor little guy was made 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.660
 for cake I saw how the little triangles 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.470
 take advantage 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.630
 so that's all the boys 25-13 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.910
 nothing bad 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.590
 he came in second place so nothing 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.610
 guys, I hope you liked this one 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:52.700
 video as he knows how he knows but how do you 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.340
 I said I left the video and let's say the 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.170
 name of the song in the description 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.090
 of this video so I hope there is not 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.190
 more questions of this song that I know that 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.720
 endorses them but it does not matter so 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.030

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:09.100
