something<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:33.230> ridiculous<00:02:35.950> my<00:02:36.950> estimation

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
something this ridiculous my estimation

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.390 
something this ridiculous my estimation
would<00:02:37.970> suggest<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.540> there<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.680> base<00:02:40.070> on

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
would suggest that there is a base on

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.560 
would suggest that there is a base on
this<00:02:40.580> map<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.260> when<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.410> cap<00:02:42.710> that<00:02:42.950> base<00:02:43.570> you

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
this map and when you cap that base you

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.210 
this map and when you cap that base you
are<00:02:44.720> allowed<00:02:44.990> to<00:02:45.020> become<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.530> gunner<00:02:45.800> from<00:02:46.040> the
