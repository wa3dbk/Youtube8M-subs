00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.700
 With this I want to show you now 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.200
 protect the different sky-wide 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.210
 the position of women with 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.310
 uses his round gear looks 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.619
 that will take you through the turns and 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.759
 wandering and calculated and especially knew 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.550
 standing on his bike and well you really see 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:32.840
 did that that you really almost no longer the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:37.670
 climb up on coming and the people 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.250
 see how you really try 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.050
 with his body weight and standing towards 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.560
 to heat up above itself 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.560
 at some point then you will see him 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.510
 yes loose 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.000
 lingers yenka is coming 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.010
 around it the table could also see this church 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.350
 the bruise after the victory 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.739
 it is still a kilometer always 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.299
 tricky km simon gallons than see previous 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.369
 good for a stage victory in the tour for years 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.680
 just talk to our live rome, that's it 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.210
 has literally everything open at the park 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.700
 is completely on the link quickly 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.590
 make oxford ambitus or the way 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.290
 park completely says josÃ© de 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.369
 cauwer I am right that is perfectly true 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.619
 I would soon suffer that 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.299
 differences is showing with 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:29.539
 asked the mon fuck you had malfunctions 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:32.119
 30 seconds to follow 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.369
 images of good friends everyone d 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.560
 classified during the ascent of it 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.600
 monfort and i ask your life eggs 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.259
 Pay attention to the following points 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.929
 what a heavenly difference became 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.049
 shown in the in position of in 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.840
 during the shiro in 2009 see go for it 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.700
 and images and now we are out of it 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.209
 incredibly good 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.429
 Firstly, he is very far from the interrogations 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.590
 he even stays with him 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.409
 democracy and can hardly be the team 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.469
 held during the mon Ventoux 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.660
 then they demarcate and are therefore whole 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.789
 further forward with becker camps so that he 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.970
 optimal kill kill kill points of 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.790
 the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.890
 with its can kick anywhere second 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.020
 he is very well fixed between his 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.910
 handlebar and saddle because you see one 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.400
 unlike all other buckets him 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.840
 really do not slide on his saddle please 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.390
 but also very good because that point 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.400
 from the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.420
 the rear part of his father remains 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.080
 yes constantly visible of course it comes 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.150
 also new 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.190
 because of his oval, because that's where we see you 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.310
 body weight weight is going to push like 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.380
 with the previous video images 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.430
 then you automatically slide saddle or 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.890
 you're going to be the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.880
 forced to stand third he 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.340
 is in a kind 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.570
 giraffe attitude quite silent 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.370
 his bike 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.200
 the fourth he placed in the arms 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.720
 elbow a bit cut out 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.270
 so that he is also from here 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.730
 pump it yourself and pull it upwards 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.370
 the tractor bikes say 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.500
 fifth he used his immensely well 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.959
 trained body energy 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.850
 muscles perfect to turn this into 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.400
 kinetic energy 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.070
 and sixth he even gets them an energy 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.110
 out of his neck because he prefers to sit 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.090
 prefer not to nod anything naturally 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.300
 with his head and makes as it were 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.580
 therefore you say pool apps 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.920
 to you now, I ask now the 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.350
 neither criticize nor deny any criticism 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.650
 that the movie its position and its over 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.079
 make the revolution of this century is what 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.820
 criticaster and wherever media 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.720
 dare to suspect vroem now 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.720
 doping vroem his epo is evolution one 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.579
 paddling everywhere and I am again 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.880
 And science would also be 100 cents 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.880
 find out that frame and benefits 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.010
 compared to the jiro 2009 now one 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.410
 benefit from more towards 10% 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.459
 35 seconds no comments look or 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:05.450
 possibly stop the images to see eh 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.450
 yes how i am right 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.640
 that more and more wheels know me alike 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.380
 to give 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.770
 that also proves the correspondence 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.590
 that I fed with Danny Nelissen 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.880
 because he writes to me I drove in 1995 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.800
 with the srm 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.810
 everyone asked me if you could come too 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.370
 fax one of how to indicate 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.290
 conservative old who wheels you 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.150
 world language then was still there 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.160
 remains 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.770
 i shared my knowledge with emma with 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.540
 none alone with my coach from 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.970
 so colorado i could have all the details 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.690
 forwarding by computer service 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.760
 yes e-mail in 1995 parents 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.980
 I also rode the World Cup that I live in 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.460
 6 point 3 kilo bicycle 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.940
 you do so a 1995 they did not know 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.570
 better 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.530
 breaking meshes but they are their dekker et 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.480
 cetera 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.730
 but I knew exactly what and how long I did 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.490
 in certain assets and that 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.800
 earned me the world title 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.130
 so we effe the word emphatically 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.010
 ability my match was very based 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.900
 entirely based on srm hence i 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.560
 always loose on my later again 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:51.960
 came back i believe you say in 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.960
 and sometimes test greetings danny
