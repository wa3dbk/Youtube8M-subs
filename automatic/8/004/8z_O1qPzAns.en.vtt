00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 while everyone is being 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.659
 preparing to write down all the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.339
 Chinese drawings that are going to be released 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.500
 in the new season something was 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.450
 making the floor tremble was not a life 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.710
 of fanboy from guata monte 9 the hype by 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.240
 the arrival of that skin or the tan 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.830
 expected zinc final chapter 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.960
 equinoxes and was the long-awaited 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.970
 dragon ball z movie synonymous with 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.619
 nostalgia for epic battles and successes 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.359
 would be stupid and try to 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.310
 delve into things like the characters 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.230
 of the universe since this enough 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.760
 as letter now if not 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.500
 know and minimum that is dragon ball z 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.210
 may be because you live inside a 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.590
 thermos which in turn is below a 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.390
 stone the story of this movie 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.040
 basically it does not direct to bill the god 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.260
 chihuahueño of the distribution that has 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.059
 a dream in which he knew a sayayin 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.620
 god and that's enough excuse for 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.180
 bring together a whole cast of people who 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.620
 simply useless so that what 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.570
 only that you get interested in all the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.100
 movie be the super epic battles 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.170
 and balanced between goku and a god 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.610
 for rum and to avoid spoilers and 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.140
 considering that that makes me 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.640
 limit a lot in the things that I say and that 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.050
 already simply the movie 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.760
 there are few things that happen I will 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.820
 try to summarize my impressions in 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.710
 four words this movie is 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.750
 ridiculous 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.239
 santo I do not remember when was passing 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.710
 so much shame together the movie is so 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:14.540
 ridiculous way is that you're going to fall 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:16.070
 of ass of shame and you do not believe me no 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.659
 I'm waiting fine but buzzi I'm not 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.310
 waiting for a hiroyuki address ni 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.840
 much less am I prejudiced for this 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.000
 type of movies that comes from a series 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.759
 with a pretty scatological history 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.380
 but the shame surpasses more than 9000 of 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.729
 way that's going to be more embarrassing than 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.380
 when they sing your birthday with 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.090
 Applause while they put the movie 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.369
 Disney and people are made 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.080
 sing happily and I can assure you 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.759
 that if you have the sense of ridicule 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.380
 well sharp the first thing you're going to think 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.060
 is to hide your head in a floor of 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.280
 fresh cement to give them an example 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.259
 let's talk about vegueta the subject that is the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.119
 warrior more proud and who prefers 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.979
 throwing themselves at pineapples and dying in an attempt 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.110
 suicide rather than ridicule I know 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.670
 clearly that goes to hell when 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.200
 the subject starts dancing and singing a 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.820
 Bingo song that saddest you 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.860
 let's dance the news song 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.300
 while reporting the weather you have a 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.550
 god chihuahueño whose motivation to 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.530
 destroy the earth is to lament for not 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.390
 Having eaten rather than power 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.920
 interesting instead of making the god 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.330
 Give him enough time 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.160
 to make an effort with hard training 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.530
 in a time room or something 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.790
 similar that gives fruits and put small 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.319
 fragments or transitions of 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.420
 hard training with a little sign that 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.790
 say two years later he came up with the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.410
 bright idea of ​​telling a legend the 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.150
 which was to gather five monkeys and see who 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.310
 It was the purest of heart as if the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.989
 power of friendship was treated and in itself 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.840
 it was less to insert the psu on foot and 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.040
 may was the most forced and misplaced 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.140
 the movie 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.180
 and you were expecting a super epic fight 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.430
 all the time in an hour movie and 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.080
 peak is going to have two good fights the one 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.290
 vegueta that the best of the whole movie 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.120
 and the one of goku that this of course in the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.680
 epic battle you so expected and that 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.230
 for your misfortune it will take 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.730
 much ten minutes without a doubt the animation 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.860
 it's a very strong and very good point that 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.870
 has this film moving closer and 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.819
 rotating the camera but if you watch the movie 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.709
 in full fight you will realize 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.630
 act that they put a cg scene 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.760
 copypaste not the cyber graphic engine 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.470
 connected just to set an angle 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.880
 that is dynamic enough to 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.010
 that they see how nice the 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.810
 characters in battle but they did not happen 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.180
 account that same thing in full fight 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.650
 ruined the perspective 2 of the figure 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.190
 which is supposed to be the mighty dragon 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.620
 of the boss 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.910
 he is also ridiculed apparently 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.530
 realize who the god bolt is and 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.150
 it begins the reverence and the apologies 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.320
 with which she remains indifferent as 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.690
 always was it could not have had 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.520
 problems but they did not have to 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.320
 true pieces said of amilpas and with a 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.180
 end certainly and satisfactory and that 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.620
 amount of ridiculous that would not follow 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.060
 speaking for more than five minutes but 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.100
 I think I made it clear how the 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.660
 hand so without more people I hope that the 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.700
 video you liked about him there 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.260
 favorites comment subscribe everything 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.370
 that you want so we see ourselves without 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.370
 more until next time
