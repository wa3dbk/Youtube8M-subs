00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.230
 for me it is no 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.540
 visit an expert report on the pedal strokes too it's really a 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.540
 full sport 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.740

 some brands of buttons everywhere we can touch the stuff as well as in the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.990
 most shops destroyed a buddy any player it's complicated 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 how 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.170
 this level of quality and security 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.200
 its presence in this sector is just a little bit magical what do the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.220
 other

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.790
 if your site 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.050
 when you redeem says there is something magical happening somewhere 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.380
 thing I do not know what I know 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.500
 in fact here are the engineers of the brand we consult a new keyboard 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.509
 especially for the CP1 so a keyboard the keys in wood coating 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.570
 ivory 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.640
 and a man for whom is proud to best accompany their new 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.179
 sound technology it's called sc example they extend when one 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.179
 has a moderate pace which is actually a modeling technique 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.979
 they started from a high-definition full-tooth sampling that 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.429
 do not suffer any compression 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:22.639
 in themselves and then comes to join in all aspects 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.629
 modeling ie buddies 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.529
 we're really going to hear there the physical aspects of piano du 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.340
 resonance of lighting and the residences of the party camps suffers the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.309
 soundboard and all these all these aspects that really make the instrument 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:37.279
 what 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:41.589
 so when at the game level we really have incredible fluidity 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:45.159
 in all that we will do in the whole line of tolls velocity 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.159
 which gives a great natural expressiveness 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.419
 besides the simplest we know very well that all builders do 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.719
 excellent digital games sit at the steering wheel corner diana so go to 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.060
