00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
a row so anyway after that it gets

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
a row so anyway after that it gets
interesting<00:00:47.610> folks<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:49.170> are<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
eighth seed and it looks like we've got

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.000 
eighth seed and it looks like we've got
a<00:00:54.030> great<00:00:54.270> chance<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.719> play<00:00:55.020> with<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:55.829> tile

year<00:02:24.599> so<00:02:25.599> I<00:02:25.629> like<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.260> bracket<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.709> like<00:02:26.890> what

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
year so I like the bracket I like what

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.660 
year so I like the bracket I like what
we've<00:02:27.250> got<00:02:27.459> here<00:02:28.709> we<00:02:29.709> lost<00:02:29.920> by<00:02:30.129> a<00:02:30.160> point<00:02:30.250> to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
we've got here we lost by a point to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.420 
we've got here we lost by a point to
Florida<00:02:31.090> who<00:02:31.900> everybody<00:02:32.500> says<00:02:32.799> is<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.190> best

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
Florida who everybody says is the best

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.850 
Florida who everybody says is the best
team<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.940> country<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:35.349> mean<00:02:35.709> we've<00:02:35.830> got

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
team in the country so I mean we've got

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.949 
team in the country so I mean we've got
experience<00:02:36.310> we<00:02:36.670> played<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.940> one<00:02:37.269> seed<00:02:37.569> three

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
experience we played a one seed three

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.460 
experience we played a one seed three
times<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.470> year<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:40.030> will<00:02:40.810> most<00:02:40.989> we<00:02:41.319> could

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
times this year and will most we could

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.170 
times this year and will most we could
have<00:02:41.590> won<00:02:41.739> two<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:42.040> those<00:02:42.099> games<00:02:42.370> against<00:02:43.060> the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
have won two of those games against the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.229 
have won two of those games against the
Florida<00:02:43.569> so<00:02:44.049> I<00:02:44.280> think<00:02:45.280> Florida<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.000> whole

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
Florida so I think Florida is a whole

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.630 
Florida so I think Florida is a whole
lot<00:02:46.390> better<00:02:46.599> than<00:02:46.900> Wichita<00:02:47.620> State<00:02:47.920> that's<00:02:48.459> why

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
lot better than Wichita State that's why

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.400 
lot better than Wichita State that's why
I<00:02:48.670> like<00:02:48.940> her<00:02:49.120> chances<00:02:49.510> that's<00:02:49.780> why<00:02:49.930> was<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.230> if

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
I like her chances that's why was it if

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.500 
I like her chances that's why was it if
we<00:02:50.560> play<00:02:50.769> like<00:02:50.799> we're<00:02:51.250> capable<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.849> don't<00:02:52.360> see

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
we play like we're capable I don't see

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.300 
we play like we're capable I don't see
no<00:02:52.630> reason<00:02:52.840> Kentucky<00:02:53.530> cannot<00:02:53.799> get<00:02:53.980> back<00:02:54.130> to
