all the i/o connections to the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.219 
all the i/o connections to the
motherboard<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.619> everything<00:01:59.030> hit<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.330> user

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
motherboard and everything hit the user

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.310 
motherboard and everything hit the user
guide<00:02:02.900> RT<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:06.060> certificate<00:02:06.840> of

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
guide RT and a certificate of

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.440 
guide RT and a certificate of
reliability<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:09.830> that's<00:02:10.830> basically<00:02:11.450> comes
