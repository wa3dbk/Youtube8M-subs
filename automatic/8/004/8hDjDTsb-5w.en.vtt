but it's a great knife just even as it

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.710 
but it's a great knife just even as it
is<00:01:28.700> one<00:01:29.700> thing<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> found<00:01:30.299> was<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.479> little

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
is one thing that I found was a little

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.020 
is one thing that I found was a little
bit<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.869> lacking<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.560> handle<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
bit of lacking is the handle I like to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.910 
bit of lacking is the handle I like to
have<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> little<00:01:33.390> bit<00:01:33.479> more<00:01:33.600> grip<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.619> knife

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
have a little bit more grip on a knife

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.490 
have a little bit more grip on a knife
and<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.240> looked<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.840> some<00:01:36.960> ways<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.320> found

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
and so I looked up some ways and I found

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.770 
and so I looked up some ways and I found
out<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.860> actually<00:01:38.220> wrap<00:01:39.090> paracord

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
out that you can actually wrap paracord

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.090 
out that you can actually wrap paracord
around<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> actually<00:01:40.770> makes<00:01:41.009> it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
around this and it actually makes it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.730 
around this and it actually makes it
very<00:01:41.220> very<00:01:41.490> beautiful<00:01:41.729> weave<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:43.530> gives

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
very very beautiful weave and just gives

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.440 
very very beautiful weave and just gives
it<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.890> better<00:01:44.220> grip<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.579> which<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.270> makes

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
it that better grip and which just makes

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.270 
it that better grip and which just makes
it<00:01:45.659> pretty<00:01:46.110> much<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.500> perfect<00:01:46.680> survival

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
first thing is you've got to have the

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.260 
first thing is you've got to have the
cord<00:02:07.630> coming<00:02:07.960> out<00:02:08.140> from<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.590> top<00:02:08.800> here<00:02:09.270> you

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
cord coming out from the top here you

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.630 
cord coming out from the top here you
can<00:02:10.390> either<00:02:10.509> just<00:02:10.950> slide<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.160> length<00:02:12.340> through

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
can either just slide the length through

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.870 
can either just slide the length through
and<00:02:13.030> have<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.870> just<00:02:14.080> loosely<00:02:14.920> hanging<00:02:15.400> out<00:02:15.520> at

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
and have it just loosely hanging out at

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.550 
and have it just loosely hanging out at
the<00:02:16.060> bottom<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.480> just<00:02:16.630> hold<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.900> tight<00:02:17.349> with

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
the bottom and just hold it tight with

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.930 
the bottom and just hold it tight with
something<00:02:17.920> while<00:02:18.069> you<00:02:18.190> will<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.670> do<00:02:18.819> your

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
something while you will you do your

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.900 
something while you will you do your
weave<00:02:19.180> what<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:19.870> actually<00:02:20.140> did<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:21.790> actually

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
weave what I actually did is I actually

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.120 
weave what I actually did is I actually
put<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.209> Chinese<00:02:22.599> ball<00:02:22.870> knot<00:02:23.110> on<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.890> end<00:02:23.920> a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
put a Chinese ball knot on the end a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.009 
put a Chinese ball knot on the end a
really<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.370> big<00:02:24.519> fat<00:02:24.790> knot<00:02:25.060> there<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.660> that

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
really a big fat knot there and that

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.690 
really a big fat knot there and that
does<00:02:26.230> two<00:02:26.440> things<00:02:26.470> number<00:02:26.890> one<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.280> holds<00:02:27.580> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
does two things number one it holds the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.270 
does two things number one it holds the
paracord<00:02:28.120> tight<00:02:28.720> for<00:02:28.989> me<00:02:29.080> while<00:02:29.800> I'm<00:02:29.950> doing<00:02:30.250> my

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
paracord tight for me while I'm doing my

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.910 
paracord tight for me while I'm doing my
weave<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.000> other<00:02:31.150> thing<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.450> does<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.959> it

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
weave and the other thing it does is it

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.790 
weave and the other thing it does is it
plugs<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.519> top<00:02:33.880> hole<00:02:34.150> there<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:35.050> all<00:02:35.739> I

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
plugs that top hole there so that all I

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.530 
plugs that top hole there so that all I
need<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.099> do<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.430> plug<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.060> bottom<00:02:37.300> hole<00:02:37.390> and

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
need to do is plug the bottom hole and

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.640 
need to do is plug the bottom hole and
I've<00:02:37.599> got<00:02:37.780> some<00:02:37.900> little<00:02:38.019> storage<00:02:38.319> space<00:02:38.350> in

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
I've got some little storage space in

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.120 
I've got some little storage space in
there<00:02:38.799> so<00:02:39.430> that's<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.060> way<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.209> did<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:42.040> the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
there so that's the way I did it so the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.250 
there so that's the way I did it so the
first<00:02:42.370> step<00:02:42.610> once<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.510> have<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.810> Rope<00:02:43.959> coming

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
first step once you have the Rope coming

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.809 
first step once you have the Rope coming
out<00:02:44.350> of<00:02:44.470> your<00:02:44.560> hole<00:02:44.739> here<00:02:44.950> as<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.610> go<00:02:45.730> ahead

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
out of your hole here as you go ahead

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.320 
out of your hole here as you go ahead
and<00:02:46.000> just<00:02:46.120> wrap<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.920> behind<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.190> handle<00:02:48.580> and

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
and just wrap that behind the handle and

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.420 
and just wrap that behind the handle and
have<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.810> coming<00:02:49.989> out<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.200> front<00:02:50.440> here<00:02:50.860> what

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
have it coming out the front here what

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.620 
have it coming out the front here what
you<00:02:51.519> want<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.760> do<00:02:51.850> is<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.060> want<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.299> wait<00:02:52.450> make

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
you want to do is you want to wait make

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.390 
you want to do is you want to wait make
a<00:02:52.660> little<00:02:52.989> bit<00:02:53.080> of<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.260> loop<00:02:53.410> with<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.739> with<00:02:54.130> the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
a little bit of a loop with it with the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.430 
a little bit of a loop with it with the
remainder<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.000> cord<00:02:55.269> on<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.780> bottom<00:02:56.170> of

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
remainder of the cord on the bottom of

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.830 
remainder of the cord on the bottom of
the<00:02:56.650> loop<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.239> then<00:02:58.239> what<00:02:58.450> you're<00:02:58.569> gonna<00:02:58.630> do

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
the loop and then what you're gonna do

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.350 
the loop and then what you're gonna do
is<00:02:59.019> you're<00:02:59.110> gonna<00:02:59.170> come<00:02:59.410> out<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.560> other<00:02:59.650> side

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
is you're gonna come out the other side

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.460 
is you're gonna come out the other side
and<00:03:01.360> you're<00:03:01.480> gonna<00:03:01.569> make<00:03:01.750> another<00:03:01.959> loop<00:03:02.230> and

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
and you're gonna make another loop and

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.390 
and you're gonna make another loop and
just<00:03:03.069> pass<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.840> right<00:03:04.840> through<00:03:05.049> there<00:03:05.260> like<00:03:06.160> so

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
just pass it right through there like so

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.610 
just pass it right through there like so
and<00:03:06.640> now<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.360> that's<00:03:07.900> all<00:03:08.080> there<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.500> it

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
and now and that's all there is to it

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.720 
and now and that's all there is to it
that's<00:03:08.799> just<00:03:09.099> the<00:03:09.250> pattern<00:03:09.519> that<00:03:09.549> you're

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
that's just the pattern that you're

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.099 
that's just the pattern that you're
gonna<00:03:09.850> follow<00:03:10.060> is<00:03:10.359> now<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:10.660> have<00:03:10.900> another

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
gonna follow is now you have another

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.229 
gonna follow is now you have another
loop<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.920> you're<00:03:12.010> gonna<00:03:12.130> pass<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.579> cord<00:03:12.820> down

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
loop and you're gonna pass the cord down

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.970 
loop and you're gonna pass the cord down
the<00:03:13.420> other<00:03:13.540> side<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:14.049> put<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.440> loop<00:03:14.620> through

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
the other side and put a loop through

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.860 
the other side and put a loop through
that<00:03:15.100> loop<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.609> that's<00:03:16.390> pretty<00:03:16.630> much<00:03:16.720> all

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
that loop and that's pretty much all

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.960 
that loop and that's pretty much all
there<00:03:17.019> is<00:03:17.079> to<00:03:17.170> it's<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.500> very<00:03:17.680> simple<00:03:17.980> weave<00:03:18.280> but

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
there is to it's a very simple weave but

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.810 
there is to it's a very simple weave but
it<00:03:19.060> makes<00:03:19.239> it<00:03:19.299> look<00:03:19.480> really<00:03:19.510> good<00:03:19.780> now<00:03:20.290> a

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
it makes it look really good now a

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.160 
it makes it look really good now a
couple<00:03:21.820> of<00:03:21.880> tricks<00:03:22.090> with<00:03:22.299> this<00:03:22.450> number<00:03:22.900> one

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
couple of tricks with this number one

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.170 
couple of tricks with this number one
don't<00:03:23.560> cut<00:03:23.709> off<00:03:23.799> your<00:03:23.950> finger<00:03:24.280> because<00:03:24.700> it's<00:03:25.090> a

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
don't cut off your finger because it's a

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.460 
don't cut off your finger because it's a
very<00:03:25.359> sharp<00:03:25.540> knife<00:03:25.600> like<00:03:25.959> I<00:03:26.079> said<00:03:26.290> something

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
very sharp knife like I said something

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.789 
very sharp knife like I said something
very<00:03:26.560> careful<00:03:26.980> with<00:03:27.070> that<00:03:28.380> as<00:03:29.380> you're<00:03:29.650> going

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
very careful with that as you're going

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.460 
very careful with that as you're going
on<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.220> you're<00:03:30.790> gonna<00:03:30.940> want<00:03:31.239> to<00:03:31.299> pull<00:03:31.510> these

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
on this you're gonna want to pull these

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.920 
on this you're gonna want to pull these
very<00:03:32.920> tight<00:03:33.250> because<00:03:33.760> otherwise<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.720> could

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
very tight because otherwise it could

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.840 
very tight because otherwise it could
end<00:03:35.019> up<00:03:35.140> slipping<00:03:35.410> over<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:36.130> metal<00:03:36.340> there<00:03:36.609> and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
end up slipping over the metal there and

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.759 
end up slipping over the metal there and
that<00:03:37.120> just<00:03:37.150> makes<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.140> grip<00:03:38.319> even<00:03:38.470> worse

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
that just makes the grip even worse

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.940 
that just makes the grip even worse
instead<00:03:39.130> of<00:03:39.220> improving<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.790> grip<00:03:40.000> so<00:03:40.900> as<00:03:41.200> you

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
instead of improving the grip so as you

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.830 
instead of improving the grip so as you
go<00:03:42.130> here<00:03:42.370> you're<00:03:42.640> gonna<00:03:42.730> want<00:03:42.819> to<00:03:43.090> pull<00:03:43.329> on<00:03:43.690> the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
go here you're gonna want to pull on the

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.530 
go here you're gonna want to pull on the
top<00:03:44.049> part<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.590> of<00:03:44.950> your<00:03:45.700> loop<00:03:45.880> there<00:03:46.150> to

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
top part of of your loop there to

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.710 
top part of of your loop there to
tighten<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.989> loop<00:03:47.140> behind<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:48.389> and<00:03:49.389> I

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
tighten the loop behind it and I

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.910 
tighten the loop behind it and I
actually<00:03:49.900> recommend<00:03:50.170> having<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.739> pair<00:03:50.889> of

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
actually recommend having a pair of

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.800 
actually recommend having a pair of
pliers<00:03:51.100> on<00:03:51.370> hand<00:03:51.609> to<00:03:52.120> make<00:03:52.269> sure<00:03:52.299> that<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.660> can

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
pliers on hand to make sure that you can

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.840 
pliers on hand to make sure that you can
get<00:03:52.989> that<00:03:53.170> really<00:03:53.620> really<00:03:53.799> tight<00:03:54.069> because<00:03:54.579> the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
get that really really tight because the

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.370 
get that really really tight because the
tighter<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.269> get<00:03:55.389> that<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:55.840> less<00:03:56.049> slippage

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
tighter you get that the less slippage

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.350 
tighter you get that the less slippage
you'll<00:03:56.530> have<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.190> safer<00:03:57.519> your<00:03:57.609> handle

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
you'll have and the safer your handle

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.070 
you'll have and the safer your handle
and<00:03:58.990> the<00:03:59.320> pretty<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.560> little<00:03:59.800> of<00:03:59.980> two<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.900> and

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
and the pretty a little of two so and

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.660 
and the pretty a little of two so and
just<00:04:02.110> make<00:04:02.320> sure<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.590> you<00:04:02.680> have<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:03.130> always

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
just make sure that you have this always

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.940 
just make sure that you have this always
on<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.940> bottom<00:04:04.210> part<00:04:04.420> of<00:04:04.510> that<00:04:04.860> alright<00:04:05.860> so

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
on the bottom part of that alright so

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.460 
on the bottom part of that alright so
this<00:04:08.950> does<00:04:09.190> take<00:04:09.370> a<00:04:09.400> little<00:04:09.580> bit<00:04:09.670> of<00:04:09.850> time<00:04:10.470> but

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
this does take a little bit of time but

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.500 
this does take a little bit of time but
in<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.310> end<00:04:12.340> it'll<00:04:12.940> give<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.240> really<00:04:13.420> great

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
in the end it'll give you a really great

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.820 
in the end it'll give you a really great
grip<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:14.080> then<00:04:14.140> you're<00:04:14.320> carrying<00:04:14.620> some<00:04:14.770> extra

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
grip and then you're carrying some extra

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.789 
grip and then you're carrying some extra
paracord<00:04:15.490> and<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:16.269> just<00:04:16.450> makes<00:04:16.660> just<00:04:17.650> makes

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
paracord and it just makes just makes

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.039 
paracord and it just makes just makes
this<00:04:18.010> knife<00:04:18.190> way<00:04:18.820> better<00:04:19.030> which<00:04:19.630> it's<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.870> great

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
this knife way better which it's a great

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.770 
this knife way better which it's a great
knife<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.320> begin<00:04:20.530> with<00:04:20.709> but<00:04:21.780> great

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
knife to begin with but great

00:04:22.780 --> 00:05:07.610 
knife to begin with but great
improvements<00:04:23.440> here<00:04:24.100> we<00:04:24.250> go

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.140 

so<00:05:08.220> this<00:05:08.370> is<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:08.550> pattern<00:05:08.700> you<00:05:08.910> should<00:05:09.060> be

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
so this is the pattern you should be

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.180 
so this is the pattern you should be
having<00:05:09.300> here<00:05:09.630> just<00:05:09.930> along<00:05:10.140> the<00:05:10.260> front<00:05:10.500> kind<00:05:11.130> of

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
having here just along the front kind of

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.680 
having here just along the front kind of
gives<00:05:11.310> you<00:05:11.340> that<00:05:11.400> grip<00:05:11.730> there<00:05:11.910> and<00:05:12.150> it<00:05:12.480> should

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
gives you that grip there and it should

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.030 
gives you that grip there and it should
be<00:05:12.810> tight<00:05:12.990> enough<00:05:13.140> so<00:05:13.200> it<00:05:13.410> doesn't<00:05:13.680> it

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
be tight enough so it doesn't it

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.470 
be tight enough so it doesn't it
shouldn't<00:05:14.400> I<00:05:14.430> mean<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.670> might<00:05:14.790> sly<00:05:15.060> a<00:05:15.090> little

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
shouldn't I mean it might sly a little

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.590 
shouldn't I mean it might sly a little
bit<00:05:15.660> but<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:15.990> shouldn't<00:05:16.320> do<00:05:16.440> that<00:05:16.590> too<00:05:16.890> much

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
bit but it shouldn't do that too much

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.760 
bit but it shouldn't do that too much
shouldn't<00:05:18.600> be<00:05:18.660> too<00:05:18.840> loose<00:05:18.990> you<00:05:19.440> want<00:05:19.590> to<00:05:19.650> keep

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
shouldn't be too loose you want to keep

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.800 
shouldn't be too loose you want to keep
it<00:05:19.920> really<00:05:20.220> tight<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.760> as<00:05:21.330> you've<00:05:21.480> seen<00:05:21.630> I've

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
it really tight and as you've seen I've

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.320 
it really tight and as you've seen I've
been<00:05:21.840> just<00:05:22.170> pulling<00:05:22.680> on<00:05:22.770> it<00:05:22.890> with<00:05:23.010> these<00:05:23.330> these

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
been just pulling on it with these these

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.100 
been just pulling on it with these these
pliers<00:05:24.660> here<00:05:25.670> just<00:05:26.670> to<00:05:26.790> try<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:27.660> keep<00:05:27.870> it<00:05:27.990> as

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
pliers here just to try and keep it as

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.670 
pliers here just to try and keep it as
tight<00:05:28.320> as<00:05:28.440> you<00:05:28.500> can

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.710 

it'll<00:05:31.680> be<00:05:31.800> hard<00:05:32.040> but<00:05:32.280> it'll<00:05:32.460> be<00:05:32.550> worth<00:05:32.700> it<00:05:35.720> and

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
it'll be hard but it'll be worth it and

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.000 
it'll be hard but it'll be worth it and
then<00:05:37.410> just<00:05:37.910> keep<00:05:38.910> the<00:05:39.410> cord<00:05:40.410> might<00:05:40.560> twist<00:05:40.830> a

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
then just keep the cord might twist a
