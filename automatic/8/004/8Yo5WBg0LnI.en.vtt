is time but as you can see i'm now
picking<00:01:15.119> up<00:01:15.290> about<00:01:17.060> 500<00:01:18.060> dorvan<00:01:18.420> arrows<00:01:18.799> one

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
picking up about 500 dorvan arrows one

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.219 
picking up about 500 dorvan arrows one
at<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> time<00:01:20.600> this<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.689> kind<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.900> weird<00:01:22.049> they'd

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
at a time this is kind of weird they'd

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.170 
at a time this is kind of weird they'd
ever<00:01:22.409> stacked<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.220> before<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:23.909> as<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
ever stacked like this before but as you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.350 
ever stacked like this before but as you
can<00:01:24.270> see<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.670> continually<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
can see it's just continually going and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.600 
can see it's just continually going and
going<00:01:30.320> normally<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.530> will<00:01:31.650> multiply<00:01:32.159> whatever

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
going normally it will multiply whatever

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.940 
going normally it will multiply whatever
you're<00:01:32.729> multiplying<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.390> larger<00:01:33.780> sets<00:01:34.079> such

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you're multiplying in larger sets such

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.080 
you're multiplying in larger sets such
as<00:01:35.159> Quivers<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.180> arrows<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:37.549> as<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.820> see

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
as Quivers of arrows but as you can see

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.300 
as Quivers of arrows but as you can see
it<00:01:39.869> obviously<00:01:40.409> works<00:01:43.520> Wow

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
it obviously works Wow

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.889

meeting unequip your arrows Oh as you

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.950 
meeting unequip your arrows Oh as you
can<00:03:10.310> see<00:03:10.489> you<00:03:10.640> can<00:03:10.790> also<00:03:11.019> multiply<00:03:12.019> Scrolls

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.100 

simply<00:03:18.950> let's<00:03:19.460> see<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.880> lot<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.390> keys<00:03:20.630> like<00:03:20.990> to

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
simply let's see a lot of keys like to

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.900 
simply let's see a lot of keys like to
kill<00:03:21.260> people<00:03:23.980> any<00:03:24.980> signal<00:03:25.430> stone<00:03:25.610> will<00:03:25.730> do

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
kill people any signal stone will do

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.060 
kill people any signal stone will do
drop<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.780> this<00:03:27.320> is<00:03:27.440> where<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.680> usually<00:03:27.830> gets

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
drop and this is where it usually gets

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.300 
drop and this is where it usually gets
really<00:03:28.430> leggy<00:03:28.670> as<00:03:29.110> you<00:03:30.110> can<00:03:30.230> see<00:03:30.410> it's<00:03:30.560> not

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
really leggy as you can see it's not

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.580 
really leggy as you can see it's not
moving<00:03:31.550> too<00:03:31.790> quickly<00:03:32.030> right<00:03:32.300> now<00:03:32.590> sometimes

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
moving too quickly right now sometimes

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.770 
moving too quickly right now sometimes
if<00:03:34.090> it's<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.180> huge<00:03:35.920> multiplication<00:03:37.180> your<00:03:38.180> Xbox

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
if it's a huge multiplication your Xbox

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.650 
if it's a huge multiplication your Xbox
may<00:03:39.200> freeze<00:03:39.710> or<00:03:40.010> dramatically<00:03:40.850> slowed<00:03:41.510> down

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
may freeze or dramatically slowed down

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.890 
may freeze or dramatically slowed down
but<00:03:42.050> oh<00:03:42.230> here<00:03:42.740> you<00:03:42.770> go<00:03:42.910> as<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.090> can<00:03:44.180> see<00:03:44.360> it's<00:03:44.780> a

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
but oh here you go as you can see it's a

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.690 
but oh here you go as you can see it's a
concentration<00:03:45.710> of<00:03:45.800> citrus<00:03:46.160> stones<00:03:46.370> in<00:03:46.490> front

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
concentration of citrus stones in front

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.120 
concentration of citrus stones in front
of<00:03:46.760> me<00:03:46.820> about<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.900> be<00:03:48.020> spread<00:03:48.590> out<00:03:48.620> across<00:03:48.830> my

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
of me about to be spread out across my

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.540 
of me about to be spread out across my
floor<00:03:50.650> usually<00:03:51.650> with<00:03:51.770> Siddle<00:03:52.070> stones<00:03:52.280> because

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
floor usually with Siddle stones because

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.310 
floor usually with Siddle stones because
of<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.880> noise<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.660> light<00:03:53.930> they<00:03:54.110> give<00:03:54.290> off

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
of the noise and the light they give off

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.340 
of the noise and the light they give off
it<00:03:54.800> takes<00:03:55.790> a<00:03:55.910> really<00:03:56.150> really<00:03:56.570> long<00:03:56.990> time<00:03:57.290> to

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
it takes a really really long time to

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:06.460 
it takes a really really long time to
multiply<00:03:58.420> um<00:04:00.070> crap<00:04:03.910> but<00:04:04.910> yeah<00:04:05.210> it<00:04:05.570> works<00:04:06.140> about

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
multiply um crap but yeah it works about

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.990 
multiply um crap but yeah it works about
with<00:04:07.100> just<00:04:07.490> anything<00:04:07.880> under<00:04:08.540> one<00:04:08.900> weight<00:04:09.140> in

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
with just anything under one weight in

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.640 
with just anything under one weight in
some<00:04:11.000> cases<00:04:11.210> such<00:04:11.570> as<00:04:11.600> a<00:04:11.720> sigil<00:04:11.990> stone<00:04:12.320> it<00:04:12.620> is

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
some cases such as a sigil stone it is

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.780 
some cases such as a sigil stone it is
one<00:04:13.310> um<00:04:13.900> can<00:04:14.900> multiply<00:04:15.260> scrolls<00:04:15.980> ingredients

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
one um can multiply scrolls ingredients

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.390 
one um can multiply scrolls ingredients
potions<00:04:17.510> for<00:04:18.380> those<00:04:18.530> of<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:18.710> who<00:04:19.070> can
