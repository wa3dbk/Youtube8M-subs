and there you've got it I have got the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.290 
and there you've got it I have got the
windows<00:02:29.680> multi-point<00:02:30.190> manager<00:02:30.640> basically

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
windows multi-point manager basically

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.440 
windows multi-point manager basically
running<00:02:31.960> right<00:02:32.170> here<00:02:32.200> on<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.860> win7<00:02:33.450> machine

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
running right here on this win7 machine

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.690 
running right here on this win7 machine
as<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:34.930> remote<00:02:35.320> adapt<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.100> at<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:36.370> point<00:02:36.580> it

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
as a remote adapt and at this point it

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.220 
as a remote adapt and at this point it
basically<00:02:37.030> just<00:02:37.330> looks<00:02:37.510> like<00:02:37.600> it's<00:02:37.930> an<00:02:38.080> app

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
basically just looks like it's an app

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.500 
basically just looks like it's an app
that's<00:02:39.220> running<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.180> scenario<00:02:40.480> here

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
that's running so the scenario here
