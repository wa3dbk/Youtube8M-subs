00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.980
 do Sergio called the day because in the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.710
 season he had an inflammation in the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.660
 that his second 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.230
 greater than the gift of not but it is a 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.180
 boy formed at the base and who has already started 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.859

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.120
 explain how this was all 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.290
 beginning in the Basque the passage of the base 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.899
 professional 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.050
 the first is a pleasure to see the hygiene and 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.270
 it was very important 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.969
 although I got here and went 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.940
 received by all and very professional 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.590
 well I even want to thank you and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.140
 wish all the best for your life is very 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.719
 because in this transition it was very 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.930
 importance of their experience 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.229
 everything you 've ever seen can go through your 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.330
 Come back together with mine too and we 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.979
 we got the maracana also and it was very 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.200
 important for me i'll remember too 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.049
 when he treated when you arrived at 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.810
 Basque you had conditions 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.100
 nine years so I guess I got it 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.340
 henrique now playing here for 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.439
 show that vasco always graduated 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.759
 talent at home think that the output 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.770
 club the jesus when the young 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.720
 talented how is sucker do danilo 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.900
 which unfortunately is already coming out of a 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.350
 young male is here only the kids 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.590
 Italy 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.930
 today I said it's there so I guess 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.030
 that this is the future of the club always 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.670
 Basque was always the club that when 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.290
 champion was with the base players 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.000
 today they are already there 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.340
 I believe in collaboration with young people. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.950
 always I tell them that the work is 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.509
 everything is clear that unfortunately some will 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.149
 stay in the middle of the road but the one that 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.950
 here are serious and I hope someday 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.719
 see them being championed by the Basque in the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.399
 professional raising the trophy 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.590
 I think it helps in some way 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.880
 with them but always with pleasure because 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.439
 I met some players who 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.750
 they helped me then I felt obliged to 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.250
 spend something are closing here 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.840
 my participation in my debut 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.180
 as 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.590
 door and they also asked why it was 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.010
 too bad for me 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.250
 Thanks a lot, and this is the future of 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.250
 basque
