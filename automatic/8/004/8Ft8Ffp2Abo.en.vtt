00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
cars inside since one hour I just used

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.450 
cars inside since one hour I just used
for<00:00:33.489> storing<00:00:33.940> stuff<00:00:34.210> and<00:00:34.510> parking<00:00:35.140> cars<00:00:38.460> okay

when<00:00:40.360> are<00:00:40.480> they<00:00:40.600> kicking<00:00:40.930> us<00:00:41.050> out<00:00:43.380> I'm

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
when are they kicking us out I'm

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.450 
when are they kicking us out I'm
guessing<00:00:45.219> now<00:00:46.770> maybe<00:00:47.770> we<00:00:47.950> can<00:00:48.130> store<00:00:48.430> our

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
guessing now maybe we can store our

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.670 
guessing now maybe we can store our
instruments<00:00:49.180> here<00:00:49.450> but<00:00:49.780> we<00:00:49.989> can't<00:00:50.290> practice

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
instruments here but we can't practice

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.069 
instruments here but we can't practice
here<00:00:51.190> we'd<00:00:51.670> be<00:00:51.700> too<00:00:52.000> noisy<00:00:52.180> and<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.809> school

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
here we'd be too noisy and the school

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.049 
here we'd be too noisy and the school
wouldn't<00:00:53.379> allow<00:00:53.559> it<00:00:53.590> if<00:00:54.280> we<00:00:54.489> need<00:00:54.700> a<00:00:54.730> place

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059
