a handle design done in adobe

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.019 
a handle design done in adobe
illustrator<00:00:20.649> could<00:00:21.279> be<00:00:21.399> done<00:00:21.550> to<00:00:21.700> something

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
illustrator could be done to something

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.790 
illustrator could be done to something
else<00:00:22.180> as<00:00:22.329> well<00:00:22.360> but<00:00:22.689> in<00:00:23.079> this<00:00:23.140> case<00:00:23.349> I<00:00:23.500> did<00:00:23.680> an

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
else as well but in this case I did an

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.249 
else as well but in this case I did an
Adobe<00:00:24.250> Illustrator<00:00:24.610> imported<00:00:25.210> then<00:00:25.540> got<00:00:26.079> some

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
Adobe Illustrator imported then got some

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.990 
Adobe Illustrator imported then got some
guide<00:00:26.470> curves<00:00:26.829> and<00:00:27.099> some<00:00:27.279> dimension<00:00:27.730> lines

guide curves and some dimension lines

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.400 
guide curves and some dimension lines
and<00:00:28.329> things<00:00:28.360> like<00:00:28.750> that<00:00:28.809> that<00:00:29.140> are<00:00:29.200> going<00:00:29.349> to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
and things like that that are going to

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.499 
and things like that that are going to
help<00:00:29.619> me<00:00:29.739> keep<00:00:29.919> my<00:00:29.980> size<00:00:30.369> straight<00:00:30.700> but<00:00:31.390> this

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
help me keep my size straight but this

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.990 
help me keep my size straight but this
is<00:00:31.660> where<00:00:31.809> we'd<00:00:31.989> start<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:33.340> next<00:00:33.460> thing<00:00:33.700> we<00:00:33.820> do

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
is where we'd start the next thing we do

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.760 
is where we'd start the next thing we do
is<00:00:34.120> we<00:00:34.300> inflate<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:34.989> handle<00:00:35.320> to<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.500> certain

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
is we inflate the handle to a certain

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.700 
is we inflate the handle to a certain
size<00:00:35.950> so<00:00:36.250> we'll<00:00:36.399> use<00:00:36.550> the<00:00:36.790> inflate<00:00:37.270> command

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
size so we'll use the inflate command

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.940 
size so we'll use the inflate command
come<00:00:38.710> up<00:00:38.830> and<00:00:38.980> select<00:00:39.190> this<00:00:39.370> curve<00:00:40.830> grab<00:00:41.830> it

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
come up and select this curve grab it

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
come up and select this curve grab it
with<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.220> hand<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:42.900> inflate<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:45.640> look<00:00:45.850> at

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
with the hand and inflate we look at

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.180 
with the hand and inflate we look at
that<00:00:46.120> curve<00:00:46.720> from<00:00:46.900> the<00:00:47.050> front<00:00:47.290> and<00:00:47.680> using<00:00:48.040> the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
that curve from the front and using the

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.210 
that curve from the front and using the
deform<00:00:48.640> tool<00:00:48.880> and<00:00:49.620> we'd<00:00:50.620> adjust<00:00:51.010> its

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
deform tool and we'd adjust its

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.610 
deform tool and we'd adjust its
proportions<00:00:51.820> say<00:00:52.540> set<00:00:52.840> it<00:00:52.930> on<00:00:53.050> proportional

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
proportions say set it on proportional

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
proportions say set it on proportional
adjustment<00:00:54.130> come<00:00:55.000> up<00:00:55.180> grab<00:00:55.630> it<00:00:55.840> tuck<00:00:56.500> it<00:00:56.530> in<00:00:56.770> do

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
adjustment come up grab it tuck it in do

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.340 
adjustment come up grab it tuck it in do
different<00:00:58.060> changes<00:00:58.329> to<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:58.660> size<00:00:58.840> depending

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
different changes to the size depending

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.280 
different changes to the size depending
on<00:00:59.440> how<00:00:59.590> we<00:00:59.649> want<00:00:59.950> it<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.100> be<00:01:00.360> affected<00:01:01.360> apply

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
on how we want it to be affected apply

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.179 
on how we want it to be affected apply
that<00:01:05.579> remove<00:01:06.579> the<00:01:06.759> plane<00:01:07.829> don't<00:01:08.829> have<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.039> see

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
that remove the plane don't have to see

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.730 
that remove the plane don't have to see
it<00:01:09.280> anymore<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:10.380> increase<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.530> resolution

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
it anymore and increase the resolution

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.520 
it anymore and increase the resolution
of<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.609> actual<00:01:12.969> piece<00:01:13.810> just<00:01:14.079> so<00:01:14.200> it's<00:01:14.319> a<00:01:14.380> bit

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
of the actual piece just so it's a bit

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.399 
of the actual piece just so it's a bit
smoother<00:01:14.889> I'm<00:01:15.069> going<00:01:15.219> to<00:01:15.280> turn<00:01:15.399> it<00:01:15.520> up<00:01:15.579> to<00:01:16.409> two

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
smoother I'm going to turn it up to two

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.639 
smoother I'm going to turn it up to two
millimeters<00:01:17.590> in<00:01:17.979> size<00:01:21.719> evaluate<00:01:22.719> it<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:22.959> I'll

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
millimeters in size evaluate it and I'll

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.739 
millimeters in size evaluate it and I'll
actually<00:01:23.859> go<00:01:24.100> down<00:01:24.219> to<00:01:24.579> one<00:01:25.209> millimeter<00:01:25.600> in

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:25.749 
actually go down to one millimeter in

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:28.349 
actually go down to one millimeter in
size<00:01:25.869> each<00:01:26.649> step<00:01:27.159> each<00:01:27.429> progressive<00:01:28.090> step

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
size each step each progressive step

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:29.910 
size each step each progressive step
instead<00:01:28.659> of<00:01:28.780> going<00:01:28.990> all<00:01:29.319> the<00:01:29.469> way<00:01:29.560> right<00:01:29.709> down

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
instead of going all the way right down

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.830 
instead of going all the way right down
to<00:01:30.039> one<00:01:30.189> on<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.429> first<00:01:30.700> thing<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.600> go<00:01:31.630> down

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
to one on the first thing to go down

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.949 
to one on the first thing to go down
progressively<00:01:32.409> in<00:01:32.679> steps<00:01:33.779> actually<00:01:34.779> help

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959 
progressively in steps actually help

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:36.660 
progressively in steps actually help
smooth<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.380> model<00:01:35.799> out<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.189> does<00:01:36.639> a

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
smooth the model out and does a

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.399 
smooth the model out and does a
progressive<00:01:37.270> refinement<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.020> surface

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
progressive refinement of the surface

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.069 
progressive refinement of the surface
and<00:01:38.649> creates<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.579> smoother<00:01:39.939> clay<00:01:40.179> model<00:01:40.569> so<00:01:41.020> we

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
and creates a smoother clay model so we

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.449 
and creates a smoother clay model so we
can<00:01:41.200> go<00:01:41.289> down<00:01:41.439> in<00:01:41.590> steps<00:01:41.859> like<00:01:42.069> that<00:01:42.249> and<00:01:42.369> be

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
can go down in steps like that and be

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.399 
can go down in steps like that and be
able<00:01:42.549> to<00:01:42.700> refine<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.299> model<00:01:43.630> create<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.259> more

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
able to refine the model create a more

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.529 
able to refine the model create a more
and<00:01:44.529> more<00:01:44.679> smoother<00:01:45.039> surface<00:01:45.399> some<00:01:46.389> of<00:01:46.479> the

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
and more smoother surface some of the

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.879 
and more smoother surface some of the
next<00:01:46.810> things<00:01:46.990> i'll<00:01:47.139> be<00:01:47.229> doing<00:01:47.349> is<00:01:47.560> just<00:01:47.740> adding

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
next things i'll be doing is just adding

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:49.889 
next things i'll be doing is just adding
some<00:01:48.039> simple<00:01:48.609> wire<00:01:48.789> cuts<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.299> add<00:01:49.420> some<00:01:49.630> form

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
some simple wire cuts to add some form

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.589 
some simple wire cuts to add some form
to<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.109> handle<00:01:50.439> i<00:01:50.619> did<00:01:51.579> a<00:01:51.609> wire<00:01:51.819> cut<00:01:52.090> adhered

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
to the handle i did a wire cut adhered

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.269 
to the handle i did a wire cut adhered
to<00:01:52.630> be<00:01:52.869> able<00:01:52.959> to<00:01:53.079> add<00:01:53.200> clay<00:01:53.529> in<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.740> back<00:01:53.920> so<00:01:54.249> i

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:54.279 
to be able to add clay in the back so i

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:56.459 
to be able to add clay in the back so i
just<00:01:54.579> created<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:55.060> plane<00:01:55.329> projected<00:01:56.139> clay<00:01:56.289> down

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
just created a plane projected clay down

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.609 
just created a plane projected clay down
there<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.810> blended<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:59.049> with<00:01:59.170> that<00:01:59.319> part<00:01:59.560> of

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
there and blended in with that part of

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.249 
there and blended in with that part of
the<00:01:59.679> surface<00:02:00.450> another<00:02:01.450> thing<00:02:01.689> i'd<00:02:01.810> like<00:02:01.869> to<00:02:02.109> do

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
the surface another thing i'd like to do

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.849 
the surface another thing i'd like to do
is<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.529> be<00:02:02.560> able<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:03.240> cut<00:02:04.240> in<00:02:04.590> areas<00:02:05.590> on<00:02:05.770> the

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
is to be able to cut in areas on the

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.059 
is to be able to cut in areas on the
clay<00:02:06.389> to<00:02:07.389> be<00:02:07.479> able<00:02:07.569> to<00:02:07.719> add<00:02:08.319> some<00:02:08.590> just<00:02:08.770> forms

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
clay to be able to add some just forms

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.610 
clay to be able to add some just forms
to<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.340> handle<00:02:09.640> grips<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.149> in<00:02:11.020> this<00:02:11.140> case<00:02:11.349> I

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
to the handle grips and in this case I

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.430 
to the handle grips and in this case I
took<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.930> model<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.170> offset

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
took the model and I offset

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.500 
took the model and I offset
this<00:02:15.800> piece<00:02:16.040> here<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.490> created<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.300> thinner

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
this piece here and created a thinner

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.920 
this piece here and created a thinner
piece<00:02:17.750> by<00:02:18.650> approximately<00:02:19.550> 1<00:02:19.670> millimeter<00:02:20.030> and

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
piece by approximately 1 millimeter and

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.670 
piece by approximately 1 millimeter and
you<00:02:21.740> can<00:02:21.890> see<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.070> here<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:24.170> inside<00:02:24.470> piece

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
you can see that here the inside piece

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.450 
you can see that here the inside piece
is<00:02:24.860> just<00:02:25.100> slightly<00:02:25.280> thinner<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:28.100> what<00:02:28.400> I'm

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
is just slightly thinner and what I'm

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.650 
is just slightly thinner and what I'm
going<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.640> do<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.910> just<00:02:28.940> cut<00:02:29.330> away<00:02:29.480> that

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
going to do is just cut away that

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.110 
going to do is just cut away that
outside<00:02:29.990> using<00:02:30.740> a<00:02:30.890> wire<00:02:31.070> cut<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.460> remove<00:02:31.730> to

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
outside using a wire cut to remove to

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.090 
outside using a wire cut to remove to
reveal<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.750> inside<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:33.590> i'll<00:02:33.680> have<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.860> slight

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
reveal the inside so i'll have a slight

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.010 
reveal the inside so i'll have a slight
little<00:02:34.220> bevel<00:02:34.640> in<00:02:34.730> here<00:02:34.910> i'll<00:02:35.000> say<00:02:35.210> let's<00:02:35.810> work

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
little bevel in here i'll say let's work

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.760 
little bevel in here i'll say let's work
up<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.440> cut<00:02:37.010> away<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.220> material<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.770> once

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
up this cut away the material and once

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.000 
up this cut away the material and once
removed<00:02:40.900> i'll<00:02:41.900> have<00:02:42.020> a<00:02:42.050> nice<00:02:42.260> little<00:02:42.410> step<00:02:42.830> in

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
removed i'll have a nice little step in

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.490 
removed i'll have a nice little step in
on<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:44.030> front<00:02:44.240> in<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.420> back<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.900> they'll

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
on the front in the back and they'll

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.810 
on the front in the back and they'll
just<00:02:45.530> merge<00:02:45.950> these<00:02:46.160> two<00:02:46.220> pieces<00:02:46.520> together

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
just merge these two pieces together

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.030 
just merge these two pieces together
again<00:02:47.390> merge<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.990> outside<00:02:48.380> with<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.740> inside

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
again merge the outside with the inside

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.990 
again merge the outside with the inside
do<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.580> combined<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.250> can<00:02:52.490> see<00:02:52.640> those<00:02:52.790> are

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
do a combined so you can see those are

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.060 
do a combined so you can see those are
two<00:02:53.120> separate<00:02:53.450> pieces<00:02:53.660> then<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.620> did<00:02:54.800> several

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
two separate pieces then I did several

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.830 
two separate pieces then I did several
smooth<00:02:55.520> so<00:02:55.760> I<00:02:55.790> don't<00:02:55.970> want<00:02:56.090> this<00:02:56.210> to<00:02:56.270> be<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.540> hard

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
smooth so I don't want this to be a hard

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.390 
smooth so I don't want this to be a hard
edge<00:02:56.990> handles<00:02:57.410> now<00:02:57.710> I'm<00:02:57.800> going<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.040> be<00:02:58.160> able<00:02:58.250> to

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
edge handles now I'm going to be able to

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.540 
edge handles now I'm going to be able to
have<00:02:58.520> it<00:02:58.580> kind<00:02:59.150> of<00:02:59.270> nice<00:02:59.510> soft<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.530> organic<00:03:01.040> so

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
have it kind of nice soft and organic so

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.030 
have it kind of nice soft and organic so
I<00:03:01.880> just<00:03:02.480> used<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.810> smooth<00:03:03.080> command<00:03:03.440> or<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.740> area

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
I just used a smooth command or the area

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.310 
I just used a smooth command or the area
smooth<00:03:04.280> command<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:05.480> selected<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.050> entire

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
smooth command and I selected the entire

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.400 
smooth command and I selected the entire
thing<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.770> smooth<00:03:07.070> it<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.020> smooth<00:03:09.260> it

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
thing and smooth it and I smooth it

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.100 
thing and smooth it and I smooth it
quite<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.650> bit<00:03:09.740> actually<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.630> rounded<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.750> off<00:03:11.870> so

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
quite a bit actually I rounded it off so

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.780 
quite a bit actually I rounded it off so
I<00:03:12.140> didn't<00:03:12.350> have<00:03:12.440> any<00:03:12.560> hard<00:03:12.770> edges<00:03:12.920> actually

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
I didn't have any hard edges actually

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.310 
I didn't have any hard edges actually
smooth<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.120> little<00:03:14.390> bit<00:03:14.510> more<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:16.760> again<00:03:17.320> I've

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
smooth a little bit more so again I've

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.170 
smooth a little bit more so again I've
got<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:18.800> that<00:03:18.980> it's<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.520> nice<00:03:19.670> kind<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:19.970> soft

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
got it so that it's a nice kind of soft

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.330 
got it so that it's a nice kind of soft
organic<00:03:20.480> handle<00:03:21.020> with<00:03:21.200> kind<00:03:21.830> of<00:03:21.860> a<00:03:21.950> hint<00:03:22.190> of

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
organic handle with kind of a hint of

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.180 
organic handle with kind of a hint of
the<00:03:22.459> actual<00:03:23.230> cutaways<00:03:24.230> in<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.560> just<00:03:24.800> makes<00:03:25.100> a

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
the actual cutaways in it just makes a

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.170 
the actual cutaways in it just makes a
little<00:03:25.310> bit<00:03:25.550> more<00:03:27.130> detailed<00:03:28.130> also<00:03:28.790> in<00:03:28.970> those

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
little bit more detailed also in those

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.300 
little bit more detailed also in those
areas<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:30.050> are<00:03:30.170> kind<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.680> like<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.010> slight

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
areas that are kind of like the slight

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.860 
areas that are kind of like the slight
in<00:03:31.430> sets<00:03:31.670> there's<00:03:32.180> going<00:03:32.330> to<00:03:32.390> be<00:03:32.420> a<00:03:32.510> gripped

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
in sets there's going to be a gripped

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.199 
in sets there's going to be a gripped
handle<00:03:33.320> now<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.100> notice<00:03:34.370> I'm<00:03:34.610> working<00:03:35.120> on

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
handle now you notice I'm working on

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.030 
handle now you notice I'm working on
this<00:03:35.360> without<00:03:35.720> having<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.380> connected<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:36.920> the

this without having it connected to the
actual<00:03:37.459> body<00:03:37.880> yet<00:03:38.680> when<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:39.709> do<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:40.070> body

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
actual body yet when I do the body

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.760 
actual body yet when I do the body
connection<00:03:41.110> I'll<00:03:42.110> explain<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.620> when<00:03:42.650> i

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
connection I'll explain it when i

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.960 
connection I'll explain it when i
actually<00:03:42.950> get<00:03:43.160> there<00:03:43.370> but<00:03:43.580> i<00:03:43.610> want<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.880> make

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
actually get there but i want to make

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.130 
actually get there but i want to make
sure<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.300> I<00:03:44.330> don't<00:03:44.450> do<00:03:44.690> anything<00:03:44.930> that

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
sure that I don't do anything that

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.550 
sure that I don't do anything that
changes<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.850> form<00:03:47.150> as<00:03:47.360> it<00:03:47.510> goes<00:03:47.660> from<00:03:47.810> clay<00:03:48.200> to

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
changes the form as it goes from clay to

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.920 
changes the form as it goes from clay to
this<00:03:48.820> solid<00:03:49.820> I<00:03:49.940> need<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.269> to<00:03:50.450> be<00:03:50.540> an<00:03:50.690> accurate

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
this solid I need that to be an accurate

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.780 
this solid I need that to be an accurate
register<00:03:51.650> all<00:03:51.800> or<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:52.070> will<00:03:52.610> get<00:03:52.760> a

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
register all or I will get a

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.479 
register all or I will get a
discontinuity<00:03:53.300> there<00:03:53.800> this<00:03:54.800> next<00:03:54.830> step<00:03:55.250> I've

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
discontinuity there this next step I've

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.490 
discontinuity there this next step I've
just<00:03:55.700> completed<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.269> voxel<00:03:56.630> eyes<00:03:56.750> region<00:03:57.290> I

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
just completed a voxel eyes region I

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.790 
just completed a voxel eyes region I
just<00:03:57.769> did<00:03:57.980> i<00:03:58.459> created<00:03:59.000> a<00:03:59.320> curve<00:04:00.320> on<00:04:00.470> a<00:04:00.530> plane

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
just did i created a curve on a plane

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.370 
just did i created a curve on a plane
and<00:04:01.040> I<00:04:01.880> used<00:04:02.090> Fox<00:04:02.480> lies<00:04:02.720> with<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:02.989> profile

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
and I used Fox lies with the profile

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.630 
and I used Fox lies with the profile
gave<00:04:04.160> it<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.340> certain<00:04:04.489> thickness<00:04:04.790> and

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
gave it a certain thickness and

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.490 
gave it a certain thickness and
converted<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.730> area<00:04:08.030> where<00:04:08.209> that<00:04:08.750> profile

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
converted the area where that profile

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.160 
converted the area where that profile
intersected<00:04:10.130> that<00:04:10.280> solid<00:04:10.640> and<00:04:10.970> it<00:04:11.570> created<00:04:11.870> a

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
intersected that solid and it created a

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.740 
intersected that solid and it created a
voxel<00:04:12.620> heist<00:04:12.800> region<00:04:13.250> or<00:04:13.519> an<00:04:13.760> area<00:04:14.239> converted

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
voxel heist region or an area converted

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.870 
voxel heist region or an area converted
to<00:04:14.870> clay<00:04:15.110> you<00:04:15.680> can<00:04:15.800> see<00:04:15.950> my<00:04:16.070> handle<00:04:16.430> intersects

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
to clay you can see my handle intersects

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.159 
to clay you can see my handle intersects
that<00:04:17.090> part<00:04:17.390> and<00:04:17.540> that's<00:04:17.630> where<00:04:17.810> I'm<00:04:17.900> going<00:04:18.049> to

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
that part and that's where I'm going to

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.370 
that part and that's where I'm going to
be<00:04:18.260> joining<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.709> two<00:04:18.859> together<00:04:20.230> to<00:04:21.230> build

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
be joining the two together to build

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.490 
be joining the two together to build
them<00:04:21.590> blended<00:04:22.280> handle<00:04:22.580> form

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
them blended handle form

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.030 
them blended handle form
and<00:04:23.770> here<00:04:24.670> I've<00:04:24.820> used<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.900> area<00:04:26.320> smooth

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
and here I've used the area smooth

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.160 
and here I've used the area smooth
command<00:04:27.430> just<00:04:27.670> by<00:04:27.790> saying<00:04:28.000> you<00:04:28.660> know<00:04:28.750> painting

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
command just by saying you know painting

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.800 
command just by saying you know painting
an<00:04:29.260> area<00:04:29.530> between<00:04:29.890> these<00:04:30.570> where<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.660> two

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
an area between these where the two

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.510 
an area between these where the two
parts<00:04:32.110> would<00:04:32.230> join<00:04:32.470> together<00:04:32.620> using<00:04:33.280> the

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
parts would join together using the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.640 
parts would join together using the
combined<00:04:33.880> tool<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.570> I<00:04:34.990> just<00:04:35.170> did<00:04:35.290> an<00:04:35.320> area

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
combined tool and I just did an area

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.300 
combined tool and I just did an area
smooth<00:04:35.920> on<00:04:36.100> that<00:04:36.250> area<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:38.190> blended<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.280> two

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
smooth on that area and blended the two

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.370 
smooth on that area and blended the two
together<00:04:39.640> to<00:04:39.970> create<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:40.380> connection

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
together to create that connection

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.050 
together to create that connection
between<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:42.040> two<00:04:42.220> I<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:44.430> want<00:04:45.430> this<00:04:45.550> transition

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
between the two I I want this transition

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.240 
between the two I I want this transition
to<00:04:46.150> be<00:04:46.240> as<00:04:46.330> smooth<00:04:46.630> as<00:04:46.750> possible<00:04:46.780> I<00:04:47.530> could<00:04:48.160> have

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
to be as smooth as possible I could have

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.040 
to be as smooth as possible I could have
been<00:04:48.430> used<00:04:48.670> the<00:04:48.850> shape<00:04:49.090> tool<00:04:49.300> for<00:04:49.600> example<00:04:49.960> to

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
been used the shape tool for example to

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.170 
been used the shape tool for example to
do<00:04:50.230> a<00:04:50.260> number<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.620> different<00:04:50.710> things<00:04:51.120> but<00:04:52.120> I

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
do a number of different things but I

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.730 
do a number of different things but I
wanted<00:04:52.480> it<00:04:52.600> a<00:04:52.690> pretty<00:04:52.900> simple<00:04:53.200> word<00:04:53.440> joined

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
wanted it a pretty simple word joined

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.290 
wanted it a pretty simple word joined
between<00:04:53.920> the<00:04:54.190> two<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.490> again<00:04:54.610> being<00:04:55.000> able<00:04:55.240> to

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
between the two and again being able to

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.970 
between the two and again being able to
use<00:04:55.390> voxels<00:04:55.870> and<00:04:56.050> clay<00:04:56.260> you<00:04:56.470> can<00:04:56.620> just<00:04:56.770> kind<00:04:56.919> of

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
use voxels and clay you can just kind of

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.190 
use voxels and clay you can just kind of
jam<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.580> together<00:04:57.940> blend<00:04:58.390> it<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:58.690> round<00:04:59.020> it

smooth<00:04:59.500> it<00:04:59.620> whatever<00:04:59.919> you<00:04:59.980> want<00:05:00.510> now<00:05:01.510> to<00:05:01.720> just

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
smooth it whatever you want now to just

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.390 
smooth it whatever you want now to just
step<00:05:02.200> back<00:05:02.380> a<00:05:02.440> minute<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.890> show<00:05:03.010> you<00:05:03.100> how<00:05:03.250> I<00:05:03.280> did

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
step back a minute to show you how I did

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.140 
step back a minute to show you how I did
that<00:05:03.550> blend<00:05:05.430> what<00:05:06.430> I<00:05:06.460> want<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:06.730> be<00:05:06.820> able<00:05:06.910> to<00:05:07.060> do

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
that blend what I want to be able to do

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.730 
that blend what I want to be able to do
is<00:05:07.240> do<00:05:07.390> is<00:05:07.510> smooth<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.870> blend<00:05:08.140> between<00:05:08.440> the

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
is do is smooth the blend between the

two as possible I want to be able to do

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.790 
two as possible I want to be able to do
lots<00:05:10.419> of<00:05:10.600> smoothing<00:05:10.930> and<00:05:11.080> changes<00:05:11.500> on<00:05:11.620> this

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
lots of smoothing and changes on this

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.409 
lots of smoothing and changes on this
piece<00:05:12.010> where<00:05:12.250> while<00:05:12.370> not<00:05:12.550> changing<00:05:13.120> the<00:05:13.210> piece

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
piece where while not changing the piece

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.760 
piece where while not changing the piece

where the two geometries meet the sheet

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.610 
where the two geometries meet the sheet
body<00:05:18.040> and<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:19.510> clay<00:05:19.720> area<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:20.530> was

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
body and the clay area that was

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.030 
body and the clay area that was
converted<00:05:21.490> from<00:05:21.669> it<00:05:22.440> so<00:05:23.440> you<00:05:23.500> can<00:05:23.710> see<00:05:23.830> in<00:05:23.919> this

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
converted from it so you can see in this

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.190 
converted from it so you can see in this
example<00:05:24.220> I've<00:05:24.669> actually<00:05:24.910> got<00:05:25.330> two<00:05:25.540> pieces<00:05:26.020> I

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
example I've actually got two pieces I

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:35.880 
example I've actually got two pieces I
had<00:05:27.750> selected<00:05:28.750> an<00:05:28.990> area<00:05:29.260> from<00:05:29.380> this<00:05:29.590> piece<00:05:34.890> and

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
had selected an area from this piece and

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.350 
had selected an area from this piece and
I<00:05:36.850> had<00:05:37.000> grabbed<00:05:37.360> it<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:37.830> copied<00:05:38.830> it<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:40.150> that<00:05:40.330> I

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
I had grabbed it and copied it so that I

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.530 
I had grabbed it and copied it so that I
had<00:05:40.600> a<00:05:41.490> chunk<00:05:42.490> of<00:05:42.550> material<00:05:42.669> up<00:05:43.090> here<00:05:43.270> that<00:05:43.479> I

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
had a chunk of material up here that I

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.430 
had a chunk of material up here that I
could<00:05:43.690> work<00:05:43.840> with

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.070 

and<00:05:47.560> in<00:05:48.130> this<00:05:48.250> way<00:05:48.720> add<00:05:49.720> a<00:05:49.780> piece<00:05:50.110> that<00:05:51.630> I<00:05:52.630> could

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
and in this way add a piece that I could

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.660 
and in this way add a piece that I could
smooth<00:05:53.650> blend<00:05:54.190> do<00:05:54.520> all<00:05:54.670> kinds<00:05:54.910> of<00:05:55.000> changes<00:05:55.150> to

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
smooth blend do all kinds of changes to

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.850 
smooth blend do all kinds of changes to
without<00:05:57.670> affecting<00:05:58.270> where<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:59.050> two<00:05:59.290> other

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
without affecting where the two other

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.060 
without affecting where the two other
geometries<00:06:00.520> men<00:06:00.850> and<00:06:01.260> you'll<00:06:02.260> see<00:06:02.500> what<00:06:02.890> I<00:06:02.950> do

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
geometries men and you'll see what I do

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.730 
geometries men and you'll see what I do
is<00:06:03.310> I<00:06:03.550> now<00:06:03.700> go<00:06:03.940> and<00:06:04.060> combine<00:06:04.480> this<00:06:04.750> piece<00:06:05.350> where

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
is I now go and combine this piece where

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.050 
is I now go and combine this piece where
you<00:06:05.890> know<00:06:06.010> I've<00:06:06.130> been<00:06:06.280> able<00:06:06.370> to<00:06:06.550> do<00:06:06.670> the<00:06:06.790> blend

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
you know I've been able to do the blend

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.370 
you know I've been able to do the blend
and<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.330> smoothing<00:06:07.780> and<00:06:07.870> everything<00:06:08.230> like

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
and the smoothing and everything like

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.160 
and the smoothing and everything like
that<00:06:08.440> too<00:06:08.860> I<00:06:09.240> can<00:06:10.240> combine<00:06:10.570> those<00:06:10.780> two<00:06:10.990> pieces

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
that too I can combine those two pieces

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.580 
that too I can combine those two pieces
together<00:06:11.530> and<00:06:12.690> get<00:06:13.690> a<00:06:13.720> much<00:06:13.960> smoother<00:06:14.350> piece

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
together and get a much smoother piece

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.430 
together and get a much smoother piece
so<00:06:15.400> I'll<00:06:15.520> do<00:06:15.930> combine<00:06:16.930> into<00:06:17.110> and<00:06:17.500> the<00:06:17.770> one<00:06:17.950> and

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
so I'll do combine into and the one and

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.740 
so I'll do combine into and the one and
been<00:06:20.440> able<00:06:20.590> to<00:06:20.860> arrive<00:06:21.160> at<00:06:21.430> this<00:06:22.030> really<00:06:22.540> nice

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
been able to arrive at this really nice

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.000 
been able to arrive at this really nice
and<00:06:23.080> transition<00:06:23.920> from<00:06:24.160> this<00:06:24.520> piece<00:06:24.730> here<00:06:26.010> into

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
and transition from this piece here into

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.800 
and transition from this piece here into
my<00:06:27.130> piece<00:06:27.370> that<00:06:27.610> I<00:06:27.790> don't<00:06:28.060> want<00:06:28.210> any<00:06:28.420> changes

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
my piece that I don't want any changes

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.040 
my piece that I don't want any changes
on<00:06:28.930> it<00:06:29.050> all<00:06:29.200> again<00:06:29.680> I<00:06:29.890> don't<00:06:30.310> want<00:06:30.580> to<00:06:30.700> have

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
on it all again I don't want to have

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.290 
on it all again I don't want to have
anything<00:06:32.050> happen<00:06:32.380> where<00:06:33.220> this<00:06:34.000> piece

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
anything happen where this piece

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.320 
anything happen where this piece
contacts<00:06:35.170> my<00:06:35.590> sheet<00:06:35.860> body<00:06:36.100> those<00:06:36.700> pieces<00:06:37.000> must

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
contacts my sheet body those pieces must

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.940 
contacts my sheet body those pieces must
stay<00:06:37.570> and<00:06:37.750> its<00:06:37.900> exact<00:06:38.320> the<00:06:38.470> register<00:06:38.860> as

stay and its exact the register as

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.950 
stay and its exact the register as
possible<00:06:39.520> to<00:06:40.120> prevent<00:06:40.390> gaps<00:06:40.720> and

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
possible to prevent gaps and

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.040 
possible to prevent gaps and
discontinuities<00:06:41.620> when<00:06:41.830> I<00:06:41.860> go<00:06:42.100> and<00:06:42.250> create

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
discontinuities when I go and create

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.170 
discontinuities when I go and create
then<00:06:44.050> patches<00:06:44.350> that<00:06:44.920> reverse<00:06:45.610> engineer<00:06:46.090> from

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
then patches that reverse engineer from

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.320 
then patches that reverse engineer from
this<00:06:46.360> edge<00:06:46.540> onto<00:06:46.810> the<00:06:47.020> clay<00:06:47.320> now<00:06:48.190> again<00:06:48.880> pay

this edge onto the clay now again pay

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.390 
this edge onto the clay now again pay
attention<00:06:49.360> attention<00:06:50.140> to<00:06:50.560> this<00:06:50.680> clay<00:06:50.980> up<00:06:51.130> here

there<00:06:59.260> won't<00:06:59.880> the<00:07:00.880> work<00:07:01.030> that<00:07:01.210> I<00:07:01.240> do<00:07:01.330> later

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
there won't the work that I do later

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.150 
there won't the work that I do later
because<00:07:02.110> it's<00:07:02.260> outside<00:07:02.410> of<00:07:02.650> the<00:07:02.770> edge<00:07:02.950> that

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
because it's outside of the edge that

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.770 
because it's outside of the edge that
I'm<00:07:03.250> going<00:07:03.400> to<00:07:03.460> copy<00:07:03.640> from<00:07:03.910> and<00:07:04.240> then<00:07:04.360> the<00:07:04.630> edge

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
I'm going to copy from and then the edge

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.610 
I'm going to copy from and then the edge
being<00:07:05.940> this<00:07:06.940> edge<00:07:07.180> here<00:07:07.210> so<00:07:08.169> it's<00:07:08.350> not<00:07:08.410> going

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
being this edge here so it's not going

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.490 
being this edge here so it's not going
to<00:07:08.710> affect<00:07:08.740> where<00:07:09.130> i<00:07:09.160> work<00:07:09.400> from<00:07:10.169> you<00:07:11.169> can<00:07:11.320> see

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500 
to affect where i work from you can see

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.080 
to affect where i work from you can see
it's<00:07:11.620> clearly<00:07:11.890> on<00:07:12.070> the<00:07:12.220> other<00:07:12.370> side<00:07:12.640> of<00:07:12.669> it<00:07:12.850> but

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
it's clearly on the other side of it but

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.810 
it's clearly on the other side of it but
just<00:07:13.210> to<00:07:13.360> point<00:07:13.540> it<00:07:13.690> out
