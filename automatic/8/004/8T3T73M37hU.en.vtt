hunting hours up in tree stands or
elevated<00:00:05.549> areas<00:00:06.029> but<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.690> find<00:00:06.990> more<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.500> more

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
elevated areas but I find more and more

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.950 
elevated areas but I find more and more
there<00:00:07.890> are<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.010> lot<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.250> opportunities<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.360> hunt

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
there are a lot of opportunities to hunt

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.990 
there are a lot of opportunities to hunt
off<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.290> ground<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.889> know<00:00:11.610> there<00:00:11.759> are<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.849> lot<00:00:11.969> of

off the ground I know there are a lot of

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.700 
off the ground I know there are a lot of
you<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.389> are<00:00:12.480> physically<00:00:12.840> challenged<00:00:13.559> or

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
you that are physically challenged or

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.709 
you that are physically challenged or
you<00:00:13.980> plain<00:00:14.280> just<00:00:14.519> don't<00:00:14.849> like<00:00:15.059> getting<00:00:15.330> up<00:00:15.540> and

you plain just don't like getting up and
there<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.049> might<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> little<00:00:16.500> afraid<00:00:16.710> of

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
there you might be a little afraid of

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.460 
there you might be a little afraid of
altitude<00:00:17.779> ground<00:00:18.779> hunting<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.320> be<00:00:19.350> extremely

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
altitude ground hunting can be extremely

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.429 
altitude ground hunting can be extremely
effective<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.880> might<00:00:21.119> add<00:00:21.330> very<00:00:21.900> easy<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
effective and I might add very easy to

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.859 
effective and I might add very easy to
do<00:00:22.650> there<00:00:23.519> are<00:00:23.609> manufactured<00:00:24.269> blinds<00:00:24.779> that

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
do there are manufactured blinds that

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.470 
do there are manufactured blinds that
you<00:00:25.019> can<00:00:25.170> use<00:00:25.439> out<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.949> netting<00:00:26.490> type<00:00:26.849> material

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
you can use out of netting type material

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.519 
you can use out of netting type material
that<00:00:27.599> will<00:00:27.689> conceal<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.230> quite<00:00:28.500> well

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
that will conceal you quite well

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.669 
that will conceal you quite well
although<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.640> find<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> most<00:00:31.199> part<00:00:31.349> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
although I find that for the most part a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.830 
although I find that for the most part a
natural<00:00:32.219> blind<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> best<00:00:33.120> way<00:00:33.300> to

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
natural blind is the best way to

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.380 
natural blind is the best way to
approach<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.290> hunting<00:00:34.559> situation<00:00:35.000> as<00:00:36.000> far<00:00:36.300> as

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
approach a hunting situation as far as

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.490 
approach a hunting situation as far as
where<00:00:36.630> do<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.840> hunt<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> ground

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
where do you hunt on the ground

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.560 
where do you hunt on the ground
typically<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.460> look<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:38.940> areas<00:00:39.090> where<00:00:39.420> there's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
typically I look for areas where there's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.270 
typically I look for areas where there's
a<00:00:39.629> lot<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.840> deer<00:00:40.140> sign<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.070> down

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
don't put your stand on the deer trail

don't put your stand on the deer trail

with your bow hunting or your rifle
hunting<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.930> then<00:00:52.860> consider<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.820> wind<00:00:54.030> most

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719

westerlies northerlies or southerlies
but<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.170> use<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.530> wind<00:01:01.770> when<00:01:02.340> you're

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
but you have to use the wind when you're

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.439 
but you have to use the wind when you're
on<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.640> ground<00:01:02.879> you're<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> lot<00:01:03.420> more

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
on the ground you're a lot more

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.539 
on the ground you're a lot more
susceptible<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> animal<00:01:04.949> smelling<00:01:05.400> you

susceptible to the animal smelling you
another<00:01:06.390> very<00:01:06.720> important<00:01:07.260> factor<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> use

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
another very important factor is a use

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.570 
another very important factor is a use
of<00:01:08.130> sunlight<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.630> Sun<00:01:09.900> early<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.740> late<00:01:11.070> can

of sunlight the Sun early and late can

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.670 
of sunlight the Sun early and late can
be<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> blinding<00:01:12.330> factor<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> animals

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
be a blinding factor to the animals

be a blinding factor to the animals
there<00:01:14.280> been<00:01:14.400> many<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.670> time<00:01:14.939> where<00:01:15.180> I've<00:01:15.270> looked

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
there been many a time where I've looked

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.600 
there been many a time where I've looked
at<00:01:15.659> deer<00:01:15.960> right<00:01:16.470> square<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> eyes<00:01:17.159> at<00:01:17.430> less
