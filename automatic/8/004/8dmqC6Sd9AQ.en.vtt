 old scholl and indeed to this look 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.389
 I started polling on facebook 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.400
 there you can between three things 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.070
 choose what should come today 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.789
 the other was in eyebrow video or 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.630
 a transformation from everyday look to 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.340
 evening make up and the third was that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.320
 this has won very close 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.090
 Maybe it can be that 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.030
 vote again now 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.950
 looks different but at the time where 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.820
 I was shooting the video now 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.730
 this look just the most offered 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.770
 usual and that's why I have that 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.420
 today for you the others turned 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.550
 of course, videos will come too 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.250
 von jörg believes the second time 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.170
 tuned then make the week on it 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.110
 or in the near future was like 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.579
 So always on my facebook 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.109
 pay a visit to everyone 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.090
 case because then you have a little bit 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.430
 have a say in what's next 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.110
 for a video comes and could then there 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.760
 also decide with what you want to decide 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.100
 I have a look like you again 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.420
 you also like the video and you 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.860
 understands everything the way I did it 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.270
 have that today it is pretty much 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.220
 changeable I'm always too 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.509
 actually instructed and the sun the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.369
 money or the clouds and then it comes 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.100
 would be out then it's in the clouds 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.600
 and that's why it always gets that way 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.280
 bright to dark light to dark 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.710
 I hope you do not mind this and 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.660
 that you like anyway and here 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.080
 Now have fun with the video 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.660
 [Music] 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.780
 [Laughter] 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.939
 [Music] 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.310
 As a product, I use the eyeliner 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.049
 this smokey eyes set and carry it with 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.850
 the applicator from my complete die 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.380
 on or wherever I am 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.390
 after that also eyeshadows do not have 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.189
 An applicator is suitable for this 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.630
 perfect because he's just the same 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.149
 Achieve effect as for example now 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.560
 the finger and takes the most color 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.310
 but I just finger the same 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.310
 does not make you dirty 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.930
 the fallopian tube base is best always from 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.470
 please apply to the outside and 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.720
 then outwards and inwards 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.230
 simply hide the color 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.390
 or deficits from angle on 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.000
 highest and always inside 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:26.180
 becomes weaker 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.180
 [Music] 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.390
 next i will use the eyeshadow 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.100
 from that spot and hit the one with 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.720
 brush on the middle of my way 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.620
 then open again and then follow suit 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.620
 outside out 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.220
 once on the brush is not that much anymore 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.620
 color is I start that you in the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.090
 so that I work 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.950
 because not so much color 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.950
 but can hide so slowly 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:17.640
 [Music] 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.930
 to lure now the black mouse angle 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.790
 I also serve one 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.129
 black coat the shadow of one 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.140
 beach cosmetics range and give him 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.920
 just really on the outside and lay 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:32.220
 so maria pure and also in the eyelet fold 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.220
 [Music] 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.990
 around the epitome of my eye at this 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.700
 to lighten a bit locally 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.340
 I clicked this food in the color 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.140
 03 starlight and also for one 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.420
 applicator because with it really easy 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.550
 the most color is distributed and goes 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.380
 then in the angle and at the bottom 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.040
 especially long and a bit too 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.040
 recover 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.980
 Now I'm just missing the painting 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.930
 I'm really looking forward to something new 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.760
 assortment comes out not to last 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.530
 again such a wild guy I unfortunately 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.990
 and I swam with this 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.220
 Part of it must be so that yes 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.650
 Again, always different 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.390
 and then will be the eyelashes 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.460
 showered with my ilove extreme 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.460

 [Music] 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.710
 in the outer corner of my eye I wear then 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.960

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.120
 waterline on easy again and 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.630
 these outside quite dark and brighter 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:15.220
 become 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:16.960
 because to reinforce directly after 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.760
 I now fell down in witten 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.280
 Treichl has eliminated a concealer 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.740
 and smooth that one up with mine 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.020

 great with it and I'm right 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.380
 Enthusiastic and then I would have the

 because I'm too stressed eyes 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.790
 I would use a color for the lips 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:27.260
 while I use here from p 2 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:28.670
