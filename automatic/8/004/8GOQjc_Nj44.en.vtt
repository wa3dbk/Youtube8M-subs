this<00:00:08.170> video<00:00:08.559> shows<00:00:09.160> how<00:00:09.219> to<00:00:09.490> add<00:00:09.910> hands<00:00:10.660> to<00:00:11.080> a

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
this video shows how to add hands to a

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.840 
this video shows how to add hands to a
basic<00:00:11.680> humanoid<00:00:12.959> in<00:00:13.959> edit<00:00:14.529> mode<00:00:14.820> position<00:00:15.820> the

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:15.850 
basic humanoid in edit mode position the

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.269 
basic humanoid in edit mode position the
model<00:00:16.270> so<00:00:16.750> that<00:00:16.779> you<00:00:17.080> can<00:00:17.260> clearly<00:00:17.590> see<00:00:18.039> the

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
model so that you can clearly see the

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.200 
model so that you can clearly see the
wrist<00:00:18.789> area<00:00:19.710> make<00:00:20.710> sure<00:00:20.740> X<00:00:21.340> symmetry<00:00:22.030> is

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
wrist area make sure X symmetry is

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.020 
wrist area make sure X symmetry is
switched<00:00:22.600> on<00:00:22.960> so<00:00:23.650> that<00:00:23.800> both<00:00:24.039> hands<00:00:24.460> are<00:00:24.610> built

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
switched on so that both hands are built

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.310 
switched on so that both hands are built
at<00:00:25.270> the<00:00:25.420> same<00:00:25.660> time<00:00:27.090> using<00:00:28.090> a<00:00:28.390> small<00:00:28.750> drawl

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
at the same time using a small drawl

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.000 
at the same time using a small drawl

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
size click and drag to create a new Z's

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.209 
size click and drag to create a new Z's
fear<00:00:33.399> then<00:00:34.239> hold<00:00:34.600> down<00:00:34.750> control<00:00:35.469> before

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
fear then hold down control before

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.809 
fear then hold down control before
dragging<00:00:36.940> out<00:00:37.149> further<00:00:37.679> the<00:00:38.679> Newsies<00:00:39.219> fear<00:00:39.550> is

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:39.819 
dragging out further the Newsies fear is

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:43.049 
dragging out further the Newsies fear is
scaled<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.989> draw<00:00:41.319> size<00:00:41.649> and<00:00:42.129> positioned

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
scaled to the draw size and positioned

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.669 
scaled to the draw size and positioned
away<00:00:43.479> from<00:00:43.809> its<00:00:43.960> parent<00:00:44.550> add<00:00:46.079> two<00:00:47.079> more<00:00:47.289> Z's

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
away from its parent add two more Z's

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.379 
away from its parent add two more Z's
fears<00:00:48.069> in<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.850> same<00:00:49.089> way<00:00:50.489> click<00:00:51.489> to<00:00:51.670> add<00:00:51.879> two

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:52.389 
fears in the same way click to add two

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:55.889 
fears in the same way click to add two
newsies<00:00:53.350> fears<00:00:53.769> either<00:00:54.519> side<00:00:54.940> of<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.569> middle

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
newsies fears either side of the middle

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.489 
newsies fears either side of the middle
finger<00:00:56.549> these<00:00:57.549> will<00:00:57.819> become<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.420> index<00:00:59.229> and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:00:59.499 
finger these will become the index and

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.779 
finger these will become the index and
ring<00:00:59.559> fingers<00:01:01.469> adds<00:01:02.469> these<00:01:02.889> fears<00:01:03.309> to<00:01:03.670> the

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
ring fingers adds these fears to the

ring fingers adds these fears to the
thumb<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.330> little<00:01:04.420> finger<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.890> that<00:01:06.100> they<00:01:06.250> can

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
thumb and little finger so that they can

thumb and little finger so that they can
be<00:01:06.549> repositioned<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.890> preview<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:08.920> mesh

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.209 

now<00:01:13.460> add<00:01:13.790> further<00:01:14.240> Z's<00:01:14.659> fears<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.680> create<00:01:16.039> the

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
now add further Z's fears to create the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.359 
now add further Z's fears to create the
joints<00:01:16.700> then<00:01:17.479> move<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.990> fingers<00:01:18.439> into<00:01:19.009> a<00:01:19.039> more

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
joints then move the fingers into a more

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.480 
joints then move the fingers into a more
natural<00:01:19.939> pose

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.330 

in<00:01:27.490> scale<00:01:28.060> mode<00:01:28.440> resize<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:29.740> hand<00:01:30.010> as

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
in scale mode resize the hand as

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:39.360 
in scale mode resize the hand as
necessary

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.150 

continue<00:01:40.370> to<00:01:40.550> refine<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.180> model<00:01:41.560> then<00:01:42.560> make

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
continue to refine the model then make

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.900 
continue to refine the model then make
an<00:01:43.340> adaptive<00:01:43.970> skin<00:01:45.370> select<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.610> skin

an adaptive skin select the skin

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.630 
an adaptive skin select the skin
diversion<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.350> refine<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.070> mesh<00:01:49.100> further

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
diversion and refine the mesh further

00:01:49.640 --> 00:02:02.830 
diversion and refine the mesh further
