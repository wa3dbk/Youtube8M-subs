00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.690
 zoom in a video today a little review 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.800
 About the things I'm so last 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:21.619
 time to box we catch the best 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.810
 times with the imax 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.349
 I had no problems at all 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.790
 the mx so loads once free lasts 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.570
 the 5400 so about three quarters of an hour 0 2 it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.270
 so about 45 to 50 minutes in the cut 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.780
 only disadvantage the thing is right 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.890
 hot 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.059
 because he has no fan, the thing is mega 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.399
 I would not have thought hot 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.960
 that then cools down again when the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.600
 ampere numbers decline again 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.660
 the problem is but if I am now 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.920
 I would like to load example two 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.719
 not that thing that looks white 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.020
 I do not think so I will 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.789
 make that cool the charger 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.510
 leave and do a second workout differently 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:11.549
 is the familiar but he is not so 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:16.350
 but well, at least it's ok 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.659
 the thing with the city bot case has 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.700
 Now about five charges run away 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.990
 bomb I have the one here is one 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.790
 on it because I do not take off several 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.330
 to get confused what happened 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.860
 which not 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.860
 that's why the number is up 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.159
 I have been charging for 25 years 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.420
 40 50 minutes somehow something like that 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.600
 in between has really great vapor so 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.030
 for the price really unbeatable the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.340
 adapter cable that I have bought 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.750
 they are a bit shaky that 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.750
 balancer cable that is somehow 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.159
 pretty shaky too, but this one 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.470
 So it goes misfire has not had it 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.119
 since a bit shaky that it me 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.530
 where here and then I could yes 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.310
 not yet use mine 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.119
 level is still not there 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.930
 but here it is so that the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.670
 plug and pretty 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.380
 babbel my turn so there it is 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.479
 processing not so special though 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.780
 okay as long as it works I say 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.840
 times 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.380
 all that in the frame then we still have 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.970
 the lipo safe bag is the only thing 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.710
 I noticed that always know openly 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.160
 to do 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:27.760
 Suddenly you can see that here it dissolves 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.120
 so a bit the nato but otherwise 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.910
 everything bonn by manager for the 23 euro 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.130
 he is live bomba for the time from beijing 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.340
 so go 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.280
 bild I say I'm gone and that is 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.660
 car in front 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.820
 should I show what I there times 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.020
 at the time so everything was tuned so 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.870
 I should not use the other sneaker otherwise 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.370
 actually so I live inside only 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.110
 Of course it is a bit dirty 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.330
 I like to go outside until now 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.380
 still no time and lust found because 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.380
 to clean up 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.959
 that's what the young ones want 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.739
 break into it 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.900
 So hammer goes off like the st 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.140
 on asphalt werner grip did it 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.820
 can immediately recognize high front wheel the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.700
 all the way out of here was so through 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.870
 the ridge has really fierce 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.190
 I did not think so with the two of them 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.530
 go the absolute madness 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.220
 As you can see, everything starts slowly 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:41.200
 rust the screw heads start with 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.090
 east through the constant water since the 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.000
 cost stop there I am always superior 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.900
 to get more stainless steel screws 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.170
 What else have I done here is one 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:55.060
 a little bit that it does not work that way 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:58.110
 and the caro on it is here i have the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.489
 largest included placeholder 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.130
 packed in with the adhesive surface 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.500
 down so clean if you are now 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.310
 namely, the lipo takes the fits 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.130
 bit pressure 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.830
 just as pure as he has not a bit 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.260
 play because nothing can happen there also 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.299
 I have the rashes already 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.120
 had with the thing and is nothing 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.910
 I happened recently I 've got 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.730
 now the shock absorbers all wrestlers 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.010
 that means nice up 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.870
 jumps and where I did that 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.900
 I have a near one in the forest 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.389
 downhill track found there a few 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.290
 people have purely carpentered and there 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.880
 I built him under there 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.370
 jump there are six so seven 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.220
 meter height difference ten meters far 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.610
 otherwise it has come up high 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.680
 nothing on the axis on the rheder 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.800
 nothing about the car is absolutely nothing 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.100
 broken that's really that fascinates 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.950
 me on this car 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.510
 that really never something breaks 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:09.280
 so far expensive but really amazing 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.780
 So far , nothing really had been so 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.320
 if a few scratches subcategories 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.810
 one struts everywhere empire just when 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.720
 on asphalt if you have one 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.370
 score comes then it hits but 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.050
 nothing is the only thing I do 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.690
 had to 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.860
 after I installed the engine 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.669
 I have to tighten the clutch a bit 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:34.419
 So make the kripo clutch on 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:36.900
 screw in that they do not last 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.220
 grinds because of the more power 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.780
 has the permanently ground that is 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.440
 he did not really kick in I thought 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.889
 Only then do I take it 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.150
 here screwed on the housing cover and 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.160
 I saw the whole man 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.530
 then made one more turn 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.270
 and lo and behold, the thing breaks 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:00.880
 release yes that's it actually is 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.090
 also review otherwise knows the rest 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.430
 all the clarification to the caro if what 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.470
 new comes out or if 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.880
 new car comes new parts i do 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.110
 of course called boxing because of her 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.460
 experience it all again close 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.950
 in any case much fun 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.969
 the weather still enjoys it for so long 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.509
 a bit dry 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:26.449
 and not too cold make you out 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:28.839
 with the cars until then a lot of fun and 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.839
 BayWa
