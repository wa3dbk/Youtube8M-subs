hello there i'm mark from stick shift

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.900 
hello there i'm mark from stick shift
masterclass<00:00:05.500> calm<00:00:05.950> and<00:00:06.490> i'm<00:00:06.580> going<00:00:06.700> to<00:00:06.790> show

masterclass calm and i'm going to show

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.090 
masterclass calm and i'm going to show
you<00:00:06.970> how<00:00:07.060> to<00:00:07.209> do<00:00:07.359> the<00:00:07.480> power<00:00:07.689> down<00:00:07.930> shift<00:00:08.260> down

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100 
you how to do the power down shift down

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.859 
you how to do the power down shift down
shifting<00:00:09.610> is<00:00:09.760> usually<00:00:10.090> associated<00:00:10.420> with

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:10.869 
shifting is usually associated with

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:13.320 
shifting is usually associated with
slowing<00:00:11.230> down<00:00:11.590> because<00:00:12.250> when<00:00:12.670> driving<00:00:12.910> stick

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
slowing down because when driving stick

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.180 
slowing down because when driving stick
generally<00:00:13.809> you<00:00:13.930> adjust<00:00:14.260> your<00:00:14.379> speed<00:00:14.680> then

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
generally you adjust your speed then

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.700 
generally you adjust your speed then
shift<00:00:15.580> your<00:00:15.699> gear<00:00:16.029> so<00:00:16.779> you'd<00:00:16.930> speed<00:00:17.230> up<00:00:17.439> then

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
shift your gear so you'd speed up then

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.370 
shift your gear so you'd speed up then
change<00:00:18.100> up<00:00:18.400> and<00:00:18.580> slow<00:00:19.150> down<00:00:19.420> then<00:00:19.720> shift<00:00:20.080> down

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
change up and slow down then shift down

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.440 
change up and slow down then shift down
but<00:00:21.040> you<00:00:21.130> can<00:00:21.280> downshift<00:00:21.490> without<00:00:22.000> losing

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
but you can downshift without losing

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.830 
but you can downshift without losing
speed<00:00:22.690> is<00:00:23.200> called<00:00:23.560> power<00:00:23.890> down<00:00:24.220> shifting<00:00:24.840> now

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
speed is called power down shifting now

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.570 
speed is called power down shifting now
one<00:00:26.020> of<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.170> advantage<00:00:26.619> isn't<00:00:26.890> driving<00:00:27.310> stick

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
one of the advantage isn't driving stick

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.370 
one of the advantage isn't driving stick
is<00:00:27.940> that<00:00:28.210> you<00:00:28.300> can<00:00:28.449> select<00:00:28.660> your<00:00:28.900> gear<00:00:29.170> in

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
is that you can select your gear in

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.310 
is that you can select your gear in
advance<00:00:29.770> of<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.100> situation<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:32.050> you<00:00:32.110> would

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
advance of the situation so you would

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.229 
advance of the situation so you would
use<00:00:32.529> this<00:00:32.680> technique<00:00:33.100> when<00:00:33.399> say<00:00:33.670> approaching

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
use this technique when say approaching

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.419 
use this technique when say approaching
a<00:00:34.329> curve<00:00:34.600> or<00:00:34.870> sizing<00:00:35.379> up<00:00:35.469> a<00:00:35.589> passing<00:00:36.069> maneuver

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:36.429 
a curve or sizing up a passing maneuver

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:38.669 
a curve or sizing up a passing maneuver
putting<00:00:37.329> your<00:00:37.359> car<00:00:37.690> in<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:37.839> most<00:00:38.050> responsive

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:38.679 
putting your car in the most responsive

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:40.529 
putting your car in the most responsive
gear<00:00:38.949> so<00:00:39.550> that<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.760> balance<00:00:40.089> between<00:00:40.239> your

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
gear so that the balance between your

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.200 
gear so that the balance between your
motors<00:00:40.960> rpm<00:00:41.469> and<00:00:41.620> your<00:00:42.190> gear<00:00:42.399> is<00:00:42.579> just<00:00:42.699> right

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
motors rpm and your gear is just right

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.689 
motors rpm and your gear is just right
to<00:00:43.870> give<00:00:44.019> you<00:00:44.140> the<00:00:44.260> power<00:00:44.440> you<00:00:44.620> need<00:00:44.769> when<00:00:45.550> you

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
to give you the power you need when you

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.000 
to give you the power you need when you
need<00:00:45.729> it<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.989> technique<00:00:47.379> can<00:00:47.440> also<00:00:47.710> be<00:00:47.979> used

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
need it this technique can also be used

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.829 
need it this technique can also be used
when<00:00:48.370> you're<00:00:48.519> changing<00:00:48.789> down<00:00:49.179> in<00:00:49.389> the<00:00:49.479> normal

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
when you're changing down in the normal

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.809 
when you're changing down in the normal
way<00:00:49.989> when<00:00:50.229> you're<00:00:50.350> slowing<00:00:50.769> down<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:51.550> give<00:00:51.699> you

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:51.819 
way when you're slowing down to give you

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:55.720 
way when you're slowing down to give you
the<00:00:51.940> smoothest<00:00:52.510> possible<00:00:52.929> shift

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.180 

the<00:00:56.720> secret<00:00:57.079> to<00:00:57.110> this<00:00:57.290> technique<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:58.040> Rev

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
the secret to this technique is the Rev

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.510 
the secret to this technique is the Rev
match<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.760> short<00:00:59.390> on<00:00:59.540> off<00:00:59.660> squeeze<00:00:59.989> of<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.170> gas

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
match a short on off squeeze of the gas

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.520 
match a short on off squeeze of the gas
increasing<00:01:01.520> revs<00:01:01.730> by<00:01:02.000> say<00:01:02.329> between<00:01:02.570> 500<00:01:03.410> and<00:01:03.440> a

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
increasing revs by say between 500 and a

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.250 
increasing revs by say between 500 and a
thousand<00:01:04.010> rpm<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:05.150> liven<00:01:05.360> up<00:01:05.540> your<00:01:05.600> motor<00:01:05.990> as

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
thousand rpm to liven up your motor as

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.390 
thousand rpm to liven up your motor as
you<00:01:06.650> downshift<00:01:07.869> so<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:08.990> idea<00:01:09.110> then<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.770> to

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
you downshift so the idea then is to

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.460 
you downshift so the idea then is to
downshift<00:01:10.909> in<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.240> normal<00:01:11.570> way<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:12.350> it's

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
downshift in the normal way so it's

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.040 
downshift in the normal way so it's
clutching<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.100> shift<00:01:13.369> but<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.119> rev<00:01:14.360> match<00:01:14.600> as

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
clutching and shift but to rev match as

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.560 
clutching and shift but to rev match as
you<00:01:15.350> shift<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:16.490> practice<00:01:16.970> you<00:01:17.119> can<00:01:17.240> actually

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
you shift to practice you can actually

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.330 
you shift to practice you can actually
try<00:01:17.810> just<00:01:18.050> pushing<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.470> crunch<00:01:18.710> in<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.100> rev

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
try just pushing a crunch in the rev

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.320 
try just pushing a crunch in the rev
matching<00:01:19.520> but<00:01:20.210> without<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.509> shift<00:01:22.119> but<00:01:23.119> just

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
matching but without the shift but just

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.760 
matching but without the shift but just
get<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.600> feet<00:01:23.810> used<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.350> what<00:01:24.470> it<00:01:24.619> is<00:01:24.650> are

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
get the feet used to what it is are

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.350 
get the feet used to what it is are
there<00:01:25.009> going<00:01:25.159> to<00:01:25.220> be<00:01:25.280> doing<00:01:25.460> when<00:01:26.240> you're

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
there going to be doing when you're

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.469 
there going to be doing when you're
ready<00:01:26.540> for<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.840> shift<00:01:27.820> then<00:01:28.820> add<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.119> actual

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
ready for the shift then add the actual

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:30.880 
ready for the shift then add the actual
gear<00:01:29.720> shift<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.170> Rev<00:01:30.380> match<00:01:30.619> on<00:01:30.860> your

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
gear shift to the Rev match on your

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.060 
gear shift to the Rev match on your
downshifts<00:01:31.670> giving<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.450> smoother<00:01:32.960> shift<00:01:33.259> so

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
downshifts giving a smoother shift so

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.800 
downshifts giving a smoother shift so
that's<00:01:34.250> clutch<00:01:34.550> down<00:01:34.820> shift<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.360> rev<00:01:35.570> match

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
that's clutch down shift and rev match

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.770 
that's clutch down shift and rev match
clutch<00:01:36.590> up<00:01:36.800> and<00:01:37.039> if<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.000> want<00:01:38.180> to<00:01:38.300> downshift

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
clutch up and if you want to downshift

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.499 
clutch up and if you want to downshift
but<00:01:39.050> speed<00:01:39.320> up<00:01:39.530> well<00:01:40.280> finally<00:01:41.180> as<00:01:41.330> you

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
but speed up well finally as you

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:42.969 
but speed up well finally as you
complete<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.990> downshift<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.590> lift<00:01:42.860> the

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
complete the downshift and lift the

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.430 
complete the downshift and lift the
clutch<00:01:43.220> feed<00:01:43.970> in<00:01:44.149> the<00:01:44.180> gas<00:01:44.479> in<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.020> same<00:01:45.259> way

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
clutch feed in the gas in the same way

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.529 
clutch feed in the gas in the same way
as<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:45.590> would<00:01:45.800> after<00:01:46.009> shifting<00:01:46.550> up<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.360> that's

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
as you would after shifting up so that's

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.990 
as you would after shifting up so that's
clutching<00:01:48.020> shift<00:01:48.679> and<00:01:48.860> rev<00:01:49.009> match<00:01:49.250> clutch<00:01:49.759> up

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
clutching shift and rev match clutch up
