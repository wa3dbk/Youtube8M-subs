what's<00:04:34.039> his<00:04:34.699> speed<00:04:35.059> so<00:04:35.089> good<00:04:35.479> I<00:04:35.599> think<00:04:35.629> Ren

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.469 
what's his speed so good I think Ren

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:52.779 
what's his speed so good I think Ren
that<00:04:47.949> he<00:04:48.949> loses<00:04:49.489> a<00:04:49.519> health<00:04:50.299> very<00:04:50.629> fast<00:04:51.049> so<00:04:51.789> you

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
that he loses a health very fast so you

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:59.139 
that he loses a health very fast so you
best<00:04:53.029> make<00:04:53.329> sure<00:04:53.779> that<00:04:54.469> um<00:04:57.729> you<00:04:58.729> best<00:04:58.969> make
