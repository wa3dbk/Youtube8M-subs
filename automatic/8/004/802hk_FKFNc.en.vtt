00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.169
 with only a few days 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:10.409
 today we will continue 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.199
 the plates with this 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.240
 which tools we have in the market for gaspar 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.919
 king these pests and prevent that sector 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.159
 per hundred for it we are going to cut a wide range of products 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.249
 specific 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.099
 it is for this the acp adopta and the basic norm 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.330
 per hundred yes they attend it 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.510
 has every pass 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.720
 kelly that are recommendations from 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.960
 will be that 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960
 together he has to apply for 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.270
 for what he recommends 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.870
 Each plant 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.290
 for them 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.830
 it's good you have to take into account the actress 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.830
 I took the day that is going to do this 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.180
 'sunny days' 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.180
 it is very important not to apply it 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.010
 certainly take advantage of the hours of ee 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.080
 early in the morning 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.270
 beatrice hahn 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.180
 I used to how many 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.180
 on the other hand it is also very important 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.170
 all when applied 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.430
 if you go to totana 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.610
 odeh burgos 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.280
 with the wind it may be to be applying 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.280
 next to a plant that is next to the museum 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.270
 others to do is that he 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.780
 it is very important to know 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.019
 we give to that plant is 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.479
 they are not the same thing because 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.479
 let's interfere in him 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.529
 we have managed to know what 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.529
 and you always have to take into account 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.329
 you have to take 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.329
 an explosion is quite logical and 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.739
 to avoid inhaling 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.209
 skin possible 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.209
 once the treatments are applied we will go 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.079
 let's continue 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.089
 the texts of songs like 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.649
 nevertheless conscientiously those body parts that have been tying 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.229
 that are not covered 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:16.389
 just as we are going to use it has several tools and utensils that 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.179
 you have to keep out of jail 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:30.009
 it is also true that there is and 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:33.009
 in plants that 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.579
 then in excess entity that nobody 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.329
 Residual effect simply outline 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.429
 a time this plant is going to have issues 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:51.429
 it can be dangerous because it's going to absorb this 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.449
 and it's usually a 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.819
 that you have to respect superior 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.819
 in any case always 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:09.729
 as for the green coast 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.649
 chop the dose three attacks 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:16.249
 explodes perfectly studied in relation to works of art 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.370
 were some poems apply very concrete 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.020
 the capacity 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.020
 the small ones 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.480
 and on the other hand siquisique people participated with bigger type to you 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.969
 there were more specific 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.340
 or what way we do not have 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.029
 simply with 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.029
 zapala more 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:01.050
 and without demagogy and I have always respected all the envelopes the indications of 

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:02.110
 maker 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.110
 / to
