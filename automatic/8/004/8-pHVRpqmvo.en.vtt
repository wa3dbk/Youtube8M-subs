burro y like this right near the tavern
so<00:00:16.440> as<00:00:16.529> soon<00:00:16.650> as<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.890> borough<00:00:17.070> furnitures

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
so as soon as the borough furnitures

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.640 
so as soon as the borough furnitures
he's<00:00:17.760> also<00:00:17.910> going<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.180> be<00:00:18.300> able<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.570> buy<00:00:18.720> his

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650

he's also going to be able to buy his
hero<00:00:19.949> back<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:21.199> that's<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.320> nice<00:00:22.439> place<00:00:22.619> to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
hero back and that's a nice place to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.890 
hero back and that's a nice place to
hide<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.070> because<00:00:23.220> obviously<00:00:23.880> when<00:00:24.570> burrows

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
hide it because obviously when burrows

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.269 
hide it because obviously when burrows
are<00:00:25.019> constructing<00:00:25.529> they<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:25.920> take<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> lot<00:00:26.220> of

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
are constructing they can take a lot of

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.740 
are constructing they can take a lot of
damage<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.609> grow<00:00:26.849> exactly<00:00:27.180> building<00:00:27.539> another

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
damage and grow exactly building another

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.359 
damage and grow exactly building another
borough<00:00:28.019> here<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.619> serve<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> redundancy

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
borough here just serve a redundancy

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.560 
borough here just serve a redundancy
plant<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.820> think<00:00:30.920> and<00:00:31.920> he's<00:00:32.340> i'm<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.480> sure

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
plant I think and he's i'm not sure

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.819 
plant I think and he's i'm not sure
where<00:00:33.690> he's<00:00:33.809> sending<00:00:34.020> his<00:00:34.110> army<00:00:34.380> he<00:00:34.530> might<00:00:34.680> be

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
where he's sending his army he might be

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:35.900 
where he's sending his army he might be
better<00:00:34.920> off<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.250> creep<00:00:35.460> at<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.700> point

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
better off to creep at this point

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.010 
better off to creep at this point
because<00:00:36.000> he<00:00:36.239> can't<00:00:36.420> take<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.840> those<00:00:36.960> three

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
because he can't take out those three

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.920 
because he can't take out those three
towers<00:00:37.440> without<00:00:37.680> taking<00:00:38.070> too<00:00:38.219> much<00:00:38.399> damage

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
towers without taking too much damage

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.660 
towers without taking too much damage
ridley<00:00:39.930> at<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.170> point<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.530> i<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.489> he

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
ridley at this point and i think so he

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.420 
ridley at this point and i think so he
knows<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.210> he<00:00:43.170> has<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.649> better<00:00:43.800> army<00:00:44.190> for

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
knows that he has the better army for

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.250 
knows that he has the better army for
the<00:00:44.489> moment<00:00:44.640> but<00:00:44.850> not<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> better<00:00:45.300> economy<00:00:45.840> so

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the moment but not the better economy so

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.560 
the moment but not the better economy so
he's<00:00:46.379> good<00:00:46.559> at<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.770> attack<00:00:47.039> now<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.550> grab<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
he's good at to attack now and grab the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.760 
he's good at to attack now and grab the
action<00:00:48.809> moving<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.230> attacking<00:00:49.559> this

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
action moving and just attacking this

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.709 
action moving and just attacking this
farm<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> edge<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.879> grubbing<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:51.539> does

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
farm on the edge and grubbing now does

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.420 
farm on the edge and grubbing now does
have<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> food<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.379> he<00:00:52.440> manages<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> buy<00:00:53.190> back

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
have the food and he manages to buy back

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.279 
have the food and he manages to buy back
his<00:00:53.579> blade<00:00:53.820> master<00:00:54.030> though<00:00:54.690> he<00:00:54.840> doesn't<00:00:55.020> have

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
his blade master though he doesn't have

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.720 
his blade master though he doesn't have
much<00:00:55.530> health<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.309> he<00:00:56.340> probably<00:00:56.550> will

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
much health on it so he probably will

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.860 
much health on it so he probably will
need<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.969> south<00:00:57.149> about<00:00:57.300> before<00:00:57.629> he<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.780> go

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
need to south about before he can go

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.000 
need to south about before he can go
into<00:00:58.020> battle<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.350> grab<00:00:58.530> actually<00:00:58.800> taking<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
into battle and grab actually taking a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.290 
into battle and grab actually taking a
lot<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.160> damage<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> wind<00:00:59.789> rider<00:00:59.969> from<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
lot of damage on the wind rider from the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.599 
lot of damage on the wind rider from the
ark<00:01:00.420> matriarch<00:01:01.020> may<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.379> go<00:01:01.500> down<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.579> I

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
ark matriarch may just go down and so I

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.160 
ark matriarch may just go down and so I
think<00:01:02.699> grubbing<00:01:03.059> must<00:01:03.210> not<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.480> paying<00:01:03.660> proper

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
think grubbing must not be paying proper

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.780 
think grubbing must not be paying proper
attention<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.680> them<00:01:04.799> instead<00:01:05.189> focus<00:01:05.670> on

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
attention to them instead focus on

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.280 
attention to them instead focus on
focusing<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.600> creeping<00:01:06.960> here<00:01:07.140> where

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
focusing on this creeping here where

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.510 
focusing on this creeping here where
he's<00:01:07.380> almost<00:01:07.560> got<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.770> shadow<00:01:08.010> under<00:01:08.280> level

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
he's almost got a shadow under level

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.219 
he's almost got a shadow under level
three<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.909> he's<00:01:09.299> almost<00:01:09.420> got<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.659> blade<00:01:09.990> master

a<00:01:12.570> shadow<00:01:12.869> into<00:01:13.049> now<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.470> level<00:01:13.590> 32<00:01:13.979> is

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
a shadow into now that it's level 32 is

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.499 
a shadow into now that it's level 32 is
very<00:01:14.340> much<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:14.700> several<00:01:15.000> weeks<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.299> much

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
very much to get several weeks and much

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.270 
very much to get several weeks and much
he'll<00:01:15.689> get<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.020> from<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.320> no<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:16.979> don't<00:01:17.250> think

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.520 
elemental there just to UM stay alive
and<00:01:42.210> grubby<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.570> now<00:01:42.720> attacking<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.200> towers

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and grubby is now attacking the towers

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.630 
and grubby is now attacking the towers
and<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.070> notice<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.280> song<00:01:44.520> he's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and you notice that song he's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.039 
and you notice that song he's
immediately<00:01:44.850> focusing<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> wind<00:01:45.869> rider

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
immediately focusing the wind rider

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.840 
immediately focusing the wind rider
whenever<00:01:46.439> window-eyes<00:01:46.950> whenever<00:01:47.280> he<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.549> but

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
whenever window-eyes whenever he can but

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.700 
whenever window-eyes whenever he can but
just<00:01:48.060> not<00:01:48.180> enough<00:01:48.450> gumby's<00:01:49.200> built<00:01:49.439> up<00:01:49.560> too

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
just not enough gumby's built up too

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.410 
just not enough gumby's built up too
much<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.890> an<00:01:50.070> army<00:01:50.310> he<00:01:50.460> stoled<00:01:50.759> sulky<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.299> too

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
much of an army he stoled sulky for too

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.719 
much of an army he stoled sulky for too
long<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.899> i<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.649> pretty<00:01:53.399> much<00:01:53.579> over

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
long and i think it's pretty much over

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.550 
long and i think it's pretty much over
for<00:01:53.880> some<00:01:54.180> key<00:01:54.329> now<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.720> there's<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.020> GG<00:01:55.320> yeah

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
for some key now and there's a GG yeah

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.459 
for some key now and there's a GG yeah
so<00:01:56.369> i<00:01:56.399> hope<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.030> enjoyed<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.360> guy's<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:58.140> I

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
so i hope you enjoyed that guy's up I

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.050 
so i hope you enjoyed that guy's up I
think<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.520> was<00:01:59.670> sort<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.850> quite<00:02:00.000> an

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
think that was sort of quite an

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
think that was sort of quite an
enjoyable<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.570> I'll<00:02:00.719> try<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.020> find<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.380> turtle

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
enjoyable and I'll try and find a turtle

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.770 
enjoyable and I'll try and find a turtle
rock<00:02:02.399> map<00:02:02.670> where<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.090> close<00:02:03.329> spawn<00:02:03.630> I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
rock map where it's not close spawn I

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.749 
rock map where it's not close spawn I
think<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.110> actually<00:02:04.799> one<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> more

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
think it's actually one of the more

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.819 
think it's actually one of the more
interesting<00:02:06.240> matchups<00:02:06.840> whenever<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.350> close

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
interesting matchups whenever it's close

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.279 
interesting matchups whenever it's close
ball<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.280> because<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:09.080> get<00:02:10.080> less

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
ball and just because you get less

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.430 
ball and just because you get less
creeping<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.450> don't<00:02:12.450> really<00:02:12.569> like<00:02:12.840> turtle

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
creeping and I don't really like turtle

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.610 
creeping and I don't really like turtle

the<00:02:13.739> map<00:02:13.950> generally<00:02:14.489> just<00:02:14.670> because<00:02:15.060> there<00:02:15.690> is

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
the map generally just because there is

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.479 
the map generally just because there is
sort<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.110> implicit<00:02:16.379> randomness<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.220> crow

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
sort of the implicit randomness of crow

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.949 
sort of the implicit randomness of crow
spawn<00:02:17.790> as<00:02:18.000> well<00:02:18.120> as<00:02:18.269> it's<00:02:18.450> quite<00:02:18.629> hard<00:02:18.780> to

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
spawn as well as it's quite hard to

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.339 
spawn as well as it's quite hard to
expand<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:19.980> there's<00:02:20.970> much<00:02:21.299> less<00:02:21.629> diversity

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
expand so there's much less diversity

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.050 
expand so there's much less diversity
and<00:02:22.530> match<00:02:22.680> as<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.980> find<00:02:23.220> for<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.549> map<00:02:23.760> but

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
and match as I find for that map but

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.570 
and match as I find for that map but
that's<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.720> personal<00:02:24.900> opinion<00:02:25.430> okay<00:02:26.430> well

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
that's just a personal opinion okay well

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.250 
that's just a personal opinion okay well
I've<00:02:26.640> hope<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:26.940> enjoyed<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.540> feel<00:02:28.140> free
