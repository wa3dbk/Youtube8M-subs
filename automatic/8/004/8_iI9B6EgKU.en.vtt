then<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> big<00:00:47.100> ones<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.460> course<00:00:47.489> is

that can be aligned and popped into
place<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.520> form<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.880> completed<00:01:21.420> robot<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.170> the
