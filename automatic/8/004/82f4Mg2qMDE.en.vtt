00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.540
 we will work with for alone 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.480
 n150 and with the slate color and the 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.179
 felts with porcelain 150 you can 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.559
 work on all enamelled media 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.179
 such as for example here it's from the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.460
 faience to porcelain I 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.230
 chose to make you see the technique 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.750
 of art oise and with the felts the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.000
 red tip wide and the tip glass 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.939
 fine in the first place we will define 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.019
 an area to apply lardoise the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.019
 first tape 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.440
 then I take a finer design 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:53.910
 to make a very sharp finish to 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:55.260
 lens level this is very important 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.380
 to mix the product before 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.170
 use it otherwise your color risk of 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.890
 shiny head so really it takes 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.320
 mix well before use without 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.440
 never this shot and then we will use 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.870
 the fan brush that has a wide 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.940
 work surface and that allows for 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.250
 to make beautiful flat I always go 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.280
 put my brush parallel to the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.650
 surface is really the little thing that 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.920
 will make sure that you will succeed 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:31.470
 application never add water 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.580
 in the colors and always work 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.520
 with a dry brush the colors will be 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.990
 tender drying and there before the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.720
 color does not dry I will remove 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.790
 delicately the adhesives 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.590
 see here nice it's under the eye the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.390
 wish it's not a concern I'm taking a 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.720
 cotton swab like the color is not 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.390
 dry I will very easily remove the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.340
 kind of things I'm going to let it dry 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.100
 a quarter of an hour and then I'm going 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.320
 come work with the felt so at 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.080
 present my slate color and dry 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.240
 you see she's very dull that's it 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.600
 a strong contrast with the enamel so the 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.360
 mag 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.750
 now I'm going to work with the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.310
 felt point class 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.000
 like the felt enough you see that the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.220
 wick and white so I'm going to boot my 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.300
 tip until I get the 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.300
 color is red 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.520
 here is the self with the same things 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.080
 I have to prime central crush him huh 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.830
 it's just to bring down the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.050
 product here I exercise a small 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.580
 pressure there and you see the tip is 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:58.820
 in very fine I can do some work 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:03:02.010
 very precise and there I let go I turn 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.190
 here I am going to make small 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.400
 flowers with each other point small point 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.400
 the plot here 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.130
 all the little flowers 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.790
 he could play you just need to 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.200
 let dry 24 hours and then you 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.170
 go leather in your household oven 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.790
 electric gas oven at your convenience 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.910
 it's all about having the right temperature 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.730
 150 degrees for 35 minutes 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.860
 now you can use your mug 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.220
 it even goes into microwave without any 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.220
 worry
