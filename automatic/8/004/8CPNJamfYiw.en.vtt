live pack I want all of you guys to go
wired<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.750> your<00:00:21.869> gaming<00:00:22.109> peripherals<00:00:22.619> and

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
wired in your gaming peripherals and

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.740 
wired in your gaming peripherals and
Wi-Fi<00:00:23.189> connections<00:00:23.699> because<00:00:24.300> generally

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
Wi-Fi connections because generally

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.540 
Wi-Fi connections because generally
going<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.170> wire<00:00:25.410> connection<00:00:25.949> will<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
going to a wire connection will have a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.670 
going to a wire connection will have a
lower<00:00:26.880> lag<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.420> latency<00:00:27.720> than<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.439> wireless

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
lower lag and latency than a wireless

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.429 
lower lag and latency than a wireless
solution<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.090> example<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.689> Icarus<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.260> went

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
solution so for example on Icarus I went

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.319 
solution so for example on Icarus I went
ahead<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.619> benchmarked<00:00:32.160> him<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.520> his<00:00:32.940> Wi-Fi

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
ahead and benchmarked him on his Wi-Fi

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.819 
ahead and benchmarked him on his Wi-Fi
adapter<00:00:33.750> versus<00:00:34.079> hooking<00:00:34.380> him<00:00:34.530> up<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.770> an

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
adapter versus hooking him up to an

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.130 
adapter versus hooking him up to an
Ethernet<00:00:35.190> cable<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.670> he<00:00:35.880> gains<00:00:36.149> are<00:00:36.420> there<00:00:36.630> so

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
Ethernet cable and he gains are there so

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.020 
Ethernet cable and he gains are there so
for<00:00:37.260> example<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:37.920> his<00:00:38.160> wireless<00:00:38.610> connection

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
for example on his wireless connection

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.000 
for example on his wireless connection
he<00:00:39.149> achieved<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.480> paying<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.930> 32<00:00:40.350> milliseconds

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
he achieved a paying of 32 milliseconds
