00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.040
Welcome to Cocina Identidad, today we are going to prepare a “beet Salad”,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.100
a Christmas Salad, 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.720
one of the most important aspects of it is 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.400
that it has the Christmas colors, the red, the yellow, bright colors, 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.340
we are going to use beet, cooked beet 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.480
that we are going to peel. This is very important, 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.340
if we peel it and then we cook it, 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.680
all the juice is lost, including its color and flavor.  

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.020
We are going to see that once the beet is cooked, it is very easy to peel

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.560
because the skin is easily removed. 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.420
What a beautiful color, 

00:00:48.237 --> 00:00:50.237
the brightness of the beet

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.980
and once it has been peeled; we are going cut it into cubes

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.420
 to integrate it into our salad. 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.940
Having cut the beet and with all the other ingredients ready, 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.340
we are preparing the salad, little by little.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.580
It is fundamental that the beet stands out, and once we have the beet in our bowl, 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.520
we are going to add jicama, 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.400
fruit that is popular in this season, 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.240
to provide more flavor,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.640
texture, consistency, 

00:01:35.993 --> 00:01:39.333
we add the tejocote (Mexican Hawthorn), 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.940
we cut it not into small pieces because our salad  has to have color and shape.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.080
Guavas, 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.420
see what this fruit is like in this Christmas Season, 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.540
now the Mexican lime, 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.220
the lime with such perfume, so sweet, so fresh 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.720
that is going to provide flavor, 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.280
juiciness

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.840
and scent

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.560
and orange,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.040
this is a magnificent orange that was brought from a home garden as a gift. 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.980
It is wonderful to receive these gifts

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.760
to be eaten, to be prepared 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.980
and to give us love,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.880
to give us food. 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.800
Once everything is mixed, 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.540
we add sugar, 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.120
it is a sweet salad.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.860
Immediately, beet provides its color

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.160
to the other fruits, it is integrated into the salad. 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.080
We are going to add a little of orange juice. 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.060
Finally,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.740
our salad integrated,

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.520
we are going to add 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.040
peanut, 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.660
natural peanut, peeled and golden. 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.460
We let the flavors to blend, 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:29.980
all the flavors, all the perfumes, and finally, 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.340
we are going to garnish our salad 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.480
with sweets

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:45.100
until the last minute, so the sugar from the sweet does not melt. 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.760
This is the way our Christmas salad is ready, 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.140
our beet salad to enjoy with the family.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.620
