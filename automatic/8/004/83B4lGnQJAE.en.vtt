00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
drawing the ball and they don't know why

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.350 
drawing the ball and they don't know why
they're<00:00:09.929> not<00:00:10.309> drawing<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.429> ball<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.179> want

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
they're not drawing the ball so I want

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.499 
they're not drawing the ball so I want
to<00:00:12.420> clarify<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:13.040> first<00:00:14.040> thing<00:00:14.250> first<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.450> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
to clarify that first thing first in the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.300 
to clarify that first thing first in the
state<00:00:15.570> made<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.379> generally<00:00:16.800> people<00:00:16.980> try<00:00:17.279> to

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
state made is generally people try to

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.849 
state made is generally people try to
lift<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.090> butt<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.359> their<00:00:18.480> cue<00:00:18.779> up<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.470> draw<00:00:19.680> it

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
lift the butt of their cue up to draw it

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.560 
lift the butt of their cue up to draw it
draw<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.250> ball<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.730> they<00:00:20.850> don't<00:00:21.000> jump<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.480> off

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
draw the ball so they don't jump it off

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.810 
draw the ball so they don't jump it off
the<00:00:21.750> table<00:00:22.789> and<00:00:24.080> they<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.199> draw<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.410> ball<00:00:28.820> so

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the table and they can draw the ball so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.860 
the table and they can draw the ball so
a<00:00:29.849> much<00:00:30.119> better<00:00:30.330> way<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.660> drawing<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.410> ball<00:00:31.560> is

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
a much better way of drawing the ball is

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.930 
a much better way of drawing the ball is
I<00:00:33.870> want<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.290> transfer<00:00:34.770> my<00:00:34.920> energy<00:00:35.190> through<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
I want to transfer my energy through the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.780 
I want to transfer my energy through the
ball<00:00:36.360> not<00:00:37.140> into<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> table<00:00:38.190> when<00:00:38.340> I'm<00:00:38.460> jacked

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
ball not into the table when I'm jacked

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.389 
ball not into the table when I'm jacked
up<00:00:39.059> I'm<00:00:39.780> transferring<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.800> energy<00:00:40.860> through

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
up I'm transferring that energy through

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.910 
up I'm transferring that energy through
the<00:00:41.430> ball<00:00:41.700> into<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> table<00:00:42.540> not<00:00:43.200> getting<00:00:43.590> very

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the ball into the table not getting very

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.950 
the ball into the table not getting very
good<00:00:44.010> rotation<00:00:44.670> with<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.850> cue<00:00:45.120> ball<00:00:45.300> too<00:00:45.930> much

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
good rotation with the cue ball too much

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.840 
good rotation with the cue ball too much
energy<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.530> going<00:00:46.739> into<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> table<00:00:47.579> not

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
energy is going into the table not

00:00:47.850 --> 00:01:01.869 
energy is going into the table not
enough<00:00:48.120> into<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.390> ball

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.459 

now<00:01:02.449> there<00:01:02.690> are<00:01:02.780> people<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.230> do<00:01:03.320> it<00:01:03.350> the

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
now there are people that do it the

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.249 
now there are people that do it the
right<00:01:03.680> way<00:01:03.739> but<00:01:04.400> they<00:01:04.549> tend<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:04.939> have<00:01:05.269> good

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
right way but they tend to have good

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:07.749 
right way but they tend to have good
days<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.500> bad<00:01:06.770> days<00:01:06.920> when<00:01:07.460> they're<00:01:07.580> drawing

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
days and bad days when they're drawing

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.770 
days and bad days when they're drawing
the<00:01:07.909> ball<00:01:08.180> what<00:01:09.049> happens<00:01:09.650> is<00:01:10.630> they're<00:01:11.630> not

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
the ball what happens is they're not

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.620 
the ball what happens is they're not
going<00:01:11.990> low<00:01:12.229> enough<00:01:12.470> on<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:12.740> ball<00:01:16.479> we're<00:01:17.479> going

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
going low enough on the ball we're going

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.370 
going low enough on the ball we're going
to<00:01:17.780> fix<00:01:18.110> that<00:01:18.409> problem<00:01:19.540> is<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.720> always<00:01:21.110> start

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
to fix that problem is to always start

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.010 
to fix that problem is to always start

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
next thing that people do they might do

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.449 
next thing that people do they might do
everything<00:02:20.409> the<00:02:20.530> correct<00:02:20.799> way<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.280> their

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
stick down there hitting blowing up but

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.449 
stick down there hitting blowing up but
they<00:02:24.519> just<00:02:24.870> hit<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.049> ball<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.950> normal

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
they just hit the ball like a normal

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.449 
they just hit the ball like a normal
stroke<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.120> they'll<00:02:28.569> do<00:02:28.719> this<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:33.010> ball<00:02:33.219> does

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
stroke and they'll do this the ball does

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.330 
stroke and they'll do this the ball does
not<00:02:33.609> draw<00:02:34.000> then<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.599> do<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:35.129> you<00:02:36.129> have<00:02:36.250> to

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
not draw then you do that you have to

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:44.550 
not draw then you do that you have to
understand<00:02:37.030> what<00:02:37.209> it's<00:02:37.329> doing<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:43.379> have<00:02:44.379> to

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
understand what it's doing I have to

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.000 
understand what it's doing I have to
make<00:02:44.829> this<00:02:45.129> ball<00:02:45.750> spin<00:02:46.750> backwards<00:02:49.769> so<00:02:50.769> when<00:02:50.889> it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
make this ball spin backwards so when it

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.119 
make this ball spin backwards so when it
hits<00:02:51.159> it<00:02:51.549> takes<00:02:52.120> off<00:02:52.889> okay

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
hits it takes off okay

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.740 
hits it takes off okay
so<00:02:54.489> if<00:02:54.609> I<00:02:54.730> just<00:02:54.939> hit<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.180> with<00:02:55.299> a<00:02:55.449> regular

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750

stroke<00:02:56.409> I<00:02:57.689> can't<00:02:58.689> get<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.139> to<00:02:59.260> spin<00:02:59.500> back
