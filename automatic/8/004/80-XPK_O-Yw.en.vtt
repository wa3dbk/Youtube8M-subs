00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.670
 the incredible one millimeter 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.539
 Murcia 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.569
 Jorge Enrique likes books 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:27.019
 but not like the tiger 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.019
 he liked to eat them 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.560
 everything started by mistake one afternoon when I was distracted 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.830
 at the beginning I had many doubts 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.330
 and he only ate one word just for trying 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.640
 then he tried it with a complete sentence 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.640
 and after the full page raffle 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.480
 He definitely liked it 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.890
 for Wednesday henry who had already eaten a whole book 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.290
 and by the end of the month a book could be titled 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.290
 there is a pull 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.950
 he loved commented all kinds of books do not fall dictionaries 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.080
 almanacs and atlases 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.530
 joke books 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.220
 history books and even math books 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.830
 but the reds were his favorites 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.830
 and the willing ones an incredible pace 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.580
 but the best 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.760
 pine forests 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.760
 while more food more ready and asia 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.159
 once he ate a book about little fish and knew at once what to give 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.680
 eat at 15 super was quoted 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.100
 in a very short time he was able to solve his father's crossword and the newspaper 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.100
 yes so far smarter than the teachers at your school 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.120
 enrique liked ferriz 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.640
 I was afraid that if I continued like that, I could become the smartest person in the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.600
 world 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.530
 so he kept eating liters and he's getting more watched 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.150
 and smarter 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.310
 he went from eating a whole book to eating two or three in one fell swoop 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.230
 books about anything 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.909
 it was nothing of the process 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.399
 and I wanted to know everything 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.399
 but things then started to get complicated 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:17.119
 rather they started to get in very 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.159
 very very bad 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.299
 enrique ate too much and certainly too fast 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.889
 I was beginning to feel a little sick 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.159
 but that was not what I 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.250
 everything he was learning turned into a mess because he did not have time to 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:34.529
 be good digestion 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.790
 and he began to feel ashamed of having to open his mouth 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:39.919
 you have already done 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:43.219
 Enrique suddenly did not seem so smart 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.219
 more than one he advised that they no longer eat 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.369
 he left he can eat books and he was sad for a long time in his room 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:53.509
 kiva without ideas 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:57.959
 it is more then almost by accident Enriquez as of the ground a book to 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:58.889
 half eat 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.919
 but instead of taking it to the mouth 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.009
 there would not be a day he started reading 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.549
 After that Enrique explained that he liked to read a lot 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.139
 that day pretty 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.389
 I could still become the most seen person in the world 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.049
 although I would need more time 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.549
 now enrique is always reading 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.919
 although the truth 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.919
 occasionally 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.339
 play now rome
