00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.050 

now<00:01:39.220> it's<00:01:39.370> important<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:39.820> note<00:01:40.030> that

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
now it's important to note that

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.270 
now it's important to note that
everybody<00:01:40.660> has<00:01:40.900> their<00:01:41.080> own<00:01:41.140> Chemex<00:01:41.770> technique

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
everybody has their own Chemex technique

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.860 
everybody has their own Chemex technique
some<00:01:42.700> people<00:01:43.000> are<00:01:43.620> very<00:01:44.620> territorial<00:01:45.160> about

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
some people are very territorial about

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.200 
some people are very territorial about
that<00:01:46.870> technique<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.820> happen<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:48.850> be<00:01:49.000> one<00:01:49.180> of

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
that technique I happen to be one of

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.920 
that technique I happen to be one of
those<00:01:49.390> people<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:51.250> is<00:01:51.460> just<00:01:51.700> my<00:01:51.940> technique

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
those people this is just my technique

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.110 
those people this is just my technique
see<00:01:53.740> there's<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.980> little<00:01:54.220> dry<00:01:54.460> island<00:01:55.000> of

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
see there's a little dry island of

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.810 
see there's a little dry island of
coffee<00:01:55.360> ground<00:01:55.690> there<00:01:56.050> in<00:01:56.230> the<00:01:56.320> center<00:01:56.820> that's

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
coffee ground there in the center that's

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.670 
coffee ground there in the center that's
the<00:01:58.030> last<00:01:58.330> stuff<00:01:58.870> that<00:01:59.050> we<00:01:59.140> want<00:01:59.410> to<00:01:59.470> get

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
the last stuff that we want to get

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.370 
the last stuff that we want to get
brewed<00:02:00.300> so<00:02:01.300> it's<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.630> last<00:02:01.810> stuff<00:02:02.050> that<00:02:02.230> will

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
brewed so it's the last stuff that will

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.900 
brewed so it's the last stuff that will
wet<00:02:02.560> since<00:02:02.890> that's<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.370> stuff<00:02:03.580> that's<00:02:03.700> going

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
wet since that's the stuff that's going

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.930 
wet since that's the stuff that's going
to<00:02:04.000> sink<00:02:04.240> into<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.780> middle<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:06.490> inverted

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
to sink into the middle this inverted

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:22.070 
to sink into the middle this inverted
cone<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.990> get<00:02:08.170> rid<00:02:08.350> last

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.740 

so<00:02:23.080> just<00:02:23.319> like<00:02:23.440> with<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.680> other<00:02:24.330> filter<00:02:25.330> under
