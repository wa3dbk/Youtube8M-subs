 link to the description of all the good time 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.440
 days with you imba steps and clan shadows and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.619
 we still play aion on the server 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.140
 gardarika asmodian who do not know this 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.269
 hand to the first server today will show you 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.250
 especially for beginners is a very important thing 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.109
 who learned a little later than necessary 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.619
 and if I knew before, it would be 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.210
 still cooler here let's say at level 16 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.030
 I will go to a gift with that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.520
 called choirs but other than that 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.840
 you could have done it before 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.329
 I'll show you what I want to do 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.420
 the bow is such a standard for himself 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.719
 example and so is 52 701 and 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.399
 extra stats in general if you 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.989
 outside and be guided you can hold alt 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.670
 and spin the wheel to see 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.340
 what are the onion extra rates here 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.440
 Essentially, we don’t have a good idea. 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.480
 take this bow 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.039
 I like it 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.909
 extra stats and longbows 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.530
 karna he has attack 67 dash 92 then 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.110
 go we can say standard statues and 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.630
 then hell reduced writing sparkles plus 13 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.520
 this is called extra stats than 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.110
 the more and the better they are now under 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.509
 each character fits its own why 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.540
 let's say this bow up to office crete + 13 for 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.729
 archer nat creed this as one of the basics 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.140
 so nat creed here is very good then 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.320
 have it as it could be top 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.520
 the same thing would not hurt me well attack 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.530
 for auto attack 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.940
 Well, hepe parcel and archers in principle 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.460
 did not prevent it approximately as at division 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.380
 potapov sti you can have such a move 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.240
 in places it is convenient for someone, but if there 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.429
 I have the accuracy of which 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.960
 honestly these are not necessary or there would be more 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.090
 something which I evasion 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.830
 which part I don’t need or m n 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.020
 it would have been considered not so 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.670
 pavsky onion and for 2 st but why is it 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.590
 all told we will now have it yet 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.479
 by force let's say this is the best bow 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.470
 at this level for example yes he is more likely 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.840
 everything is the best 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.420
 but we still make it even cooler how we will 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.360
 do this showing we press the button m 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.280
 we are in the city of understanding the capital 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.950
 Smolyan we appear here 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.290
 the bridge see over the bridge did not teach here and 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.970
 right here is the shopping street us 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.160
 here are these two rivers with two 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.410
 with swords here we will appear very 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.620
 often left when we go old 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.940
 for there is such a npc as a master combination 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.920
 two-handed weapon here are two-handed weapon 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.860
 one-handed let's say that the sword 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.200
 hay 1 or for example at the warrior mesh can not 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.360
 connect and make stronger and two handed 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.610
 weapons from the example of the same bow there 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.650
 weapon gladiator two-handed sword is all 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.590
 can be combined 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.760
 push the combination of two-handed weapons 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.060
 sesil must be taken from you 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.239
 Here I have it different in the inventory I 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.830
 I choose here to supplement rather so where is my 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.040
 the main here are two holes 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.940
 and ohh here even hp is given plus 77 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.800
 and additionally changing script by 10 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.240
 creed and accuracy so she bows karma 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.420
 now you need to choose prettier 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.980
 she gives the ninth rank but accuracy 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.540
 further after all let him let onions here I 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.540
 gave only 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.670
 descried 13 and here office 313 is rented and 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.290
 accuracy on this means this is better we 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.420
 we lose nothing but still 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.280
 plus 29 accuracy doesn't hurt us 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.470
 we put his first neck two times 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.780
 left button and I have exactly the same 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.640
 onions eat we put it second let's 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.090
 remember, even sitting on a leaf, write it down 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:34.850
 for yourself can remember the attack we have 85 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.710
 and 116 that is it turns out from 85 to 116 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.240
 but additional by the way would be to write 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.690
 let 's not show it pinned right now 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.340
 me accuracy swim to 29 biscuit 13 and 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.900
 we put 2 onions the same which we 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.370
 You can buy another in advance 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.020
 worse down I put two days lacquers 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.880
 because there are enough coins for which you don’t 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.500
 bought you can top bow 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.660
 be sure to put it that better 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.000
 the bottom can be left any or with 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.790
 good extra articles on your 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.430
 discretion brings stuck dvalin like 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.600
 onions for this you will take 73,000 I would not 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.260
 said it's a lot even 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.270
 sixteenth level click to accept 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.280
 lower bow lower it will fall apart but 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.380
 rather, he will only disconnect 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.760
 they can not be lower if we will 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.440
 Disconnection then top again 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.690
 connects if disconnect 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.400
 and the bottom is falling apart with the top bow of you 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.710
 will always persist and the bottom always 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.410
 will disappear if you decide 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:26.630
 fanned so let's say apply here it is 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.930
 This is the first thing we got 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.000
 see stats left 85 116 to begin 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.430
 damage and final but in parenthesis appeared 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.010
 the amount is such a plus 10 imagine on 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.660
 10 more damage he has is the amount 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.460
 depends on how much initial you have 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.720
 and the final attack so let's say that is what 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.340
 more do you have a bow which is in the second 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.910
 combine the greater will be this number in 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.310
 brackets 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.380
 we go further century I have accuracy 29 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.240
 right where there was and biscuit 13 but you 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.060
 notice that below appeared yet 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.550
 accuracy of 29 and another fiscal 13 is not 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.280
 reflection 1 st and then this is additional 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.260
 stats 2 weapons that we combined 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.330
 there is nifiga myself and plus 13 years old 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.449
 added exactly 29 at our level 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.639
 This dofiga department as much as possible 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.499
 instead of two holes our weapons now 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.599
 as you can see four here you can put 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:13.669
 2 pebbles let's say biscuit for 10 is already 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.099
 would be 20 a thanks to 2 extra 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:20.330
 slot holes it turns out plus 2 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:21.620
 that is, we are not sickly strengthened our bow think 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.419
 here you all figured out like this 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.860
 done if suddenly you then want to 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.809

 another filled with stats or with large 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.180
 slot cells so say yes or 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:33.199
 slots I still want to call it 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.020
 cell slots 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:38.539
 holes here that come to the same nps 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.919
