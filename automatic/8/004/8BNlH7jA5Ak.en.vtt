00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.330
 customization of the character this time

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.580
 to do is to watch this video , you know that 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.560
 I brought you the other time how to bring the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.180
 mask and helmet at the same time how 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.830
 wear the helmet and mask as 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.689
 today we are going to see how to wear 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.359
 same time a hat that you 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.430
 you choose and a mask worth is very 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.230
 simple very easy and you will be able to 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.969
 pop the like button for this great 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.440
 trick that will make our character 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.390
 at the same time be something different from 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.160
 rest let's see how you do what 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 first thing we have to do is to be 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.870
 without anything worth we will give the pse 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.399
 let's keep pressing the select and you 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.079
 I'm going to teach what I have 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.879
 we go to inventory as you see in 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.739
 head because we have different types 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.180
 of cap and in masks the first 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.670
 mask that I have then is the skull 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.590
 gray is what I have here well 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.059
 let's put the first thing in mind a 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.340
 hat the hat that we want 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.019
 carry in my case the cowboy me 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.540
 I put it in and we go out we go to the circle and 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.310
 we left, now we are going to the quad 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.380
 this only works on quads, not on 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.270
 the normal bikes we put on the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.720
 quad and what we are going to do is give the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.520
 cel 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.500
 we're going to go to inventory and we're going to 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.760
 put on masks ok we're going to be 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.680
 prepared and we're going to put it on 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.660
 masks because because now we are going to give 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.100
 to the triangle with this window open it 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.470
 will ride on the bike and when you do the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.420
 gesture of putting on the helmet quickly 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.010
 we will give the crosshead on the right to 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.570
 put us in the mask what are you going to see 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.370
 I am already prepared in 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.750
 masks I hope you are going to put on the helmet and 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.700
 I quickly put on the mask 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.740
 skull what's going to happen is that it's going 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.900
 to dive and now we just close 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.670
 this window we got off the motorcycle and 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.590
 when the helmet is removed because 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.560
 they got off the motorcycle takes off the helmet and 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.030
 we will be left with the bug made tachÃ¡n 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.250
 we have our mask and our 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.990
 hat on and so we are about 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.610
 undead 'with super hats 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.170
 good looking , we do not have to go alone 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.880
 with the mask that's not worn anymore 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.470
 now what it takes is this this is what 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.880
 which is carried away now so nothing if it has 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.950
 liked this video do not hesitate to give it 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.720
 like favorites and those that are not 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.220
 subscribed to the channel I do not know what you expect 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.840
 to subscribe I do not know I do not understand it 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.640
 is that no no does not enter my head 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.899
 I entered the head so nothing said 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.010
 see you in the next video a 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.519
 greeting and until next time 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.519
 goodbye 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.720
 the reason for this
