00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.760
 shoemaker unboxing video here on the 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.080
 channel along with games island many 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.470
 thanks again for the provision and 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.740
 we come to the last video of the display 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:26.140
 booster unboxing they are at 36 and 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:31.269
 relish suddenly here now that 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:35.140
 last booster and zack we want 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:38.230
 look what we have so good the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.440
 Classics Gent Monastery Out Rage Eats 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.589
 Kazakhs already seen x times 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.720
 have and the first batch of videos is 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.850
 a james ii Mainz came to me ever 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.070
 seen for 64 fly if that 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.780
 must enter a player or 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.699
 opponents because the top five cards 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.229
 put his boutique in the cemetery 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.629
 if one may then the instant source 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:02.320
 they were playing without their men 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:05.080
 cost so not all 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.670
 a cool card beat up nicely 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.070
 find such maps but as I said very 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.090
 very funny where to find the opponent's deck 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.860
 used against him nice thing so 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.860
 booster two numero 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.630
 Let's start with a nice great 13 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.610
 fly 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:33.240
 yes act on crises pacifism most beautiful 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.190
 Nice is limited booster so far 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.860
 and yes, another hydra the watch 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.070
 hydrant probably not the means for 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.790
 biped x100 she comes with x11 wait 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.020
 in the game 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.870
 and if she dies you are allowed one 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.060
 Number of plus 11 marks on it 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.690
 were on creatures who congratulated 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.970
 to distribute 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.659
 Definitely a nice card for that 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.070
 Cool creatures have fallen anyway 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.520
 me very well and that is not quite 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.560
 Well 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.380
 So she comes in a relatively weak game 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.760
 but good if she dies we'll see 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.560
 I then further distribute and 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.220
 otherwise good as well 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.769
 mediocre 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.659
 You can not really talk about it 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.920
 complain 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:18.220
 So that would now have to know number three 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.780
 Be opened with the condom shining up 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.110
 envy the nation 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.730
 semmering as usual here one more 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.480
 diabolical and another of solnhofen 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.630
 and yes we have the music on 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.850
 valckes only five painters 44 fly 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.840
 whenever he or another dragon 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.370
 the playing field under our control 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.660
 we can damage the field of play 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.130
 was enlightened a player shoot 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.239
 where the number of kites is the 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.780
 controlled band he still has fire 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.100
 pick up 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.540
 So it does not tend to be too bad 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.920
 so I'm also dragons so fan 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.239
 which manager is not kite fans 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.100
 I do not know but you were there 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.690
 We still have in the pool here 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.239
 in the edition so there are also cheap ones 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.989
 where are the kites so good? 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.550
 can play out 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.950
 because of course the mana curve at the 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.480
 sgsh starts killing maneuvers at 52 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.860
 In Berlin then you can get the effect too 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.040
 not really exploit 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.200
 So I think that has something in the right place 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.030
 Kessel areas a nice fun 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.310
 deck you build yourself a few 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.760
 cheaper kites , or so 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.500
 changeling not bad so the 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.850
 opponents because so changing all 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.640
 then you can do that 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.870
 maybe something funny, too 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.310
 Potential is there I am going to get something 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.230
 superior if there is interest that 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.739
 just a comment 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.709
 and we do not expect for three times 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.810
 therefore 22 oliver or if you are so 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.790
 have checked here livelink 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.329
 tend to be super cool artwork tries 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.709
 I really like to show it again 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.850
 only my home is likely 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.690
 do not be black 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:58.150
 At the moment I can turn to green red 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.920
 where clarity is also quite good 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.049
 have to look 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.790
 black does not have that yet 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.340
 you have to convince in the budget 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.170
 watch out for those with one 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.700
 Number of colors you play in the basin 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.930
 you really have to be careful you can 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.630
 It does not exaggerate you can do it 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.299
 but not so expensive 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.039
 auxerre angel then you still have 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.470
 with the guilty does not know the 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.789
 Great for 2011 and everything better 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.660
 which perry knows so you can 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:29.169
 grope for any mah na awesome 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.090
 pimenta grandios domestic kate one more 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.110
 is fully back then the churches 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.690
 actually with a very nice card the 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.400
 I have been there for four years 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:42.020
 Men 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.340
 you can not just control and you 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.100
 controls the enchanted creature 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.590
 But at the beginning of withdrawal when the 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.850
 cat power so strength is 4 or greater 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.290
 one must take over the victims with it 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.750
 weak stuff is nevertheless a good one 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.420
 map and then another fire department 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.250
 lilianas riva for four painters very 43 with 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.720
 death's touch and always if one 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.460
 the player has to deal damage 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.380
 player discard a hand card and you 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.830
 gets a 22 paced and zombie game 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.860
 climb 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.370
 that's good for four times after 43, that's why 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.440
 that's fine 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.110
 and the effect is just strong 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.520
 nice booster with the domestic aid and 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.680
 that and and then I still have that 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.870
 slipper and that for menzer so that was 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.580
 but just from the cover level 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.600
 good book certainly also and how 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.390
 I had said that before I think so 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.740
 a thing ran de lyon in the cut the 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.960
 Cards do not necessarily have much to value 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.180
 but are from the playful 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.440
 he has always said something to me here 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.630
 the cheap hit of which I talked 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.560
 have something you can quite with the 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:40.460
 You are the sketch and the dragon 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.990
 really nice so border is now 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.520
 the last book for the display i 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.300
 did not say it but we are watching 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.150
 a few words on the itb act and 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.880
 huppmann james mainz i gave her now 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.740
 also 3 out of 4 644 fly for that 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.270
 Spielfeld is still entering 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.120
 Opponent the top five cards 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.250
 cemetery and of it a spontaneous 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.410
 magic or witchcraft card play without 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.570
 your men cost to pay cool 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.840
 So map here twice as the 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.790
 conclusion actually a cool yield 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.950
 I'm definitely happy though 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.420
 with the hydra beautiful cards 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.910
 I think that's just a nice ending 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.860
 for the display unboxing and yes me 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.290
