00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
not going to work for me anymore the one

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.870 
not going to work for me anymore the one
issue<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:52.630> I<00:01:52.779> did<00:01:53.049> have<00:01:53.229> with<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:54.189> stove<00:01:54.490> was

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
issue that I did have with the stove was

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.160 
issue that I did have with the stove was
that<00:01:55.740> one<00:01:56.740> of<00:01:56.770> these<00:01:57.009> came<00:01:57.819> off<00:01:58.060> actually<00:01:58.959> kind

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
that one of these came off actually kind

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.749 
that one of these came off actually kind
of<00:01:59.259> broke<00:01:59.469> off<00:01:59.679> so<00:02:00.039> I<00:02:00.069> actually<00:02:00.310> ended<00:02:00.520> up

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
of broke off so I actually ended up

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.089 
of broke off so I actually ended up
having<00:02:00.999> to<00:02:01.090> epoxy<00:02:01.749> it<00:02:01.869> back<00:02:02.079> on<00:02:02.319> to<00:02:02.529> it<00:02:02.679> screw

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
having to epoxy it back on to it screw

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:05.459 
having to epoxy it back on to it screw
so<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:04.149> one's<00:02:04.389> definitely<00:02:04.569> not<00:02:04.959> coming<00:02:05.259> off

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
so that one's definitely not coming off

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.309 
so that one's definitely not coming off
so<00:02:05.979> but<00:02:06.759> I've<00:02:06.880> never<00:02:07.149> even<00:02:07.509> attempted<00:02:07.719> to<00:02:08.170> use

denatured alcohol

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.270 
denatured alcohol
even<00:02:16.900> though<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.110> can<00:02:17.470> use<00:02:17.500> rubbing<00:02:18.130> alcohol

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
even though you can use rubbing alcohol

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
going to find that denatured alcohol is

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.350 
going to find that denatured alcohol is
going<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.340> burn<00:02:24.580> better<00:02:24.880> than<00:02:25.090> rubbing

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
just burns very well it burns hotter

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.350 
just burns very well it burns hotter
even<00:03:14.410> then<00:03:14.770> rubbing<00:03:14.980> alcohol<00:03:15.190> would<00:03:15.700> so

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
even then rubbing alcohol would so

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.060 
even then rubbing alcohol would so
you're<00:03:16.840> going<00:03:16.960> to<00:03:17.020> do<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.200> lot<00:03:17.470> better<00:03:17.500> with<00:03:17.860> a

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
regular meal in here and then I might

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.870 
regular meal in here and then I might
brew<00:04:19.720> up<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:20.140> cup<00:04:20.709> of<00:04:20.830> hot<00:04:20.950> chocolate<00:04:21.010> or<00:04:21.700> coffee

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.900 

now<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:29.800> do<00:04:30.009> want<00:04:30.160> to<00:04:30.250> quickly<00:04:30.370> show<00:04:30.759> you<00:04:30.789> the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
now I do want to quickly show you the

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.210 
now I do want to quickly show you the
alcohol<00:04:31.360> burner<00:04:31.630> I<00:04:31.900> thought<00:04:32.800> about<00:04:32.919> doing<00:04:33.009> a

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
alcohol burner I thought about doing a

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.589 
alcohol burner I thought about doing a
test<00:04:33.490> burn<00:04:33.669> with<00:04:33.849> this<00:04:34.030> but<00:04:34.210> there's<00:04:34.360> a<00:04:34.419> lot<00:04:34.509> of

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
test burn with this but there's a lot of

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.200 
test burn with this but there's a lot of
examples<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:35.199> that<00:04:35.319> on<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.560> internet<00:04:35.889> so<00:04:36.520> I'm

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
examples of that on the internet so I'm

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.480 
examples of that on the internet so I'm
just<00:04:37.330> not<00:04:37.419> going<00:04:37.569> to<00:04:37.630> do<00:04:37.780> that<00:04:37.930> but<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:39.340> can

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
just not going to do that but you can

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.499 
just not going to do that but you can
see<00:04:39.520> here<00:04:40.139> we<00:04:41.139> have<00:04:41.349> a<00:04:43.889> a<00:04:44.889> cover<00:04:45.460> here<00:04:45.910> that<00:04:46.330> we

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
see here we have a a cover here that we

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.860 
see here we have a a cover here that we
can<00:04:46.810> slide<00:04:47.470> over<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:48.009> burner<00:04:48.630> once<00:04:49.630> we're

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
can slide over the burner once we're

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.540 
can slide over the burner once we're
ready<00:04:49.900> to<00:04:50.229> put<00:04:50.410> it<00:04:50.500> out<00:04:50.620> let's<00:04:50.860> say<00:04:51.069> we're<00:04:51.370> done

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
ready to put it out let's say we're done

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.480 
ready to put it out let's say we're done
cooking<00:04:51.930> but<00:04:52.930> our<00:04:53.319> alcohol<00:04:53.680> stove<00:04:54.069> is<00:04:54.280> still

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
cooking but our alcohol stove is still

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.420 
cooking but our alcohol stove is still
burning<00:04:54.750> we<00:04:55.750> can<00:04:55.900> simply<00:04:56.259> slide<00:04:56.830> this<00:04:57.009> in<00:04:57.190> here

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
burning we can simply slide this in here

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.219 
burning we can simply slide this in here
and<00:04:57.699> put<00:04:57.880> it<00:04:57.970> over<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.330> alcohol<00:04:58.720> burner<00:04:58.960> and

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
and put it over the alcohol burner and

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.469 
and put it over the alcohol burner and
it'll<00:04:59.440> put<00:04:59.680> it<00:04:59.770> out<00:04:59.919> and<00:05:00.550> then<00:05:00.849> the<00:05:01.000> advantage

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
it'll put it out and then the advantage

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.529 
it'll put it out and then the advantage
of<00:05:01.690> this<00:05:01.870> is<00:05:02.199> is<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.949> top<00:05:03.190> lid<00:05:03.580> on<00:05:03.909> this<00:05:04.300> burner

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
of this is is the top lid on this burner

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.279 
of this is is the top lid on this burner
actually<00:05:05.169> has<00:05:05.409> an<00:05:05.770> o-ring<00:05:06.520> here<00:05:06.789> so<00:05:07.270> once<00:05:07.509> the

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
actually has an o-ring here so once the

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.010 
actually has an o-ring here so once the
burner<00:05:08.530> is<00:05:08.770> out<00:05:09.009> you<00:05:09.610> can<00:05:09.759> simply<00:05:10.210> leave<00:05:10.750> your

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
burner is out you can simply leave your

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.980 
burner is out you can simply leave your
fuel<00:05:11.319> in<00:05:11.530> here<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:12.009> just<00:05:12.940> cover<00:05:13.210> it<00:05:13.300> up<00:05:13.449> and

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
fuel in here and just cover it up and

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.010 
fuel in here and just cover it up and
then<00:05:14.500> you<00:05:15.370> know<00:05:15.490> next<00:05:16.330> time<00:05:16.449> you<00:05:16.630> need<00:05:16.750> to<00:05:16.810> cook

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
then you know next time you need to cook

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.510 
then you know next time you need to cook
there's<00:05:17.409> already<00:05:17.590> going<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:17.860> be<00:05:17.979> some<00:05:18.159> fuel<00:05:18.400> in

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
there's already going to be some fuel in

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.180 
there's already going to be some fuel in
here<00:05:18.729> to<00:05:18.880> get<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.330> get<00:05:19.449> started<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:20.830> one<00:05:21.009> thing

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
here to get to get started the one thing

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.420 
here to get to get started the one thing
about<00:05:21.280> alcohol<00:05:22.120> is<00:05:22.620> it<00:05:23.620> does<00:05:23.770> evaporate<00:05:24.400> very

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
about alcohol is it does evaporate very

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.050 
about alcohol is it does evaporate very
quickly<00:05:25.050> so<00:05:26.050> that<00:05:26.530> oving<00:05:27.400> in<00:05:27.520> there<00:05:27.669> is<00:05:27.849> going

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
quickly so that oving in there is going

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.399 
quickly so that oving in there is going
to<00:05:28.180> prevent<00:05:28.479> prevent<00:05:29.020> that<00:05:29.169> from<00:05:29.229> happening

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
to prevent prevent that from happening

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.020 
to prevent prevent that from happening
of<00:05:29.889> now<00:05:30.159> the<00:05:30.220> one<00:05:30.400> thing<00:05:30.550> that<00:05:30.669> I<00:05:30.729> am<00:05:30.820> a<00:05:30.849> little

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
of now the one thing that I am a little

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.550 
of now the one thing that I am a little
disappointed<00:05:31.539> is<00:05:31.659> this<00:05:31.780> o-ring<00:05:31.960> does<00:05:32.320> fall

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
disappointed is this o-ring does fall

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.249 
disappointed is this o-ring does fall
out<00:05:33.000> it<00:05:34.000> originally<00:05:34.389> stayed<00:05:34.659> up<00:05:34.810> there<00:05:35.080> I

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
out it originally stayed up there I

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.010 
out it originally stayed up there I
should<00:05:35.979> probably<00:05:36.190> maybe<00:05:36.699> see<00:05:37.360> if<00:05:37.449> I<00:05:37.570> can<00:05:37.750> epoxy

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
should probably maybe see if I can epoxy

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.870 
should probably maybe see if I can epoxy
that<00:05:38.259> up<00:05:38.590> in<00:05:38.770> there<00:05:38.919> so<00:05:39.159> it'll<00:05:39.280> stay<00:05:39.520> up<00:05:39.639> there

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
that up in there so it'll stay up there

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.640 
that up in there so it'll stay up there
but<00:05:40.570> it's<00:05:40.690> not<00:05:40.810> really<00:05:41.020> that<00:05:41.080> big<00:05:41.320> of<00:05:41.409> an<00:05:41.500> issue

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
but it's not really that big of an issue

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.490 
but it's not really that big of an issue
you<00:05:42.430> just<00:05:44.099> put<00:05:45.099> it<00:05:45.190> on<00:05:45.280> there<00:05:45.580> and<00:05:46.500> you're

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
you just put it on there and you're

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.560 
you just put it on there and you're
ready<00:05:47.710> to<00:05:47.800> go<00:05:47.919> I<00:05:48.190> have<00:05:48.699> noticed<00:05:49.090> a<00:05:49.150> few<00:05:49.330> times

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
ready to go I have noticed a few times

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.290 
ready to go I have noticed a few times
that<00:05:49.810> I<00:05:49.840> almost<00:05:50.020> lift<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.500> stove<00:05:50.770> though<00:05:51.300> with

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
that I almost lift the stove though with

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.990 
that I almost lift the stove though with
the<00:05:52.570> o-ring<00:05:53.259> sitting<00:05:53.919> on<00:05:54.039> top<00:05:54.250> of<00:05:54.310> here<00:05:54.699> didn't

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
the o-ring sitting on top of here didn't

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.459 
the o-ring sitting on top of here didn't
realize<00:05:55.300> it<00:05:55.449> was<00:05:55.509> sitting<00:05:55.870> on<00:05:56.020> top<00:05:56.229> of<00:05:56.409> the

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
realize it was sitting on top of the

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.290 
realize it was sitting on top of the
burner<00:05:56.680> so<00:05:57.340> you<00:05:57.400> do<00:05:57.580> want<00:05:57.759> to<00:05:57.789> be<00:05:57.880> careful<00:05:58.060> of

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
burner so you do want to be careful of

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.589 
burner so you do want to be careful of
that<00:05:58.800> but<00:05:59.800> overall<00:06:00.669> it's<00:06:00.940> a<00:06:00.969> really<00:06:01.000> good<00:06:01.330> set

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
that but overall it's a really good set

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.620 
that but overall it's a really good set
it's<00:06:02.169> an<00:06:02.319> aluminum<00:06:02.590> set<00:06:03.099> of<00:06:03.370> all<00:06:03.729> the<00:06:04.060> pots<00:06:04.300> are

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
it's an aluminum set of all the pots are

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.409
