 they did this as if it were some more 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.740
 wagons train landmarks this is a 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.260
 well-known chocolate where we're going to make 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.229
 us a bunny and this are the 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.660
 more bad that you buy this in the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.880
 candy houses that are very, very 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.320
 known good what we 're going to do 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.850
 now it's going to be the little body of the snail 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.970
 let's go as always from a 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.370
 ball in this case dyed with dye 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.010
 green and what we are going to do now is 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.280
 let's fine tune and determine what 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.110
 would be the head we're tuning to 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.630
 perform the body there I'll fine tune 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.070
 so that it is well on tiptoes is 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.950
 very nice that we do it in different 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.160
 colors 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.810
 because it's more fun for kids 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.269
 think that sweets is something that 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.760
 the boys have a lot of fun and in 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.310
 us to decorate them also there 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.000
 we are going here to mark a little more 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.000
 the neck 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.650
 I'm going to bend a little bit there 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.720
 and here what I 'm going to do is 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.720
 mark the division of the eyes 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.940
 in this way we would have the 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.730
 little face 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.480
 what I'm going to do is to mark the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.480
 two little children 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.020
 there and there 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.190
 and what I'm going to do now we're going to 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.190
 place 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.680
 the little ball that is a little ball 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.360
 red there to place the nose and with 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.069
 this is a very little here 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.180
 what I'm going to do is very gently and 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.569
 I'm going to lift 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.739
 the upper lip and I'm going to lower the 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:43.769
 lower lip then with a stick what 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.409
 what I'm going to do is to mark here a 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.680
 day to place later with a 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:53.219
 stamen I'm going from the middle so 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.109
 we are going to place after we give form and what 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:57.750
 what I'm going to do is put it on a telo 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.609
 for once I have this what I'm going to 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.780
 to do is simply hit him with a 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.240
 little bit of class 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.310
 the worst we can not use of 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.110
 different colors there are white roses 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.430
 celestial in all the ways that you 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.890
 they can happen and all 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.350
 flavors that are the most important thing good 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.750
 let's do the successfully look at 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.820
 from this chocolate cited this chocolate 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.690
 what we are going to do is very well known 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.670
 is to take white pasta 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.060
 remember that I can pasta 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.410
 give color I can give flavor in the case 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.330
 that is doing some known that 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.490
 have chocolate flavor I can place 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.900
 chocolate essences also what 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.270
 important that we have the 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.790
 pasta always well covered so you do not 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.420
 we are served look to do what 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.950
 It would be the bunny's little trumpet 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.570
 make a small ball 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.140
 we always have to get him a little 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.140
 the cracks 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:56.919
 I make a little ball and then an oval I'm going 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.839
 to place here on the finger to lower a 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.789
 little bit and give it shape see that the finger 

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:02.379
 it has a rounded shape then that 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.559
 I will allow the Kaka is 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:08.689
 justito once you realize that what 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:11.809
 I am going to say with a very small bolichito 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:15.049
 I'm going to mark what would be the mouth 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:15.889
 then water and marked the little mouth 

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:17.569
 down 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.969
 once I have done this with a 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.819
 be here with this one you take away what I'm going to 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:26.760
 do I'm going to mark the division and with 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:30.660
 glue let's put it 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.520
 here in the center of the little bomb 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.170
 we can do it at birth in 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.870
 different types of colors and they are very 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.000
 very nice there is what would be the 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.920
 trumpet to do now now let's go 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.530
 to make the ears the ears are fine 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.320
 easy as always we start from the 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.490
 ball if the mass if it reaches a dry 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.170
 little what we have to do is 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.850
 moisten our hands a little 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.870
 can work without any problem 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:57.120
 then let's make a little ball 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.310
 little ball we do as well as if it were a 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.750
 pretty and then what I'm going to do with 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.230
 this is going to be flatten it 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.700
 and I plan and what I'm going to do is 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.640
 put a stick 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.050
 in this way and with that this stick what 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.740
 we are going to do after placing it here in 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.570
 the sides what I'm going to do is 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.460
 before I'm going to click the little bomb for 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:24.440
 that the ear can enter without problems 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.640
 and here from the goodies that 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.160
 you will start to occur a 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.350
 lots of other cute little bugs for 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.910
 place 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.040
 we say a clean thing 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.200
 and here we put the other shore and 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.330
 us what we can do is also 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.980
 put a stick underneath them in the 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.200
 eyes are two little black balls is very 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.050
 simple and what I can do is also 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.170
 place below this as a support that 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.420
 it's nice to put a bad one 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.140
 then we place here 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.140
 I spike there 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.680
 and there we would have the bunny that looks 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:09.050
 the girls can help help the 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.820
 guys from ways that we 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:17.660
 we start to start things happening and 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:19.400
 they help us a lot very good me 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.040
 I think it 's back 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.700
 we also see the fabric provoke but 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.700
 it's normal 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:34.029
