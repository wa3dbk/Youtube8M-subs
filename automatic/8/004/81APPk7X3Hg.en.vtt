00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.139
 yo-yo with such a charge your tribe 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.590
 but as new again, I'll be there 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.630
 tray of bovine naturally and this 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.460
 is like you can do the title 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.119
 because that will probably be said 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.650
 my most Uncas until now such a thing 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.449
 got this is a mess with a little bit 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.349
 kills so far and that's on the folder that 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.880
 fender with the paul 27 and throw it 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.950
 I think with form 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.469
 club rescue tot and stick 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.820
 mans is the mercury drop of the two 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.219
 way i love three was shared 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.320
 it is not very much yet 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.629
 tim want even though most of this shows 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.690
 so there would still be a hard time 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.969
 huge job and so on 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.460
 account where a lot is known 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.719
 no in chip music there is not yet real 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.940
 lots to do 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.820
 since there are very few but 6 people 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.439
 sit in it and so I am not crust either 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.110
 really easy to pick up and 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.939
 are also not very good 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.170
 like a place or you mind the sheds 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.510
 the shape that just 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.939
 Just make 20 kilver per bow 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.070
 because of this strings on all the things that I do 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.200
 here two lows I repeat and that thing 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.869
 then mark only 5 and 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.310
 up to 10 kills or so so that is 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.659
 just not very good yet 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.430
 want to be with you today 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.490
 how are you going to have the best 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.480
 best games would be to get some higher bim so 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.760
 especially on this game 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.750
 so if you like mine this time you can say 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.290
 years 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.610
 well la and I for crazy piece so crazy too 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.080
 just sit in the king because I am whole 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.180
 hard work and I didn't know where 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.920
 they came and would come and this 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.030
 gameplay is also pre-release 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.850
 there was the evening before this hero 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.650
 was that so it is also against 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.760
 swets 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.070
 but the best you can actually do 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.850
 is what I do now and in the middle of a mat 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.090
 to sit 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.650
 we just try to choose a place 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.540
 say where there is not very much front 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.990
 are where can come from and that 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.400
 just patrol just say 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.930
 observe wait until they come to you 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.710
 to come because when you can so god 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.170
 Russians 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.870
 so very very very much to ag2r 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.940
 of tensioning and yes that actually causes 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.450
 before you just die on 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.790
 sticks or if you are with sm3 are anyway already 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.250
 in the game not very well so that worked 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.080
 also not really mind the back 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.790
 since it is not in your heart for it 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.670
 and made stops here all 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.080
 things do n't worry at all 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.030
 kills less thing is not even possible 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.580
 shoot through things and there 's one 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.050
 say overheating thing open after one 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.470
 At some point he just had government 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.330
 in him you must reload carbon 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.430
 so the breakdown this is not so bad 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.980
 good but best way i have until now 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.660
 I've played is just in an area 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.459
 walk around a bit 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.860
 value and cannot come from it 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.050
 and just manage that and especially with 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.670
 sit down the brook flag 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.020
 you don't have to go a corner so much 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.550
 cap and wait until they are all just 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.459
 and you can just do a bit 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.160
 run around a certain area 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.930
 but do not go all the way in their spawn I 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.250
 have some game clips that I would 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.959
 probably later man times 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.260
 Upload how bad spawns are in 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.209
 captur counts from wanderer and there are 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.220
 literally just exciting where the 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.780
 someone in may i will have had second 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.910
 weapon appear in my image 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.980
 those guys from so just put black in 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.319
 a park trip that she behind me 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.870
 tension and shape tension 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.910
 so the sponge is still very difficult for you 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.950
 just to determine where and when they 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.480
 start to stretch there and that is mine too 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.580
 biggest problem the boil you share from 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.610
 Zwarver because I really like it or me 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.250
 from their tension and I am looking for one 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.230
 place out all the time being oldest 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.670
 make to run like theirs 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.959
 place or two wants to date that you have 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.519
 probably have all seen 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.709
 how I did that in the built 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.709
 is left in the factory as our regular 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.360
 locations and yes that just has to 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.799
 hard to find again just again 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.269
 find in coaching that at least confused 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.730
 related is still common at the moment 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.859
 hard to get under plus dna dna 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.440
 would make a fight I had a game yesterday 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:15.290
 wherein 20 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.400
 had a snare and then pans 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.400
 someone behind me again 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.550
 and that basically me unfortunately I have several 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.219
 I just trade a twentieth me 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.379
 just told him there was someone or 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:30.409
 very very weird span or over to me 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:31.879
 just not oosting and so i still have 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.979
 and I think that also for most 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:35.810
 spectators is still very difficult to 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.520
 kim schijntje or me not capsize dna 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.979
 Poms and so on but I guess this 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.669
 the best way is a lot of entanglement 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.669
 play and for 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.099
 dna be afraid that your thing is up 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.199
 drop scrolling and you don't have to 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.389
 agree with strict play by your cat 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.830
 here if i played without stitching and 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.990
 I had the place of worship that I am here 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.889
 probably the DNA for this game 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:01.159
 but this was a pot 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.210
 from 53 kills and yes try it on 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:03.860
 you can do that a bit further 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.419
 sits beneath the leg movement 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.710
 here so you see them just so exciting 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.909
 the sponge is bad so you can just 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.909
 apparently prius 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:15.409
 that is actually just a bit of the 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.289
 the best way to make this game successful 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.360
 with a good kd with a lot of kills too 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.219
 playing there is has is totally on it 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.089
 moment there is a number to see the smc 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:28.370
 just pure shit his name and for knowing 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:30.409
 what you 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.240
 king hall how you play what you do 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.589
 like it i like russians but 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.789
 it's the best way 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:36.110
 I hope for you for this 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.000
 combine to enjoyed it and see you at 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.270
 the following video me and yes 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.270
 different
