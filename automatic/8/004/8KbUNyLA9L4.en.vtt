 its origins are not what they seem 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.110

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.120
 a mysterious demon responds by moving 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.220
 the pencils the trend spread 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.930
 like gunpowder partly thanks to good 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.270
 number of stars in the networks 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.470
 US social networks that have been hooked 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.890
 to the game but where did it come from? 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.680
 real origin several reports indicate that 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.330
 his origins are in doctor but the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.660
 truth is that it does not seem to have 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.479
 references this game to folklore and 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.520
 American tradition the truth is that in 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.880
 mexico there is no demon called 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.010
 Charlie many of the Mexican legends 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.070
 they have their origin in Mayan mythology and 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.780
 Aztec or from the beliefs that 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.360
 they started circulating in religion 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.400
 during the Spanish conquest in the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.100
 Mexican mythology abound names 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.299
 gods like guti 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.820
 and little that comes from the water such these were 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.290
 gods previously related to 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.520
 natural phenomena 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.070
 on the other hand another explanation arises 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.409
 Charly Charly is an old Mexican game 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.899
 a spiritual tradition to contact 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.399
 to a ghost named charlie what the 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.590
 people who are not educated with 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.890
 paranormal research and demonology 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.860
 does not know is that not only contacts with 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.660
 charly but with many demons these 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.280
 demons will seem friendly to 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.180
 principle but they have sinister plans 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.950
 if you do not say goodbye to charly is there 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.310
 when you will experience a series of 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.230
 paranormal situations like hearing voices 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.319
 things that move shadows laughter 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.300
 sinister and so on this game is not 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.769
 sure and I recommend that nobody play 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.110
 this game unless they are 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.770
 specialized in what to do in case of 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.680
 do not say goodbye to charly 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.510
 you are inviting the devil to put together a 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.989
 chaos in your house 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.000
 spreads the word charlie is not a 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.340
 Friendly helmet is a powerful and 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.799
 dangerous of mÃ³nica to say goodbye 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.579
 to break contact with the spirit of 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.930
 charly 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.610
 you must sing charly charly we can stop 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.829
 when the pencils move, throw the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.519
 pencils to the ground and ends saying 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.440
 goodbye if you do not say goodbye to charly 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.849
 You are leaving a portal open to 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.220
 demons to enter and leave your house 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.280

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.920
 will cause chaos and maybe an episode of 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.650
 porta and grace that is the last thing 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.450
