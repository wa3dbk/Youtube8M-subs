00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
my games instead of in past 12 I used to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.319 
my games instead of in past 12 I used to
add<00:01:00.109> like<00:01:01.109> remove<00:01:02.010> about<00:01:02.430> sixty<00:01:02.820> percent<00:01:02.969> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
add like remove about sixty percent of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.340 
add like remove about sixty percent of
the<00:01:03.390> games<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:05.570> series<00:01:06.570> was<00:01:06.720> done<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> lot

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the games and the series was done a lot

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.039 
the games and the series was done a lot
quicker<00:01:07.610> but<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.760> time<00:01:09.000> important<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.810> more

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
quicker but this time important in more

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.580 
quicker but this time important in more
games<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:12.000> does<00:01:12.299> take<00:01:12.510> longer<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.990> build<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
games and it does take longer to build a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.950 
games and it does take longer to build a
class<00:01:14.159> team<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.150> year<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.570> past

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
class team I think this year in past

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800 
class team I think this year in past
2012<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.830> started<00:01:17.369> Master<00:01:17.970> League<00:01:18.119> online<00:01:18.479> in

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810

March I think and by April around this
time<00:01:23.850> last<00:01:23.909> year<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.450> probably<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:25.110> as<00:01:25.350> good<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
