00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 there is an opinion that any computer 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.020
 the game initially takes a lot of time 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.849
 for example if it is about more power to 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.920
 without a couple of hours a day spent on 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.990
 performing daily tasks or mining 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.269
 resources not do or for example 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.580
 singles where you can complete a level 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.230
 persist and with peace of mind eat 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.300
 well-deserved sausage sandwich 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.980
 but let's imagine for a second that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.380
 Communism does not need to work 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.570
 school knowledge loads head through 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.820
 flash drive means free time with us 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.399
 a lot of it can be spent on 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.260
 reading good books kidding we're the same 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.840
 your favorite games mean time 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.730
 spend on games well, that's the question how much 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.460
 time per day can be spent on the game 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.739
 a philosophical question if it comes to 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.420
 single player then 5 hours per game will be 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.239
 enough for passing 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.750
 if this lpg care here 20 hours a day 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.000
 spends 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.530
 but it will still be small but without interruption 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.379
 playing the same game is enough 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.879
 hard so i'm sure many of you 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.280
 take a break in the games taking 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.649
 the above sandwiches and include 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.379
 new series of favorite series itself so 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.450
 I'm doing business more precisely and here's my little 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.840
 stretched and the entry comes to an end and 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.530
 we smoothly move on to the alternative 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.799
 pastime in between 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.820
 games browser games and if more specifically 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.820
 Tatar saga 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.290
 if anyone knew the Tatar saga it 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.780
 browser game in which to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.940
 it is necessary to play as it is surprising 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.700
 browser if after these words you are all for 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.710
 have already decided yourself a good day for you 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.960
 all reasonable and curious connoisseurs 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.720
 gaming industry with your permission i 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.580
 I will continue modern browser games 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.950
 made a big step forward and in 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.780
 technical and graphical 3d 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.450
 shooter in the window here insert the name 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.430
 Your browser is easily Moir ASG 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.790
 hardcore gdv yes no questions 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.830
 but terence aha game i'm not about that here 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.230
 rather nostalgic centered important 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.690
 Internet dwellers still remembering about 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.430
 text games are moving around the world 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.680
 we get new satellites we mine 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.990
 materials and create items nothing here 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.840
 new and unusual about all 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.910
 familiar lpg components I will go straight 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.400
 to those things that attracted me a 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.890
 perhaps this atmosphere is attracting you too 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.050
 the world around the whole interesting point 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.130
 is to communicate and study 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.470
 surrounding world 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.480
 here you arrived in the city went unloaded 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.640
 docks went to the forest for mushrooms 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.400
 after practicing the domestication of animals 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.500
 and then you come in to listen to the tavern 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.200
 interesting stories on from a tangle of ale and 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.510
 all this is accompanied by pleasant music 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.459
 but why play the majority 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.120
 can only be in the breaks between the main 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.340
 projects 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.230
 everything is very simple as in any 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.360
 classic browser game on 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.120
 committing all actions are spent 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.820
 the main resource is time and then I say not 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.160
 about currency from the movie of the same name about 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.170
 present time be minutes hours 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.540
 or even the days you send your 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.820
 protagonist on an adventure or give 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.370
 the task is to collect ore and then go 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.780
 do any other things while he 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.420
 fulfills your tasks 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.459
 Yes, I do not talk about the intricacies of the game 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.300
 process but if you are interested in everything 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.790
 the foregoing 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.769
 you can safely go to study 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.610
 world since the game is accessible to all 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.010
 wanting 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.290
 but will the lost saga take its place 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.510
 in your bookmarks as usual you decide 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.800
 that's all thanks for watching and 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.239
