00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
really liked how it came out I think

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.210 
really liked how it came out I think
added<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> little<00:01:43.079> bit<00:01:43.290> more<00:01:43.530> fun<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> look

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.399 
added a little bit more fun to the look
a<00:01:44.460> little<00:01:44.909> more<00:01:45.030> depth<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.750> what<00:01:45.990> was<00:01:46.110> more

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
