to<00:02:01.939> come<00:02:02.149> in<00:02:02.299> when<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.600> big<00:02:02.750> seed<00:02:03.049> heads

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
to come in when the big seed heads

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.950 
to come in when the big seed heads
already<00:02:04.730> so<00:02:05.690> I<00:02:05.990> will<00:02:06.200> show<00:02:06.440> you<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:07.190> flowers

already so I will show you the flowers

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.470 
already so I will show you the flowers
right<00:02:08.960> now<00:02:09.170> here's<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.830> nasturtiums<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:11.240> got

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
right now here's the nasturtiums and got

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.450 
right now here's the nasturtiums and got
these<00:02:11.630> from<00:02:11.870> Johnson's<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:12.890> there's<00:02:13.100> three

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
these from Johnson's and there's three

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.220 
these from Johnson's and there's three
different<00:02:13.820> varieties<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.510> here<00:02:14.870> I'm<00:02:14.990> going<00:02:15.170> to

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
different varieties in here I'm going to

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.410 
different varieties in here I'm going to
plant<00:02:15.470> them<00:02:15.620> all<00:02:15.710> in<00:02:15.980> exactly<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.850> same<00:02:17.090> way

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
plant them all in exactly the same way

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.390 
plant them all in exactly the same way
they're<00:02:18.200> all<00:02:18.380> beautiful<00:02:18.920> colors<00:02:19.100> are

they're all beautiful colors are
hopefully<00:02:19.880> they'll<00:02:20.360> grow<00:02:20.570> in<00:02:20.630> between<00:02:21.020> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
hopefully they'll grow in between the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.220 
hopefully they'll grow in between the
beans<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.790> peas<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:22.870> anywhere<00:02:23.870> in<00:02:24.080> the

beans and peas and anywhere in the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.680 
beans and peas and anywhere in the
allotment<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:24.860> they'll<00:02:25.730> keep<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.480> bees

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
allotment and they'll keep the bees

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
on how to plant because they're all

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.720 
on how to plant because they're all
exactly<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:51.110> same<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.680> as<00:02:51.860> before<00:02:52.130> I've<00:02:52.550> got

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.540 
exactly the same and as before I've got
a<00:02:52.760> toilet<00:02:53.360> roll<00:02:53.540> I've<00:02:54.290> cut<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.800> in<00:02:54.920> half<00:02:55.190> and

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
a toilet roll I've cut it in half and

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.330 
a toilet roll I've cut it in half and
I've<00:02:55.880> filled<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:56.480> with<00:02:56.510> compost<00:02:56.900> like<00:02:57.620> that

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
I've filled it with compost like that

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.070 
I've filled it with compost like that
now<00:02:58.820> this<00:02:58.970> will<00:02:59.180> be<00:02:59.270> great<00:02:59.480> because<00:02:59.630> then<00:02:59.930> we

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
now this will be great because then we

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.370 
now this will be great because then we
can<00:03:00.290> put<00:03:00.740> it<00:03:00.770> straight<00:03:01.070> in<00:03:01.490> the<00:03:01.640> soil<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.380> we

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
can put it straight in the soil and we

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.370 
can put it straight in the soil and we
won't<00:03:03.560> disturb<00:03:03.950> any<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.490> roots<00:03:04.820> if<00:03:05.380> the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
won't disturb any of the roots if the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.400 
won't disturb any of the roots if the
cardboard<00:03:06.860> tube<00:03:07.190> isn't<00:03:07.930> biodegraded<00:03:08.959> enough

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
cardboard tube isn't biodegraded enough

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.380 
cardboard tube isn't biodegraded enough
we<00:03:09.709> can<00:03:09.860> always<00:03:09.950> just<00:03:10.430> run<00:03:10.640> a<00:03:10.700> pair<00:03:11.360> of

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
we can always just run a pair of

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.230 
we can always just run a pair of
scissors<00:03:11.690> up<00:03:12.050> there<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.760> then<00:03:13.760> put<00:03:14.120> it

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
scissors up there and then put it

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.420 
scissors up there and then put it
straight<00:03:14.390> in<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.780> ground<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:16.100> if<00:03:16.220> we<00:03:16.400> just

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
straight in the ground and if we just

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.580 
straight in the ground and if we just
put<00:03:16.820> two<00:03:17.150> in<00:03:17.740> each<00:03:19.000> pot<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.480> we<00:03:21.110> just<00:03:21.290> put<00:03:21.470> them

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
put two in each pot and we just put them

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.460 
put two in each pot and we just put them
on<00:03:21.709> top<00:03:21.770> like<00:03:22.430> this<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.030> then<00:03:23.750> just<00:03:24.020> push<00:03:24.230> them

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
on top like this and then just push them

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.740 
on top like this and then just push them
down<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:25.489> your<00:03:25.670> first<00:03:26.060> knuckle<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.910> then<00:03:29.390> just

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
down to your first knuckle and then just

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.300 
down to your first knuckle and then just
cover<00:03:29.959> them<00:03:30.170> over<00:03:30.290> if<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:30.770> need<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:30.950> little<00:03:31.130> bit

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
cover them over if you need a little bit

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.740

more compost and put a little bit more
compost<00:03:33.260> on<00:03:33.530> top<00:03:33.770> and<00:03:34.070> there<00:03:34.880> we<00:03:35.030> are<00:03:35.060> that's

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
compost on top and there we are that's

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.750 
compost on top and there we are that's
those<00:03:36.290> done<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:36.800> I'll<00:03:37.040> just<00:03:37.250> do<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.550> once

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760

a little bent down the middle and that

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.330 
a little bent down the middle and that
can<00:04:34.969> be<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.150> dividing<00:04:35.870> line<00:04:35.900> if<00:04:36.469> you've<00:04:36.919> got<00:04:37.099> two

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
can be a dividing line if you've got two

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.580 
can be a dividing line if you've got two
small<00:04:37.610> trays<00:04:38.180> then<00:04:38.569> use<00:04:38.780> two<00:04:39.020> small<00:04:39.319> trees

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
small trays then use two small trees

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.129 
small trays then use two small trees
don't<00:04:40.400> do<00:04:40.550> these<00:04:40.699> outside<00:04:41.210> otherwise<00:04:41.840> they'll

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
don't do these outside otherwise they'll

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.740 
don't do these outside otherwise they'll
blow<00:04:42.409> away<00:04:42.639> but<00:04:43.639> these<00:04:43.879> are<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.180> rebecky

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
blow away but these are the rebecky

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.330 
blow away but these are the rebecky
essenes<00:04:45.169> they're<00:04:45.469> very<00:04:46.270> very<00:04:47.270> small<00:04:47.840> okay<00:04:48.740> so

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340

going to do is just sprinkle over the

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:57.839 
going to do is just sprinkle over the
top<00:04:56.210> like<00:04:56.479> this

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849

okay the last few on and do exactly the
same<00:05:03.190> with<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.219> delphinium<00:05:05.150> seeds<00:05:05.770> now<00:05:06.770> these

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
same with the delphinium seeds now these

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.869 
same with the delphinium seeds now these
aren't<00:05:07.580> even<00:05:07.940> round<00:05:08.240> they're<00:05:08.509> very<00:05:08.750> bizarre

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:09.879 
aren't even round they're very bizarre

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.969 
aren't even round they're very bizarre
very<00:05:10.879> very<00:05:11.210> strange<00:05:11.629> shape<00:05:12.020> there<00:05:12.349> there<00:05:12.830> we

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
very very strange shape there there we

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:13.119 
very very strange shape there there we
are
