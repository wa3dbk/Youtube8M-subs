have fits and seizures and they died of

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.259 
have fits and seizures and they died of
convulsions<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:40.250> then<00:03:41.250> they<00:03:41.400> did<00:03:41.580> an<00:03:41.730> autopsy

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
convulsions and then they did an autopsy

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.979 
convulsions and then they did an autopsy
and<00:03:42.570> they<00:03:43.050> found<00:03:43.380> lesions<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:44.489> is

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
and they found lesions this is

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.710 
and they found lesions this is
abnormalities<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:47.430> guts<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:48.000> on<00:03:48.480> the

abnormalities in the guts and on the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.040 
abnormalities in the guts and on the
nerves<00:03:49.730> so<00:03:50.730> there<00:03:50.910> was<00:03:51.000> something<00:03:51.239> very<00:03:51.690> toxic

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
nerves so there was something very toxic

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
need to be very careful

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.930 
need to be very careful
of<00:04:27.840> proteins<00:04:28.440> especially<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.310> proteins<00:04:29.760> in

and once they get warped and distorted

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.580 
and once they get warped and distorted
they<00:04:34.980> become<00:04:35.310> toxic<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:36.260> obviously<00:04:37.260> in<00:04:37.440> the

case of the proteins and grains

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.340 
case of the proteins and grains
they've<00:04:39.990> become<00:04:40.310> neurotoxic<00:04:41.570> now<00:04:42.570> here<00:04:43.200> we

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
they've become neurotoxic now here we

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.420 
they've become neurotoxic now here we
have<00:04:43.380> a<00:04:43.800> supermarket<00:04:44.790> with<00:04:45.450> a<00:04:45.480> whole<00:04:45.900> row<00:04:46.260> of

have a supermarket with a whole row of

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.670 
have a supermarket with a whole row of
extruded<00:04:47.430> breakfast<00:04:47.880> cereals<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.680> this

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
extruded breakfast cereals and this

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.230 
extruded breakfast cereals and this
photograph<00:04:50.190> was<00:04:50.430> taken<00:04:50.460> in<00:04:50.910> a<00:04:50.940> health<00:04:51.150> food

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
photograph was taken in a health food

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.000 
photograph was taken in a health food
store<00:04:51.420> and<00:04:53.000> these<00:04:54.000> are<00:04:54.210> organic<00:04:54.360> grains<00:04:55.290> right

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
store and these are organic grains right

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.890 
store and these are organic grains right
and<00:04:56.280> they<00:04:56.400> don't<00:04:56.550> have<00:04:56.820> any<00:04:57.060> artificial

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
and they don't have any artificial

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.860 
and they don't have any artificial
colors<00:04:58.320> they<00:04:59.280> don't<00:04:59.460> have<00:04:59.580> any<00:04:59.730> sugar<00:05:00.030> these

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
colors they don't have any sugar these

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.340 
colors they don't have any sugar these
are<00:05:01.080> good<00:05:01.350> for<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.740> cereals<00:05:02.280> right<00:05:03.140> the<00:05:04.140> thing

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
are good for you cereals right the thing

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.130 
are good for you cereals right the thing
about<00:05:04.560> organic<00:05:04.770> grains<00:05:05.490> whole<00:05:06.480> grains<00:05:06.510> first

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
about organic grains whole grains first

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.630 
about organic grains whole grains first
they<00:05:07.260> have<00:05:07.410> more<00:05:07.560> protein<00:05:08.010> and<00:05:08.220> organic

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
they have more protein and organic

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.920 
they have more protein and organic
grains<00:05:08.850> have<00:05:09.060> more<00:05:09.300> protein<00:05:09.720> than

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
grains have more protein than

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.700 
grains have more protein than
non-organic<00:05:10.140> grains<00:05:11.660> so<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:12.840> likelihood<00:05:13.530> is

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
non-organic grains so the likelihood is

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.860 
non-organic grains so the likelihood is
you're<00:05:13.890> going<00:05:14.070> to<00:05:14.130> get<00:05:14.340> more<00:05:14.730> of<00:05:15.060> these<00:05:15.270> toxic

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
you're going to get more of these toxic

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.350 
you're going to get more of these toxic
neurotoxic<00:05:16.710> protein<00:05:17.130> fragments<00:05:17.910> in<00:05:18.060> the

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
neurotoxic protein fragments in the

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.350 
neurotoxic protein fragments in the
health<00:05:18.600> food<00:05:18.960> cereals<00:05:19.950> than<00:05:20.669> you<00:05:20.880> would<00:05:21.120> if

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
health food cereals than you would if

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.350 
health food cereals than you would if
you<00:05:21.480> were<00:05:21.600> buying<00:05:21.900> cocoa<00:05:22.680> puffs<00:05:23.040> in<00:05:23.910> the

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
you were buying cocoa puffs in the

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.130 
you were buying cocoa puffs in the
supermarket<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:26.090> we<00:05:27.090> have<00:05:27.300> a<00:05:27.330> generation<00:05:27.900> of

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
supermarket and we have a generation of

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.690 
supermarket and we have a generation of
children<00:05:28.320> who<00:05:28.620> starts<00:05:28.980> out<00:05:29.130> eating<00:05:29.520> each

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
children who starts out eating each

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.090 
children who starts out eating each
morning<00:05:30.210> eating<00:05:31.050> these<00:05:31.169> breakfast<00:05:31.710> cereals

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
morning eating these breakfast cereals

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.710 
morning eating these breakfast cereals
do<00:05:32.790> you<00:05:32.880> think<00:05:33.090> there's<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.300> connection

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
do you think there's a connection

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.420 
do you think there's a connection
between<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:34.290> fact<00:05:34.560> that<00:05:34.650> these<00:05:34.830> kids<00:05:35.100> can't

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
between the fact that these kids can't

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.280 
between the fact that these kids can't
sit<00:05:35.669> students<00:05:36.120> sit<00:05:36.540> still<00:05:36.780> in<00:05:36.930> school<00:05:37.169> and

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
sit students sit still in school and

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.600 
sit students sit still in school and
have<00:05:37.470> behavior<00:05:37.890> problems<00:05:38.280> and<00:05:38.430> can't

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
have behavior problems and can't

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.570 
have behavior problems and can't
concentrate<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:39.419> can't<00:05:39.960> learn<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:40.650> these

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
concentrate and can't learn and these

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.330 
concentrate and can't learn and these
extruded<00:05:42.150> breakfast<00:05:42.540> cereals<00:05:42.900> I<00:05:43.160> think<00:05:44.160> that

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
extruded breakfast cereals I think that

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.210 
extruded breakfast cereals I think that
there's<00:05:44.729> a<00:05:44.820> connection
