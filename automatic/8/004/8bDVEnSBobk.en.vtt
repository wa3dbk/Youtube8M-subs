00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
this is just switching up the way you're

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.830 
this is just switching up the way you're
wrapping<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.220> around<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:11.970> you're<00:01:12.510> only<00:01:12.630> doing

wrapping it around if you're only doing

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.960 
wrapping it around if you're only doing
it<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.320> way<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.799> not<00:01:14.070> gonna<00:01:14.250> work<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.729> well<00:01:14.939> I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
it one way it's not gonna work as well I

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.300 
it one way it's not gonna work as well I
realize<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.750> after<00:01:16.290> I've<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.799> pregnancy<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
realize that after I've a pregnancy to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.249 
realize that after I've a pregnancy to
curl<00:01:17.490> my<00:01:17.580> hair<00:01:17.610> for<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.299> many<00:01:18.479> years<00:01:18.810> now<00:01:19.020> I

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
curl my hair for so many years now I

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.109 
curl my hair for so many years now I
realized<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.070> alternate<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.939> way<00:01:21.060> you

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
realized to be alternate the way you

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.840 
realized to be alternate the way you
curl<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.780> actually<00:01:22.350> makes<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.100> difference<00:01:23.549> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
curl it it actually makes a difference I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.980 
curl it it actually makes a difference I
didn't<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.270> made<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> difference<00:01:24.810> it's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
didn't think I made a difference it's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.200 
didn't think I made a difference it's
how<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.080> did<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.740> way<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.640> does<00:01:26.939> take<00:01:27.180> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
how I did it this way it does take a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.999 
how I did it this way it does take a
little<00:01:27.450> bit<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> longer<00:01:27.990> process<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.890> it's

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
little bit of a longer process but it's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.490 
little bit of a longer process but it's
totally<00:01:29.310> worth<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> out<00:01:30.270> run<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.900> this

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
totally worth it in the out run and this

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that out right now it's kind of annoying

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.560 
that out right now it's kind of annoying
but<00:01:47.159> I'm<00:01:47.399> sorry<00:01:47.610> about<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.329> tried<00:01:48.540> my

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
but I'm sorry about that but I tried my

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.450 
but I'm sorry about that but I tried my
best<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.079> film<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.920> guys<00:01:50.070> but<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
best to film this for you guys but the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.859 
best to film this for you guys but the
whole<00:01:50.610> technique<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.720> just

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
whole technique for this is just

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.060 
whole technique for this is just
switching<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.259> way<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.409> wrap<00:01:52.680> your<00:01:52.890> hair

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
switching the way you wrap your hair

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:01.910 
switching the way you wrap your hair
around<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.340> curling<00:01:53.430> iron

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.020 

when<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:02.950> was<00:02:03.159> doing<00:02:03.310> this<00:02:03.520> also<00:02:03.790> I

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
when I was doing this also I

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.270 
when I was doing this also I
accidentally<00:02:04.960> did<00:02:05.170> burn<00:02:05.440> my<00:02:05.650> forehead<00:02:06.070> it

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
just moving on to the other side and

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.810 
just moving on to the other side and
curling<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.040> way<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.190> did<00:02:30.430> on<00:02:30.459> my<00:02:30.670> other

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
curling it the way I did on my other

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.759 
curling it the way I did on my other
side<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.480> try<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.870> cut<00:02:32.080> down<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.230> lot<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
side I try to cut down a lot of the

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.830 
side I try to cut down a lot of the
parts<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.190> here<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.519> it's<00:02:33.670> not<00:02:33.790> just<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.239> long

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
parts in here so it's not just that long

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.330 
parts in here so it's not just that long
of<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.290> watching<00:02:35.590> me<00:02:35.650> do<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.830> same<00:02:36.070> technique

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
of you watching me do the same technique

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.670 
of you watching me do the same technique
for<00:02:37.330> my<00:02:37.450> whole<00:02:37.630> entire<00:02:37.660> hair<00:02:38.170> because<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.500> does

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
for my whole entire hair because it does

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.440 
for my whole entire hair because it does
take<00:02:38.950> quite<00:02:39.489> some<00:02:39.670> time<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:40.000> takes<00:02:40.180> me<00:02:40.330> about

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
take quite some time it takes me about

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.600 
take quite some time it takes me about
45<00:02:40.690> minutes<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.410> do<00:02:41.560> my<00:02:41.739> whole<00:02:41.980> entire<00:02:42.100> head

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
45 minutes to do my whole entire head

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.390 
45 minutes to do my whole entire head
and<00:02:42.820> it's<00:02:43.540> kind<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.989> long<00:02:44.230> process<00:02:44.500> but<00:02:45.100> if

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
and it's kind of a long process but if

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.460 
and it's kind of a long process but if
you<00:02:46.000> really<00:02:46.239> want<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.840> natural-looking

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
you really want the natural-looking

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.590 
you really want the natural-looking
curls<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.610> have<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:49.000> work<00:02:49.150> for<00:02:49.360> them<00:02:49.450> and

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
curls and you have to work for them and

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.400 
curls and you have to work for them and
they<00:02:50.050> aren't<00:02:50.500> as<00:02:51.120> good<00:02:52.120> as<00:02:52.390> they<00:02:52.660> supposed<00:02:53.290> to
