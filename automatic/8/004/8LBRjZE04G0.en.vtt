 still and I did and I hope I can show it to you but the following as it is 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:52.490
 that your game bears the mark that I already have 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.720
 you can create a new car loads network I'll show you how the game works 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.010
 is under development 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.489
 he already up to the airport things new here in the game the turn decision 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.700
 that I saw a demonstration video of it easier to continue here I go 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.360
 entering my house I'll comment on the deal you can get 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.570
 many people have to have told that it was only from the diary of a company that was 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.509
 fatal of jackman and craig fisher né 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.380
 too much video on the internet is that I'm going to answer a lot about it 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.820
 I want to take the time to do this at the end of this video. 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.280
 and I'm going to ask you for help, because I want to make it go 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.780
 depending on your contribution has some form so wait there when 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.640
 you're my house I made inside the milk pt that is the black swimsuit 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.750
 for psp 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.750
 team happens that they have already implemented several things and have to see now 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.539
 there is indeed issued today if you have a 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.789
 one of the most fair of stores around her she that crosses the wall for her 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.629
 is not contained by the wall but is already working is unfortunately still 

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:48.719
 It's a block so from here to you go through it's still time option 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.640
 block property but it should change that soon. 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.820
 I did my house the game works more or less how quelimane works 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.410
 classic creative léo the year zero point three things of type c in the flame segment 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.190
 the one you can play for free from the sea page and crack 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.190
 it means that you can put a blog what you want if you can take the 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.909
 that would put 5 you press a button your pastor to do this 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.900
 It is a tinga button should bear in mind that it is or 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.730
 You press him to take him to put the inter take. 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.170
 one of the problems I had here with control you have to try 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.610
 select to jump 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.310
 because his move 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.090
 stays on the analog 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.639
 and the view is in the suburb of the buttons 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.389
 is here 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.029
 no directional is to choose the blocks that you can use I put all the 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.159
 blocks here from this side 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.269
 For you to see that you already answered here. 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.370
 in block African thing and the block of diamond was the blockade 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.099
 the help it eventually became common the campus looks like it will be good deep is not 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.830
 that thing that this meal benefits without the sugar cane and that also then 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.369
 you have a great range of blocks to be able to work with them here 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:56.469
 type codipi shoulders on the loss of forest fell from sixth and the desert can 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.510
 have another that I have not noticed 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.519
 and quotes the pool tires said another one I did 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.790
 is this was in the must to which the pilot was 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.829
 in the water was the florence but as it has to block and with ice on top of the block 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.659
 probably there should also be a biome 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.370
 I have not arrived, they do not even have the block they did not implement. 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.180
 thing that even implemented until you reach psi 20 you can see here the sneakers 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.159
 Let's compete, I'll talk, sit down. 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.010
 and enter 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.109
 in the module late I go then you can visualize the mind you come back 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.190
 it is quite different from the creative mode 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.310
 on the other side 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.550
 he credited his game in the new creative mode of the sea in crack 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.290
 until he proved something similar 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.189
 directed with the vision and support forward in the directional to fly 7 9 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.249
 I will not go any better man does not have that scheme of this kind on the other side 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:45.959
 more practical and active 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.010
 an interesting thing that had many spaces we lost it I already commented this 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.560
 finally I'll comment now 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.010
 that I saw he was promising to return a scheme of day night 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.290
 they finally did it in the selection with the sharing has it in a 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.860
 version 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.090
 but earlier there was no 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.260
 a thing that is different from an interpreter who killed him henrique 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.489
 in definite generated actually the player without points you can 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.420
 possibly procons pt my house near the wall of bush you arrive at 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.200
 His wall he has a scheme of success highly tries to see the thing is 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.930
 down there has a relative also more or less how well it works is frank 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.489
 dugard a normal interpreter 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.860
 if you are seeing that fidelity to your heart 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.180
 that they place here in the Haitian system the problem is that in the next 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.259
 being also are not so behind him the water finally the Portuguese beating here of that 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.920
 side but you can see what the nominated house looks like 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.380
 the light through the wall is not blocked by it and they believed 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.059
 in that 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:41.240
 but things are planned for Christmas little by little to the people 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.310
 and this thing becoming very functional the way it frightens me because 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.500
 put one thing to get that one thing of the pcp can they are 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.980
 now adapted to the full exterior that is the man who would be the game cell phone 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.130
 dream time 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.680
 only that the goiás misses and has a processor of 1ghz seduction of 333 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.220
 I think the maximum of his speed 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.700
 333 the abeiva represent each of those guys managed to do a lot 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.200
 thing so that's what I leave here for you and you guys bachata everything in 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.340
 description bar if you are right there and going from below is to put your weight down 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.630
 you have one of the blockers 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.140
 but nowadays any good prospects unlocked in the then guess no one 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.500
 It's going to be a problem to do this. I did it to change this game to fashion. 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.880
 also screen capture system that there were fatalities 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.740
 twilight production now about using the information you want 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.660

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.259
 elaborated 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.669
 and put in place put on the internet and at dawn to see if the thing 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.250
 people's work did not have a very good reaction 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.319
 and I myself did not like the peace project that no area places 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.950
