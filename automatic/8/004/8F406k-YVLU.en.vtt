 all went here we go 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:03.760
 craft then you create a new network and 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.760
 written there for example 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:16.939

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.979
 here turned on 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:24.549
 already ate and so then you come in 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.549
 mancraft 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.000
 big screen 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.400
 our game and include and any world or 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.430
 judges finals 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.160
 but it makes no difference I will create the old 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.510
 which friend played 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:47.140
 so the question is you take inkscape and 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.270
 open for city 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.710
 then well if you want to creative the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.070
 title of screen 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.090
 important 4 turn on look 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.690
 adventure video there new blocks and 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.590
 nasty at surviving in an open world 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.280
 a month and right here the alpi beat me up 0 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:12.020
 . 0. 0 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:15.820
 and thousands of this 74 do not need these 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:25.220
 many write only need to write off the end 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:36.470
 : 1954 then your friend enter the team 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:41.120
 not yet there is 10 and writes 12 pairs 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.040
 and writes 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.840
 I do not know how to get to connect as already 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.640
 It became a super war song sovereign 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:54.159
 if you want more key chains 2010 then 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:03:04.220
 have to pay hamachi and so 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:07.900
 further we copy this address and so 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.390
 document for example matched forget and 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.709
 put it in every person here 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.370
 hamachi different address different for such 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.569
 unpretentious 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:25.840
 and the fact that just here still writing 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.840
 like football is also looking for this letters 4 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.510
 highly 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.480
 our 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:43.209
 three four like this and you give this 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:48.440
 ip friend necessarily and see 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:51.290
 then suddenly while in the game then he walks into 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:04:00.049
 direct connection of the game and here and eat and 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:05.750
 there must be copied and pasted and I 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:06.560
