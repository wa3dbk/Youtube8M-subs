00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.919
 there are cells in our body 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.740
 primitives that can turn into 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.870
 cardiac liver cells and so 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.360
 away to regenerate old fabrics or 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.370
 stem cells are damaged 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.989
 known for a long time 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.090
 research has begun to study it 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.800
 in the nineties to exploit them 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.610
 extraordinary capacity for purpose 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.280
 therapeutic 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.829
 today they are used successfully in 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.050
 treatment of bone lesions like bread 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.160
 in the case of burns and in treatment 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.379
 of leukemia 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.390
 they are also considered the big one 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.309
 promise of medicine to be used in 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.440
 future for the treatment of the disease of 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.380
 parkinson of some heart diseases 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.259
 of diabetes and the 1 to deficiencies with 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.299
 people but what they are and how they are used 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.310
 stem cells in the body 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.430
 adult we try skin cells 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.680
 of the bones of the brain muscles and 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.250
 many other fabrics all different between 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.320
 their 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.630
 but if we rewind the story of a 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.820
 organism we arrive moment when 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.100
 different cells are not differentiated 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.470
 in specialized fabrics during the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.600
 embryo formation from divisions 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.270
 of the zygote are in fact formed of the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.430
 totipotent cells, ie those that then 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.680
 differentiating they will form the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.180
 so many adult tissues are the cells 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.399
 embryonic stem cells 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.220
 these cells may in the beginning 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.409
 become anything but gradually 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.930
 the embryo grows cell division 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.469
 after cell division each takes 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.030
 his destiny becoming heart liver 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.130
 brain and all it takes to 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.590
 adult body and this spontaneous process 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.840
 repair that is used e 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.530
 enhanced in treatment based on 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.689
 stem 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.789
 healthy stem cells are transplanted 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.360
 in the sick body to repair the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.070
 textiles 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.620
 there are two problems still to be solved 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.290
 as in any other transplant 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.690
 there is also the risk of rejection of these 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.360
 so bright cells are hard to 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.400
 check and can replicate so 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.620
 harmful to health compared to 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.930
 adult stem cells have embryonic stem cells 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.060
 a strong regenerating power and can 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.460
 differentiate into a greater number of 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.900
 Cell types for this are seen 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.400
 as more promising 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.680
 they are the embryonic stem cells 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.379
 but to be a matter of discussion 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.510
 ethics for taking stem cells 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.579
 the embryo must be destroyed but a 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.470
 newly conceived individual is the owner 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.790
 of the same rights in a person already 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.790
 born or not
