00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.290
 and I start telling you about the 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.180
 competition that was held on 10 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.889
 September by which garlic 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.199
 as planned, two were announced 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.270
 cell phones the iphone 5 this and the 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.130
 iphone 5 6 and the iphone 5 went to 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.779
 contrary what was expected is not 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.670
 cheaper or cheaper than the 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.080
 previous iphone 5 what is going to happen is 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.240
 that will have practically the same 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.220
 features that the iphone 5 the 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.050
 iphone 5 is going to be deleted is to say no longer 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.970
 is going to sell and when this 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.770
 iphone 5 this with different colors and 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.480
 with 100 dollars cheaper is the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.699
 feature on this screen 4 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.679
 inch with retina display processor 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.510
 art like the iphone 5 and a camera 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.890
 of 8 megapixels besides that as they 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.319
 mentioned and I get different 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.670
 colors and the plastic housing despite 

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:48.379
 everything still has a good option for 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.280
 those who do not want cellular as expensive as 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.229
 the iphone 5 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.550
 Now if we do something new like 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:54.889
 I was expecting the iphone now it will come in three 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.929
 different colors white black and color 

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:58.879
 gold and gold for the 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.440
 people who like sling online 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.269
 you know the team has a 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.889
 processor so this one I have a jack 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.260
 is the first to use the structure 

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:08.810
 64-bit more powerful graphics and 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.490
 will also have a m7 tester that 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.750
 will allow to handle all the functions of 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.810
 motion sensors 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.310
 in processor 7 and we can make a 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.410
 most fluid experience with our 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.790
 device is supposed to have boosted 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.470
 battery but with all those new 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.290
 characteristics is going to be spent just as 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.820
 fast are 250 hours on standby which is 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.530
 practically the same as the iphone 5 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.000
 Previous also has a camera 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.580
 pretty good that allows you to record 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.410
 even at 120 frames per second and what 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.119
 newer so to speak something that does not 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.530
 was in the previous cell phones in the 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.880
 new auditorium that was 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.229
 specifically a fingerprint reader 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.420
 fingerprint that includes this device 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.130
 how does it work since you practically put 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.600
 your finger reads your fingerprints and 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.460
 You can have what you do what you do 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.720
 shopping online only with your 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.090
 fingers just need to put your password 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.009
 surveys or anything like that just you 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.750
 well it's perfect now not only are you going 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.880
 to steal the board men are going to cut the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.350
 excellent finger but hey we say about 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.030
 you who think about your new 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.920
 device that they will buy us if 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.300
 they had money they would buy them or 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.039
 definitely opt in your 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.149
 cell phones like the galaxy those who do not 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.950
 13-0 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.989
 Miley Cyrus released her new music video 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.580
 entitled breaking bone and he does not want them 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.110
 count because of himself as he broke the 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.820
 musical record of live on youtube that 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.320
 I previously had the chin song of 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.180
 the one direction network what happened 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.849
 was that before the video got 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.709
 on the day of its release thing that the 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.390
 previous video could only have 17 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.459
 millions and now may and health has the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.129
 record with this song now yes let's go 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.140
 to the video they already saw it is seriously 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.420
 truth was all that miley needed 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.659
 because you have to be 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.930
 swinging in this way in a ball and 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.280
 lick a hammer really do not know what 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.620
 say about it if you have not seen the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.599
 video and who cry a mouse as the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.639
 the rest is wrong, it's the grand videogame 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.049
 theft auto 5 will be released 17 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.609
 September practically throughout the 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.500
 world tells you that it's going to be a game 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.819
 excellent that will exceed all 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.680
 limits that players are 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.200
 waiting but all this had a cost 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.419
 very very high since now gta 5 is 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.340
 considered the most expensive game of all 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.139
 story and not because the copy of the 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.359
 video can I will cost 5 thousand pesos and 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.799
 nothing of that but the realization and 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.180
 production of this game cost 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.060
 many millions 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.370
 the small urns a total of 266 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.200
 millions of dollars is a lot of money 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.700
 and obviously rockstar games is 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.829
 waiting for this game to be a big hit 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.210
 we see that they can recover everything 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.770
 they have invested all 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.300
 tyler if not the same just the 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.190
 description and also the full note 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.170
 so they learn a little more about everything 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.790
 what this video told has spam of 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.410
 the superheroes or simply and simply 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.600
 have you seen the most year films 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.880
 know until Jarvis the assistant of 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.470
 tony stark no pepper potts garden ya 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.120
 you know the computer with toni 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.160
 he's always talking, he seems like something 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.840
 quite futuristic and in fact it is but 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.340
 now marvel attacking the application that 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.200
 it can lead us to feel more or less 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.910
 what it is like to have an assistant of this type 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.140
 the application is called garden so the 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.180
 you can search the store in your 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.280
 devices and in the download so 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.200
 it's May - the assistant is nothing 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.970
 similar to siri with her they went with her 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.390

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.100

 you can also use it as an alarm clock 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.820
 calendar is used to remember things 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.710
 and also always a file with all 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.330
 the armor of that superhero in case 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.830
 you're a fan, it made me something 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.810

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.850
 mini or pseudo console that allows you 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.530
