2014-2015 NBA season of the Washington
Wizards<00:00:06.899> so<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.740> did<00:00:08.189> go<00:00:08.309> ahead<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.790> just<00:00:08.940> skip

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
Wizards so I did go ahead and just skip

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.150 
Wizards so I did go ahead and just skip
to<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.480> offseason<00:00:10.019> after<00:00:10.170> last<00:00:10.530> game<00:00:10.769> because

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
to the offseason after last game because

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.009 
to the offseason after last game because
we<00:00:11.610> pretty<00:00:11.790> much<00:00:11.880> had<00:00:12.179> no<00:00:12.360> shot<00:00:12.570> at<00:00:12.719> making<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
we pretty much had no shot at making the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.839 
we pretty much had no shot at making the
playoffs<00:00:13.230> unless<00:00:13.799> an<00:00:14.070> absolute<00:00:14.670> miracle

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
playoffs unless an absolute miracle

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.210 
playoffs unless an absolute miracle
happened<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.870> miracle<00:00:16.199> did<00:00:16.320> not<00:00:16.470> happen<00:00:16.890> we

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
happened and a miracle did not happen we

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.010 
happened and a miracle did not happen we
did<00:00:17.400> not<00:00:17.580> make<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.910> playoffs<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.600> were<00:00:18.779> I

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
did not make the playoffs we were I

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.420 
did not make the playoffs we were I
think<00:00:19.380> like<00:00:19.470> eight<00:00:19.680> games<00:00:19.890> out<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.279> eighth

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
think like eight games out of the eighth

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.560 
think like eight games out of the eighth
spot<00:00:20.670> or<00:00:20.820> something<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.270> weren't<00:00:21.480> even

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
spot or something so we weren't even

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.150 
spot or something so we weren't even
particularly<00:00:22.050> close<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.500> make<00:00:22.740> him<00:00:22.890> play<00:00:22.980> out

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
particularly close to make him play out

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.910 
particularly close to make him play out
but<00:00:23.789> Kevin<00:00:24.539> Durant<00:00:24.720> was<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> MVP<00:00:25.080> no<00:00:25.680> real

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
but Kevin Durant was the MVP no real

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.370 
but Kevin Durant was the MVP no real
surprise<00:00:26.369> there<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:27.119> usual<00:00:27.630> suspects<00:00:28.199> for

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
surprise there the usual suspects for

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.540 
surprise there the usual suspects for
the<00:00:28.410> first<00:00:28.619> second<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.010> third<00:00:29.189> team<00:00:29.369> all-nba

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the first second and third team all-nba

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.569 
the first second and third team all-nba
is<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.179> didn't<00:00:30.420> really<00:00:30.599> get<00:00:30.960> anyone<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.679> any<00:00:32.369> of

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
is we didn't really get anyone on any of

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.310 
is we didn't really get anyone on any of
these<00:00:32.730> teams<00:00:33.090> unfortunately<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.960> thought<00:00:34.230> our

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
these teams unfortunately I thought our

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.229 
these teams unfortunately I thought our
team<00:00:34.530> was<00:00:34.649> quite<00:00:34.860> solid<00:00:35.130> more<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.790> teams

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
team was quite solid more of a a teams

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.569 
team was quite solid more of a a teams
team<00:00:36.630> rather<00:00:36.960> than<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.590> team<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.280> built

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
team rather than a team that is built

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.250 
team rather than a team that is built
around<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:39.030> star<00:00:39.270> player<00:00:39.600> even<00:00:39.809> though<00:00:39.930> John

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
around one star player even though John

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.720 
around one star player even though John
Wall<00:00:40.469> was<00:00:40.620> definitely<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.160> star<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
Wall was definitely a star and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.459 
Wall was definitely a star and
definitely<00:00:42.059> deserved<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.690> at<00:00:42.840> least<00:00:43.020> 13

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
definitely deserved to be at least 13

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.560 
definitely deserved to be at least 13
while<00:00:43.620> NBA<00:00:43.920> I'm<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.789> sure<00:00:44.850> why<00:00:45.180> he<00:00:45.300> didn't

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
while NBA I'm not sure why he didn't

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.760 
while NBA I'm not sure why he didn't
make<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.840> he's<00:00:45.989> definitely<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.469> least<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
make it he's definitely at least the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.770 
make it he's definitely at least the
third<00:00:46.800> best<00:00:47.160> point<00:00:47.370> guard<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> NBA<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.270> my

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
third best point guard in the NBA in my

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.630 
third best point guard in the NBA in my
estimation<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.950> San<00:00:50.250> Antonio<00:00:50.340> Spurs

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
estimation but the San Antonio Spurs

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.880 
estimation but the San Antonio Spurs
wound<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.600> winning<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.110> championship<00:00:52.739> I

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
wound up winning the championship I

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.770 
wound up winning the championship I
really<00:00:53.399> was<00:00:53.520> not<00:00:53.760> surprised<00:00:54.210> at<00:00:54.420> all<00:00:54.539> there

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
really was not surprised at all there

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.450 
really was not surprised at all there
there<00:00:54.989> my<00:00:55.140> pick<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> win<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> championship<00:00:55.800> in

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
there my pick to win the championship in

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.939 
there my pick to win the championship in
real<00:00:56.640> life<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.149> highly<00:00:57.989> doubt<00:00:58.140> anyone<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.680> going

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
real life I highly doubt anyone is going

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.709 
real life I highly doubt anyone is going
to<00:00:59.100> beat<00:00:59.280> them<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.579> real<00:00:59.730> life<00:00:59.910> bar<00:01:00.180> some<00:01:00.480> major

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
to beat them in real life bar some major

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.200 
to beat them in real life bar some major
injury<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.500> they<00:01:02.100> did<00:01:02.280> end<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.670> back-to-back

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
injury and they did end up back-to-back

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.939 
injury and they did end up back-to-back
repeat<00:01:03.870> because<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.229> won<00:01:04.409> last<00:01:04.619> year<00:01:04.860> as

reason<00:01:17.580> Washington<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> big<00:01:18.420> market<00:01:18.750> city

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
reason Washington is a big market city

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.260 
reason Washington is a big market city
in<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> NBA<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:20.040> only<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> 68

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
in the NBA but we only have like a 68

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.090 
in the NBA but we only have like a 68
million<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.689> year<00:01:21.720> budget<00:01:22.020> or<00:01:22.290> something<00:01:22.619> for

million a year budget or something for

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.950 
million a year budget or something for
everything<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.420> don't<00:01:24.570> really<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
everything so we don't really have the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.230 
everything so we don't really have the
biggest<00:01:25.290> budget<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:26.130> also<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.939> believe

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
biggest budget we also have I believe

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.359 
biggest budget we also have I believe

first-round<00:01:30.000> draft<00:01:30.240> picks<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.869> we<00:01:31.049> did<00:01:31.229> end<00:01:31.409> up

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
first-round draft picks so we did end up

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.560 
first-round draft picks so we did end up
with<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> 13th<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.400> 10th<00:01:32.729> pick<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.299> 10th

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
with the 13th in the 10th pick the 10th

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.960 
with the 13th in the 10th pick the 10th
was<00:01:33.810> from<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> Nets<00:01:34.320> 13th<00:01:35.009> was<00:01:35.189> our<00:01:35.400> own<00:01:35.640> pic

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
was from the Nets 13th was our own pic

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.999 
was from the Nets 13th was our own pic
and<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.509> believe<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.869> also<00:01:37.049> had<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.530> 18th

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
and then I believe we also had the 18th

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.700 
and then I believe we also had the 18th
pick<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> trade<00:01:39.119> from<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.689> Grizzlies<00:01:40.380> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
pick with a trade from the Grizzlies and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.469 
pick with a trade from the Grizzlies and
that's<00:01:41.009> all<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:41.369> our<00:01:41.400> first<00:01:41.729> round<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.329> we

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that's all for our first round and we

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.460 
that's all for our first round and we
don't<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.750> any<00:01:42.869> second<00:01:43.140> round<00:01:43.290> picks

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
don't have any second round picks

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.170 
don't have any second round picks
because<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.740> traded<00:01:44.040> them<00:01:44.159> all<00:01:44.369> away<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.820> also

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
because we traded them all away I also

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.850 
because we traded them all away I also
wanted<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.600> hire<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> new<00:01:45.960> coach<00:01:45.990> I'm<00:01:46.470> not

very good Martell Webster is going to be
on<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.440> decline<00:02:53.680> so<00:02:54.130> he's<00:02:54.250> going<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.430> be<00:02:54.490> worse

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730

the<00:03:00.160> Philadelphia<00:03:00.640> seventy<00:03:00.940> Sixers<00:03:01.210> were

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
the Philadelphia seventy Sixers were

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.820 
the Philadelphia seventy Sixers were
thinking<00:03:01.720> but<00:03:01.840> they<00:03:01.960> actually<00:03:02.290> offered<00:03:02.650> me

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
thinking but they actually offered me

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.440 
thinking but they actually offered me
the<00:03:02.950> trade<00:03:03.220> i<00:03:03.250> didn't<00:03:03.610> offer<00:03:03.730> them<00:03:03.880> that<00:03:04.210> trait

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
the trade i didn't offer them that trait

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.330 
the trade i didn't offer them that trait
so<00:03:04.600> i<00:03:04.960> went<00:03:05.200> for<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.560> I'm<00:03:05.650> just<00:03:05.950> asking

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
so i went for it I'm just asking

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.130 
so i went for it I'm just asking
everyone<00:03:06.670> who<00:03:06.820> to<00:03:06.970> draft<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.390> overall<00:03:08.020> our

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
everyone who to draft and overall our

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.080 
everyone who to draft and overall our
biggest<00:03:08.500> need<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.680> at<00:03:09.010> power<00:03:09.280> forward<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:10.060> we

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
biggest need is at power forward so we

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.210 
biggest need is at power forward so we
end<00:03:10.360> up<00:03:10.510> taking<00:03:10.960> the<00:03:11.080> best<00:03:11.260> power<00:03:11.560> forward<00:03:12.070> on

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
end up taking the best power forward on

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.890 
end up taking the best power forward on
the<00:03:12.640> market<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.240> looks<00:03:13.420> like<00:03:13.630> in<00:03:13.870> that

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
the market that it looks like in that

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.780 
the market that it looks like in that
was<00:03:14.200> suggested<00:03:14.710> by<00:03:14.830> about<00:03:15.190> half<00:03:15.250> of<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
was suggested by about half of the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.150 
was suggested by about half of the
people<00:03:16.090> that<00:03:16.210> I<00:03:16.330> have<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:17.050> was<00:03:17.200> Joey<00:03:17.500> Bradshaw

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
people that I have it was Joey Bradshaw

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.560 
people that I have it was Joey Bradshaw
and<00:03:18.340> he<00:03:18.490> ended<00:03:18.730> up<00:03:18.820> being<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.090> really<00:03:19.120> nice

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
and he ended up being a really nice

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.540 
and he ended up being a really nice
player<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.320> he<00:03:20.350> will<00:03:20.680> be<00:03:20.710> the<00:03:21.010> power<00:03:21.160> forward

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
player so he will be the power forward

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.800 
player so he will be the power forward
for<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.880> future<00:03:22.210> for<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.450> Washington

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
for the future for the Washington

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.630 
for the future for the Washington
Wizards<00:03:22.840> hopefully<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.800> also<00:03:24.070> he<00:03:24.220> comes<00:03:24.460> on<00:03:24.580> a

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
Wizards hopefully and also he comes on a

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.940 
Wizards hopefully and also he comes on a
really<00:03:24.940> cheap<00:03:25.150> contract<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.900> he<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.410> going<00:03:26.710> to

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
really cheap contract and he is going to

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.680 
really cheap contract and he is going to
give<00:03:27.130> us<00:03:27.160> more<00:03:27.520> than<00:03:27.580> Luol<00:03:28.060> Deng<00:03:28.090> would<00:03:28.570> at

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
give us more than Luol Deng would at

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.970 
give us more than Luol Deng would at
that<00:03:28.720> power<00:03:29.020> forward<00:03:29.350> spot<00:03:29.380> so<00:03:29.710> he<00:03:29.830> isn't

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
that power forward spot so he isn't

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.740 
that power forward spot so he isn't
upgrade<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.580> he<00:03:30.910> is<00:03:31.000> cheaper<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:31.450> he's

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
upgrade and he is cheaper and he's

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.180 
upgrade and he is cheaper and he's
younger<00:03:32.020> so<00:03:32.290> he's<00:03:32.410> going<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.650> develop<00:03:33.040> and

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
younger so he's going to develop and

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.880 
younger so he's going to develop and
then<00:03:33.610> our<00:03:33.760> next<00:03:33.790> pick<00:03:34.330> is<00:03:34.480> later<00:03:35.110> on<00:03:35.350> at<00:03:35.650> pick

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
then our next pick is later on at pick

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.320 
then our next pick is later on at pick
number<00:03:36.160> 13<00:03:36.520> because<00:03:36.670> we<00:03:36.760> did<00:03:36.910> not<00:03:36.940> trade<00:03:37.240> away

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
number 13 because we did not trade away

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.870 
number 13 because we did not trade away
the<00:03:37.540> 13th<00:03:37.960> pick<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.440> we<00:03:38.980> are<00:03:39.250> just<00:03:39.550> go<00:03:39.790> ahead

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
the 13th pick and we are just go ahead

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.520 
the 13th pick and we are just go ahead
and<00:03:40.000> asking<00:03:40.630> everyone<00:03:40.990> what<00:03:41.020> they<00:03:41.200> want<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.410> do

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
and asking everyone what they want to do

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.930 
and asking everyone what they want to do
and<00:03:41.740> it<00:03:42.040> looks<00:03:42.190> like<00:03:42.340> most<00:03:42.430> people<00:03:42.730> want<00:03:42.850> to

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
and it looks like most people want to

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.699 
and it looks like most people want to
draft<00:03:43.300> in<00:03:43.420> two<00:03:43.570> big<00:03:43.720> men<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:44.140> we<00:03:44.230> drafted<00:03:44.620> this

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
draft in two big men so we drafted this

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.890 
draft in two big men so we drafted this
guy<00:03:44.920> Marshall<00:03:45.370> Johnston<00:03:45.820> obviously<00:03:46.390> these

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
guy Marshall Johnston obviously these

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.710 
guy Marshall Johnston obviously these
people<00:03:47.230> are<00:03:47.320> fake<00:03:47.620> however<00:03:48.370> 2k<00:03:49.270> did<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.480> lot<00:03:49.690> of

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
people are fake however 2k did a lot of

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.480 
people are fake however 2k did a lot of
work<00:03:49.930> on<00:03:50.200> how<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.500> draft<00:03:50.800> classes<00:03:51.040> work<00:03:51.340> now

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
work on how the draft classes work now

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.010 
work on how the draft classes work now
and<00:03:51.640> it's<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.850> lot<00:03:52.000> better<00:03:52.240> now<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.570> rookies

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
and it's a lot better now the rookies

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.240 
and it's a lot better now the rookies
are<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.170> lot<00:03:53.290> more<00:03:53.320> realistic<00:03:53.680> there's<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.160> lot

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
are a lot more realistic there's a lot

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.800 
are a lot more realistic there's a lot
more<00:03:54.280> information<00:03:54.940> about<00:03:55.030> them<00:03:55.330> scouting<00:03:55.750> the

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
more information about them scouting the

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.990 
more information about them scouting the
information<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:56.740> i<00:03:56.770> really<00:03:57.280> like<00:03:57.520> it<00:03:57.700> quite<00:03:57.940> a

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
information so i really like it quite a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.090 
information so i really like it quite a
bit<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.510> often<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.170> 2k<00:03:59.500> rookies<00:03:59.860> are<00:04:00.040> a

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
bit and often the 2k rookies are a

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.800 
bit and often the 2k rookies are a
little<00:04:00.550> bit<00:04:00.700> more<00:04:00.790> realistic<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.510> rating

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
little bit more realistic and rating

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.510 
little bit more realistic and rating
than<00:04:02.080> the<00:04:02.500> draft<00:04:02.770> classes<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.370> can

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
than the draft classes that you can

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.490 
than the draft classes that you can
download<00:04:03.670> online<00:04:04.180> which<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.140> reason<00:04:05.290> why

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
download online which is the reason why

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.800 
download online which is the reason why
i<00:04:05.530> prefer<00:04:05.740> to<00:04:06.010> use<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.490> 2k<00:04:06.820> rookies<00:04:07.150> because<00:04:07.570> i

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
i prefer to use the 2k rookies because i

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.270 
i prefer to use the 2k rookies because i
don't<00:04:08.260> want<00:04:08.410> to<00:04:08.500> get<00:04:08.620> some<00:04:08.770> rookies<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:09.190> are

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
don't want to get some rookies that are

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.070 
don't want to get some rookies that are
just<00:04:09.459> way<00:04:09.610> too<00:04:09.670> high<00:04:10.000> or<00:04:10.209> way<00:04:10.330> too<00:04:10.390> low<00:04:10.720> overall

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
just way too high or way too low overall

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.650 
just way too high or way too low overall
and<00:04:11.470> it's<00:04:11.590> not<00:04:12.040> very<00:04:12.070> realistic<00:04:12.700> so<00:04:13.360> we<00:04:13.480> ended

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
and it's not very realistic so we ended

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.720 
and it's not very realistic so we ended
up<00:04:13.750> taking<00:04:13.990> a<00:04:14.260> small<00:04:14.560> forward<00:04:14.950> on<00:04:15.100> our<00:04:15.400> next

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
up taking a small forward on our next

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.880 
up taking a small forward on our next
pick<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:16.150> we<00:04:16.930> didn't<00:04:17.380> really<00:04:17.470> have<00:04:17.650> too<00:04:17.770> much

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
pick and we didn't really have too much

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.190 
pick and we didn't really have too much
of<00:04:18.040> a<00:04:18.100> need<00:04:18.280> for<00:04:18.580> him<00:04:18.790> but<00:04:19.030> maybe<00:04:19.720> he'll<00:04:20.049> be<00:04:20.169> a

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
of a need for him but maybe he'll be a

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.330 
of a need for him but maybe he'll be a
decent<00:04:20.440> wing<00:04:20.739> player<00:04:20.979> off<00:04:21.130> the

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
I ended up not signing a single player

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.030 
I ended up not signing a single player
and<00:04:36.760> free<00:04:37.210> agency<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:37.840> offered<00:04:38.710> a<00:04:38.770> couple

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
as Jordan Clarkson who developed really

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.340 
as Jordan Clarkson who developed really
nicely<00:04:42.550> another<00:04:43.330> young<00:04:43.600> point<00:04:43.840> guard<00:04:43.990> and

nicely another young point guard and

nicely another young point guard and
neither<00:04:44.770> of<00:04:44.979> them<00:04:45.130> were<00:04:45.250> willing<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.610> play<00:04:45.820> for

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
neither of them were willing to play for

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.700 
neither of them were willing to play for
what<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.270> could<00:04:46.479> afford<00:04:46.600> so<00:04:47.020> I<00:04:47.050> ended<00:04:47.320> up<00:04:47.440> just

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
what I could afford so I ended up just

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.590 
what I could afford so I ended up just
having<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.280> computers<00:04:48.699> signed<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.180> couple

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
having the computers signed a couple

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.990 
having the computers signed a couple
know<00:04:49.930> named<00:04:50.260> really<00:04:50.620> really<00:04:50.860> low<00:04:51.130> overall<00:04:51.760> I

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
know named really really low overall I

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.580 
know named really really low overall I
believe<00:04:52.270> there<00:04:52.479> are<00:04:52.630> uh<00:04:52.780> keys<00:04:52.960> or<00:04:53.260> just<00:04:53.500> people

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
believe there are uh keys or just people

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.860 
believe there are uh keys or just people
from<00:04:53.979> the<00:04:54.130> free<00:04:54.340> agent<00:04:54.700> class<00:04:54.820> which<00:04:55.450> was<00:04:55.479> not

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
from the free agent class which was not

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.600 
from the free agent class which was not
fun<00:04:55.900> probably<00:04:56.620> second-round<00:04:57.190> picks<00:04:57.460> that

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
fun probably second-round picks that

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.370 
fun probably second-round picks that
team<00:04:57.850> chose<00:04:58.360> not<00:04:58.660> to<00:04:58.810> sign<00:04:59.020> themselves

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
team chose not to sign themselves

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.629 
team chose not to sign themselves
because<00:04:59.530> they're<00:04:59.590> not<00:04:59.710> very<00:04:59.919> good<00:05:00.130> so<00:05:00.550> the

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
because they're not very good so the

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:01.980 
because they're not very good so the
final<00:05:00.790> thing<00:05:00.940> we<00:05:01.120> did<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.419> going<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:01.780> train

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
final thing we did is going to train

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.320 
final thing we did is going to train
camps<00:05:02.320> I<00:05:02.410> said<00:05:02.860> Bradley<00:05:03.310> Whitfield<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:04.000> the

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
camps I said Bradley Whitfield to the

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.879 
camps I said Bradley Whitfield to the
perimeter<00:05:04.690> shooting<00:05:04.960> so<00:05:05.350> he's<00:05:05.560> just<00:05:05.590> going<00:05:05.830> to

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
perimeter shooting so he's just going to

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.650 
perimeter shooting so he's just going to
be<00:05:06.040> deadly<00:05:06.490> deadly<00:05:06.820> accurate<00:05:07.450> from<00:05:07.570> the

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
be deadly deadly accurate from the

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.900 
be deadly deadly accurate from the
perimeter<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:08.169> also<00:05:08.560> ended<00:05:08.950> up<00:05:09.100> sending<00:05:09.700> John

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
perimeter I also ended up sending John

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.370 
perimeter I also ended up sending John
Wall<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.300> perimeter<00:05:10.630> shooting<00:05:10.870> because<00:05:11.080> he

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
Wall the perimeter shooting because he

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.170 
Wall the perimeter shooting because he
really<00:05:11.650> could<00:05:11.950> use<00:05:11.979> to<00:05:12.490> improve<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.880> little<00:05:12.970> bit

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
really could use to improve a little bit

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.909 
really could use to improve a little bit
on<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.330> three-point<00:05:13.810> writing<00:05:14.080> he<00:05:14.380> can<00:05:14.620> get<00:05:14.770> hot

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
on a three-point writing he can get hot

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.010 
on a three-point writing he can get hot
sometimes<00:05:15.220> but<00:05:15.729> John<00:05:16.210> Wall<00:05:16.389> is<00:05:16.419> definitely

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
sometimes but John Wall is definitely

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.900 
sometimes but John Wall is definitely
inconsistent<00:05:17.979> and<00:05:18.070> then<00:05:18.190> I<00:05:18.250> set<00:05:18.460> our<00:05:18.580> rookie

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
inconsistent and then I set our rookie

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.150 
inconsistent and then I set our rookie
to<00:05:19.120> athleticism<00:05:19.600> it<00:05:20.199> was<00:05:20.350> already<00:05:20.620> kind<00:05:20.979> of<00:05:21.039> a

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
to athleticism it was already kind of a

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.590 
to athleticism it was already kind of a
freak<00:05:21.340> athlete<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:21.880> now<00:05:21.940> he's<00:05:22.090> just<00:05:22.270> more<00:05:22.539> of

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
freak athlete and now he's just more of

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.570 
freak athlete and now he's just more of
a<00:05:22.810> freak<00:05:23.020> athlete<00:05:23.199> I<00:05:23.560> was<00:05:24.039> debating<00:05:24.220> with

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
a freak athlete I was debating with

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.310 
a freak athlete I was debating with
sending<00:05:24.820> them<00:05:24.970> to<00:05:25.090> untapped<00:05:25.510> potential<00:05:26.050> but

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
sending them to untapped potential but

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.409 
sending them to untapped potential but
that<00:05:26.560> is<00:05:26.710> also<00:05:26.889> the<00:05:27.039> most<00:05:27.280> expensive<00:05:27.430> one<00:05:28.030> I'm

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
that is also the most expensive one I'm

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:29.879 
that is also the most expensive one I'm
not<00:05:28.570> using<00:05:28.750> my<00:05:28.900> VC<00:05:29.229> for<00:05:29.410> anything<00:05:29.560> but<00:05:29.770> who

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
not using my VC for anything but who

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:31.260 
not using my VC for anything but who
knows<00:05:30.039> maybe<00:05:30.100> I'll<00:05:30.460> do<00:05:30.580> some<00:05:30.639> my<00:05:30.910> team<00:05:31.120> or

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
knows maybe I'll do some my team or

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.270 
knows maybe I'll do some my team or
something<00:05:31.479> in<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:31.720> future<00:05:31.870> and<00:05:32.229> then<00:05:32.830> I<00:05:32.860> could

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
something in the future and then I could

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.210 
something in the future and then I could
actually<00:05:33.460> use<00:05:33.700> this<00:05:34.180> VC<00:05:34.630> but<00:05:35.200> for<00:05:35.590> in<00:05:35.889> terms<00:05:36.039> of

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
actually use this VC but for in terms of

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.580 
actually use this VC but for in terms of
the<00:05:36.310> my<00:05:36.460> gem<00:05:36.760> I<00:05:37.000> don't<00:05:37.660> really<00:05:37.870> use<00:05:38.139> it<00:05:38.169> up<00:05:38.440> all

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
the my gem I don't really use it up all

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
that often so the main thing it's for is

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.180 
that often so the main thing it's for is
just<00:05:40.450> spinning<00:05:40.900> on<00:05:41.139> the<00:05:41.169> camps<00:05:41.620> so<00:05:42.039> it<00:05:42.099> was

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
just spinning on the camps so it was

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
the camps and now finally we go to the

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.080 
the camps and now finally we go to the
next<00:05:47.380> season<00:05:47.830> and<00:05:48.039> we're<00:05:48.280> going<00:05:48.430> to<00:05:48.460> be<00:05:48.610> ranked

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
rankings coming to the next season so I

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.210
