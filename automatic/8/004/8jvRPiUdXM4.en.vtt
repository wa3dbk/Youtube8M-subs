00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.559
 what's up kids here in general I 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.269
 I'm a little trick for gta 5 during 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.219
 I miss 5 and it's a trick to want 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.439
 transported in an online session of 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.820
 one place to another on the map to 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.369
 teleport what we have to 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.789
 to do is to come to start mode mode 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.109
 pause and look for a career that is 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.820
 near a place where we 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.890
 we want to go for example if we want 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.960
 have signed to the area where they appear 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.820
 helicopters is worth it is in the south of 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.530
 map because we look for a career that is 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.900
 very close to that place where they appear 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.040
 helicopters and what we do is aim 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.210
 we the name on a paper 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.480
 we come to online we come to 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.570
 lists of games we come to create 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.460
 add career and look for the name of 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.220
 the race that we had aimed for that 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.100
 which is close to where they appear 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.050
 helicopters to transport us very 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.410
 near where are two helicopters and 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.690
 do not take long to go either by car or 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.460
 in whatever for example is that of 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.380
 step of the channel that I think is about 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.390
 of the helicopters but good is the one 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.340
 I chose for the video he picked up a volley 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.490
 but but I think it works for the case of 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.000
 opposite we give the X 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.470
 we give the circle we give to save and 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.540
 we put the name we want for 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.220
 example we can put helicopters for 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.540
 know that when we teleport more 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.799
 there we will be close to the 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.270
 helicopters 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.770
 now I show you here so you can see the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.720
 list of players that there are so that 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.570
 you see that it does not change us of session that is 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.830
 in the same room in the same session 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.350
 then to have transport 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.600
 we come to online we come to the list of 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.970
 departure starting ministers and we look for 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.649
 which we have saved in this case I 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.729
 I have named the old house but 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.670
 could have put the name of 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.690
 helicopters we give to load we give 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.090
 to accept the teleports will be us 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.310
 will put us in host of the game 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.399
 we go to the circle the insurance that we want 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.470
 leave if and when you leave we will appear 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.140
 just to the race and then it's 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.630
 a mini trick does not stop 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.600
 teleport to sites because more 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.180
 easy because it happens many times that you 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.650
 join a party of a friend and he is 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.080
 in one corner and you are in another and you have 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.519
 to go by car and that's a way 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.330
 of teleporting is very easy 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.940
 you can point 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.350
 the notes on a paper in a man that 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.330
 be near your friend's house 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.400
 so you know that every time you 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.930
 you unite to invite them to more than you have to 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.090
 teleported to that race that you 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.550
 you have targeted and already be there near 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.860
 our friend is a simple trick advice 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.090
 you could say no then nothing but you 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.470
 liked you deis life favorites 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.480
 subscribe to my channel if I was not and 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.850

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.680

 forget if it were the merry christmas now 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.340
 that there really is not much goal 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.140
 Well the one without forgetting before but good 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.200
 What a merry Christmas and what I hope there will be 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.270
 enjoyed the gifts and nothing 30 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.060
