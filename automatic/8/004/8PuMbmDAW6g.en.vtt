one<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.880> seems<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.330> be<00:00:21.480> some<00:00:22.320> river<00:00:22.590> boats<00:00:24.170> that

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
one it seems to be some river boats that

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.089 
one it seems to be some river boats that
are<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.740> down<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.010> river<00:00:26.930> on<00:00:27.930> both<00:00:28.349> sides<00:00:28.650> and

are going down a river on both sides and

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.299 
are going down a river on both sides and
so<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.910> find<00:00:30.539> these<00:00:30.720> Arizona<00:00:31.260> ones<00:00:31.560> really

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309

stand<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:33.000> when<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.329> see<00:00:33.510> them<00:00:33.690> compared<00:00:34.110> to

a<00:00:38.250> chance<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.610> haven't<00:00:38.820> been<00:00:39.030> too<00:00:39.360> impressed

thought I'd try this one out so I'm not

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.959

sure exactly what southern style sweet

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.660 
sure exactly what southern style sweet
tea<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:51.629> that's<00:00:51.870> something<00:00:52.860> that's<00:00:53.070> well

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
tea is if that's something that's well

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.850 
tea is if that's something that's well
known<00:00:53.910> or<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> something<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.739> they

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
known or if it's you something that they

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.920 
known or if it's you something that they
use<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.340> describe<00:00:56.460> their<00:00:56.940> particular<00:00:57.539> sweet

tea<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> guess<00:00:59.789> we'll

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
tea that they have but I guess we'll

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.770

find<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.629> hopefully<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.770> tastes<00:01:02.129> good<00:01:02.780> but

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780

my sweet teas to be I'm even a fan of
iced<00:03:04.359> teas<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.930> don't<00:03:05.109> have<00:03:05.260> any<00:03:05.410> sugar<00:03:05.769> in

iced teas that don't have any sugar in

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.819 
iced teas that don't have any sugar in
them<00:03:06.130> at<00:03:06.250> all<00:03:06.370> but<00:03:07.120> even<00:03:07.599> though<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:07.989> you<00:03:08.109> I<00:03:08.260> like

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
them at all but even though I you I like

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.830 
them at all but even though I you I like
it<00:03:08.859> less<00:03:09.250> sweet<00:03:09.519> I<00:03:09.700> still<00:03:09.940> did<00:03:10.180> enjoy<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:10.660> one

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
it less sweet I still did enjoy this one

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.659 
it less sweet I still did enjoy this one
I<00:03:10.870> found<00:03:11.169> it<00:03:11.319> was<00:03:11.380> sweet<00:03:11.709> but<00:03:11.919> you<00:03:12.280> could<00:03:12.430> still

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
I found it was sweet but you could still

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.030 
I found it was sweet but you could still
taste<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.690> tea<00:03:13.900> flavor<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.470> wasn't<00:03:14.859> just

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
taste the the tea flavor it wasn't just

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.699 
taste the the tea flavor it wasn't just
overwhelmed<00:03:15.730> by<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.940> sugary<00:03:16.389> flavor<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:17.049> so

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
overwhelmed by the sugary flavor and so

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.710 
overwhelmed by the sugary flavor and so
I<00:03:17.739> think<00:03:18.040> that's<00:03:18.220> really<00:03:18.400> important<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.569> as

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
I think that's really important the as

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.990 
I think that's really important the as
far<00:03:19.930> as<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.349> tea<00:03:20.560> flavor<00:03:20.829> goes<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.430> was<00:03:21.519> good

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
far as the tea flavor goes it was good

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.150 
far as the tea flavor goes it was good
you<00:03:22.209> could<00:03:22.359> definitely<00:03:22.480> taste<00:03:23.019> it<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.709> wasn't

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
you could definitely taste it it wasn't

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.789 
you could definitely taste it it wasn't
too<00:03:24.430> strong<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.180> know<00:03:25.540> some<00:03:25.840> people<00:03:25.989> don't<00:03:26.530> like

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
too strong I know some people don't like

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.129 
too strong I know some people don't like
too<00:03:27.069> much<00:03:27.190> tea<00:03:27.519> flavor<00:03:27.790> in<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.060> personally<00:03:28.870> I

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
too much tea flavor in it personally I

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.580 
too much tea flavor in it personally I
do<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:30.069> like<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.609> a<00:03:30.669> little<00:03:30.849> stronger<00:03:31.269> but<00:03:32.169> this

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
do I like it a little stronger but this

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.050 
do I like it a little stronger but this
one<00:03:32.769> was<00:03:32.950> still<00:03:33.130> pretty<00:03:33.370> good<00:03:33.549> I<00:03:33.609> could<00:03:33.819> still

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
one was still pretty good I could still

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.210 
one was still pretty good I could still
taste<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.389> flavor<00:03:34.690> of<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.989> tea<00:03:35.169> so<00:03:35.769> I<00:03:36.099> think

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
taste the flavor of the tea so I think

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.729 
taste the flavor of the tea so I think
it<00:03:36.430> was<00:03:36.489> pretty<00:03:36.700> nice<00:03:36.910> overall<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:38.169> think<00:03:38.590> it

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
it was pretty nice overall I think it

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.699 
it was pretty nice overall I think it
was<00:03:38.859> pretty<00:03:39.010> good<00:03:39.569> even<00:03:40.569> though<00:03:40.840> it's<00:03:41.049> not<00:03:41.230> one

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
was pretty good even though it's not one

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.460 
was pretty good even though it's not one
that's<00:03:41.889> generally<00:03:42.760> in<00:03:42.819> my<00:03:42.970> style<00:03:43.319> since<00:03:44.319> this

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
that's generally in my style since this

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.250 
that's generally in my style since this
one<00:03:44.650> was<00:03:44.859> sweet<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.489> not<00:03:45.760> very<00:03:46.090> strong<00:03:46.510> but<00:03:47.049> I

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
one was sweet and not very strong but I

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.869 
one was sweet and not very strong but I
guess<00:03:47.709> that's<00:03:47.889> a<00:03:47.980> good<00:03:48.010> thing<00:03:48.190> if<00:03:48.459> it's<00:03:48.669> not

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
guess that's a good thing if it's not

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.030 
guess that's a good thing if it's not
one<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.269> I<00:03:49.329> normally<00:03:49.780> go<00:03:49.930> for<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.739> still

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
one that I normally go for and I still

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.099 
one that I normally go for and I still
like<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.430> flavor<00:03:51.700> overall<00:03:52.269> I<00:03:52.480> think<00:03:52.840> that

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
like the flavor overall I think that

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.140 
like the flavor overall I think that
means<00:03:53.319> it's<00:03:53.500> probably<00:03:53.889> a<00:03:54.129> pretty<00:03:54.549> good<00:03:54.760> one<00:03:54.910> so

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
means it's probably a pretty good one so

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.809 
means it's probably a pretty good one so
I've<00:03:55.750> seen<00:03:55.989> these<00:03:56.139> Arizona<00:03:56.650> iced<00:03:57.069> teas<00:03:57.459> in<00:03:57.760> the

I've seen these Arizona iced teas in the

I've seen these Arizona iced teas in the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
stores before never got them before but

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.499 
stores before never got them before but
now<00:04:00.280> that<00:04:00.459> I've<00:04:00.549> had<00:04:00.699> this<00:04:00.880> one<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.299> I<00:04:01.359> thought

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:01.509 
now that I've had this one and I thought

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.820 
now that I've had this one and I thought
it<00:04:01.630> was

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
it was

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.470 
it was
pretty<00:04:01.950> good<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.370> think<00:04:02.520> I'll<00:04:02.790> probably<00:04:02.940> go<00:04:03.270> and

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
pretty good I think I'll probably go and

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.720 
pretty good I think I'll probably go and
try<00:04:03.780> some<00:04:03.990> other<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:05.010> can<00:04:05.040> expect<00:04:05.490> to<00:04:05.580> see

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
try some other so you can expect to see

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.520 
try some other so you can expect to see
some<00:04:05.760> other<00:04:06.000> videos<00:04:06.120> on<00:04:06.600> Arizona<00:04:07.080> iced<00:04:07.290> teas

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
some other videos on Arizona iced teas

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.010 
some other videos on Arizona iced teas
for<00:04:07.770> me<00:04:07.920> in<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.370> near<00:04:08.520> future<00:04:08.840> anyway<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:09.990> I

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
for me in the near future anyway so I

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.260 
for me in the near future anyway so I
think<00:04:10.140> if<00:04:10.470> you're<00:04:10.920> someone<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.340> likes<00:04:11.610> sweet

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
think if you're someone that likes sweet

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.720 
think if you're someone that likes sweet
teas<00:04:12.510> give<00:04:13.350> this<00:04:13.470> one<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.680> shot<00:04:13.740> I<00:04:14.250> think<00:04:14.580> it's

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
teas give this one a shot I think it's

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.610 
teas give this one a shot I think it's
as<00:04:15.000> good<00:04:15.240> as<00:04:15.510> any<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.780> I've<00:04:16.019> had<00:04:16.200> out<00:04:16.380> there

as good as any that I've had out there

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.410 
as good as any that I've had out there
