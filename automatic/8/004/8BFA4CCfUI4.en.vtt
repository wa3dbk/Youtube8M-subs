00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.049
 2 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.969
 remember 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.480
 My name is Shulyak 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.660
 i am in active lab 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.760
 saving the remnants of humanity from 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.730
 total extinction 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.980
 some are developed here 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.980
 virus turns people into zombies 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.830
 a huge area around the facility was 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.960
 infected 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.710
 through those who got into this zone 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.390
 turned all resentment 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.150
 I found the answer 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.160
 if you can hear me before the transfer and perhaps 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.710
 unfortunately the connection was interrupted julius not 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.159
 managed to finish my heartbreaking 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.960
 an unbelievable story about a city appeared 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.460
 turned into a monastery of evil sorry 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.780
 half-dead driver 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.260
 but nothing terrible 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.270
 happened we still saw similar 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.470
 a thousand times 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.710
 cause numerous 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.789
 examples we will not 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.209
 we mention only another project of the studio of the Sejm 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:34.430
 gorgeous reality jokes 2 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.920
 how not to remember the last game when 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.520
 second track to get rid of the season 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.060
 is a full tracing paper with 1 3100 arcade 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.040
 same engine they are the same models 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.869
 resuscitation and old principles and findings 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.189
 posters and it looks like everything was happening 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.580
 in the same place 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.360
 it should be noted the developers were not 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.020
 original in their act 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.570
 the first zombie jesters were also a blueprint 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.610
 cattle from April 1st institute 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.770
 understandably the seim wants to repeat its 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.900
 success with a minimum of effort 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.380
 it's unclear just why persist if 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.420
 once it is initially wrong 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.849
 the idea has already failed 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.400
 the long history of Russia seems to be clearly 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.120
 proves that our loved ones 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.930
 national placement will come 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.269
 twice on one rake leads to nothing 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.059
 good 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:20.619
 which is even less excusable 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.809
 poor quality clown copy 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.269
 developers have some 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.199
 flawed 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.199
 valence tour 2 was an interesting role-playing 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.990
 system 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.770
 could really 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.940
 think about what kind of ability 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.070
 character is worth developing how 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.789
 use weapons 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:36.499
 here the author believed meters 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.499
 there were only memories 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.540
 we have eight heroes 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.549
 four guys four girls 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.150
 everyone seems to have their own characteristics 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.979
 features starting gear 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.039
 but after several levels it becomes 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:52.989
 it is clear that the differences are nominal 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.389
 one of them is bigger business 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:57.389
 this was a direct consequence 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.559
 simplified pumping system 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.439
 for each revealed one point is given 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.219
 which can be spent on the second 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.719
 location strength and speed accuracy intelligence 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:06.720
 self treatment 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.240
 and some strange ability under 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.589
 name money 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.700
 accuracy will bring the most benefit 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.950
 she will not only allow not 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.980
 miss but still increase the football 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.119
 weapon forces 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.139
 whether weak or powerful 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.919
 ion gun 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:21.589
 other characteristics 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:23.690
 you should not pump as much as possible 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.030
 in extreme cases, you can buy 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.090
 implant bridge 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.930
 the result of this approach is logical 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.150
 after a couple of hours all the characters become 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.559
 the same 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:33.909
 that is another thing if they are good there 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.479
 cannon and durable battle 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.529
 we like somewhere in the middle of the plot 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.019
 picked up homing 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.129
 manual launcher this lap 500 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.550
 passengers 5 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.220
 and the snows of the end have gone well and what 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.770
 gun powerful rate of fire 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.190
 normal defeat area poland 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.670
 You can stupidly set the left button more and 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.530
 focus on building up 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.480
 bye balance our hero is invincible heat 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.480
 magata 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.779
 the second zones without joking does not save even 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.719
 the atmosphere of the post apocalypse and 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.369
 the opportunity to ride on the tanks 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:10.979
 and other transport 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:13.139
 the gameplay is very annoying 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.519
 feeling of deja vu and generally just like that 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.659
 turns out to be stronger than any positive 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.749
 impulses semblance of interest problems 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:21.719
 merging only at the end when to perform 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.650
 jobs in the city and laboratories 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.309
 but this is only part of the game 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:27.649
 unfortunately the Yenisei team would not reveal 

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:30.309
 all my potential hope from a third or 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:32.099
 a stroke can make us 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.599
 smile and subject probes on occasion 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.599
 exploit roller and shaft 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.949
 goalkeeper
