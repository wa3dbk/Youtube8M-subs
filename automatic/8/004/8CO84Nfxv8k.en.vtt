00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.049
 as an aromatic fragrance everything comes from what makes the outer skin India and 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.960
 Pakistan to us 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.360
 31 products of this particularly expensive rice variety has the Stiftung Warentest 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.249
 scrutinized 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:14.660
 the big disappointment 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.150
 16 products were poor 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.480
 1 very bad result because that means 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.880
 more than half of the products failed 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.080
 five products 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.119
 did not contain too many strangers, two of them, no what do you mean 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.409
 that was Penny Maccari like that 

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:35.430
 and the cook Volker Ratzmann speech 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.220
 such a thing is consumer deception and the pack would not have so 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.060
 may be sold 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.470
 Some white samples need or tasted rancid musty or after 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.700
 Jutesack 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.550
 there were deductions in the rating 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.040
 the tasting also paid attention to the consistency 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.950
 sticky 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.450
 clumped or to Koch 30 led to a poorer grade 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.820
 also after pollutants in the rice was searched 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.560
 Residues of pesticides were the same in several products 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.000
 but also found traces of mold toxins 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.350
 On such forces we examined and looked for products with halves 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.399
 detected 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.560
 that as a testimony they would not have been able to trade that was 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.099
 Jenny McCarthy like that and the other one was a perfect Biro do not tear him 

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:26.870
 remained 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.420
 consistently poor grades also got the three pre-cooked Marais products in the 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.660
 test 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.900
 All three products were basmati atypical and we have them with us 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.540
 poorly rated 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.570
 the advantage of a quick preparation by two minutes in the microwave 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.570
 So completely destroyed by the quality 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.090
 only seven products received a "good" 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.320
 short winner and only rice with a very good sensory test times 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.740
 the basmati rice Filder 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.770
