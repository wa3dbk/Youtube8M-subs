see my Reds I was going around in a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.310 
see my Reds I was going around in a
counterclockwise<00:01:53.039> way<00:01:53.759> which<00:01:54.600> waist<00:01:55.140> is

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
counterclockwise way which waist is

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.980 
counterclockwise way which waist is
dropping<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.799> left<00:01:56.299> with<00:01:57.299> my<00:01:57.450> greens<00:01:57.719> are

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
dropping on the left with my greens are

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.599 
dropping on the left with my greens are
they're<00:01:58.499> doing<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.890> opposite<00:01:59.399> they're

right<00:02:36.470> here<00:02:36.770> where<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:36.980> stud<00:02:37.490> or<00:02:37.790> where<00:02:38.300> that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
right here where that stud or where that

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.860 
right here where that stud or where that
wall<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:40.820> can<00:02:41.120> just<00:02:41.360> go<00:02:41.570> ahead<00:02:41.690> and

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
wall is so you can just go ahead and

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.720 
wall is so you can just go ahead and
work<00:02:42.820> one<00:02:43.820> way<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:45.230> where<00:02:45.410> your<00:02:46.310> right<00:02:46.460> hand

work one way to where your right hand

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.290 
work one way to where your right hand
snips<00:02:47.890> are<00:02:48.890> getting<00:02:49.310> close<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:50.000> where<00:02:50.090> that

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
snips are getting close to where that

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.050 
snips are getting close to where that
wall<00:02:50.540> is<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.320> say<00:02:51.770> it's<00:02:51.890> boom<00:02:52.070> that's<00:02:52.370> really

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
wall is and say it's boom that's really

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.840 
wall is and say it's boom that's really
where<00:02:53.240> I<00:02:53.270> have<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.660> stop<00:02:53.930> right<00:02:54.490> I'm<00:02:55.490> gonna<00:02:55.670> be

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
where I have to stop right I'm gonna be

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.050 
where I have to stop right I'm gonna be
hitting<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.180> wall<00:02:56.390> if<00:02:57.320> they're<00:02:57.590> over<00:02:57.710> there<00:02:58.060> so

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
hitting a wall if they're over there so

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.610 
hitting a wall if they're over there so
take<00:02:59.840> my<00:02:59.990> greens<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:02.170> come<00:03:03.170> back<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.590> other

way
I<00:03:04.280> got<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.120> nice<00:03:05.420> line<00:03:05.840> to<00:03:06.230> go<00:03:06.830> body<00:03:07.160> nice

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
I got a nice line to go body nice

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.000 
I got a nice line to go body nice
guidance<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.840> I'm<00:03:09.080> gonna<00:03:09.200> just<00:03:09.470> come<00:03:09.680> back<00:03:09.800> the

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
other way and I'm gonna use my snips to

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.740 
other way and I'm gonna use my snips to
go<00:03:14.240> ahead<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:15.140> finish<00:03:15.440> out<00:03:15.770> with<00:03:16.070> a<00:03:16.160> cut<00:03:16.750> here

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
go ahead and finish out with a cut here

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.570 
go ahead and finish out with a cut here
right<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.620> end<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:21.590> don't<00:03:21.770> want<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:22.010> do<00:03:22.250> a

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
right to the end you don't want to do a

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.720 
right to the end you don't want to do a
couple<00:03:23.570> things<00:03:23.600> what<00:03:24.080> I<00:03:24.110> just<00:03:24.410> did<00:03:24.740> really<00:03:25.250> and

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
couple things what I just did really and

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.400 
couple things what I just did really and
that's<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:26.090> come<00:03:26.360> down<00:03:26.720> all<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.080> way<00:03:27.200> in<00:03:27.260> your

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
that's to come down all the way in your

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.360 
that's to come down all the way in your
snips<00:03:27.740> that<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:29.030> leaves<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.780> burr<00:03:30.440> on<00:03:30.830> the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
snips that that leaves a burr on the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.790 
snips that that leaves a burr on the
edge<00:03:31.520> of<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.820> metal<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.660> really<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:34.160> toxic

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
edge of the metal that really is toxic

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.949 
edge of the metal that really is toxic
by<00:03:36.800> toxic<00:03:37.340> I<00:03:37.459> mean<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:38.120> will<00:03:38.330> end<00:03:38.690> up

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
by toxic I mean that you will end up

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.380 
by toxic I mean that you will end up
running<00:03:39.680> your<00:03:40.010> finger<00:03:40.370> around<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.820> edge<00:03:41.030> when

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
running your finger around the edge when

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.660 
running your finger around the edge when
you're<00:03:41.480> putting<00:03:41.720> in<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.050> collar<00:03:42.290> or

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
you're putting in the collar or

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.530 
you're putting in the collar or
something<00:03:43.670> like<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.239> you'll<00:03:44.360> catch

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
something like that and you'll catch

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.720 
something like that and you'll catch
your<00:03:44.720> finger<00:03:45.019> on<00:03:45.050> that<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:46.010> fishhook<00:03:46.489> and

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
your finger on that that fishhook and

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.210 
your finger on that that fishhook and
then<00:03:46.959> it's<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:48.080> stinger<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:48.680> hurts<00:03:48.920> worse<00:03:49.160> than

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
then it's a stinger it hurts worse than

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.390 
then it's a stinger it hurts worse than
the<00:03:49.610> big<00:03:49.790> cuts<00:03:50.120> really<00:03:50.920> so<00:03:51.920> I'm<00:03:52.070> gonna<00:03:52.190> go

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
the big cuts really so I'm gonna go

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.120 
the big cuts really so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:52.489> and<00:03:52.610> finish<00:03:52.820> out<00:03:53.120> here<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:54.130> that's

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
ahead and finish out here and that's

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.190 
ahead and finish out here and that's
pretty<00:03:55.340> much<00:03:55.459> how<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:55.790> do<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.209> you<00:03:56.360> just<00:03:56.390> keep

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
pretty much how you do it you just keep

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.960 
pretty much how you do it you just keep
running<00:03:57.680> your<00:03:57.769> snips<00:03:58.100> make<00:03:58.370> sure<00:03:58.519> your<00:03:58.700> drops

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
running your snips make sure your drops

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.940 
running your snips make sure your drops
dropping<00:03:59.510> off<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.810> this<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.380> correct<00:04:00.680> side

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
dropping off to this the correct side

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.810 
dropping off to this the correct side
and<00:04:01.640> you'll<00:04:02.540> have<00:04:02.720> yourself<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.530> nice<00:04:04.100> round

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
and you'll have yourself a nice round

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.160 
and you'll have yourself a nice round
hole<00:04:05.470> in<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.680> piece<00:04:06.890> of<00:04:06.950> rectangular<00:04:07.580> or<00:04:08.170> piece

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
hole in a piece of rectangular or piece
