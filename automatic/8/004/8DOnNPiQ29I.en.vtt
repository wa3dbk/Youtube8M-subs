00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
extra sensors also got a color sensor as

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.410 
extra sensors also got a color sensor as

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
well as that infrared sensor that laser

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.569 
well as that infrared sensor that laser
sensor<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.890> built<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.369> there

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
