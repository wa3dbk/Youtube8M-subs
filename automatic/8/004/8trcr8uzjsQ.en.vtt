 week he's playing here singing 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.020

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.150

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.430
 always let me dream and then 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.150

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.150

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:07.399
 so the love of your life would not have 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.930
 to go back to last another day 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:15.350
 in your dreams every day not only the color 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:21.530
 from heaven I would not like 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:24.950
 I mean I'm in love but I do not understand 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.850
 courage stopped me from trembling when I'm a 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.850
 your side 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.859
 that all words are in shadows 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.859
 that with the look I can talk to you 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.590
 you dream 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.230
 that I have the courage to say hello how 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.230
 these 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:16.900
 if there is something more than a stranger in some 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:22.530
 occasion unwittingly leafless where your 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.530
 dreams I would change only the color 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.560
 I would like 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.980
 that is to say he told me I am in love 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.570
 but I 'm not that big 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.570
 when I'm bent 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.520
 I can see you with my eyes 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.520

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.239

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.340
 I have the courage 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.180
 and now 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.680

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.680
