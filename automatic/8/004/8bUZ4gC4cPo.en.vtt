00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.850
 good morning, diverse people, we are here 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.590
 on youtube with you see now the micro and 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.809
 I bring you the presentation of a new 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.410
 champion called town amorphous 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.580
 company as you see here on my right 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.410
 I have the gentleman on the side who is going to 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.989
 collaborate with us in this video and 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.310
 is going to be my sparring boxing 

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:22.470
 to test all the skills and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.749
 basic attacks of this champion so 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.880
 like all the videos we put a little bit 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:29.359
 of zoom and we start with control 1 of 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.359
 this champion 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.130
 control 1 what it does is that it sucks 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.410
 a little bit of air and it becomes a 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.910
 balloon as you already know that you can 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.750
 warping can do what you want and 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.090
 It can be a balloon and take control 2 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.090
 pull a little bit of muscle out there 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.559
 it looks like machine whose flager I think 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.930
 it's a combination of the two because 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.880
 pigtail has ma jin and color 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.490
 key green 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.250
 and control 3 is looking dancing is 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.930
 all crazy the bug improvising because 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.560
 I think this is not choreography or 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.480
 nothing so we 've already seen the 3 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.970
 dance skills of 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.140
 presentation and everything and let's move on with 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.510
 the basic attacks 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.630
 the boxing sporting is prepared and 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.520
 to punch is basically my kick ni 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.730
 milk only punches and here goes the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.730
 lifetime 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.390
 we see that on the side is unruly not 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.960
 put the still 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.630
 then the passive of this champion 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.390
 It divides into two parts a part 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.369
 I teach right now is that if I hit 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.740
 a child not a champion with any of 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.530
 my skills as you see now 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.939
 a bit of me is going to come out and I'm going to 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.460
 I can take that little bit and I'm going to 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.369
 recover life the total of life 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.070
 recovered is 4% of my maximum life 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.240
 santis and I have 100 of life or was 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.530
 recover 4 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.200
 if I have 1000 of life recover the 40 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.760
 then the second part that we're going to 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.780
 ask now sir of what kills us 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.000
 so that we see it is that when they die they go to 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.119
 come out four particles and if not 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.690
 you kill before all of them come together 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.010
 I revive that is to say they are reliving ay 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.379
 will have a little bit of life 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.030
 let's see how it is like ma jin wook and 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.870
 We are going to ask the law to give us a 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.799
 gypsy beating 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.799
 so go ahead 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.310
 you 'll see how the four are cool 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.310
 particles that returns 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.939
 and look are reaching the body and a 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.920
 once they reach the body 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.489
 I will revive if it kills all the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.920
 particles do not revive but when leaving me 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.299
 all by letting put particles in 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.159
 recovered some percent of the 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.189
 life how many more particles reach my 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.349
 body more life I will have is like the passive 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.950
 of nibia and you have five minutes of 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:57.260
 colton as we see here 274 seconds 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.129
 before starting to apply all the 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.410
 skills of this hero this champion 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:06.920
 I have to say that they all forget 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.690
 to say is like doctor world no way 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.420
 na is because he does not have mana anymore 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.000
 champion does not have energy but spends 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.960
 life without using your skills as mor 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.530
 of world those champions 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.450
 then the skin 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.400
 what he's going to do is punch 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.620
 forward and all the enemies 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.990
 that you catch in your range of the arrow them 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.760
 will hit not only will hit the 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.310
 first but it's going to hit everyone to 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.410
 all those who are behind and as we see 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:41.430
 loses 6% of maximum life and hits 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.430
 230 in rank 5 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.370
 you see if we lack the piece we take it and 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.260
 we recover life apart from the damage this 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.690
 what cause is going to slow down the enemies 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.370
 so now it will hit sideways let's 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.690
 see how when you move it will go a lot 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.530
 slower 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.040
 good 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.020
 facebook so this champion to do 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.020
 two with the will come pretty good 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.900
 now let's go on to explain the skill w 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.269
 what he's going to do is he's going to make a 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.920
 mini explosion as you see and it's going to hit 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.970
 to all the enemies that is in the 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.030
 Circle range 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.650
 will cause magical damage and apart from 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:28.100
 this is going to remove 6% 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.720
 in rank 5 of the maximum life of the rival 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.880
 more what you raise the power of skill 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.100
 it's going to cost 4% of our current life 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.110
 and as we see 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.760
 and it's going to take away a lot of life and if the 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.510
 enemy is a tank because it will take away 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.460
 much more life 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.880
 and is releasing the particles like all 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.880
 the abilities 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:55.129
 now let's go on to explain his skill in 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.499
 scale for me is the funniest of 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:00.639
 all they have and the one that better goes to 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:02.960
 go if you go to a jungle because as we see 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.770
 of the water advance a little but that 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.270
 do not hit the tower I will give a jumbo 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.000
 in the first castell I'm going to have to 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.190
 get energy for then after 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.990
 of a second jump to my enemy is 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.130
 say he has given me for the first time the 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.800
 charge and when I release it apart from 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.229
 study half a second 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.360
 then I will jump to where I say in a 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.599
 circle in that circle I will produce 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.340
 magic damage this champion as you see it 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.069
 moves with magic damage all the 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.190
 climbing skills in ap for 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:40.020
 bankers to escape and to jump 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.740
 walls also serves this skill as 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.229
 we see here is the inhibitor 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.490
 and I will get to jump with stability 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.490
 because you get an egg 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.510
 ok now let's explain the skill 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.220
 r is to say the ultimate 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.800
 the ultimate what will cause are 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.600
 jumps in round and to all the enemies 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.210
 that are in the range of the circle that 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.660
 you see here is going to produce magical damage 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:09.540
 will study them for a second and 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.760
 will slow them down by 20% during another 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.150
 second 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.070
 and hit several enemies at the same time 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.420
 will produce half of the damage of this 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.560
 skill will not be studied but 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.509
 realized 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.030
 will gain an acceleration that is to say an 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:29.250
 Movement speed between 20 and a 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:33.000
 50 percent while stability of 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.349
 is active we will move to put a 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.629
 little bit of side damage that we see 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:38.629
 here that is idle so go for it 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.870
 we see that we hurt him we have 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.940
 studied and we made it 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.130
 we have caused a lot of damage with a 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:52.530
 skill and I remind you that this hits 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.530
 mass is a skill without an area 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.710
 good nothing but to tell you if you do not 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.930
 last is that this champion is going to be a 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.930
 good top is going to be a good jungle 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:06.770
 thanks to this skill 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:10.610
 and what scale all the skills in ap 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:12.650
 that they can relive that they can recover 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.080
 lives thanks to your passive also as 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:18.289
 we see here picking up the little pieces like this 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.370
 we said goodbye and see you soon 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:21.370
 see you
