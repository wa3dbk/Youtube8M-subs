in survival horror games the need to
explore<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> areas<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.890> pretty<00:00:47.070> vital<00:00:47.250> but

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
explore the areas is pretty vital but

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
explore the areas is pretty vital but
it's<00:00:47.640> very<00:00:47.789> very<00:00:48.120> dangerous<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
it's very very dangerous to do so and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.180 
it's very very dangerous to do so and
the<00:00:49.350> way<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.649> game<00:00:49.829> handles<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the way that this game handles the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.529 
the way that this game handles the
element<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.520> taking<00:00:50.820> risk<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.239> pretty<00:00:51.420> damn

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
element of taking risk is pretty damn

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.549 
element of taking risk is pretty damn
solid<00:00:51.719> especially<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> fact<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
solid especially for the fact that

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.630 
solid especially for the fact that
zombies<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.039> appear<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.489> most

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
zombies can appear in the most

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.220 
zombies can appear in the most
unpredictable<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.329> unexpected<00:00:54.809> places<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
unpredictable and unexpected places I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.450 
unpredictable and unexpected places I
also<00:00:55.379> love<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> implementation<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> Wii

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
also love the implementation of the Wii
U<00:00:56.579> gamepad<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.059> way<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.449> to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
U gamepad and the way that you have to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.360 
U gamepad and the way that you have to
use<00:00:57.690> as<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> backpack<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.590> real<00:00:58.800> time<00:00:59.129> during

use as a backpack in real time during
the<00:00:59.550> game<00:00:59.730> which<00:00:59.940> increases<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the game which increases the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.760 
the game which increases the
unpredictability<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.170> tension<00:01:01.500> even

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
unpredictability and tension even

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.139 
unpredictability and tension even
further<00:01:01.949> much<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.430> all<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.699> 90s<00:01:03.030> classic
