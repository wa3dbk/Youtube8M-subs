especially<00:00:49.829> because<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.399> many<00:00:50.520> people<00:00:51.020> expect

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
especially because so many people expect

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.290 
especially because so many people expect
a<00:00:52.170> storyline<00:00:52.530> that's<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.129> no<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:54.030> not

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
a storyline that's like no it's not

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
a storyline that's like no it's not
magic<00:00:54.719> its<00:00:54.960> science<00:00:55.140> when<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.039> know<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.430> sure

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
magic its science when we know for sure

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.889 
magic its science when we know for sure
that<00:00:56.640> magic<00:00:57.270> does<00:00:57.960> exist<00:00:58.010> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.190> DC<00:00:59.430> Universe

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
that magic does exist in the DC Universe

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.119 
that magic does exist in the DC Universe
so<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> storyline<00:01:01.320> like<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.829> we're<00:01:02.039> just

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
so a storyline like that we're just

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.789 
so a storyline like that we're just
gonna<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.520> pointless<00:01:03.379> next<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.500> go<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.650> the
