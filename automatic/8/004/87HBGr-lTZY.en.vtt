00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
comparison on my lips and like I said my

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.030 
comparison on my lips and like I said my
lips<00:03:29.660> are<00:03:29.810> pretty<00:03:30.019> pigmented<00:03:30.349> so<00:03:30.830> they're

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
lips are pretty pigmented so they're

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.160 
lips are pretty pigmented so they're
always<00:03:31.299> darkening<00:03:32.299> out<00:03:32.480> whatever<00:03:32.720> shade<00:03:33.019> I

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
always darkening out whatever shade I

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.050 
always darkening out whatever shade I
put<00:03:33.349> on<00:03:33.910> yeah<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.120> is<00:03:35.239> so<00:03:35.540> glossy<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:37.060> so

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
put on yeah it is so glossy and so

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.670 
put on yeah it is so glossy and so
smooth<00:03:38.329> and<00:03:38.510> these<00:03:38.720> lasts<00:03:39.140> for<00:03:39.260> quite<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.440> long

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
smooth and these lasts for quite a long

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.190 
smooth and these lasts for quite a long
time<00:03:39.860> they<00:03:40.370> are<00:03:40.489> called<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.849> lip<00:03:41.030> tint<00:03:41.540> so<00:03:42.170> I

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
time they are called a lip tint so I

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.660 
time they are called a lip tint so I
find<00:03:42.680> that<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:44.680> moisture<00:03:45.680> kind<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.400> goes<00:03:46.519> away

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
find that the moisture kind of goes away

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.970 
find that the moisture kind of goes away
after<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.150> little<00:03:47.450> bit<00:03:47.660> of<00:03:47.720> time<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.319> they're

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
after a little bit of time and they're

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.860 
after a little bit of time and they're
you<00:03:49.250> more<00:03:49.489> just<00:03:49.790> get<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.030> color<00:03:50.239> and<00:03:50.629> there's

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
you more just get the color and there's

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.750 
you more just get the color and there's
not<00:03:50.989> a<00:03:51.049> lot<00:03:51.230> of<00:03:51.260> color<00:03:51.500> transfer<00:03:52.069> I<00:03:52.099> find<00:03:52.400> so
