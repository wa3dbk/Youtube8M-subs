00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.230 

this<00:00:12.680> is<00:00:12.889> the<00:00:13.010> first<00:00:13.250> unboxing<00:00:13.670> I've<00:00:14.030> ever

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
this is the first unboxing I've ever

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:23.859 
this is the first unboxing I've ever
done<00:00:15.160> so<00:00:16.160> I'll<00:00:16.340> see<00:00:16.580> what<00:00:16.760> I<00:00:16.820> can<00:00:16.910> do<00:00:17.300> here<00:00:22.869> so

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
done so I'll see what I can do here so

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:33.090 
done so I'll see what I can do here so
this<00:00:24.050> is<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.380> way<00:00:24.500> it<00:00:24.619> came<00:00:24.830> from<00:00:25.130> fedex

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.240 

ok<00:00:34.100> that's<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:34.520> computer

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.160 

that's<00:00:39.250> probably<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.760> power<00:00:40.030> maybe<00:00:40.990> the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
that's probably the power maybe the

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.150 
that's probably the power maybe the
mouse<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:44.430> I'm<00:00:45.430> sure<00:00:45.700> this<00:00:45.940> is<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.150> keyboard

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
mouse and I'm sure this is the keyboard

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.800 
mouse and I'm sure this is the keyboard
so<00:00:48.160> keyboard<00:00:48.730> is<00:00:48.880> not<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.270> biggest<00:00:49.570> thing

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
so keyboard is not the biggest thing

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:58.740 
so keyboard is not the biggest thing
here<00:00:54.030> okay<00:00:55.030> I'm<00:00:55.090> taking<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:58.090> sign<00:00:58.330> off<00:00:58.540> the

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
here okay I'm taking to sign off the

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.049 
here okay I'm taking to sign off the
computer<00:00:59.520> pulling<00:01:00.520> it<00:01:00.640> out<00:01:00.730> of<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:00.880> bag<00:01:01.120> so

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
computer pulling it out of the bag so

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.440 
computer pulling it out of the bag so
that<00:01:05.370> is<00:01:06.370> the<00:01:06.640> computer

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.300 

it<00:01:11.899> doesn't<00:01:12.259> look<00:01:12.289> like<00:01:12.530> much<00:01:12.829> but

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
it doesn't look like much but

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.880 
it doesn't look like much but
and<00:01:14.579> it<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:17.930> it's<00:01:18.930> got<00:01:19.170> two<00:01:19.350> gigabytes

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
and it is so on it's got two gigabytes

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.140 
and it is so on it's got two gigabytes
of<00:01:20.189> RAM

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:32.650 

and<00:01:24.100> 32<00:01:25.360> gigabytes<00:01:26.360> of<00:01:28.930> hard<00:01:29.930> a<00:01:31.420> solid<00:01:32.420> state

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
and 32 gigabytes of hard a solid state

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:42.850 
and 32 gigabytes of hard a solid state
hard<00:01:32.870> drive<00:01:36.820> it's<00:01:37.820> got<00:01:37.970> full<00:01:38.270> USB<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:42.620> yours

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
hard drive it's got full USB to yours

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.370 
hard drive it's got full USB to yours
fees<00:01:43.130> in<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.340> bag<00:01:43.610> I<00:01:43.990> think<00:01:44.990> they're<00:01:45.170> three

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
fees in the bag I think they're three

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.720 
fees in the bag I think they're three
point<00:01:45.650> 0<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.520> two<00:01:47.300> in<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.450> front<00:01:48.340> SS<00:01:49.340> i<00:01:49.520> think

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
point 0 and two in the front SS i think

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.860 
point 0 and two in the front SS i think
that's<00:01:49.940> that's<00:01:50.060> which<00:01:50.330> superseded

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.050 

it's<00:01:57.290> got<00:01:57.470> hdmi<00:01:58.040> and<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.510> displaced<00:02:00.340> sport<00:02:01.340> to

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
it's got hdmi and a displaced sport to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.930 
it's got hdmi and a displaced sport to
slice<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.750> display<00:02:03.110> board<00:02:03.970> I've<00:02:04.970> seen<00:02:05.270> it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
slice the display board I've seen it

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.490 
slice the display board I've seen it
driving<00:02:07.940> two<00:02:08.150> monitors<00:02:08.479> at<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:08.869> time<00:02:09.110> but<00:02:09.380> I

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
driving two monitors at a time but I

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.250 
driving two monitors at a time but I
think<00:02:10.090> one<00:02:11.090> monitor<00:02:11.570> is<00:02:11.630> probably<00:02:11.930> all<00:02:12.110> I'll

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
think one monitor is probably all I'll

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.840 
think one monitor is probably all I'll
ever<00:02:12.530> be<00:02:12.800> using<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.370> for

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.750 

and<00:02:20.850> here's<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.720> little<00:02:21.810> card<00:02:22.230> or<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.500> bumbler<00:02:22.860> on

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
and here's a little card or a bumbler on

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:43.180 
and here's a little card or a bumbler on
the<00:02:24.420> side<00:02:24.660> here

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.880 

pallets<00:02:44.190> pretty<00:02:44.430> much<00:02:44.550> like<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.890> laptop

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
pallets pretty much like it I laptop

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:55.970 
pallets pretty much like it I laptop
power<00:02:47.160> spa<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:51.290> mouse<00:02:54.650> there's<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.740> wire

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
power spa and a mouse there's a wire

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.559 
power spa and a mouse there's a wire
mouse

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.800 

you

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.680 

the<00:03:09.020> keyboard<00:03:09.319> is<00:03:09.680> also<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.069> USB<00:03:10.670> keyboard<00:03:11.180> I

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.479 

think<00:03:14.690> with<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.870> higher<00:03:15.080> end<00:03:15.440> versions<00:03:15.920> an<00:03:16.160> HP

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
think with a higher end versions an HP

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:23.670 
think with a higher end versions an HP
does<00:03:16.670> make<00:03:17.260> some<00:03:18.260> more<00:03:18.410> expensive<00:03:19.010> version<00:03:19.989> it

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.670 

you<00:03:24.159> can<00:03:24.370> actually<00:03:24.640> get<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.790> wireless<00:03:25.060> our

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
you can actually get a wireless our

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:37.460 
you can actually get a wireless our
bluetooth<00:03:26.680> mouse<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.870> keyboard

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.479 

yeah<00:03:38.010> full-size<00:03:38.520> keyboard

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.890 

and<00:03:43.489> I<00:03:43.580> should<00:03:43.849> have<00:03:43.940> cited<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.629> reason

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
and I should have cited the reason

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.170 
and I should have cited the reason
probably<00:03:45.080> this<00:03:45.319> is<00:03:45.379> points<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:46.310> fast<00:03:46.550> is<00:03:46.879> it's

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
probably this is points of fast is it's

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.940 
probably this is points of fast is it's
for<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.450> hundred<00:03:47.810> one<00:03:48.500> hundred<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.860> eighty

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
for a hundred one hundred and eighty

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.869 
for a hundred one hundred and eighty
dollars<00:03:49.750> this<00:03:50.750> is<00:03:50.900> my<00:03:51.519> probably<00:03:52.519> not<00:03:52.640> good<00:03:52.849> for

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
dollars this is my probably not good for

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.339 
dollars this is my probably not good for
a<00:03:53.120> first<00:03:53.569> computer<00:03:54.080> but<00:03:54.290> for<00:03:54.470> second<00:03:54.830> computer

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
a first computer but for second computer

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.850 
a first computer but for second computer
I'm<00:03:57.349> hoping<00:03:57.709> it's<00:03:57.950> going<00:03:58.099> to<00:03:58.190> be<00:03:58.280> at<00:03:59.709> just<00:04:00.709> what

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
I'm hoping it's going to be at just what

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.220 
I'm hoping it's going to be at just what
we<00:04:00.980> need<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:01.880> for<00:04:02.840> one<00:04:02.930> hundred<00:04:03.170> eighty

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
we need and for one hundred eighty

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.030 
we need and for one hundred eighty
dollars<00:04:03.709> it's<00:04:03.920> hard<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:05.650> hard<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.830> get<00:04:06.950> it

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
dollars it's hard to hard to get it

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:24.850 
dollars it's hard to hard to get it
wrong

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.270 

so<00:04:25.860> those<00:04:26.070> are<00:04:26.190> all<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.760> pieces<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:28.070> get<00:04:29.070> win

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
so those are all the pieces that get win

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.720 
so those are all the pieces that get win
the<00:04:29.400> box<00:04:30.710> all<00:04:31.710> we<00:04:31.860> have<00:04:31.980> to<00:04:32.010> do<00:04:32.160> now<00:04:32.340> is<00:04:32.370> start

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
the box all we have to do now is start

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.440 
the box all we have to do now is start
plugging<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.720> up<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:35.400> way<00:04:35.670> let's<00:04:35.940> turn<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.300> on

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
plugging it up the way let's turn it on

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:45.420 
plugging it up the way let's turn it on
see<00:04:36.750> what<00:04:36.780> happens<00:04:37.350> here

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.920 

Stevie

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.860 

i'm<00:04:50.590> using<00:04:50.740> uh
