be pretty much only cosmetic or only
aesthetic<00:00:58.530> which<00:00:59.309> leads<00:00:59.789> me<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.000> believe<00:01:00.120> that

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
aesthetic which leads me to believe that

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.270 
aesthetic which leads me to believe that
it's<00:01:01.109> not<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> bad<00:01:01.890> thing<00:01:01.920> at<00:01:02.190> all

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
it's not going to be a bad thing at all

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.680 
it's not going to be a bad thing at all
it's<00:01:02.489> actually<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.969> benefit<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it's actually going to benefit the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.090 
it's actually going to benefit the
production<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> game<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:05.010> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
production of the game it's going to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740 
production of the game it's going to
allow<00:01:05.189> them<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.610> more<00:01:05.820> funds<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.479> make

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
allow them to have more funds to make

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.450 
allow them to have more funds to make
more<00:01:06.960> expansions<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:08.340> just

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
more expansions and I think it will just

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.420 
more expansions and I think it will just
be<00:01:08.549> good<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.360> general<00:01:09.540> oh<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.799> there<00:01:11.040> won't<00:01:11.280> be

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
warcraft I mean it was definitely a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.710 
warcraft I mean it was definitely a
world<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.010> warcraft<00:02:17.370> clone<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> problem

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
world of warcraft clone but the problem

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.630 
world of warcraft clone but the problem
was<00:02:19.170> just<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.650> amount<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.950> money<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.340> had<00:02:20.490> to

in<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.740> game<00:02:22.770> where<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.210> realized<00:02:24.630> I

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
in the game where you just realized I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.990 
in the game where you just realized I
can't<00:02:25.020> do<00:02:25.500> anything<00:02:25.620> now<00:02:26.070> you<00:02:26.340> know<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.490> can't

something<00:02:29.820> in<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.210> in-game<00:02:30.540> store<00:02:30.750> what<00:02:31.380> and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
something in the in-game store what and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.110 
something in the in-game store what and
it<00:02:31.770> was<00:02:31.890> very<00:02:32.070> frustrating<00:02:32.310> for<00:02:32.670> people<00:02:32.790> that

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
it was very frustrating for people that

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.940 
it was very frustrating for people that
leveled<00:02:33.390> all<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.630> way<00:02:33.720> up<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.840> level<00:02:34.080> 45<00:02:34.680> or

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
leveled all the way up to level 45 or

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.530 
leveled all the way up to level 45 or
something<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.400> max<00:02:35.580> level<00:02:35.730> was<00:02:35.970> like<00:02:36.090> 50<00:02:36.450> at

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
something the max level was like 50 at

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.110 
something the max level was like 50 at
the<00:02:36.570> time<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.810> think<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:37.140> 65<00:02:37.620> now<00:02:37.860> but<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.970> was

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
the time I think it's 65 now but it was

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.699 
the time I think it's 65 now but it was
frustrating<00:02:39.630> for<00:02:39.750> those<00:02:39.870> people<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:40.230> got

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
frustrating for those people that got

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.130 
frustrating for those people that got
that<00:02:41.010> far<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.520> game<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.000> then<00:02:42.900> they

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
that far in the game and then they

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.660 
that far in the game and then they
realized<00:02:43.500> well<00:02:43.740> I<00:02:43.770> can't<00:02:44.160> really<00:02:44.280> do<00:02:44.490> anything

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
realized well I can't really do anything

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.840 
realized well I can't really do anything
now<00:02:44.940> because<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.690> would<00:02:45.959> have<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.260> pay<00:02:46.410> money

one<00:03:36.989> was<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.170> great<00:03:37.560> success<00:03:37.830> in<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.280> aspect<00:03:38.700> I

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
one was a great success in that aspect I

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.699 
one was a great success in that aspect I
mean<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.299> just<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:40.590> allowed<00:03:41.040> players<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:42.500> get<00:03:43.500> a

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
mean it just it allowed players to get a

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.289 
mean it just it allowed players to get a
little<00:03:43.890> bit<00:03:44.130> out<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.519> but<00:03:44.730> still<00:03:45.030> not

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
little bit out of it but still not

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.070 
little bit out of it but still not
affect<00:03:45.750> other<00:03:46.049> players<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:47.280> I<00:03:47.790> think<00:03:48.080> that's

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
affect other players and I think that's

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.100 
affect other players and I think that's
kind<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.500> what<00:03:49.620> they're<00:03:49.709> going<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.860> go<00:03:50.010> for<00:03:50.280> and

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
kind of what they're going to go for and

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.420 
kind of what they're going to go for and
with<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.350> original<00:03:52.590> guild<00:03:52.980> wars<00:03:53.160> one<00:03:53.280> being

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
with the original guild wars one being

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.920 
with the original guild wars one being
such<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:53.670> great<00:03:53.880> success<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.390> don't<00:03:54.570> see<00:03:54.720> why<00:03:54.870> the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
such a great success I don't see why the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.910 
such a great success I don't see why the
next<00:03:55.470> game<00:03:55.920> won't<00:03:56.310> be<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.489> success<00:03:56.910> right

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
next game won't be a success right

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.630 
next game won't be a success right
