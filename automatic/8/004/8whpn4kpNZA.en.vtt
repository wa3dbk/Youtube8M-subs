00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.910 
summoned quite a few copies of himself
so<00:01:39.570> I'll<00:01:39.720> definitely<00:01:40.140> get<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.650> shot<00:01:40.680> on

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
so I'll definitely get that one shot on

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.550 
so I'll definitely get that one shot on
that<00:01:41.250> first<00:01:41.520> stage<00:01:41.759> these<00:01:42.509> next<00:01:42.899> two<00:01:42.990> stages<00:01:43.439> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
that first stage these next two stages I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440 
that first stage these next two stages I
do<00:01:43.619> not<00:01:43.890> believe<00:01:44.130> can<00:01:44.340> be<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:44.700> shot<00:01:44.970> any<00:01:45.240> more

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
do not believe can be one shot any more

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.929 
do not believe can be one shot any more
so<00:01:46.049> what<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.229> would<00:01:46.350> try<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.700> push

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
so what I would try to do is just push

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.520 
so what I would try to do is just push
them<00:01:48.180> into<00:01:48.299> killing<00:01:48.570> blow<00:01:48.840> range<00:01:49.079> as<00:01:49.259> quickly

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
them into killing blow range as quickly

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.679 
them into killing blow range as quickly
as<00:01:49.770> possible<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.820> possible<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.360> push<00:01:51.509> them

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
as possible it's possible to push them

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.569 
as possible it's possible to push them
into<00:01:51.810> killing<00:01:52.140> blow<00:01:52.290> range<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.799> one<00:01:53.040> execute

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
into killing blow range with one execute

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.789 
into killing blow range with one execute
I<00:01:53.850> fail<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.570> do<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.720> here<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.710> him

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
I fail to do that here but I get him

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.649 
I fail to do that here but I get him
pretty<00:01:56.009> close<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:57.119> only<00:01:57.240> takes<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.630> few

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
pretty close and it only takes a few

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.630 
pretty close and it only takes a few
more<00:01:57.960> execute<00:01:58.500> after<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.189> get<00:01:59.280> him<00:01:59.430> into

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
more execute after that to get him into

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.730 
more execute after that to get him into
killing<00:01:59.759> blow<00:02:00.090> range<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:01.020> careful<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.560> this

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
killing blow range be careful with this

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.590 
killing blow range be careful with this
stage<00:02:02.009> though<00:02:02.280> because<00:02:02.610> he<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:03.000> slag<00:02:03.360> you

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
stage though because he can slag you

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.080 
stage though because he can slag you
this<00:02:04.409> third<00:02:04.740> stage<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.280> recommend<00:02:05.729> getting<00:02:05.880> him

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
this third stage I recommend getting him

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.490 
this third stage I recommend getting him
in<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.240> killing<00:02:06.540> blow<00:02:06.659> range<00:02:06.990> before<00:02:07.229> he

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
in the killing blow range before he

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.320 
in the killing blow range before he
actually<00:02:07.680> takes<00:02:08.099> off<00:02:08.250> into<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> air<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
actually takes off into the air for the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.420 
actually takes off into the air for the
second<00:02:09.690> time<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.649> first<00:02:10.890> time<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.129> noticed

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
second time the first time I noticed

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.240 
second time the first time I noticed
he'll<00:02:11.760> always<00:02:12.000> land

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
he'll always land

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.220 
he'll always land
is<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.370> good<00:02:13.580> time<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.880> get<00:02:13.970> kunai<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.960> good

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
is a good time to get kunai and a good

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.710 
is a good time to get kunai and a good
backstab<00:02:15.800> on<00:02:16.070> him<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:17.210> can<00:02:17.240> push<00:02:17.540> him

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
backstab on him and you can push him

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.480 
backstab on him and you can push him
into<00:02:17.870> killing<00:02:18.050> blow<00:02:18.350> range<00:02:18.590> like<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.310> go
