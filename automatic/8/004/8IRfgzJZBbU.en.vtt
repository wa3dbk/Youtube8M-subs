00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
but we need to bring this tutorial so

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.870 
but we need to bring this tutorial so
yes<00:01:45.409> so<00:01:46.409> he<00:01:46.680> decided<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
yes so he decided to do it now and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.300 
yes so he decided to do it now and
basically<00:01:48.720> there's<00:01:49.350> two<00:01:49.409> ways<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.920> doing<00:01:50.100> it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
basically there's two ways of doing it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.889 
basically there's two ways of doing it
the<00:01:50.460> basic<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.240> advanced<00:01:51.509> way<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
the basic one and the advanced way the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.380 
the basic one and the advanced way the
advanced<00:01:52.200> way<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.590> why<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.430> which<00:01:54.210> is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
advanced way is why I do it and which is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.700 
advanced way is why I do it and which is
basically<00:01:54.689> putting<00:01:54.960> both<00:01:55.229> hands<00:01:55.500> off

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
basically putting both hands off

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.550 
basically putting both hands off
directly<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.520> from<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> floor<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.350> put

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
directly so from the floor and you put

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.020 
directly so from the floor and you put
one<00:01:58.770> arm<00:01:59.009> than<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> other<00:01:59.430> arm<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.820> then<00:01:59.939> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
one arm than the other arm and then you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.569 
one arm than the other arm and then you
get<00:02:00.149> up<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.540> instantly<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.380> from<00:02:01.680> there<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:02.250> up

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
get up in instantly so from there up up

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.969 
get up in instantly so from there up up
up<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:04.259> other<00:02:04.290> way<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.619> doing<00:02:04.770> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
up like that the other way of doing it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.560 
up like that the other way of doing it
is<00:02:05.130> if<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.610> enormous<00:02:06.000> strength<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.479> your

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
is if you have enormous strength in your

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.839 
is if you have enormous strength in your
arms<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.350> do<00:02:07.530> one<00:02:07.860> arm<00:02:08.069> then<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.429> other<00:02:08.550> arm

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
arms is to do one arm then the other arm

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.690 
arms is to do one arm then the other arm
that<00:02:09.030> up<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.420> go<00:02:09.720> push<00:02:10.140> one<00:02:10.349> arm<00:02:10.670> then<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
that up so you go push one arm then the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.530 
that up so you go push one arm then the
other<00:02:11.879> one

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
other one

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.289 
other one
then<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.959> put<00:02:13.110> stomach<00:02:13.500> there<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> go<00:02:14.730> that's

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
then you put stomach there you go that's

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.759 
then you put stomach there you go that's
the<00:02:15.510> basic<00:02:16.049> way<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.409> haven't<00:02:16.560> got<00:02:16.739> that

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
the basic way if you haven't got that

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.199 
the basic way if you haven't got that
much<00:02:17.040> strength<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.549> then<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.819> other<00:02:17.970> way<00:02:18.150> is

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
much strength and then the other way is

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.640 
much strength and then the other way is
the<00:02:18.420> advanced<00:02:18.720> once<00:02:19.049> you<00:02:19.170> fill<00:02:19.319> out<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.530> basic

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the advanced once you fill out the basic

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.309 
the advanced once you fill out the basic
pretty<00:02:20.250> well<00:02:20.540> but<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.599> nun<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:21.900> for<00:02:22.079> that

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
pretty well but a nun and for that

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:31.130 
pretty well but a nun and for that
lasted<00:02:23.010> because<00:02:23.129> so<00:02:23.849> C<00:02:28.819> equal<00:02:29.840> ISIL<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:30.989> there

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
lasted because so C equal ISIL in there

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.020 
lasted because so C equal ISIL in there
and<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:31.829> let's<00:02:32.099> put<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> swedish<00:02:32.909> cowboy

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
and so let's put a swedish cowboy

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.430 
and so let's put a swedish cowboy
collect<00:02:33.540> come<00:02:33.659> in<00:02:33.750> two<00:02:33.840> locations<00:02:34.049> tomorrow

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
collect come in two locations tomorrow

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.240 
collect come in two locations tomorrow

possibly had prevented pizza by partial

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.789 
possibly had prevented pizza by partial
x<00:02:38.430> tomorrow<00:02:39.530> right

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
x tomorrow right

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.670 
x tomorrow right
and<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.220> obviously<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.989> best<00:02:43.200> way<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.379> get

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
and so obviously and the best way to get

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.849 
and so obviously and the best way to get
arm<00:02:44.459> strength<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.359> do<00:02:45.510> pull-ups<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:46.170> as

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
is a crazy way of that we thought that

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.120 
is a crazy way of that we thought that
would<00:04:19.690> be<00:04:19.720> pretty<00:04:19.959> fun<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:20.470> for<00:04:20.739> you<00:04:20.829> guys<00:04:20.979> to

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
would be pretty fun to for you guys to

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.719 
would be pretty fun to for you guys to
do<00:04:21.280> and<00:04:21.789> which<00:04:21.970> another<00:04:22.210> way<00:04:26.070> inverse<00:04:27.070> which

do and which another way inverse which

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.980 
do and which another way inverse which
is<00:04:28.030> doing<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:30.100> output<00:04:31.090> backwards<00:04:31.510> so<00:04:31.960> you

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
is doing the output backwards so you

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.490 
is doing the output backwards so you
start<00:04:32.500> from<00:04:33.090> so<00:04:34.090> instead<00:04:34.389> of<00:04:34.449> chair<00:04:34.930> going<00:04:35.260> up

viento eat caramel do an armistice it
right<00:06:10.510> and<00:06:11.130> so<00:06:12.130> obviously<00:06:12.789> we<00:06:12.940> this<00:06:13.510> the<00:06:13.960> first

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
right and so obviously we this the first

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.869 
right and so obviously we this the first
one<00:06:14.530> and<00:06:15.159> he<00:06:15.340> do<00:06:15.639> is<00:06:15.909> a

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:16.879 
one and he do is a

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:19.689 
one and he do is a
I<00:06:17.240> do<00:06:17.300> is<00:06:18.289> easier<00:06:18.830> than<00:06:19.189> doing<00:06:19.459> it<00:06:19.520> back

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
I do is easier than doing it back

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:20.949 
I do is easier than doing it back
because<00:06:19.999> obviously<00:06:20.300> if<00:06:20.569> you<00:06:20.629> do<00:06:20.719> it<00:06:20.779> backwards

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:20.959 
because obviously if you do it backwards

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.749 
because obviously if you do it backwards
then<00:06:21.259> you<00:06:21.319> have<00:06:21.439> to<00:06:21.529> control<00:06:21.770> your<00:06:21.889> legs<00:06:22.099> you

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 
then you have to control your legs you

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:24.399 
then you have to control your legs you
have<00:06:22.789> to<00:06:22.939> control<00:06:23.330> it<00:06:23.479> requires<00:06:24.199> more

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.409 
have to control it requires more

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:26.290 
have to control it requires more
strength<00:06:24.529> if<00:06:25.520> you'd<00:06:25.669> be<00:06:25.729> the<00:06:25.789> first<00:06:25.819> one<00:06:26.059> in

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
strength if you'd be the first one in

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.029 
strength if you'd be the first one in
the<00:06:26.360> back<00:06:26.479> ones<00:06:26.689> just<00:06:26.839> like<00:06:26.929> a<00:06:27.050> bit<00:06:27.740> of<00:06:27.830> a<00:06:27.889> bit

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 
the back ones just like a bit of a bit

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.629 
the back ones just like a bit of a bit
fun<00:06:28.309> -<00:06:29.270> no<00:06:29.499> -<00:06:30.499> just<00:06:30.679> various<00:06:31.249> you<00:06:31.339> don't<00:06:31.520> the

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 
fun - no - just various you don't the

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.869 
fun - no - just various you don't the
same<00:06:31.819> thing<00:06:31.999> all<00:06:32.119> the<00:06:32.179> time<00:06:32.270> and<00:06:32.800> obviously

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:33.879 
same thing all the time and obviously

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:36.339 
same thing all the time and obviously
what<00:06:34.879> he<00:06:34.999> didn't<00:06:35.209> say<00:06:35.270> anything<00:06:35.539> Spanish<00:06:36.050> was

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:36.349 
what he didn't say anything Spanish was

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:41.379 
what he didn't say anything Spanish was
that<00:06:36.919> and<00:06:37.279> if<00:06:37.580> you<00:06:38.379> find<00:06:39.379> a<00:06:39.529> space<00:06:39.830> that<00:06:40.789> you

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
that and if you find a space that you

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:47.079 
that and if you find a space that you
can<00:06:42.009> do<00:06:43.009> this<00:06:43.249> trick<00:06:43.580> in<00:06:44.169> on<00:06:45.169> sand<00:06:46.039> or<00:06:46.490> grass<00:06:46.819> if

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:47.089 
can do this trick in on sand or grass if

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:48.399 
can do this trick in on sand or grass if
there's<00:06:47.270> a<00:06:47.330> bar<00:06:47.509> on<00:06:47.539> the<00:06:47.659> beach<00:06:47.839> even<00:06:48.289> better

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:48.409 
there's a bar on the beach even better

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:52.659 
there's a bar on the beach even better
and<00:06:50.679> obviously<00:06:51.679> we<00:06:52.039> always<00:06:52.219> require<00:06:52.399> safety

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669 
and obviously we always require safety

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.570 
and obviously we always require safety
and<00:06:53.649> yeah<00:06:54.649> that's<00:06:54.860> basically<00:06:54.979> it<00:06:55.339> you<00:06:55.459> know

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
and yeah that's basically it you know

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.850 
and yeah that's basically it you know
it's<00:06:55.729> just<00:06:55.789> like<00:06:56.379> subscribe<00:06:57.379> share<00:06:57.999> and<00:06:59.860> yeah

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
it's just like subscribe share and yeah

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.939 
it's just like subscribe share and yeah
I<00:07:01.009> think<00:07:01.099> that's<00:07:01.399> it<00:07:01.580> pretty<00:07:01.819> much
