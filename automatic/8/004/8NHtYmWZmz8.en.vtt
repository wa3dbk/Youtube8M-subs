00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello everyone how about in this video we're going 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.970
 to see when the watermelons are ready 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.950
 to collect 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.680
 Well, here we are surrounded by 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.050
 watermelons 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.840
 and when it comes to collecting the first thing that 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.540
 we look is in its size and in its 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.880
 color if they have a little more color 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.800
 clear is not an intense dark green 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.289
 and of course, if they have a good size 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.079
 because usually it may already be 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.160
 they can start to be at their point there 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.149
 different factors that can 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.309
 help detect that a watermelon is 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.800
 ready to collect as we have already 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.510
 said then the size and color we 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.630
 help cidade first at first hit 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.520
 of sight 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.520
 another is to give a few hits 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.700
 to see if it sounds hollow 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:59.420
 It has to sound like water like it was 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.450
 to break another pretty factor 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.820
 unequivocal is to locate the species of 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.320
 tendril that is between the union 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.150
 of the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.600
 of watermelon 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.920
 to the plant 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.200
 and if it is withered, it does not dry us 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.950
 withered then in this case this watermelon 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.159
 Well, I would be ready to collect 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.440
 as you can see this would be the castle 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.260
 kind of castle that grows 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.659
 we have between the armpit of between where 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.250
 une 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.020
 the watermelon to the plant 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.570
 in addition to those factors that we have 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.650
 commented there is also the possibility 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.410
 to see that in the watermelon is about 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.320
 taking a look at the part of 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.540
 ascended that rests on earth must 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.280
 of changing white when our 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.390
 list 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.970
 from a pale white to a yellow 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.070
 creamy 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.720
 once the plants simply the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.930
 production practically at three or 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.010
 every three or four days 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.229
 now watermelons ready to collect 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.800
 well here you can see our watermelon 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.210
 we locate the union tendril and how 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.020
 you can see it has not yet withered 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.770
 then this one will still not be 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.770
 list 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.590
 well here you can see another watermelon this 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.510
 small clear living is not much 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.330
 less list 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.780
 as you can see 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.440
 sometimes there is a tendril and other 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.390
 that comes out with a kind of leaf 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.480
 we will also have to take into account the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.190
 same factor when the sheet is 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.190
 totally withered 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.030
 here you can see the peduncle 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.580
 is where the stem that binds the watermelon with 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.020
 the plant the Tasio species that binds 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.970
 watermelon with the plant and the little leaf 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.650
 grows between say the armpit 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.840
 sometimes it 's a sheet sometimes it's a 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.310
 tendril our factor can also 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.740
 be although I do not know if it is appreciated in the 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.720
 camera is that watermelon can be 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.870
 remove easily as a layer of 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.790
 wax that was on his skin 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.870
 when we can easily remove the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.819
 Wax coat passing his hand 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.240
 can also help us to know if the 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.390
 Watermelon is ready 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.910
 well as we have seen this watermelon brings together 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.160
 all the requirements let's say so to speak 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.180
 in some way to be collected at 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.480
 withered castle 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.480
 hollow personality 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.480
 the part in contact with the earth 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.480
 yellow 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.610
 and we are going to make a cut to 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.380
 check 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.360
 as it is inside good we have 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.310
 made the cut 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.970
 and as you can see 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.590
 it's perfect 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.590
 at its delicious point 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.010
 well, this has been all about the 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.200
 video I hope you enjoy the watermelon 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.980
 delicious and refreshing for summer 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.980
 come to the next video
