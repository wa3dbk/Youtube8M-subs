00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
where he got attacked by a peak hair so

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.460 
where he got attacked by a peak hair so
I<00:00:03.419> guess<00:00:03.600> he<00:00:03.720> figured<00:00:03.990> he'd<00:00:04.110> fight<00:00:04.290> back<00:00:04.440> a

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
I guess he figured he'd fight back a

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.809 
I guess he figured he'd fight back a
little<00:00:04.799> bit<00:00:04.890> then<00:00:05.069> trying<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.339> tell<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.640> away

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
until he realized he's telling blocked

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.320
