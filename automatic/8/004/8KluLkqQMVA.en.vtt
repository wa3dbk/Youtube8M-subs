00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
routes but I only have three provinces

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.380 
routes but I only have three provinces
and<00:01:32.509> that's<00:01:32.690> three<00:01:32.899> trade<00:01:33.200> routes

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.540 

as<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.140> see<00:01:37.320> here<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.800> trade<00:01:38.070> route<00:01:38.280> is

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
as you can see here this trade route is

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.120 
as you can see here this trade route is
wine<00:01:39.120> it<00:01:39.420> gives<00:01:39.600> me<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> local<00:01:40.200> revolt<00:01:40.590> risk<00:01:40.860> of

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
wine it gives me a local revolt risk of

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.010 
wine it gives me a local revolt risk of
negative<00:01:41.430> one<00:01:41.970> which<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.420> good<00:01:42.659> because<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
negative one which is good because the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.730 
negative one which is good because the
lower<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.440> revolt<00:01:43.740> risk<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.900> don't<00:01:45.900> see<00:01:46.440> any

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
lower the revolt risk I don't see any

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.819 
lower the revolt risk I don't see any
warnings<00:01:47.580> of<00:01:47.880> revolt

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.020 

that's<00:01:53.490> not<00:01:53.700> gonna<00:01:53.789> be<00:01:53.880> useful<00:01:54.149> right<00:01:54.479> now

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
that's not gonna be useful right now

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.399 
that's not gonna be useful right now
their<00:01:57.030> grain<00:01:57.270> which<00:01:57.539> is<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:57.840> population

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
their grain which is for population

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.590 
their grain which is for population
growth<00:01:58.439> which<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.429> good<00:01:59.609> for<00:01:59.729> colonization<00:02:00.090> so

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
growth which is good for colonization so

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.940 
growth which is good for colonization so
I'm<00:02:00.689> gonna<00:02:00.780> move<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.439> because<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
I'm gonna move that here because the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.309 
I'm gonna move that here because the
higher<00:02:02.929> population<00:02:04.789> civilization<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:06.030> more

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
higher population civilization the more

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.580 
higher population civilization the more
chance<00:02:07.319> increases<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.280> keep<00:02:08.519> uh

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
chance increases that you keep uh

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.180 
chance increases that you keep uh
colonize<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.870> here<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.080> got<00:02:13.230> green<00:02:13.440> again<00:02:13.709> okay

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
colonize and here I got green again okay

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:22.759 
colonize and here I got green again okay
so<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:17.720> don't<00:02:18.720> have<00:02:20.420> much<00:02:21.420> choice<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:22.110> can't

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
so I don't have much choice I can't

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.740 
so I don't have much choice I can't
really<00:02:22.860> should<00:02:23.540> strategically<00:02:24.540> plan

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
really should strategically plan

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.440 
really should strategically plan
anything<00:02:25.140> out<00:02:25.730> over<00:02:26.730> there<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.030> open<00:02:27.329> trade

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
anything out over there to open trade

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.030 
anything out over there to open trade
routes<00:02:27.720> here<00:02:27.959> we<00:02:28.230> only<00:02:28.380> have<00:02:28.500> three<00:02:28.739> provinces

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
routes here we only have three provinces

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.130 
routes here we only have three provinces
an<00:02:29.519> odd<00:02:29.670> number<00:02:30.120> means<00:02:30.950> open<00:02:31.950> trade<00:02:32.130> routes<00:02:33.140> so

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
an odd number means open trade routes so

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.960 
an odd number means open trade routes so
those<00:02:34.560> trade<00:02:34.829> routes<00:02:35.040> instead<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.670> training

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
those trade routes instead of training

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.780 
those trade routes instead of training
