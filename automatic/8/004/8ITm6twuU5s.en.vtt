00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
guy that's doing this hopefully a lot of

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.760 
guy that's doing this hopefully a lot of
guys<00:00:40.550> by<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:41.420> time<00:00:41.630> they<00:00:41.750> reached<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.170> big

guys by the time they reached the big

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.250 
guys by the time they reached the big
bases<00:00:43.330> should<00:00:44.330> have<00:00:44.450> been<00:00:44.600> taught<00:00:44.780> not<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.020> do

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
bases should have been taught not to do

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.470 
bases should have been taught not to do
this<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:45.770> you'll<00:00:46.310> still<00:00:46.550> find<00:00:46.730> a<00:00:46.940> couple<00:00:47.150> okay

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
this but you'll still find a couple okay

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.330 
this but you'll still find a couple okay
and<00:00:47.720> that's<00:00:48.080> just<00:00:48.380> you<00:00:48.590> know<00:00:48.620> wigglin<00:00:49.190> is

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
and that's just you know wigglin is

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.830 
and that's just you know wigglin is
wiggling<00:00:49.880> his<00:00:50.030> hand<00:00:50.300> or<00:00:50.560> moving<00:00:51.560> the<00:00:51.650> ball<00:00:51.860> on

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
wiggling his hand or moving the ball on

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.660 
wiggling his hand or moving the ball on
certain<00:00:53.840> pitches<00:00:54.080> so<00:00:54.710> if<00:00:54.860> he's<00:00:55.040> you<00:00:55.640> know

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
certain pitches so if he's you know

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.240 
certain pitches so if he's you know
rotate<00:00:56.180> grabbing<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:56.840> four<00:00:57.500> seam<00:00:57.740> grip<00:00:57.770> and

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
rotate grabbing a four seam grip and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.100 
rotate grabbing a four seam grip and
then<00:00:58.520> every<00:00:59.330> time<00:00:59.480> he<00:00:59.600> goes<00:00:59.750> to<00:00:59.870> throw<00:01:00.020> a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
then every time he goes to throw a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.050 
then every time he goes to throw a
curveball<00:01:00.400> he's<00:01:01.400> got<00:01:01.580> a<00:01:01.610> little<00:01:01.880> wiggle

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 
curveball he's got a little wiggle

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.330 
curveball he's got a little wiggle
before<00:01:02.540> he<00:01:02.630> goes<00:01:02.810> obviously<00:01:03.500> that's<00:01:03.920> an<00:01:04.040> easy

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:04.340 
before he goes obviously that's an easy

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.950 
before he goes obviously that's an easy
toe<00:01:04.670> okay<00:01:05.090> that's<00:01:05.330> probably<00:01:05.600> if<00:01:05.690> you<00:01:05.780> come

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
toe okay that's probably if you come

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.810 
toe okay that's probably if you come
across<00:01:06.200> that<00:01:06.350> guy<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:06.590> should<00:01:06.830> be<00:01:06.950> happy

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
across that guy you should be happy

across that guy you should be happy
that's<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.120> easiest<00:01:08.510> one<00:01:08.690> to<00:01:08.870> pick<00:01:09.080> out<00:01:09.560> of

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
that's the easiest one to pick out of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.610 
that's the easiest one to pick out of
all<00:01:09.920> okay<00:01:10.460> now<00:01:11.120> a<00:01:11.150> little<00:01:11.270> bit<00:01:11.600> more<00:01:11.660> subtle<00:01:12.230> of

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
all okay now a little bit more subtle of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.700 
all okay now a little bit more subtle of
a<00:01:12.740> tip<00:01:13.430> of<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.210> pitches<00:01:14.600> is<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:15.230> can<00:01:15.380> look<00:01:15.530> at

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
a tip of the pitches is you can look at

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.600 
a tip of the pitches is you can look at
the<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.130> pitchers<00:01:17.410> right<00:01:18.410> forearm<00:01:18.770> okay<00:01:19.400> a

the the pitchers right forearm okay a

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.070 
the the pitchers right forearm okay a
lot<00:01:20.090> of<00:01:20.150> guys<00:01:20.390> will<00:01:20.600> have<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.750> slight

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
lot of guys will have a slight

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.470 
lot of guys will have a slight
difference<00:01:21.620> in<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.920> way<00:01:22.580> they're<00:01:22.820> gripping

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
difference in the way they're gripping

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.230 
difference in the way they're gripping
the<00:01:23.750> pitch<00:01:23.960> in<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.260> glove<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:25.340> how<00:01:26.030> their

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
the pitch in the glove to how their

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.050 
the pitch in the glove to how their
forearm<00:01:26.660> is<00:01:26.870> so<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.080> can<00:01:27.230> see<00:01:27.550> it's<00:01:28.550> not<00:01:28.820> as

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
forearm is so you can see it's not as

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.050 
forearm is so you can see it's not as
thick<00:01:29.540> here<00:01:29.930> as<00:01:30.920> I'm<00:01:31.190> turning<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:31.850> can

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
thick here as I'm turning it so you can

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.340 
thick here as I'm turning it so you can
see<00:01:32.270> if<00:01:32.450> you're<00:01:32.570> just<00:01:32.780> looking<00:01:33.050> at<00:01:33.170> that

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
see if you're just looking at that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.040 
see if you're just looking at that
forearm<00:01:33.650> you<00:01:34.490> can<00:01:34.640> see<00:01:34.820> subtle<00:01:35.240> differences

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
forearm you can see subtle differences

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.500 
forearm you can see subtle differences
in<00:01:36.370> some<00:01:37.370> of<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.520> different<00:01:37.820> pitches<00:01:37.970> here

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
in some of the different pitches here

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.510 
in some of the different pitches here
would<00:01:38.659> be<00:01:38.780> a<00:01:38.810> fastball<00:01:39.530> here<00:01:40.190> might<00:01:40.370> be<00:01:40.400> a

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
would be a fastball here might be a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.210 
would be a fastball here might be a
curveball<00:01:40.970> or<00:01:41.120> slider<00:01:41.270> here's<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:42.080> changeup<00:01:42.740> so

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
curveball or slider here's a changeup so

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.070 
curveball or slider here's a changeup so
you<00:01:43.280> can<00:01:43.460> see<00:01:43.640> very<00:01:43.880> subtle<00:01:44.330> differences<00:01:44.870> in

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
you can see very subtle differences in

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.790 
you can see very subtle differences in
the<00:01:45.530> wrist<00:01:45.950> forearm<00:01:46.909> area<00:01:47.330> of<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.380> throwing

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
the wrist forearm area of the throwing

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.140 
the wrist forearm area of the throwing
hand<00:01:48.830> if<00:01:49.250> you're<00:01:49.400> paying<00:01:49.640> very<00:01:49.940> close

a lot of guys will change a little
something<00:02:10.069> in<00:02:10.190> their<00:02:10.310> mechanics<00:02:10.850> when

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
something in their mechanics when

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.640 
something in their mechanics when
they're<00:02:11.150> throwing<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.450> pitch<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.840> lot<00:02:12.319> of<00:02:12.380> guys

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
they're throwing a pitch a lot of guys

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.270 
they're throwing a pitch a lot of guys
will<00:02:12.980> have

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
will have

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.500 
will have
different<00:02:13.610> arms<00:02:13.820> circle<00:02:14.150> on<00:02:14.210> different

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
different arms circle on different

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.420 
different arms circle on different
pitches<00:02:14.660> okay<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:15.530> if<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.740> can<00:02:15.860> focus<00:02:16.130> on

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
pitches okay so if you can focus on

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.100 
pitches okay so if you can focus on
instead<00:02:16.700> of<00:02:16.760> trying<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.090> pick<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.660> pitch<00:02:17.870> out

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
instead of trying to pick the pitch out

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.760 
instead of trying to pick the pitch out
of<00:02:18.230> his<00:02:18.320> hand

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
of his hand

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.220 
of his hand
focus<00:02:19.430> on<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.760> arm<00:02:20.150> circle<00:02:20.690> when<00:02:21.110> he's

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
focus on this arm circle when he's

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.390 
focus on this arm circle when he's
coming<00:02:21.560> through<00:02:21.710> and<00:02:21.860> you'll<00:02:21.950> see<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.130> lot<00:02:22.370> of

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
coming through and you'll see a lot of

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.300 
coming through and you'll see a lot of
guys<00:02:22.580> shorten<00:02:23.060> up<00:02:23.150> their<00:02:23.330> arm<00:02:23.510> circle<00:02:23.960> on<00:02:24.020> on

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
guys shorten up their arm circle on on

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.810 
guys shorten up their arm circle on on
off-speed<00:02:25.310> pitches

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
off-speed pitches

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.330 
off-speed pitches
okay<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:26.540> that's<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.990> way<00:02:27.350> to<00:02:27.380> pick<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.770> up<00:02:27.890> and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
okay so that's a way to pick it up and

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.990 
okay so that's a way to pick it up and
that<00:02:28.520> that<00:02:28.850> really<00:02:29.210> goes<00:02:29.390> back<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:31.000> intuition

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
that that really goes back to intuition

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.790 
that that really goes back to intuition
and<00:02:32.120> pitch<00:02:32.360> recognition<00:02:32.600> okay<00:02:33.410> if<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.620> can

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
and pitch recognition okay if you can

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.380 
and pitch recognition okay if you can
see<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.490> kind<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.730> read<00:02:34.910> off<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.120> that

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
see that and kind of read off of that

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.630 
see that and kind of read off of that
you're<00:02:35.570> gonna<00:02:35.630> be<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:36.130> great<00:02:37.130> hitter<00:02:37.370> great

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
hitters do that okay but going back to

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.320 
hitters do that okay but going back to
tipping<00:02:41.750> stealing<00:02:42.590> pitches<00:02:43.580> or<00:02:43.730> having<00:02:44.240> the
