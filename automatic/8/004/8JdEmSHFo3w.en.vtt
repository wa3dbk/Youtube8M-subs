00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
this video tonight i plan on breaking it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.310 
this video tonight i plan on breaking it
down<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.070> getting<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.310> new<00:01:53.430> wiring<00:01:54.320> this

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
down and getting the new wiring this

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.690 
down and getting the new wiring this
will<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.649> water<00:01:55.799> cooling<00:01:56.130> setup<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.579> guys

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
will be the water cooling setup you guys

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.709 
will be the water cooling setup you guys
have<00:01:56.880> seen<00:01:57.030> pictures<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:59.390> as<00:02:00.390> well<00:02:00.600> as

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
have seen pictures of that as well as

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.670 
have seen pictures of that as well as
the<00:02:00.950> dual<00:02:01.950> radiators<00:02:02.579> here<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.969> back

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.109 

so<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:07.070> just<00:02:07.190> got<00:02:07.370> a<00:02:07.400> little<00:02:07.520> file<00:02:07.790> that<00:02:08.030> I'm

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
so it just got a little file that I'm

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.670 
so it just got a little file that I'm
gonna<00:02:08.210> run<00:02:10.300> just<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.450> demonstrate<00:02:11.690> that<00:02:12.500> it

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
gonna run just to demonstrate that it

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.160 
gonna run just to demonstrate that it
actually<00:02:12.830> works<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.720> I'll<00:02:14.720> hit<00:02:14.840> second

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
actually works so I'll hit second

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.840 
actually works so I'll hit second
started<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.500> went<00:02:15.590> ahead<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:15.890> set<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.070> 15-second

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
started I went ahead and set a 15-second

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
started I went ahead and set a 15-second
delay<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.209> let<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.570> spindle<00:02:18.190> power<00:02:19.190> up<00:02:19.490> to

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
delay to let the spindle power up to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.230 
delay to let the spindle power up to
24,000<00:02:20.870> rpm<00:02:21.580> after<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.880> machine<00:02:23.120> will

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
24,000 rpm after that the machine will

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.600 
24,000 rpm after that the machine will
start<00:02:23.390> moving<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.080> we'll<00:02:24.890> hit<00:02:25.010> start<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.430> I'll

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
start moving so we'll hit start and I'll

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.080

show<00:02:25.820> you<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:26.090> output<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.630> VFD<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:31.090> don't

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
show you the output on the VFD I don't

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.250 
show you the output on the VFD I don't
know<00:02:32.150> if<00:02:32.240> you've<00:02:32.360> heard<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.750> little<00:02:32.870> click

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
know if you've heard the little click

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.310 
know if you've heard the little click
but<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.890> plan<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.540> using<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.780> intelligent

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
but I plan on using the intelligent

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.610 
but I plan on using the intelligent
relay<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:37.550> drive<00:02:37.790> my<00:02:38.090> water<00:02:38.930> cooling<00:02:39.260> set<00:02:39.470> up

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
relay to drive my water cooling set up

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.580 
relay to drive my water cooling set up

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
only when the spindles on you can see

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.070 
only when the spindles on you can see
the<00:02:42.709> output<00:02:43.130> on<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:44.209> VFD<00:02:44.750> shows<00:02:45.020> 4,000<00:02:47.080> that

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
the output on the VFD shows 4,000 that

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.460 
the output on the VFD shows 4,000 that
means<00:02:48.260> it's<00:02:48.410> running<00:02:48.500> at<00:02:48.770> full<00:02:48.950> speed<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.840> 15

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470

moving<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:55.430> as<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.180> probably<00:02:56.330> heard<00:02:56.570> this

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
moving and as you probably heard this

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:11.480 
moving and as you probably heard this
little<00:02:56.959> powered<00:02:57.860> up

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
looks like the files about halfway done

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:26.670 
looks like the files about halfway done
seems<00:03:19.959> over<00:03:20.200> here<00:03:20.349> running

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:47.760 

since<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.400> finishes<00:03:27.849> will<00:03:28.120> see<00:03:28.360> me

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:58.770 

completed

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.660 

and<00:03:59.780> you<00:04:00.410> probably<00:04:00.590> heard<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:00.950> click<00:04:01.250> as<00:04:01.520> soon

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
and you probably heard the click as soon

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.760 
and you probably heard the click as soon
as<00:04:01.819> the<00:04:01.970> spindle<00:04:02.270> stopped<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:03.050> intelligent

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
as the spindle stopped the intelligent

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.660 
as the spindle stopped the intelligent
relay<00:04:04.720> coil<00:04:05.720> circuit<00:04:05.959> opened<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.519> would

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
relay coil circuit opened and that would

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.770 
relay coil circuit opened and that would
have<00:04:07.790> shut<00:04:08.030> off<00:04:08.239> my<00:04:09.760> water<00:04:10.760> cooling<00:04:11.120> setup<00:04:11.450> and

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
have shut off my water cooling setup and

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.110 
have shut off my water cooling setup and
now<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.170> display<00:04:12.530> shows<00:04:14.110> zero<00:04:15.110> zero<00:04:15.440> so<00:04:16.160> that

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
now the display shows zero zero so that

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.569 
now the display shows zero zero so that
is<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:17.900> Modbus<00:04:18.470> configuration<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:19.489> I've

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
is the Modbus configuration that I've

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.480 
is the Modbus configuration that I've
got<00:04:19.730> so<00:04:19.910> far<00:04:20.079> a<00:04:21.079> little<00:04:21.560> more<00:04:21.829> work<00:04:21.980> to<00:04:22.130> do<00:04:22.250> on

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
got so far a little more work to do on

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.670 
got so far a little more work to do on
implementing<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.630> box<00:04:23.870> getting<00:04:24.260> everything

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
implementing the box getting everything

set up for the water cooling waiting on

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.719 
set up for the water cooling waiting on
some<00:04:27.530> more<00:04:27.680> connectors<00:04:28.130> they<00:04:28.340> should<00:04:28.490> be<00:04:28.580> here

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
some more connectors they should be here

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.159 
some more connectors they should be here
tomorrow

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169

and<00:04:36.979> tapped<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:37.580> we<00:04:37.669> should<00:04:37.820> be<00:04:37.940> in<00:04:38.000> good

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
and tapped and we should be in good

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.580 
and tapped and we should be in good
