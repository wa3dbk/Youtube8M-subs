this is a really quick meal
it<00:02:02.430> only<00:02:02.550> takes<00:02:02.910> about<00:02:03.150> I<00:02:03.630> would<00:02:03.870> say<00:02:04.020> six<00:02:04.500> to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
it only takes about I would say six to

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
point we're going to now pour in the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.170 
point we're going to now pour in the
liquid<00:02:13.080> egg<00:02:13.590> whites<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:14.970> going<00:02:15.090> to

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
liquid egg whites and this is going to

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.970 
liquid egg whites and this is going to
kind<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.420> use<00:02:15.750> all<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.020> ingredients<00:02:16.140> together

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
kind of use all the ingredients together

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.610 
kind of use all the ingredients together
give<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.910> egg<00:02:18.540> fried<00:02:18.990> rice<00:02:19.020> tastes

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
give it that egg fried rice tastes

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.160 
give it that egg fried rice tastes
really<00:02:20.459> good<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.600> we're<00:02:21.720> going<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.870> let<00:02:21.990> that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
really good so we're going to let that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.770 
really good so we're going to let that
cook<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.160> last<00:02:23.370> step<00:02:23.700> here<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.240> we're

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
cook and the last step here is we're

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.930 
cook and the last step here is we're
going<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.930> put<00:02:25.140> two<00:02:25.380> whole<00:02:25.680> eggs<00:02:25.709> in<00:02:26.130> us<00:02:28.940> so

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
going to put two whole eggs in us so

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.490 
going to put two whole eggs in us so
this<00:02:30.090> has<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.390> all<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.660> has<00:02:30.810> three<00:02:31.320> different

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
this has it all it has three different

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.710 
this has it all it has three different
kinds<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.310> protein<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:33.450> good<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.660> have

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
kinds of protein and it's good to have

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.080 
kinds of protein and it's good to have
different<00:02:34.200> kinds<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.680> protein<00:02:35.130> because<00:02:35.520> every

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
different kinds of protein because every

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.690 
different kinds of protein because every
single<00:02:36.239> protein<00:02:36.630> has<00:02:37.590> different<00:02:38.010> amino<00:02:38.190> acids

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
single protein has different amino acids

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.670 
single protein has different amino acids
I<00:02:38.820> like<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.120> say<00:02:39.270> not<00:02:39.540> all<00:02:39.720> protein<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.320> credit

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
I like to say not all protein is credit

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.100 
I like to say not all protein is credit
equal<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.730> have<00:02:41.940> your<00:02:42.180> whole<00:02:42.390> egg<00:02:42.570> protein

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
equal so you have your whole egg protein

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.290 
equal so you have your whole egg protein
you<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.470> grilled<00:02:44.070> chicken<00:02:44.190> protein<00:02:44.970> there's

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
you have grilled chicken protein there's

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.880 
you have grilled chicken protein there's
even<00:02:45.570> crunching<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.050> brown<00:02:46.260> rice<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.530> also

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
even crunching and brown rice and also

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.740 
even crunching and brown rice and also
