00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.320
 constrution but this is not any 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.009
 episode so much that you will see there 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.809
 I did not even list this episode because 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.170
 You are watching this video is short and 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.689
 it is just to ask for a help to you the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.810
 which is this time not the competition or anything 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.880
 I did not ask you to get anything 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.390

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.149
 than to build because for me already 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.520
 it's getting kind of confusing what to do 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.460
 I've done a lot of things in here. 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.670

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.390

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.510
