00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
going to do is that as you see all of

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.710 
going to do is that as you see all of
the<00:02:31.560> Jews<00:02:31.829> that<00:02:32.040> came<00:02:32.280> out<00:02:32.489> so<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.180> brings<00:02:33.450> out

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the Jews that came out so it brings out

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.900 
the Jews that came out so it brings out
the<00:02:33.900> sweetness<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.769> brings<00:02:35.040> out<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.370> juices

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
the sweetness it brings out the juices

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.670 
the sweetness it brings out the juices
and<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.180> deepens<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.930> concentrates<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
and it deepens and concentrates the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.830 
and it deepens and concentrates the
flavor<00:02:37.799> so<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.489> some<00:02:39.030> people<00:02:39.329> like<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.480> take
