coming out of this yellow pipe right

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.889 
coming out of this yellow pipe right
here<00:01:38.289> just<00:01:39.289> throw<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.560> shell<00:01:40.450> back<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.659> forth

and hit these goombahs and your score is
constantly<00:01:45.649> racking<00:01:46.130> up<00:01:46.250> all<00:01:46.460> they're<00:01:46.610> doing

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
constantly racking up all they're doing

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.130 
constantly racking up all they're doing
this<00:01:46.970> as<00:01:47.240> we've<00:01:47.720> got<00:01:47.899> two<00:01:48.079> thousand<00:01:50.140> four

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
this as we've got two thousand four

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.690 
this as we've got two thousand four
thousand<00:01:51.649> eight<00:01:51.799> thousand<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.520> then<00:01:52.640> you

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
thousand eight thousand and then you

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.969 
thousand eight thousand and then you
just<00:01:52.850> hope<00:01:53.569> just<00:01:53.899> jump<00:01:54.170> on<00:01:54.289> every<00:01:54.530> sis<00:01:54.740> shall

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
just hope just jump on every sis shall

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.029 
just hope just jump on every sis shall
come<00:01:55.190> into<00:01:55.659> so<00:01:56.659> you<00:01:56.750> won't<00:01:56.899> stop<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.649> that

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
eventually as you can see when the shell

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.559 
eventually as you can see when the shell
hits<00:02:01.459> the<00:02:01.610> goombas<00:02:01.939> you're<00:02:02.119> going<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.360> rack

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
hits the goombas you're going to rack

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.559 
hits the goombas you're going to rack
one<00:02:02.899> to<00:02:03.649> do<00:02:03.799> is<00:02:03.920> just<00:02:04.069> stand<00:02:04.369> here<00:02:04.459> just<00:02:04.819> jump

one to do is just stand here just jump
when<00:02:05.720> out<00:02:05.840> of<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:05.959> shell<00:02:06.229> comes<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.970> just

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
when out of the shell comes and just

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.789 
when out of the shell comes and just
patiently<00:02:08.360> wait<00:02:08.630> about<00:02:09.019> maybe<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.349> minute<00:02:09.649> or

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
and show my long string as you can see

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:30.030 
and show my long string as you can see
