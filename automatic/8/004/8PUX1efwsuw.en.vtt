everything<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.150> step<00:02:55.660> sequence<00:02:56.080> tends<00:02:56.410> to

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
everything this step sequence tends to

everything this step sequence tends to
slow<00:02:56.890> down<00:02:57.069> I<00:02:57.370> love<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:58.000> flow<00:02:58.239> she<00:02:58.300> has<00:02:58.660> on<00:02:58.870> the
