your<00:00:25.859> day<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.249> here<00:00:26.759> we<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> deck<00:00:27.179> now

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
your day and here we have the deck now

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.749 
your day and here we have the deck now
it<00:00:27.869> seems<00:00:28.079> basic<00:00:28.349> like<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.529> legacy<00:00:28.859> version<00:00:29.159> the

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
it seems basic like a legacy version the

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.659 
it seems basic like a legacy version the
aristocrats<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.599> some<00:00:31.169> principles<00:00:31.740> mostly

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
aristocrats in some principles mostly

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.069 
aristocrats in some principles mostly
with<00:00:32.790> your<00:00:33.030> interactions<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
with your interactions with the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.700 
with your interactions with the
sacrifices<00:00:34.650> first<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.400> the<00:00:35.520> original<00:00:36.680> oddly<00:00:37.680> I

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
sacrifices first is the original oddly I

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.290 
sacrifices first is the original oddly I
think<00:00:38.220> it's<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.550> deck<00:00:38.700> maverick<00:00:39.060> always

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
think it's the deck maverick always

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.710 
think it's the deck maverick always
should<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.510> been

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
should have been

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.780 
should have been
okay<00:00:40.590> that's<00:00:40.950> another<00:00:41.160> way<00:00:41.310> to<00:00:41.370> look<00:00:41.490> at<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
okay that's another way to look at it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.810 
okay that's another way to look at it
you<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.600> mother<00:00:42.990> of<00:00:43.170> booms<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.560> for<00:00:44.460> backup

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
you have mother of booms and for backup

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.180 
you have mother of booms and for backup

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
what what's the general premise here I

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.729 
what what's the general premise here I
guess<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.560> we're<00:00:52.650> starting<00:00:52.830> so

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.520 
guess that we're starting so
my<00:00:55.190> goal<00:00:55.489> is<00:00:55.850> basically<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.629> play<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:56.899> one<00:00:57.379> drop

aristocrat<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:35.630> benevolent<00:01:36.170> bodyguard<00:01:36.619> a

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
aristocrat and benevolent bodyguard a

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.070 
aristocrat and benevolent bodyguard a
zealous<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.550> enable<00:01:38.000> high<00:01:38.150> priests<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:40.960> so<00:01:41.960> my

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
zealous to enable high priests and so my

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.800 
zealous to enable high priests and so my
thinking<00:01:42.320> is<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:42.619> creature<00:01:43.340> decks

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
thinking is that creature decks

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.440 
thinking is that creature decks
generally<00:01:44.810> can't<00:01:45.140> be<00:01:45.729> protection<00:01:46.729> into<00:01:47.270> high

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
generally can't be protection into high

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.180 
generally can't be protection into high
priests<00:01:47.750> or<00:01:48.110> stone<00:01:48.410> floors<00:01:48.680> mystic<00:01:49.009> for

priests or stone floors mystic for

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.590 
priests or stone floors mystic for
better<00:01:49.310> school<00:01:49.610> they<00:01:49.880> can't<00:01:50.090> kill<00:01:50.210> Stanford

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
better school they can't kill Stanford

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.820 
better school they can't kill Stanford

really hard for them to play the game

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.420 
really hard for them to play the game
especially<00:02:58.739> making<00:02:58.920> followed<00:02:59.190> up<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.340> the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
especially making followed up to the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.520 
especially making followed up to the
wasteland<00:02:59.730> right<00:03:00.390> right<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:01.140> camera

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
wasteland right right the camera

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.710

soulless<00:03:01.799> has<00:03:01.890> been<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.069> pretty<00:03:02.340> good<00:03:02.489> weapon

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
soulless has been a pretty good weapon

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.300 
soulless has been a pretty good weapon
against<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.780> lot<00:03:04.049> of<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.290> rugs<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:05.129> think

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
against a lot of the rugs I think

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.039 
against a lot of the rugs I think
especially<00:03:06.530> since<00:03:07.530> been<00:03:07.680> pushed<00:03:08.340> out<00:03:08.489> on<00:03:08.790> this

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
especially since been pushed out on this

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.830 
especially since been pushed out on this
but<00:03:10.049> now<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:10.980> yeah<00:03:11.489> like<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:11.849> think<00:03:11.879> that<00:03:12.090> when

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
but now this yeah like I think that when

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.479 
but now this yeah like I think that when
I<00:03:12.870> want<00:03:13.110> Mike<00:03:13.230> hurts<00:03:13.500> solo<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.129> doesn't<00:03:14.340> make

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
I want Mike hurts solo it doesn't make

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.720 
I want Mike hurts solo it doesn't make
sense<00:03:14.519> to<00:03:14.849> play<00:03:15.030> like<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.239> lotta<00:03:15.420> mana<00:03:15.629> guys<00:03:15.840> and

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
sense to play like a lotta mana guys and

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.369 
sense to play like a lotta mana guys and
when<00:03:17.730> I'm<00:03:17.849> trying<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.299> stick<00:03:18.480> like<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:19.170> graph

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
when I'm trying to stick like a to graph

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.569 
when I'm trying to stick like a to graph
instead<00:03:19.799> of<00:03:19.890> sticking<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.220> three<00:03:20.430> drop

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
instead of sticking to three drop

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.610 
instead of sticking to three drop
ignited<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.030> reliquary<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:22.290> means<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.590> I

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
ignited the reliquary it means that I

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.259 
ignited the reliquary it means that I
don't<00:03:22.709> have<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.129> play<00:03:23.340> those<00:03:23.489> mana<00:03:23.730> guys<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.209> I

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
don't have to play those mana guys and I

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.119 
don't have to play those mana guys and I
can<00:03:24.420> still<00:03:24.629> just<00:03:24.810> go<00:03:24.930> like<00:03:25.140> protection<00:03:25.769> in<00:03:26.040> the

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
can still just go like protection in the

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.130 
can still just go like protection in the
threat<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.640> just<00:03:27.510> think<00:03:27.629> that<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.840> makes<00:03:27.959> more

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
threat I just think that it makes more

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.910 
threat I just think that it makes more
sense<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.500> be<00:03:28.620> protecting<00:03:29.040> Bob<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:30.870> agree<00:03:31.769> with

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
sense to be protecting Bob I agree with

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.880 
sense to be protecting Bob I agree with
the<00:03:32.489> payoff<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.970> high<00:03:33.329> on<00:03:33.510> both<00:03:33.890> really

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890
