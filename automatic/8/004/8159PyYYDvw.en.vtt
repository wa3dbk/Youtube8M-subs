00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.030
 for my wife 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:42.129
 but I'm not going to have to put 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.129
 measurements 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:58.750

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.750
 mons 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.850
 There was a recreation in Lujan and I'm 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.520
 back on a little path but you see here 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.560
 the theme of the week this maximus list 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.420
 evelio comes to rescue one of the things 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.030
 that we have forgotten in our life and 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.740
 I wanted to teach it's about mourning 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.570
 cartoon movies of the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.979
 childhood but the original title should 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.960
 have been cartoon movies 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.750
 of the report that you remember what ever 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.100
 have you seen I bring you the top selection 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.829
 ever from cartoon movies 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.750
 that are not disney or dating works of 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.579
 pizza come one of these so they are 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.819
 important producers of drawings 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.929
 but that during the 80-90s 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.569
 they made cartoon movies 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.720
 that for my taste can be like 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.250
 compare with that artistic quality of 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.170
 the films of drawings now all 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.780
 they are nice that he said goodbye to drawings 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.909
 character that I like to do 25 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.189
 magical stanley garden although the 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.619
 original title is a troll in front of the 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.759
 park this movie my skin gets 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.409
 of chicken every time I remember 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.360
 it turns out that beneath the earth of a 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.069
 world of evil thrones there was one that 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.290
 it was not evil that they were good and that 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.450
 had one of the magic that when I played 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.860
 So they left the plant if 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.680
 all very green 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.600
 so what happens that the kings of that 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.430
 world of trolls gets angry with this 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.050
 because it is not evil and will send it to 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.000
 world of humans in particular at 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.490
 center to the pact and of course here he knows a 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.040
 Haired girl have fun all very super 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.750
 cool and angry troll queen to 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.700
 taseer guys I recommend this 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.250
 movie please because it's a 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.690
 childhood movie in which when 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.520
 was small and who was adult mind of 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.480
 then until I made this video 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.250
 in the top 4 nor the secret world of the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.709
 lady priscila I know it was please be 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.690
 a field mouse that lives on a farm 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.640
 your child gets bad and must go through 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.140
 dangerous sites to go for the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.620
 medicine that heals your child clear 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.500
 this is mixed with that at the same time it was the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.900
 farm time of that farm and run 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.360
 danger because of his height and chasm because 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.520
 there are owls and things leaving the bar to everything 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.150
 in an environment as well as suspense there 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.310
 like what 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.230
 it's super cool that texture of 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.060
 technicolor that had from before we 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.939
 we can continue now and it gives me a lot of anger 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.370
 because this color gives magic to the 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:21.319
 crazy movies in the top 3 this 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.840
 movie if you have not seen it is for 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.069
 kill you and to commit suicide and then in 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.450
 Revive is for you to return to 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.730
 kill is the guardian of words 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.200
 starring macaulay culkin good 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.030
 that goes the library that goes into a 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.150
 magical world where he meets three books 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.530
 that are fantasy horror and adventure that 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.390
 will accompany you throughout your trip 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.829
 to leave the library with a 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.989
 carnet I tell you that it's done the same 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.540
 because during that trip he goes through 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.700
 books like mobile book or like the 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.370
 doctor's book jekyll or the great life 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.709
 such a union if they are such song book 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.590
 classic or you admire the rolling of the 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.569
 eagle in the top 20 cool and adventures 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.400
 of zack and crista pÃ©rpuli is a forest 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.980
 that is in danger because a spirit 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.870
 evil called exo threatens to destroy 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.209
 everything with this movie I think that 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.250
 necessary to level ecological and I was very 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.630
 aware of everything that happened in the 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.340
 world 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.900
 the story is about a fairy that with the 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.150
 help from a bat that is super 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.810
 very human crazy because they try to eliminate 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.100
 to this evil spirit and the top 1 this 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.470
 movie considered it the best 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.660
 animation movie instead of my life 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.160
 Maybe it's because of the fact that 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.740
 company during a childhood because the 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.410
 I always saw and it is a love of none and 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.690
 I love it's called rex a dinosaur in 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.690
 new york and they are four dinosaurs that 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.730
 they travel from prehistory to the time 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.870
 of the 20th century in new york and with the 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.490
 help from a kid and a girl who is 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.980
 a super monkey have to help 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.700
 defeat an evil doctor and a circus 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.770
 of terror and the truth is that she is a lover 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.480
 of colors what wins me you can see a 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.430
 3-d movie that has been thrown away 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.260
 four years to do it I'm going to 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.240
 prefer before a movie before micro 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.480
 so then the magic that has that 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.030
 will not enter 3d 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.260
 gives too much the same movie and when 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.580
 You are small I think you need 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
 you need to have things less 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.880
 spent to unleash all 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.420
 the legislation and imagine any 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.860
 thing 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.570
 you know maybe I think that's what it is 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.130
 is losing now with the 3 to change 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.690
 13 I love the movies that are 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.830
 taking out now I love them but you already 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.570
 I say that I do not think there 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.070
 enjoyed both the movies of 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.320
 cartoons would have action this 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.360
 era that in my time of the year 90 where 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.750
 had was technicolor in tribune in dowry 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.250
 and movies really cool really good 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.420
 guys up here the video today I hope 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.860
 that you liked it as much as 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.690
 enjoyed myself looking for the list of 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.060
 movies and watching me again for 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.040
 remember them and know what I could have 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.840
 take three full days to find 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.970
 the title of that movie because I 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.410
 he remembered if a fragments and he had to 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.180
 retrieve the title to see the 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.880
 movie I think that that deserves online 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.320
 for it is the work that has supposed me and 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.870
 I hope you really liked it 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.880
 I highly recommend 100% that you see these 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.740
 five movies if you have not seen it and 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.960
 you have seen it and you have been 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.630
 enjoying with me during all the 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.370

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.340
 most beautiful in the world 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.110
 anyway, there has not been because 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.880
 it's a tiny view of five 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.740
 movies put the house description 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.690
 other movies that I also have to 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.320
 They are very good and they do not know each other 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:18.320
 a lot that I think you should see that this 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.320
 description 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.349
