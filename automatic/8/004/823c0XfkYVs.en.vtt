00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Attention this video includes 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.790
 possibly the content of the game 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.950
 reduce abortions could foam on 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.730
 own risk 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.400
 Today I tell you something 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.259
 interesting about the game portal 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.240
 Portal is known for playing a puzzle 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.920
 in ego perspective by having one 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.810
 Portal can get away in the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:25.050
 freedom has to look blue orange out 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.029
 breweries johann strauss in portal are 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.369
 there are three important characters even as 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.230
 the player so fast then bradley 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.690
 but now he is unimportant and glarus 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.579
 glarus is an artificially intelligent 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.469
 Computer of the device in the itself 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.510
 The action of the game controls game 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.910
 due to the female voice and the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.620
 point out in portal 2 the carolines 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.780
 Consciousness was clearly programmed 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.180
 computer talk to you 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.940
 Well coraline is these criteria of 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.969
 cave johnson and cave johnson 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.649
 is the creator of the computer i think 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.270
 Now we have all the important reason 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.500
 uncovered infos and can now use 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.789
 continue the main part 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.519
 stage free for the bulk hello me 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.270
 I am the main part I am the main part 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.590
 of the video 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.600
 as you could already read in the title 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.620
 you come here to load did you 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.570
 They looked at it more closely 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.490
 At first glance you only see 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.010
 Machine parts and a heap of cables 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.630
 but you look closer it looks 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.520
 construct a human 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.100
 drooping body very similar and 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.020
 that it's no coincidence because if you do that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.840
 play with the comments of gary 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.520
 bennett the art director then plays through 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.470
 He tells us that the development team 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.659
 had tried to portray glados so 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.240
 that the raw power but also the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.680
 femininity of the figure can recognize where 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.000
 he looks you it is believed she is sexy 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.729
 Bennett also said that in the first 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.440
 artworks glados on botticellis 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.830
 masterpiece the birth of venus 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.140
 based only upside down 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.480
 but as we know they are final 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.110
 Model something different from an editor 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.060
 from games.com has been more specific 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.990
 looked at and tried her figuratively 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.620
 show 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.080
 a woman can be tied up and gagged 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.790
 it is not that cave johnson in the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.650
 personality of his secretary 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.580
 had taken clear but also 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.900
 her body is about that 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.900
 probably happened 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.370
 or not 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:45.249
 the editor of the picture drawn 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.230
 has also the song in the ending on one 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:49.599
 interpreted very interesting way 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.409
 Of course that is sad and I do not want to 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.510
 live on more 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.530
 she wants to be destroyed by that 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.510
 to be freed 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.459
 who knows the English language 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.280
 Look in the description there I have 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.499
 this article can really link 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.900
 To be true, truly is one in glados 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:07.090
 live the human person or are 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.250
 it's just speculation and fantasies 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.079
 of fans that was another game 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.790
 with something shorter than the last two 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.750
 but still interesting i hope you 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.159
 the video has fallen 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.870
 do not forget to rate the video 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.609
 because that's the only way I can see if that's you 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.629
 liked the video or not and that 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.430
 I would definitely help 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.840
 if you want a few more people 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.530
 sure my videos will be happy then share 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.939
 the video 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.560
 I would be very happy about it 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.430
 that was from my side I am 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.030
