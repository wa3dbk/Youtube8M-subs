00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
even though it's this funky sort of

even though it's this funky sort of
pinky<00:03:09.510> orange<00:03:09.870> color<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:11.220> actually<00:03:11.760> tastes

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
pinky orange color it actually tastes

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.199 
pinky orange color it actually tastes
pretty<00:03:12.360> darn<00:03:12.930> good<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.440> it's<00:03:14.400> loaded<00:03:14.940> full<00:03:15.120> of

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
pretty darn good and it's loaded full of

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.220 
pretty darn good and it's loaded full of
nutrients<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.840> even<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.349> garlic<00:03:16.860> isn't<00:03:17.700> that

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
nutrients and even the garlic isn't that

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.410 
nutrients and even the garlic isn't that
overpowering<00:03:19.230> in<00:03:19.470> terms<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.890> flavor<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.700> this

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
overpowering in terms of flavor so this

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.830 
overpowering in terms of flavor so this
is<00:03:21.569> probably<00:03:21.959> one<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.319> most<00:03:22.470> nutrient<00:03:23.430> and

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
is probably one of the most nutrient and

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.690 
is probably one of the most nutrient and
