about the movie that I don't want to
know<00:02:02.460> about<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:05.180> usually<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.210> don't<00:02:06.360> but

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
know about so usually I don't but

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.680 
know about so usually I don't but
because<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.500> was<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.340> closely<00:02:09.000> related<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
because it was so closely related to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.530 
because it was so closely related to

I

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
I

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
thing is he did Mayim on did accurately

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.090 
thing is he did Mayim on did accurately
predict<00:02:26.460> his<00:02:26.810> inventory<00:02:27.810> last<00:02:28.290> week<00:02:28.590> except

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
for one thing the heavy ammo synthesis

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.360 
for one thing the heavy ammo synthesis
was<00:02:32.220> removed<00:02:33.680> maymont<00:02:34.680> predicted<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.250> he

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
was removed maymont predicted that he

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.810 
was removed maymont predicted that he
was<00:02:35.460> going<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.610> bring<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.620> surd<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.370> so

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
was going to bring it and surd in it so

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.150 
was going to bring it and surd in it so
clearly<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:39.900> guy<00:02:39.990> doesn't<00:02:40.380> have<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.890> down<00:02:41.130> to

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
clearly this guy doesn't have it down to

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.060 
clearly this guy doesn't have it down to
a<00:02:41.340> science<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:42.200> bungee<00:02:43.200> could<00:02:43.470> change<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.360> and

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
a science and bungee could change it and

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.300 
a science and bungee could change it and
personally<00:02:47.600> if<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.930> was<00:02:49.080> bungee<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.680> would

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
personally if I was bungee I would

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.760 
personally if I was bungee I would
because<00:02:50.850> this<00:02:51.030> guy<00:02:51.210> is<00:02:51.240> claiming<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:52.230> have<00:02:52.260> you

that could be a balance issue that could

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.490 
that could be a balance issue that could

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
game imagine if he could change you know

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.600 
game imagine if he could change you know
the<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:03.120> damage<00:03:03.390> values<00:03:04.050> or<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.860> lag<00:03:05.070> values

the the damage values or the lag values

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.430 
the the damage values or the lag values
playing<00:03:06.090> crucible<00:03:06.660> or<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:07.770> know<00:03:07.890> change<00:03:08.280> the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
playing crucible or you know change the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.460 
playing crucible or you know change the
the<00:03:10.440> drop<00:03:10.920> loot<00:03:11.610> system<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:12.630> know<00:03:12.750> as<00:03:13.170> he's

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
the drop loot system you know as he's

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.130 
the drop loot system you know as he's
completing<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:13.950> raid<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.550> know<00:03:14.670> look

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
completing a raid and you know look

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.170 
completing a raid and you know look
crota<00:03:16.140> just<00:03:16.380> dropped<00:03:16.620> me<00:03:17.010> six<00:03:17.460> galler<00:03:17.760> horns

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
crota just dropped me six galler horns

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.640 
crota just dropped me six galler horns
so<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.900> know<00:03:19.020> that<00:03:19.850> usually<00:03:20.850> game<00:03:21.000> developers

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
so you know that usually game developers

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.820 
so you know that usually game developers
will<00:03:22.650> react<00:03:23.070> fairly<00:03:24.000> quickly<00:03:24.270> to<00:03:24.810> address<00:03:25.500> any

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
will react fairly quickly to address any

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.540 
will react fairly quickly to address any
potential<00:03:26.490> security<00:03:27.060> or<00:03:27.710> you<00:03:28.710> know<00:03:28.830> tacking

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
potential security or you know tacking

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.200 
potential security or you know tacking

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
or glitching in their game that that

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.810 
or glitching in their game that that
allows<00:03:33.480> users<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.900> exploit<00:03:34.650> aspects<00:03:35.520> of<00:03:35.670> their

allows users to exploit aspects of their

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.080 
allows users to exploit aspects of their
games<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.390> i<00:03:36.420> could<00:03:36.870> see<00:03:37.260> Bungie<00:03:37.940> patching<00:03:38.940> or

games so i could see Bungie patching or

bungie employee which he's not claiming
that<00:03:51.360> he<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.340> don't<00:03:53.940> believe<00:03:54.240> that<00:03:54.480> this

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
that he is so I don't believe that this

that he is so I don't believe that this
this<00:03:55.410> leak<00:03:55.680> will<00:03:56.270> be<00:03:57.320> accurate<00:03:58.320> or<00:03:58.530> if<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.550> is

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
this leak will be accurate or if it is

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.130 
this leak will be accurate or if it is
accurate<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.390> do<00:04:00.450> not<00:04:00.630> think<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.930> will<00:04:01.050> be

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
accurate I do not think it will be

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.140 
accurate I do not think it will be
accurate<00:04:01.350> for<00:04:01.710> very<00:04:01.950> long<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.580> think<00:04:02.790> bunch<00:04:02.970> you

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
accurate for very long I think bunch you

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.870 
accurate for very long I think bunch you
will<00:04:03.360> patch<00:04:03.660> whatever<00:04:04.170> needs<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.500> be<00:04:04.590> patched

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
will patch whatever needs to be patched

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.180 
will patch whatever needs to be patched
so<00:04:06.020> what<00:04:07.020> does<00:04:07.110> that<00:04:07.260> mean<00:04:07.470> for<00:04:07.500> our<00:04:07.680> contest

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
so what does that mean for our contest

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.260 
so what does that mean for our contest
