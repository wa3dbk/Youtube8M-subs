be strong first of all Rex I she's a

be strong first of all Rex I she's a
basically<00:00:27.810> ad<00:00:28.170> jungler<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.010> thought<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.029> she

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
basically ad jungler I thought that she

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.849 
basically ad jungler I thought that she
was<00:00:30.240> gonna<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:30.539> more<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.990> breather<00:00:31.439> kind

everything<00:02:20.950> around<00:02:21.159> her<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.269> use<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:23.140> know

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
normal abilities and auto attacks but

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.280 
normal abilities and auto attacks but
when<00:02:26.079> she's<00:02:26.260> Underground's<00:02:27.450> your<00:02:28.450> blinds<00:02:28.780> or

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
you can see is Ward's towers alive

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.429 
you can see is Ward's towers alive
champions<00:02:33.189> minions<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.879> stuff<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:34.209> that

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
champions minions and stuff like that

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.039 
champions minions and stuff like that
but<00:02:35.439> you<00:02:36.189> basically<00:02:36.819> lose<00:02:37.209> your<00:02:37.689> like<00:02:37.840> your

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
but you basically lose your like your

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.770 
but you basically lose your like your
own<00:02:38.230> vision<00:02:38.709> so<00:02:38.920> if<00:02:39.069> you<00:02:39.159> by<00:02:39.310> yourself<00:02:39.780> you

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
own vision so if you by yourself you

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.630 
own vision so if you by yourself you
can't<00:02:41.049> see<00:02:41.260> anything<00:02:41.470> until<00:02:42.099> you<00:02:42.189> put<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.370> ward

can't see anything until you put a ward

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.629 
can't see anything until you put a ward
down<00:02:42.819> but<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:44.290> compensation<00:02:44.829> to<00:02:45.129> this<00:02:45.280> and

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
down but in compensation to this and

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.259 
down but in compensation to this and
you're<00:02:46.329> able<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.629> see<00:02:46.870> everyone's<00:02:47.379> footsteps

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
you're able to see everyone's footsteps

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.729 
you're able to see everyone's footsteps
this<00:02:49.269> includes<00:02:49.599> like<00:02:49.810> minions<00:02:50.230> monsters

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
this includes like minions monsters

this includes like minions monsters
champions<00:02:51.370> etc<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:54.879> that's<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.359> pretty

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
champions etc so in that that's a pretty

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.599 
champions etc so in that that's a pretty
interesting<00:02:56.019> mechanic<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:56.859> kind<00:02:57.159> of<00:02:57.220> liked<00:02:57.430> it

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
interesting mechanic I kind of liked it

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.250 
interesting mechanic I kind of liked it
I<00:02:57.849> thought<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.420> was<00:02:58.720> actually<00:02:59.019> really<00:02:59.139> fun

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
I thought it was actually really fun

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.080 
I thought it was actually really fun
when<00:02:59.709> you're<00:02:59.829> chasing<00:03:00.010> people<00:03:00.489> in<00:03:00.579> the<00:03:00.700> jungle

when you're chasing people in the jungle

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.879 
when you're chasing people in the jungle
like<00:03:01.420> like<00:03:01.750> they<00:03:01.900> basically<00:03:02.200> can't<00:03:02.530> Jake<00:03:02.769> you

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
like like they basically can't Jake you

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.000 
like like they basically can't Jake you
out<00:03:03.329> if<00:03:04.329> your<00:03:04.599> borrowed<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.439> also<00:03:05.709> gives<00:03:05.889> you

out if your borrowed it also gives you
more<00:03:06.310> movespeed<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.819> think<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:07.510> if<00:03:08.319> you<00:03:08.500> have

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
more movespeed I think and if you have

more movespeed I think and if you have
fury<00:03:09.010> this<00:03:09.549> champion<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.090> also<00:03:10.329> a<00:03:10.359> fury

know big it takes it could potentially
take<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.359> big<00:03:44.109> chunk<00:03:44.290> of<00:03:44.440> health<00:03:44.650> out<00:03:44.829> I<00:03:45.010> didn't

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
take a big chunk of health out I didn't

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.360 
take a big chunk of health out I didn't
find<00:03:45.459> her<00:03:46.030> by<00:03:46.239> to<00:03:46.299> speed<00:03:46.930> upgrades<00:03:47.349> even<00:03:47.799> what

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
find her by to speed upgrades even what

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.059 
find her by to speed upgrades even what
I<00:03:48.400> had<00:03:48.669> a<00:03:48.879> lot<00:03:49.209> of<00:03:49.269> fury<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.530> did<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.799> flag

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
I had a lot of fury and it did the flag

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.490 
I had a lot of fury and it did the flag
you<00:03:51.519> know<00:03:51.639> the<00:03:51.819> double<00:03:52.090> true<00:03:52.419> damage<00:03:52.750> it

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
you know the double true damage it

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.069 
you know the double true damage it
honestly<00:03:54.310> wasn't<00:03:54.609> that<00:03:54.790> great<00:03:55.000> maybe<00:03:55.870> it's

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
honestly wasn't that great maybe it's

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.520 
honestly wasn't that great maybe it's
just<00:03:56.139> me<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.879> just<00:03:57.879> didn't<00:03:58.329> find<00:03:58.569> the<00:03:59.199> damage<00:03:59.500> to

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
just me I just didn't find the damage to

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.000 
just me I just didn't find the damage to
be<00:03:59.799> that<00:04:00.400> great<00:04:00.609> to<00:04:01.030> be<00:04:01.120> honest<00:04:01.859> next<00:04:02.859> his

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
be that great to be honest next his

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.399 
be that great to be honest next his
ultimate<00:04:03.699> passively<00:04:04.419> it<00:04:04.690> gives<00:04:04.900> her<00:04:05.049> a<00:04:05.109> tack

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
ultimate passively it gives her a tack

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.670 
ultimate passively it gives her a tack
speed<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.459> active<00:04:06.819> ability<00:04:07.470> what<00:04:08.470> she

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
speed and so the active ability what she

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.449 
speed and so the active ability what she
does<00:04:08.889> is<00:04:09.190> she<00:04:09.250> screams<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:11.129> she<00:04:12.129> basically

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
does is she screams and she basically

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.550 
does is she screams and she basically
digs<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.329> one<00:04:13.569> of<00:04:13.690> her<00:04:13.750> tunnels<00:04:14.169> that<00:04:14.379> she

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
digs to one of her tunnels that she

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.720 
digs to one of her tunnels that she
makes

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
makes

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.949 
makes
I'm<00:04:15.849> pretty<00:04:16.120> sure<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:16.359> guys<00:04:16.419> already<00:04:16.750> know

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
I'm pretty sure you guys already know

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.449 
I'm pretty sure you guys already know
where<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.199> tunnels<00:04:17.590> are<00:04:17.799> which<00:04:18.220> I'll<00:04:18.370> explain

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
where the tunnels are which I'll explain

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.900 
where the tunnels are which I'll explain
in<00:04:18.820> just<00:04:18.970> a<00:04:19.120> second<00:04:19.449> Tuttle<00:04:20.440> is<00:04:20.620> her<00:04:21.160> ability

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
in just a second Tuttle is her ability

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.610 
in just a second Tuttle is her ability
when<00:04:22.419> you're<00:04:22.540> borrowed<00:04:22.840> it<00:04:23.080> basically<00:04:23.380> just

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
when you're borrowed it basically just

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.060 
when you're borrowed it basically just
creates<00:04:23.979> a<00:04:24.100> tunnel<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.630> um<00:04:25.919> you<00:04:26.919> can

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
creates a tunnel and um you can

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.560 
creates a tunnel and um you can
right-click<00:04:27.340> one<00:04:27.699> of<00:04:27.790> those<00:04:27.970> tunnels<00:04:28.240> now

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
right-click one of those tunnels now

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.120 
right-click one of those tunnels now
they<00:04:28.720> do<00:04:28.780> have<00:04:29.080> a<00:04:29.110> cooldown<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.590> how<00:04:29.919> many

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
they do have a cooldown of how many

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.280 
they do have a cooldown of how many
times<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:30.580> could<00:04:30.699> use<00:04:30.910> them<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:32.139> can

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
times you could use them but you can

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.900 
times you could use them but you can
right-click<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.740> tunnel<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:33.250> wreck<00:04:33.610> site<00:04:33.820> will

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
right-click a tunnel and wreck site will

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.000 
right-click a tunnel and wreck site will
burrow<00:04:34.120> under<00:04:34.479> it<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:34.780> go<00:04:35.350> out<00:04:35.500> from<00:04:35.800> the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
burrow under it and go out from the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.750 
burrow under it and go out from the
other<00:04:36.220> side<00:04:37.410> so<00:04:38.410> it's<00:04:38.800> a<00:04:38.889> pretty<00:04:39.040> cool<00:04:39.250> ability

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
other side so it's a pretty cool ability

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.129 
other side so it's a pretty cool ability
I<00:04:39.790> actually<00:04:40.000> really<00:04:40.360> liked<00:04:40.600> it<00:04:40.750> it's<00:04:40.900> really

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
I actually really liked it it's really

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.560 
I actually really liked it it's really
unique<00:04:41.320> people<00:04:42.280> can<00:04:42.520> also<00:04:42.610> step<00:04:43.060> on<00:04:43.210> them<00:04:43.389> to

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
unique people can also step on them to

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.689 
unique people can also step on them to
destroy<00:04:43.780> them<00:04:44.110> which<00:04:44.530> is<00:04:44.710> pretty<00:04:45.310> cool<00:04:45.550> as

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
destroy them which is pretty cool as

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.070 
destroy them which is pretty cool as
well<00:04:46.979> but<00:04:47.979> annoying<00:04:48.400> at<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.610> same<00:04:48.820> time<00:04:49.030> so<00:04:49.720> I

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
well but annoying at the same time so I

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.980 
well but annoying at the same time so I
honestly<00:04:50.860> I've<00:04:51.370> really<00:04:52.180> liked<00:04:52.360> this<00:04:52.510> mechanic

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
honestly I've really liked this mechanic

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.390 
honestly I've really liked this mechanic
with<00:04:53.169> the<00:04:53.199> tunnels<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:53.710> everything<00:04:54.130> it's

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
with the tunnels and everything it's

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.490 
with the tunnels and everything it's
like<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.090> can<00:04:55.240> just<00:04:55.270> you<00:04:56.199> can<00:04:56.260> use<00:04:56.470> it

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
like you can just you can use it

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.710 
like you can just you can use it
anywhere<00:04:56.889> as<00:04:57.190> well<00:04:57.430> like<00:04:57.729> it's<00:04:58.150> long<00:04:58.449> as<00:04:58.570> it's

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
anywhere as well like it's long as it's

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.540 
anywhere as well like it's long as it's
off<00:04:58.870> cooldown<00:04:59.199> you<00:04:59.740> could<00:04:59.860> just<00:05:00.010> use<00:05:00.220> it<00:05:00.400> you

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
off cooldown you could just use it you

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.189 
off cooldown you could just use it you
could<00:05:00.669> tunnel<00:05:00.820> anywhere<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.510> can<00:05:01.840> use<00:05:01.960> it<00:05:02.110> as

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
could tunnel anywhere you can use it as

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.159 
could tunnel anywhere you can use it as
like<00:05:02.410> a<00:05:02.440> gap<00:05:02.770> closer<00:05:03.100> or<00:05:03.550> you<00:05:04.419> can<00:05:04.570> use<00:05:04.780> it<00:05:04.810> to

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
like a gap closer or you can use it to

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.230 
like a gap closer or you can use it to
just<00:05:05.410> escape<00:05:05.740> or<00:05:06.580> whatever<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.090> doesn't

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
just escape or whatever it doesn't

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.110 
just escape or whatever it doesn't
really<00:05:07.510> matter<00:05:08.039> but<00:05:09.039> yeah<00:05:09.220> Harold<00:05:09.729> tonight

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
really matter but yeah Harold tonight

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.850 
really matter but yeah Harold tonight
basically<00:05:10.330> what<00:05:10.630> you<00:05:10.750> do<00:05:10.870> is<00:05:10.900> you<00:05:11.199> channel<00:05:11.560> for

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
basically what you do is you channel for

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.090 
basically what you do is you channel for
a<00:05:12.190> second<00:05:12.660> and<00:05:13.660> you<00:05:13.900> just<00:05:14.080> charge<00:05:14.380> toward<00:05:14.800> any

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
a second and you just charge toward any

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.840 
a second and you just charge toward any
of<00:05:15.340> your<00:05:15.520> tunnels<00:05:16.000> that<00:05:16.090> you<00:05:16.210> made<00:05:16.360> globally

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
of your tunnels that you made globally

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.430 
of your tunnels that you made globally
now<00:05:18.850> she<00:05:18.940> does<00:05:19.240> let<00:05:19.419> off<00:05:19.570> like<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:19.810> like<00:05:20.260> with

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
now she does let off like a like with

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.760 
now she does let off like a like with
science<00:05:20.800> ultimate<00:05:21.250> he<00:05:22.030> makes<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:22.720> noise<00:05:22.870> or

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
science ultimate he makes that noise or

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.740 
science ultimate he makes that noise or
that<00:05:24.190> you<00:05:24.400> know<00:05:24.490> that<00:05:24.669> there's<00:05:24.880> like<00:05:25.419> a<00:05:25.450> noise

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
that you know that there's like a noise

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.930 
that you know that there's like a noise
made<00:05:26.080> over<00:05:26.800> excitation<00:05:27.160> she<00:05:27.610> lets<00:05:27.760> out<00:05:27.880> a

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
made over excitation she lets out a

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.640 
made over excitation she lets out a
scream<00:05:28.150> everyone<00:05:28.780> can<00:05:28.930> hear<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.229> and<00:05:29.470> she

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
scream everyone can hear it and she

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.700 
scream everyone can hear it and she
charges<00:05:30.190> towards<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:30.639> now<00:05:31.320> it's<00:05:32.320> kind<00:05:32.530> of<00:05:32.560> like

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
charges towards it now it's kind of like

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.629 
charges towards it now it's kind of like
TF<00:05:33.070> faulty<00:05:33.460> except<00:05:33.940> for<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:34.150> fact<00:05:34.300> that<00:05:35.639> it

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
TF faulty except for the fact that it

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.670 
TF faulty except for the fact that it
gets<00:05:36.849> interrupted<00:05:37.270> if<00:05:37.750> you<00:05:37.900> take<00:05:38.080> damage<00:05:38.289> by

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
gets interrupted if you take damage by

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.710 
gets interrupted if you take damage by
anything<00:05:39.220> like<00:05:39.610> you<00:05:39.940> can't<00:05:40.180> just<00:05:40.360> use<00:05:40.510> it<00:05:40.690> as

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
anything like you can't just use it as

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.330 
anything like you can't just use it as
an<00:05:40.960> escape<00:05:41.169> ability<00:05:41.740> just<00:05:41.889> to<00:05:41.979> get<00:05:42.160> out<00:05:42.190> of

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
an escape ability just to get out of

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.550 
an escape ability just to get out of
sticky<00:05:42.669> situations<00:05:42.880> you<00:05:43.450> have<00:05:43.630> to<00:05:43.840> channel<00:05:44.440> it

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
sticky situations you have to channel it

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.080 
sticky situations you have to channel it
for<00:05:44.740> one<00:05:44.889> and<00:05:45.010> a<00:05:45.039> half<00:05:45.070> seconds<00:05:45.580> and<00:05:45.700> not<00:05:45.789> take

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
for one and a half seconds and not take

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.409 
for one and a half seconds and not take
any<00:05:46.360> damage<00:05:46.630> at<00:05:46.990> all<00:05:47.139> or<00:05:47.590> else<00:05:47.800> it<00:05:48.010> will<00:05:48.099> cancel

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
any damage at all or else it will cancel

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.800 
any damage at all or else it will cancel
so<00:05:50.160> that's<00:05:51.160> a<00:05:51.550> bit<00:05:51.849> annoying<00:05:51.970> but<00:05:52.300> I<00:05:52.510> guess

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
so that's a bit annoying but I guess

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.469 
so that's a bit annoying but I guess
it's<00:05:53.020> pretty<00:05:53.349> useful<00:05:53.560> for<00:05:53.979> like<00:05:54.099> just<00:05:54.479> you

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
it's pretty useful for like just you

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.230 
it's pretty useful for like just you
know<00:05:55.599> switching<00:05:56.169> two<00:05:56.380> lanes<00:05:56.620> or<00:05:56.830> whatever<00:05:57.240> it

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
know switching two lanes or whatever it

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.330 
know switching two lanes or whatever it
does<00:05:58.510> also<00:05:58.840> has<00:05:59.139> a<00:05:59.169> really<00:05:59.470> high<00:05:59.530> cool<00:05:59.979> down<00:06:00.190> as

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
does also has a really high cool down as

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.909 
does also has a really high cool down as
well<00:06:00.550> I<00:06:00.789> feel<00:06:01.780> as<00:06:01.960> though<00:06:01.990> the<00:06:02.200> cooldown<00:06:02.710> for

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
well I feel as though the cooldown for

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.680 
well I feel as though the cooldown for
whole<00:06:03.070> ultimate<00:06:03.700> as<00:06:03.849> a<00:06:03.880> bit<00:06:04.120> higher<00:06:04.330> and<00:06:04.570> they

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
whole ultimate as a bit higher and they

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.879 
whole ultimate as a bit higher and they
need<00:06:04.870> a<00:06:04.900> bit<00:06:05.080> of<00:06:05.110> tweaking<00:06:05.320> there<00:06:05.650> in<00:06:05.770> my

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
need a bit of tweaking there in my

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.779 
need a bit of tweaking there in my
opinion<00:06:06.190> but<00:06:07.470> obviously<00:06:08.470> if<00:06:08.830> people<00:06:09.220> you<00:06:09.669> know

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
opinion but obviously if people you know

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.550 
opinion but obviously if people you know
if<00:06:09.910> people<00:06:10.060> if<00:06:10.720> Wyatt<00:06:10.990> finds<00:06:11.289> that<00:06:11.440> this

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
if people if Wyatt finds that this

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.990 
if people if Wyatt finds that this
champion<00:06:12.070> isn't<00:06:12.400> strong<00:06:12.580> enough<00:06:12.639> they'll

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
champion isn't strong enough they'll

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.629 
champion isn't strong enough they'll
simply<00:06:13.270> just<00:06:13.479> buffer

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
simply just buffer

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.270 
simply just buffer
and<00:06:15.509> what<00:06:15.719> was<00:06:15.840> her<00:06:15.990> first<00:06:16.259> ability<00:06:16.499> i<00:06:16.710> forgot

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
and what was her first ability i forgot

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.879 
and what was her first ability i forgot
to<00:06:17.310> mention<00:06:17.400> one<00:06:17.849> of<00:06:17.879> them<00:06:18.120> her<00:06:19.110> skill<00:06:19.680> shot

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
to mention one of them her skill shot

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.770 
to mention one of them her skill shot
ability<00:06:20.370> when<00:06:20.550> she's<00:06:20.699> underground<00:06:21.210> the<00:06:21.449> queue

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
ability when she's underground the queue

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.080 
ability when she's underground the queue
that<00:06:22.620> ability<00:06:23.249> was<00:06:23.840> it's<00:06:24.840> really<00:06:25.680> lackluster

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
that ability was it's really lackluster

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.230 
that ability was it's really lackluster
it<00:06:27.090> I<00:06:27.689> was<00:06:28.650> hoping<00:06:29.099> for<00:06:29.159> like<00:06:29.460> a<00:06:29.520> slow<00:06:29.939> on

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
it I was hoping for like a slow on

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.839 
it I was hoping for like a slow on
disability<00:06:30.870> but<00:06:31.620> it<00:06:31.949> doesn't<00:06:32.340> even<00:06:32.460> give<00:06:32.759> you

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849 
disability but it doesn't even give you

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:34.550 
disability but it doesn't even give you
that<00:06:33.029> all<00:06:33.270> it<00:06:33.419> does<00:06:33.569> just<00:06:33.960> it<00:06:34.139> just<00:06:34.319> does

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
that all it does just it just does

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.709 
that all it does just it just does
damage<00:06:34.889> and<00:06:35.219> reveals<00:06:35.580> them<00:06:35.849> that's<00:06:36.449> pretty

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:36.719 
damage and reveals them that's pretty

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:38.839 
damage and reveals them that's pretty
much<00:06:36.870> it<00:06:36.930> i<00:06:37.289> mean<00:06:37.409> it<00:06:37.650> does<00:06:37.830> have<00:06:38.039> like<00:06:38.370> it's<00:06:38.789> a

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
much it i mean it does have like it's a

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:43.369 
much it i mean it does have like it's a
really<00:06:39.180> long<00:06:39.599> skill<00:06:40.020> shot<00:06:40.259> but<00:06:41.810> yeah<00:06:42.810> it's

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:43.379 
really long skill shot but yeah it's

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:46.399 
really long skill shot but yeah it's
just<00:06:43.999> it's<00:06:44.999> honestly<00:06:45.360> not<00:06:45.449> that<00:06:45.689> good<00:06:46.050> in<00:06:46.319> my

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:46.409 
just it's honestly not that good in my

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:48.860 
just it's honestly not that good in my
opinion<00:06:46.590> it<00:06:47.219> it<00:06:47.430> needs<00:06:47.729> some<00:06:48.029> sort<00:06:48.270> of<00:06:48.330> slow<00:06:48.659> or

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
opinion it it needs some sort of slow or

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.200 
opinion it it needs some sort of slow or
something<00:06:49.259> at<00:06:49.379> least<00:06:49.430> to<00:06:50.430> make<00:06:50.580> it<00:06:50.759> more

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
something at least to make it more

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.179 
something at least to make it more
useful<00:06:52.969> but<00:06:54.080> yeah<00:06:55.080> I<00:06:55.110> honestly<00:06:55.889> think<00:06:56.069> that

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:56.189 
useful but yeah I honestly think that

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:00.019 
useful but yeah I honestly think that
this<00:06:56.610> rack<00:06:56.969> say<00:06:57.180> she<00:06:58.129> was<00:06:59.129> just<00:06:59.310> such<00:07:00.000> a

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:00.029 
this rack say she was just such a

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:01.820 
this rack say she was just such a
deceiving<00:07:00.689> champion<00:07:01.229> I<00:07:01.319> think<00:07:01.560> she<00:07:01.680> could

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
deceiving champion I think she could

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.980 
deceiving champion I think she could
have<00:07:01.919> been<00:07:02.039> a<00:07:02.069> bit<00:07:02.250> better<00:07:02.509> that's<00:07:03.509> just<00:07:03.659> my

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
have been a bit better that's just my

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.079 
have been a bit better that's just my
opinion<00:07:04.020> at<00:07:04.590> least<00:07:04.620> I<00:07:05.159> I've<00:07:05.580> only<00:07:05.789> played<00:07:05.969> like

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:06.089 
opinion at least I I've only played like

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:10.399 
opinion at least I I've only played like
three<00:07:06.659> to<00:07:06.839> four<00:07:06.990> games<00:07:07.169> of<00:07:07.439> her<00:07:07.589> so<00:07:07.889> far<00:07:09.409> but

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:10.409 
three to four games of her so far but

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:11.990 
three to four games of her so far but
yeah<00:07:10.589> that's<00:07:10.800> pretty<00:07:11.039> much<00:07:11.159> it<00:07:11.279> i<00:07:11.580> just<00:07:11.639> i<00:07:11.969> just

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 
yeah that's pretty much it i just i just

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.489 
yeah that's pretty much it i just i just
think<00:07:12.300> she<00:07:12.389> could<00:07:12.599> be<00:07:12.689> a<00:07:13.169> bit<00:07:13.620> better<00:07:13.879> but<00:07:15.499> yeah

00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:16.499 
think she could be a bit better but yeah

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:18.829 
think she could be a bit better but yeah
she<00:07:17.099> is<00:07:17.129> really<00:07:17.460> fun<00:07:17.759> though<00:07:17.909> she's<00:07:18.150> i<00:07:18.360> really

00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:18.839 
she is really fun though she's i really

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:21.589 
she is really fun though she's i really
like<00:07:18.990> the<00:07:19.110> mechanics<00:07:19.560> say<00:07:20.150> they<00:07:21.150> gave<00:07:21.389> her

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 
like the mechanics say they gave her

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:25.100 
like the mechanics say they gave her
like<00:07:21.870> the<00:07:22.050> burrowing<00:07:22.409> the<00:07:23.099> underground<00:07:24.110> the

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.110 
like the burrowing the underground the

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.510 
like the burrowing the underground the
tunnels<00:07:25.500> and<00:07:25.680> everything<00:07:26.009> I<00:07:26.159> think<00:07:26.400> those

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 
tunnels and everything I think those

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.209 
tunnels and everything I think those
really<00:07:26.819> cool<00:07:27.029> but<00:07:27.330> yeah<00:07:27.659> I<00:07:28.020> just<00:07:28.949> think<00:07:29.129> that

00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:29.219 
really cool but yeah I just think that

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:30.740
