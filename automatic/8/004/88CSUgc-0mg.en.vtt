deficiencies in six of them two of them

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.310

got them later in life that's the brown

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.730 
got them later in life that's the brown
one<00:00:52.650> here<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.820> gold<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.330> here<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.170> it

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
one here and the gold one here and it

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.500 
one here and the gold one here and it
was<00:00:55.920> very<00:00:56.160> easy<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.490> treat<00:00:56.820> them<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.240> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
was very easy to treat them but the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.840 
was very easy to treat them but the
small<00:00:57.780> ones<00:00:58.140> unfortunately<00:00:59.040> we<00:00:59.130> lost<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.579> do

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
small ones unfortunately we lost to do

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.430 
small ones unfortunately we lost to do
two<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.690> think<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.170> must<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.350> been

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
two and I think it must have been

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.440 
two and I think it must have been
deficiencies<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.610> two<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.150> them<00:01:03.300> actually

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450
