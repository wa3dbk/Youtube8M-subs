didn't believe it in the beginning and I

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.910 
didn't believe it in the beginning and I
guess<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.250> didn't<00:02:02.549> want<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.820> believe<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.210> and

hasn't<00:02:04.920> affected<00:02:05.369> me<00:02:05.490> too<00:02:05.670> much<00:02:05.850> being<00:02:06.210> here

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
hasn't affected me too much being here

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.800 
hasn't affected me too much being here
because<00:02:06.719> I'm<00:02:07.380> kind<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.799> out<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:10.610> real<00:02:11.610> life<00:02:11.849> and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
because I'm kind of out of real life and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.149 
because I'm kind of out of real life and
but<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.930> know<00:02:13.989> it's<00:02:14.379> just<00:02:14.500> going<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:14.800> get<00:02:14.980> harder

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159
