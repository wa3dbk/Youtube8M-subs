things<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.980> android<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.760> webos<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.379> i<00:00:49.440> still

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
things in android in webos and i still

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.740 
things in android in webos and i still
think<00:00:49.860> webos<00:00:50.340> might<00:00:50.879> well<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> better<00:00:51.660> than

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
think webos might well do it better than

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.779 
think webos might well do it better than
android<00:00:52.350> right<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.860> got<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.129> notifications

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
android right you got your notifications

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.189 
android right you got your notifications
down<00:00:53.969> there<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.270> bottom<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:54.719> whereas

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
down there on the bottom right whereas

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.630 
down there on the bottom right whereas
android<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> little<00:00:56.190> window<00:00:56.399> shade

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
android you have a little window shade

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.040 
android you have a little window shade
you<00:00:56.760> pull<00:00:56.940> down<00:00:56.969> from<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> top<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.960> in

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
you pull down from the top I like in

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.209 
you pull down from the top I like in
both<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.260> lot<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.590> think<00:00:58.829> they're<00:00:58.920> both<00:00:59.039> pretty

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
both a lot I think they're both pretty

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.709 
both a lot I think they're both pretty
good<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.520> think<00:00:59.730> webos<00:01:00.270> might<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> little

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
good I think webos might do a little

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
good I think webos might do a little
better<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> cards<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
better and here we see the cards and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.460 
better and here we see the cards and
webos<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.750> how<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.110> handles

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
webos this is how it handles

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530 
webos this is how it handles
multitasking<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.430> again<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> think<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.390> does

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
multitasking and again I think it does

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.390 
multitasking and again I think it does
it<00:01:06.659> better<00:01:06.840> than<00:01:06.930> anybody<00:01:07.320> here's<00:01:08.220> how<00:01:08.340> you

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
it better than anybody here's how you

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.070 
it better than anybody here's how you

apps<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:34.439> webos<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.670> simple<00:01:35.939> now

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
apps on webos it's just so simple now

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.749 
apps on webos it's just so simple now
you<00:01:37.170> don't<00:01:37.350> have<00:01:37.409> quite<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> same<00:01:38.579> home

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
you don't have quite the same home

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.520 
you don't have quite the same home
screen<00:01:39.030> experience<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.720> obviously<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.290> evo

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
screen experience and obviously the evo

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.960 
screen experience and obviously the evo
doesn't<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> keyboard<00:01:41.280> look<00:01:41.729> at<00:01:41.850> that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
doesn't have a keyboard look at that

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.190 
doesn't have a keyboard look at that
when<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.210> open<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.509> keyboard<00:01:42.689> up<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
when you open the keyboard up and the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.740 
when you open the keyboard up and the
pre<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.470> actually<00:01:43.770> taller<00:01:44.030> than<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.180> evo<00:01:45.450> so

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
pre it's actually taller than the evo so

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.780 
pre it's actually taller than the evo so
that's<00:01:45.899> interesting<00:01:46.189> here's<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.310> look<00:01:47.490> at<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
that's interesting here's a look at the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.969 
that's interesting here's a look at the
thickness<00:01:48.090> pre<00:01:48.840> definitely<00:01:49.259> wins<00:01:49.500> out<00:01:49.710> there

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
thickness pre definitely wins out there

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.609 
thickness pre definitely wins out there
at<00:01:50.790> least<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.270> far<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.229> which<00:01:52.380> ones

at least as far as you know which ones

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
that a little shot there's typing right

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.460 
that a little shot there's typing right
obviously<00:02:18.150> typing<00:02:18.720> on<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.840> keyboard<00:02:19.050> a

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
obviously typing on a keyboard a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.559 
obviously typing on a keyboard a
physical<00:02:19.920> keyboard<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.489> lot<00:02:20.910> different<00:02:21.180> and

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
physical keyboard is a lot different and

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.320 
physical keyboard is a lot different and
generally<00:02:22.110> better<00:02:22.319> than<00:02:23.069> an<00:02:24.030> on-screen

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
generally better than an on-screen

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.900 
generally better than an on-screen
keyboard<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.500> evo<00:02:25.769> is<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.099> so<00:02:26.310> darn<00:02:26.519> big

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
keyboard but the evo is just so darn big

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.140 
keyboard but the evo is just so darn big
right<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:28.049> on-screen<00:02:28.590> keyboard<00:02:28.970> really<00:02:29.970> is

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
right the on-screen keyboard really is

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.559 
right the on-screen keyboard really is
easy<00:02:30.390> for<00:02:30.660> me<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.810> use<00:02:31.110> with<00:02:31.379> this<00:02:32.060> it's<00:02:33.060> you

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
easy for me to use with this it's you

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.119 
easy for me to use with this it's you
know<00:02:33.690> it's<00:02:33.720> not<00:02:34.200> as<00:02:34.349> big<00:02:34.470> as<00:02:34.620> like<00:02:34.830> something

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
know it's not as big as like something

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.430 
know it's not as big as like something
like<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.370> iPad<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:36.989> certainly<00:02:37.110> bigger

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
like the iPad but it's certainly bigger

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.190 
like the iPad but it's certainly bigger
