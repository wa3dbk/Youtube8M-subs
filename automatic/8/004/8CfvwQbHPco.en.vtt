00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
after the game and it was not a pleasant

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.270 
after the game and it was not a pleasant
moment<00:01:02.239> you<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.860> I<00:01:05.450> know<00:01:06.450> how<00:01:06.950> down<00:01:07.950> you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
moment you just I I know how down you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.160 
moment you just I I know how down you
were<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> other<00:01:09.090> hand<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.619> said

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
were but on the other hand you just said

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.660 
were but on the other hand you just said
we<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.380> got<00:01:13.590> our<00:01:13.740> ass<00:01:13.890> kicked<00:01:13.920> out<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.490> there

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
we just got our ass kicked out of there

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.070 
we just got our ass kicked out of there
and<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.850> couldn't<00:01:15.210> get<00:01:15.299> off<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> field<00:01:15.720> fast

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and I couldn't get off the field fast

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.100 
and I couldn't get off the field fast
enough<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.650> think<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.280> was<00:01:17.460> kind<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.930> what<00:01:18.930> she

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
enough I think that was kind of what she

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.990 
enough I think that was kind of what she
said<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.500> me<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.009> was<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.490> was<00:01:20.790> it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
said to me and it was just that was it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.920 
said to me and it was just that was it
and<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.810> think<00:01:22.850> when<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.939> talk<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.750> Holy

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
and I think when you talk about the Holy

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.710 
and I think when you talk about the Holy
Grail<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.320> coming<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.030> close<00:01:27.360> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
Grail and coming to get that close and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.999 
Grail and coming to get that close and
and<00:01:29.570> in<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.780> way<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.259> far<00:01:31.500> away<00:01:31.530> at<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
and in a way to be that far away at the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:52.040 
and in a way to be that far away at the
same<00:01:32.189> time

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.350 

typical<00:01:53.050> China<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:54.630> well<00:01:55.630> I<00:01:57.150> thought<00:01:58.150> you're

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
typical China but well I thought you're

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.270 
typical China but well I thought you're
a<00:01:58.390> great<00:01:58.660> coach<00:01:58.900> I<00:01:59.230> said<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.710> good<00:01:59.860> thing<00:02:00.130> we

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
a great coach I said the good thing we

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.420 
a great coach I said the good thing we
did<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:01.020> after<00:02:02.020> so<00:02:02.470> many<00:02:02.560> years<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:03.130> people

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
did is after so many years of people

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.970 
did is after so many years of people
telling<00:02:03.460> us<00:02:03.760> how<00:02:03.970> bad<00:02:04.180> was<00:02:04.620> work

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
telling us how bad was work

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:17.180 
telling us how bad was work
you<00:02:06.670> came<00:02:06.910> in<00:02:07.120> and<00:02:07.300> gave<00:02:07.900> us<00:02:08.110> confidence<00:02:08.320> and<00:02:15.900> I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
you came in and gave us confidence and I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.800 
you came in and gave us confidence and I
said<00:02:18.190> but<00:02:18.340> your<00:02:18.460> weakness<00:02:18.670> was<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.690> you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
said but your weakness was is that you

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.600 
said but your weakness was is that you
didn't<00:02:20.050> override<00:02:20.410> your<00:02:20.590> coaching<00:02:20.950> staff<00:02:21.190> when

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
didn't override your coaching staff when

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.970 
didn't override your coaching staff when
they<00:02:21.700> were<00:02:21.790> making<00:02:21.940> poor<00:02:22.270> decisions<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:26.410> I

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
they were making poor decisions and I

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.150 
they were making poor decisions and I
thought<00:02:27.360> let's<00:02:28.360> tackle<00:02:28.830> going<00:02:29.830> into<00:02:30.040> that

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
thought let's tackle going into that

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.780 
thought let's tackle going into that
game<00:02:30.400> we<00:02:31.360> had<00:02:31.510> run<00:02:31.780> we<00:02:32.230> had<00:02:32.410> won<00:02:32.740> games<00:02:33.280> for<00:02:33.610> two

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
game we had run we had won games for two

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.000 
game we had run we had won games for two
reasons<00:02:34.240> one<00:02:34.830> we<00:02:35.830> started<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.810> track<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.950> to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
reasons one we started this track so to

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.280 
reasons one we started this track so to
speak<00:02:39.400> when<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.330> broke<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.180> think<00:02:43.480> not

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
speak when it broke and I think not

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.010 
speak when it broke and I think not
starting<00:02:44.770> him<00:02:44.890> was<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.130> huge<00:02:45.400> mistake<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:46.180> said

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
starting him was a huge mistake I said

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.260 
starting him was a huge mistake I said
the<00:02:47.350> second<00:02:47.800> thing<00:02:47.830> was<00:02:48.340> we<00:02:48.700> went<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:49.000> here

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
the second thing was we went in here

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.020 
the second thing was we went in here
with<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.170> passing<00:02:50.650> attack<00:02:50.920> trying<00:02:51.490> to<00:02:51.730> surprise

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
with a passing attack trying to surprise

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.770 
with a passing attack trying to surprise
people

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
people

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.449 
people
you<00:02:52.959> never<00:02:53.140> good<00:02:53.470> away<00:02:53.709> from<00:02:54.010> what<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:54.280> do

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
you never good away from what you do

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.180 
you never good away from what you do
best<00:02:56.760> we<00:02:57.760> should<00:02:57.940> attack<00:02:58.330> them<00:02:58.920> not<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.040> beat

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
best we should attack them not to beat

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.540 
best we should attack them not to beat
them<00:03:00.340> with<00:03:00.519> it

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:19.240 

and<00:03:06.210> if<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.870> remember<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.380> Miami<00:03:08.130> Dolphins

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.130 

we<00:03:20.250> pounded<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.820> one<00:03:21.000> too<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.540> we<00:03:21.900> warm

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
we pounded that one too and we warm

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:37.340 
we pounded that one too and we warm
specialty<00:03:22.770> specialty<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:36.020> think<00:03:37.020> the

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
specialty specialty so I think the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:57.620 
specialty specialty so I think the
frustration<00:03:37.860> war<00:03:38.280> was<00:03:49.550> some<00:03:56.630> determination

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
frustration war was some determination

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:07.940
