00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
what does this weapon actually do well

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.420 
what does this weapon actually do well
let's<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.039> get<00:00:20.190> it

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
let's you get it

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.430 
let's you get it
well<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:21.060> weapon<00:00:21.420> pretty<00:00:21.840> much<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
well this weapon pretty much is just a

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.050 
well this weapon pretty much is just a
faster<00:00:22.920> version<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.340> all<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> other<00:00:23.730> rollers

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
faster version of all the other rollers

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
faster version of all the other rollers
but<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:25.020> cannot<00:00:25.320> run<00:00:25.560> into<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> opponent<00:00:26.220> to

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
but you cannot run into the opponent to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.120 
but you cannot run into the opponent to
kill<00:00:26.490> them<00:00:26.640> it'll<00:00:26.850> only<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.150> 70%<00:00:27.930> or<00:00:28.140> 70<00:00:28.769> damage

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
kill them it'll only do 70% or 70 damage

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.640 
kill them it'll only do 70% or 70 damage
I<00:00:29.220> guess<00:00:29.430> so<00:00:30.180> you<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.960> actually<00:00:31.080> shoot<00:00:31.529> at

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
I guess so you have to actually shoot at

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.009 
I guess so you have to actually shoot at
them<00:00:31.800> which<00:00:32.340> may<00:00:32.669> first<00:00:33.000> sound<00:00:33.300> pretty<00:00:33.600> weird

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:34.019 
them which may first sound pretty weird

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:35.899 
them which may first sound pretty weird
pretty<00:00:34.319> not<00:00:34.620> usual<00:00:35.069> but<00:00:35.429> what<00:00:35.609> you<00:00:35.699> can<00:00:35.819> do

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:35.909 
pretty not usual but what you can do

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:37.669 
pretty not usual but what you can do
with<00:00:35.999> this<00:00:36.089> ball<00:00:36.479> or<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> lot<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.199> just<00:00:37.409> keep

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:37.679 
with this ball or a lot is just keep

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.349 
with this ball or a lot is just keep
spreading<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.280> ink<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:38.609> I<00:00:38.699> keep<00:00:38.940> pressing<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:39.359 
spreading the ink if I keep pressing the

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:40.849 
spreading the ink if I keep pressing the
attack<00:00:39.449> button<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.530> kind<00:00:40.679> of<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
attack button and it's kind of like a

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.709 
attack button and it's kind of like a
really<00:00:41.100> good<00:00:41.309> shotgun<00:00:41.819> that<00:00:41.940> lets<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.210> get

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
really good shotgun that lets you get

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.599 
really good shotgun that lets you get
all<00:00:42.960> over<00:00:43.199> the<00:00:43.319> ground<00:00:43.530> one<00:00:44.069> of<00:00:44.159> my<00:00:44.219> favorites

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
all over the ground one of my favorites

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.879 
all over the ground one of my favorites
in<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> game<00:00:44.909> but<00:00:45.600> yeah<00:00:46.379> that's<00:00:46.649> pretty<00:00:46.769> much

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:46.889 
in the game but yeah that's pretty much

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:49.430 
in the game but yeah that's pretty much
it<00:00:46.979> what<00:00:47.429> it<00:00:47.549> has<00:00:47.670> as<00:00:47.879> far<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.359> sub<00:00:48.839> and<00:00:49.079> special

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it what it has as far as sub and special

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.410 
it what it has as far as sub and special
though<00:00:49.559> has<00:00:49.799> the<00:00:49.889> burst<00:00:50.069> bomb<00:00:50.190> which<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.149> don't

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
though has the burst bomb which I don't

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.419 
though has the burst bomb which I don't
really<00:00:51.569> find<00:00:51.780> much<00:00:52.109> juice<00:00:52.319> of<00:00:52.530> especially<00:00:53.339> in

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
really find much juice of especially in

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.219 
really find much juice of especially in
ranked<00:00:53.729> but<00:00:54.299> it<00:00:54.600> also<00:00:54.749> has<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> inkzooka

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
ranked but it also has the inkzooka

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.250 
ranked but it also has the inkzooka
which<00:00:56.010> when<00:00:56.369> you<00:00:56.459> run<00:00:56.639> out<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.879> ink<00:00:57.420> completely

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
which when you run out of ink completely

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.509 
which when you run out of ink completely
on<00:00:58.440> your<00:00:58.589> carbon<00:00:58.859> roller<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.309> switch<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
on your carbon roller you can switch to

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.069 
on your carbon roller you can switch to
that<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.999> you<00:01:00.299> can<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.569> lot<00:01:00.899> of

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that and you can get a lot of

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.299 
that and you can get a lot of
straightaways<00:01:01.529> which<00:01:01.739> are<00:01:01.889> very<00:01:02.039> strong

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
straightaways which are very strong

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.789 
straightaways which are very strong
especially<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:03.149> ranked<00:01:03.389> maps<00:01:03.569> so<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.680> is

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
especially in ranked maps so this is

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.200 
especially in ranked maps so this is
really<00:01:05.010> good<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.219> rank<00:01:05.399> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.640> also<00:01:05.909> really

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
really good for rank this is also really

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.910 
really good for rank this is also really
good<00:01:06.359> for<00:01:06.479> unranked<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.560> kind<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.799> good

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
good for unranked this is kind of good

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.550 
good for unranked this is kind of good
for<00:01:07.979> everything<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:09.149> next<00:01:09.719> what<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.289> I<00:01:10.380> like

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
for everything but next what do I like

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.289 
for everything but next what do I like
to<00:01:10.740> have<00:01:10.859> on<00:01:11.039> it<00:01:11.159> well<00:01:11.640> pretty<00:01:11.969> much<00:01:12.090> all<00:01:12.270> I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
to have on it well pretty much all I

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
to have on it well pretty much all I
really<00:01:12.539> like<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.899> ink<00:01:13.140> recovery<00:01:13.289> up<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.009> then

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
really like is ink recovery up and then

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.580 
really like is ink recovery up and then
of<00:01:14.820> course<00:01:14.939> more<00:01:15.299> ink<00:01:15.479> recovery<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.899> this<00:01:16.439> is

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
of course more ink recovery up this is

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.779 
of course more ink recovery up this is
all<00:01:16.679> my<00:01:16.770> secondary<00:01:17.100> account<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.399> course<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
all my secondary account of course and

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.389 
all my secondary account of course and
then<00:01:17.939> ink<00:01:18.450> resistance<00:01:18.840> up<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:19.619> once<00:01:20.250> you

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
then ink resistance up because once you

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.450 
then ink resistance up because once you
do<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.700> out<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.909> your<00:01:21.630> little<00:01:22.530> carbon<00:01:23.280> roller

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
do get out of your little carbon roller

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
do get out of your little carbon roller
status<00:01:24.119> sometimes<00:01:25.020> you'll<00:01:25.200> run<00:01:25.229> onto<00:01:25.469> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
status sometimes you'll run onto the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.200 
status sometimes you'll run onto the
opponent's<00:01:25.979> ink<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.369> ink<00:01:26.640> resistance<00:01:26.820> is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
opponent's ink and ink resistance is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.649 
opponent's ink and ink resistance is
always<00:01:27.509> good<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.009> finally<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.390> ink

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
time which is something pretty similar

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.980 
time which is something pretty similar
just<00:04:32.640> to<00:04:32.850> this<00:04:32.970> weapon<00:04:33.210> like<00:04:33.570> most<00:04:33.840> weapons

the<00:05:05.160> tower<00:05:05.310> way<00:05:05.550> too<00:05:05.610> well<00:05:05.880> but<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.660> know<00:05:06.780> it's

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
the tower way too well but you know it's

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.960 
the tower way too well but you know it's
ok<00:05:07.230> that's<00:05:07.710> not<00:05:07.890> too<00:05:08.130> bad<00:05:08.280> I'm<00:05:08.550> just<00:05:08.760> trying<00:05:08.940> to

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
ok that's not too bad I'm just trying to

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.790 
ok that's not too bad I'm just trying to
show<00:05:09.150> off<00:05:09.180> really<00:05:10.050> more<00:05:10.290> what<00:05:10.320> this<00:05:10.650> weapon

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
show off really more what this weapon

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.040 
show off really more what this weapon
can<00:05:11.100> do<00:05:11.280> this<00:05:11.910> weapon<00:05:12.300> is<00:05:12.419> not<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.720> best<00:05:12.870> of

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.780 
can do this weapon is not the best of
tower<00:05:13.230> control<00:05:13.590> I<00:05:13.770> would<00:05:14.100> recommend<00:05:14.640> it<00:05:14.760> a

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
tower control I would recommend it a

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.250 
tower control I would recommend it a
little<00:05:14.970> bit<00:05:15.120> more<00:05:15.300> for<00:05:15.570> the<00:05:15.660> other<00:05:15.840> game<00:05:16.050> modes

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
little bit more for the other game modes

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.040 
little bit more for the other game modes
where<00:05:16.440> you<00:05:16.470> can<00:05:16.620> capture<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:17.100> zones<00:05:17.340> because

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
where you can capture the zones because

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.030 
where you can capture the zones because
capturing<00:05:19.050> areas<00:05:19.410> a<00:05:19.590> little<00:05:19.800> bit<00:05:19.890> more

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
capturing areas a little bit more

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.980 
capturing areas a little bit more
important<00:05:20.370> in<00:05:20.430> that<00:05:20.460> you<00:05:21.180> know<00:05:21.330> it's<00:05:21.600> not<00:05:21.750> too

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
important in that you know it's not too

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.909
