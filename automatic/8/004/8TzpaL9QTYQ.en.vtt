00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:12.110
 In and it is a primary dove to resistance and capacitance of the first leg Daimon, as shown in FIG. 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:17.449
 A capacitor of microfarads connected in series 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:20.520
 AC circuit Gane clogging rc series circuit is yes now 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:27.720
 Power supply frequency is 1 battle Hertz 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:31.500
 When supply voltage good voltage and current i ampere 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.830
 Is a server 33 minutes of pi radians 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:40.630
 With this voltage and current 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.880
 It's the phase difference is 3 minutes pie it over cases of 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.400
 Yes 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:49.220
 Huh 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.850
 At this time , the closest value of the electrostatic microfarad value of the capacitor at this time is 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.450
 Any 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.900
 It is this kind of state if you want to know this by the fact that 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:03.390
 If you stop it, it's like this 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:10.080
 Kedomo is a place of here and say crawling usually micro that and say, this I Hist 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.640
 As the ballad finally seeks in the microfarad, now it is c farad 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.700
 Shall I calculate? 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:20.910
 And finally , let's put it in such a state when we go through micro part 2 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.409
 Well then I will be here, but 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.859
 9 capacitive reactance 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.490
 It is one part of Omega Sean which is over, yes 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:33.850
 Do you write your own this impedance vector Once And 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:38.310
 It is resistance when you write impedance vector 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:47.040
 It is one game parrot So one round of open glory 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:52.259
 Minus and look at the capacitive reactance from a few to express at it this dress number is out of the c min 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:56.850
 ja ridge say it is you octopus was a good I was direction and 1 So minus j of 4 minutes 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:00.150
 It is negative and no eyes are season 1 hi 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:05.700
 I 'm coming to hiring 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:12.120
 This is the impedance of the circuit because p can be determined 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:15.510
 So anymore oc bunch I'm here you can Kafudoshita 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.870
 Because this is a power factor nucleus , this angle 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:24.760
 Voltage and current 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:28.930
 The fact that it is the angle itself of this case the three pie This is the third of the times 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.730
 Bet that that is are we Come minute of the pie by 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.860
 It is 60 degrees It is 60 degrees It is 60 degrees yes 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:43.010
 Because it is a right triangle, it is like this 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:50.360
 It means that a little here 60 degrees There are 4 Author diffusion over ish it 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:51.200
 Pie of 3 parts, but 60 degrees 60 degrees of rate is that it is 1 tiny painful route's 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.530
 The thing is 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:02.910
 Ekko I have been here for a while 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:05.970
 This parrot number that c is 1 / c is three times the route to this one is one battle 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:13.260
 Because it is 3 times the route 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:15.520
 Battle 1 of omega Sea worth of three-fold route UmaIne 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.580
 Say Tsu route, who put one leg 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.510
 You can see in great condition, 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:30.520
 Its Once you MakotoRin capacity c pet Sea 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:35.510
 It is a goal, but c is the route 3 of omega 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:41.959
 It looks like this 1/1000 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:48.980
 By the way , it was pie f because rice is each frequency it is pie f 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:53.510
 1 of the battle worth multiplying Route 3 of applying 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.530
 I think what comes out is this in Farah degree and say do you out with this 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:02.910
 Farad comes out yes 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:04.210
 Then I would like to know about it with Microfarrado now- 10 6 times this 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:15.910
 You should do it 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:17.110
 = To this and full'll make 6 th power of f multiplying root participation Teru Kotono practice worth of cattle 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:24.230
 In micro 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:29.750
 If the frequency is round 1 to it in the way the problem is fueling the number of land comes out 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:33.020
 If you assign a line to pair two have now given the fact that Hertz 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.920
 Full multiplying f one round to 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:44.990
 It is the sixth power of 10 in one game and battle Do you have one leg nephew 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:49.550
 It is said that the boot of 10 six lines 10 10 6 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:53.990
 Pine route 1/3 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:05:03.070
 It will be called microfarad 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:04.340
 Yes If this is the calculator computed by the fact that if you will be calculated by the calculator 0 point 092 people 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.300
 Look over 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.790
 rule 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:17.690
 As it becomes 0.09, as an answer, it is micro para and to 0.09 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.690
 Yes, the answer is Fifth Avenue Te will you Seta to the fact that
