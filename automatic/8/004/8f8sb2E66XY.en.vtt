00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:11.530
 we put together a sofa and it turned out that 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:15.160
 we have some kind of backs 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.660
 it really hurts so that's what I wanted 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
 show you how easy it is 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.359
 for the first time it is possible 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.750
 do so it was decided to transfer 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.660
 backs a little volume of transactions on them 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.590
 utyazhki here can see but already 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:36.430
 ready back 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:37.979
 utyu a and their direct difference of course 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.949
 it's all a matter of taste 

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:44.010
 you might like the first one 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:47.140
 Now I will show you how to make 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.680
 I will explain these data as I did this 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.229
 case means we have a lot here 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.400
 lines do not pay attention I him 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.629
 reworked this line remaining first 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.110
 times unsuccessfully 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:08.160
 means before you the front of the cover 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:14.080
 which we have is on top of the seat 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:16.290
 here I divided the size first width by 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.120
 six pieces 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.340
 rules of the line then length into three parts and 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.490
 again winnie rules 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.380
 then along these lines I made such 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.460
 stitching that is picked up fabric and 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.460
 stitching on 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.290
 that's what we got on the face 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.180
 to the side 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.740
 it seems that the fabric is sewn from 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.740
 scraps however this is not true 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:53.250
 at the intersection of the lines we sew 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.970
 tight rope well rope can 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:03.420
 use even shoelaces to 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:06.119
 just to be durable with us in common 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.320
 complexity turned out 10 utyazhek that is 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:15.530
 need 10 segments of york now we 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.700
 turn over our case and lay it down 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:27.600
 align in the corners as we have it 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:29.580
 will lie so mean leveled for 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.209
 order to make santa utyazki us 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.730
 need three tools 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:39.020
 a piece of hard wire with a little 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.840
 hook at the end to speed up the process 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:47.570
 some kind of pin can be sewed and here 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.970
 use blunt drill and hammer 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.180
 so now we are we fabric lies as 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.720
 she will have us ottyagivatsya we find 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.180
 about here is our first utyazhka here 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.400
 here for example on somewhere here will be 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.049
 hole 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:18.329
 take our 3 such foam rubber punch 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:25.079
 hardboard one take our wire and here 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:28.850
 so here we stretch it down also do 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.850
 for the rest utyazhki 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:23.290
 I did everything 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:25.930
 utyazhki now we stretch the cover and now 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.260
 we cover everything as in the past 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.260
 video 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.670
 case we pulled 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:49.120
 now proceed directly to 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:50.380
 utyazhki horse overturned seat has 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:58.810
 we have our hands sticking out 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:05:00.100
 millions of steppler although it didn't come up here 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.590
 again it all depends on your taste 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.970
 can pull out a little and strengthened 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.730
 throw whatever you want and do 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:13.350
 do something like this and take 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.350
 nailed lace in Brus 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:55.830
 I'll need to nail it hard 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.090
 happened 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:04.890
 the inner side is as we behold 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.890
 so external like this
