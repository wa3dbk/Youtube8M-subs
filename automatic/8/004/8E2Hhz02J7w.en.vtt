darkness<00:03:43.690> content<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.140> it<00:03:44.230> actually<00:03:44.500> made<00:03:44.650> me

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
darkness content and it actually made me

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.130 
darkness content and it actually made me
want<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:45.030> reread<00:03:46.030> into<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.510> manga<00:03:46.870> against

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
want to reread into the manga against

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.870 
want to reread into the manga against
though<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.680> reason<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.130> they<00:03:48.340> are<00:03:48.370> not

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
though the reason that they are not

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.479 
though the reason that they are not
adapting<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:50.230> know<00:03:50.380> it's<00:03:50.709> in<00:03:50.950> order<00:03:51.340> is

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
adapting you know it's in order is

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:52.890 
adapting you know it's in order is
because<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.910> what<00:03:52.030> happened<00:03:52.389> at<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.510> end<00:03:52.720> and

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
because of what happened at the end and

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.330 
because of what happened at the end and
a<00:03:52.959> me<00:03:53.139> that<00:03:53.319> they<00:03:53.440> had<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.709> stop<00:03:53.950> before<00:03:54.100> they

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
a me that they had to stop before they

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.129 
a me that they had to stop before they
introduced<00:03:54.819> one<00:03:55.329> of<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.569> main<00:03:55.750> bitters<00:03:56.109> which

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
introduced one of the main bitters which

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.349 
introduced one of the main bitters which
in<00:03:56.560> emesis<00:03:57.069> now<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.549> reason<00:03:58.030> they're<00:03:58.120> doing

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
in emesis now the reason they're doing

00:03:58.359 --> 00:03:59.670 
in emesis now the reason they're doing
it<00:03:58.480> so<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.660> think<00:03:58.870> it's<00:03:59.019> because<00:03:59.260> they<00:03:59.380> want<00:03:59.590> to

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
it so I think it's because they want to

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.490 
it so I think it's because they want to
do<00:03:59.799> a<00:03:59.829> season<00:04:00.400> two<00:04:00.579> of<00:04:00.810> darkness<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:01.989> they

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
do a season two of darkness and they

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.050 
do a season two of darkness and they
feel<00:04:02.650> like<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:02.799> know<00:04:02.889> we<00:04:03.400> shouldn't<00:04:03.670> really

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
feel like you know we shouldn't really

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.569 
feel like you know we shouldn't really
you<00:04:04.269> know<00:04:04.420> have<00:04:04.989> a<00:04:05.019> big<00:04:05.380> reveal<00:04:05.829> into<00:04:06.489> the
