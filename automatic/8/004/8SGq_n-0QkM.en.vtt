00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
they're like but I know I think other

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.770 
they're like but I know I think other
people<00:02:01.860> helped<00:02:02.340> me<00:02:02.399> drive<00:02:02.670> my<00:02:02.850> standard<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.540> I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
people helped me drive my standard so I

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.719 
people helped me drive my standard so I
can't<00:02:04.320> wait<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.619> get<00:02:04.740> started<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.579> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
can't wait to get started and get on the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.399 
can't wait to get started and get on the
training<00:02:05.969> pitch<00:02:06.180> really<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.140> think<00:02:07.200> an

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
training pitch really and I think an

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.990 
training pitch really and I think an
obvious<00:02:07.530> comparison<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.310> Joe<00:02:08.520> Holt<00:02:08.759> whenever

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
obvious comparison is Joe Holt whenever

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.979 
obvious comparison is Joe Holt whenever
you<00:02:09.090> think<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.360> Sri<00:02:09.599> Freetown<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
you think of Sri Freetown and

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.170 
you think of Sri Freetown and
goalkeepers<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.039> he<00:02:11.640> someone<00:02:11.879> you've<00:02:12.030> looked

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
goalkeepers is he someone you've looked

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.850 
goalkeepers is he someone you've looked
up<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.569> as<00:02:12.750> you've<00:02:12.870> grown<00:02:13.050> up<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.410> seen

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
up to as you've grown up and seen

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.620 
up to as you've grown up and seen
his<00:02:13.950> development<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.700> game<00:02:14.850> yeah<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.390> mean

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
his development in the game yeah I mean

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.060 
his development in the game yeah I mean
of<00:02:15.720> course<00:02:15.780> he's<00:02:16.170> he's<00:02:16.650> come<00:02:16.830> through<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
of course he's he's come through the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.030 
of course he's he's come through the
same<00:02:17.250> Club<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:18.500> sought<00:02:19.500> followed<00:02:19.950> a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
same Club I have sought followed a

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.210 
same Club I have sought followed a
similar<00:02:20.400> route<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:22.080> might<00:02:22.500> be<00:02:22.770> great<00:02:22.980> to

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
similar route it might be great to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.370 
similar route it might be great to
emulate<00:02:24.000> what<00:02:24.030> he's<00:02:24.360> achieved<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:25.050> mean<00:02:25.320> I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
emulate what he's achieved I mean I

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.020 
emulate what he's achieved I mean I
think<00:02:25.440> that's<00:02:25.710> what<00:02:25.950> every<00:02:26.640> young<00:02:26.790> goalkeeper

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
think that's what every young goalkeeper

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.790 
think that's what every young goalkeeper
burning<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.840> trying<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.140> do<00:02:28.230> not<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.650> me

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
burning and trying to do not just me

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.530 
burning and trying to do not just me

because I'm from Shrewsbury so if I

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.970 
because I'm from Shrewsbury so if I
could<00:02:30.660> get<00:02:31.110> just<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.440> bit<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.710> what<00:02:31.830> he's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
could get just a bit of what he's

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.100
