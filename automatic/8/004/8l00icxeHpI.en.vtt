hello guys and we are here to talk about
the<00:00:10.650> meta<00:00:11.070> space<00:00:11.670> glasses<00:00:13.880> so<00:00:14.880> basically

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
the meta space glasses so basically

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.109 
the meta space glasses so basically
these<00:00:15.690> glasses<00:00:16.230> are<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:17.070> virtual<00:00:17.910> reality<00:00:18.570> so

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
these glasses are a virtual reality so

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.279 
these glasses are a virtual reality so
you<00:00:21.119> can<00:00:21.390> move<00:00:21.930> your<00:00:21.990> hands<00:00:22.410> around<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.250> move

you can move your hands around and move
objects<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.590> virtual<00:00:26.340> space<00:00:26.420> use<00:00:27.420> apps<00:00:27.810> and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
objects in virtual space use apps and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.349 
objects in virtual space use apps and
stuff<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.740> they<00:00:29.250> created<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.179> these

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
stuff that they created for these

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
Virtual Reality part which is 15 times

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.700 
Virtual Reality part which is 15 times
the<00:00:50.219> Google<00:00:51.180> glass<00:00:51.390> which<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.930> 15<00:00:52.260> times<00:00:52.469> that

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the Google glass which is 15 times that

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
dollars on a pair of glasses but I think

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.820 
dollars on a pair of glasses but I think
it's<00:06:10.000> definitely<00:06:10.180> worth<00:06:10.720> it<00:06:10.990> um<00:06:11.229> they're<00:06:11.710> not

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
it's definitely worth it um they're not

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.089 
it's definitely worth it um they're not
just<00:06:11.889> any<00:06:12.220> normal<00:06:12.550> glasses<00:06:12.970> though<00:06:13.300> yeah<00:06:14.099> the

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
just any normal glasses though yeah the

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:18.600 
just any normal glasses though yeah the
problems<00:06:15.699> I<00:06:16.150> can<00:06:16.449> see<00:06:16.720> with<00:06:16.870> it<00:06:16.930> is<00:06:17.199> that<00:06:17.610> they

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
problems I can see with it is that they

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.300 
problems I can see with it is that they
could<00:06:18.849> be<00:06:19.030> end<00:06:19.210> up<00:06:19.419> like<00:06:19.630> the<00:06:19.810> kinect<00:06:20.310> where

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
could be end up like the kinect where

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.580 
could be end up like the kinect where
it's<00:06:21.699> absolute<00:06:23.550> if<00:06:24.550> so<00:06:25.110> you<00:06:26.110> know<00:06:26.289> that

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
it's absolute if so you know that

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.140 
it's absolute if so you know that
could<00:06:26.800> happen<00:06:27.240> where<00:06:28.240> there<00:06:28.720> a<00:06:29.610> problem<00:06:30.610> like
