00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 Hello, how about youtube friends? 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.130
 welcome to a new video tutorial of 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.049
 win phone 8 this time we bring you 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.120
 one of the applications that at least 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.219
 I was surprised by the new 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.889
 customization that we can create in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.839
 windows phone this app may not believe us 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.750
 shortcuts to our applications 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.150
 but it does allow us to organize a 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.180
 our little home screen 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.980
 basically creating selectors 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.810
 indicators of the apps practically 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.939
 they offer us an infinite range of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.579
 possibilities that we will leave 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.700
 fly our imagination to create 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.690
 these times and it really has left us 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.000
 surprised the application is called 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.309
 header times and it is totally 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.480
 free in our market place so 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.480
 let's start 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.980
 Y 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.960
 to download this application we are going to 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.270
 go to our windows store and in 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.489
 the search key we will write rotate 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.040
 taiz is a logo with an ax and with a 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.409
 blue outline at this time has 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.479
 four stars from my perspective I 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.780
 it seems that it should have 5 since 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.340
 it is an extremely important application 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.350
 It is developed by good 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.270
 developers that are called ping kun 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.280
 Once installed, it will send us a 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.290
 interface like the one we're seeing in 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.930
 this moment here I already have some 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.270
 workshops created below the logos well 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.130
 here you can see the great range a 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.320
 great difference that there is a time to 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.479
 another this indicator for example he used it 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.670
 I for the games the name of my channel 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.399
 also around here some music and 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.110
 These logos are predefined in 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.360
 this application on this screen 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.429
 main we will find two parts as 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.920
 it's been my head ers that are the 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.509
 such that we have created and if 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.210
 we carry us right 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.610
 we will see some templates that have already 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.170
 been pre-created these templates do not 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.240
 we can modify them because they are 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.030
 precisely the demo that will serve us 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.350
 guide or base for us to take for 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.960
 so to say inspiration 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.630
 in the tels that we will be creating 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.729
 as you can see here we 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.250
 are the tags that we have created 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.140
 to start creating the first time 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.900
 let's give a touch here where it says 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.910
 the most and he's going to tell us that from 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.700
 which for template we believe 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.380
 we want to create the time is independent 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.000
 of this if we want to start 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.950
 from scratch let's give a touch here in 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.380
 where says credit from scratch me 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.870
 preferably for example I'm going to open 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.330
 this one that has the frame with a color 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.220
 orange on this screen will give us a 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.100
 preview of him such that we 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.319
 we are editing with a touch on the 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.480
 logo or about this section that I am 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.600
 playing in these moments will change us 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.430
 the type of such whether small medium or 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.100
 big from this from windows 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.290
 phones 8.1 I for example I'm going to 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.390
 select the template in medium size 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.850
 and we can add some kind of 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.549
 text for example I'm going to give a popcorn 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.350
 so that I can enable the text and 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.230
 As you can see the Hache to 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.260
 one side the text appears 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.439
 we can change the size of the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.030
 text I hope you can appreciate 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.730
 we can even change its color 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.709
 we also have subtitles we can 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.329
 add a subtitle for example let's 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.010
 put the name of my channel and how 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.909
 you can see in the part 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.120
 higher 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:28.420
 here I get a subtitle and a title 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.040
 about the one I'm editing 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.290
 we can increase or decrease the 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.200
 size here in the part on the right 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.420
 the size of the text also comes 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.180
 we can change the logo by 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.379
 example me instead of being white 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.909
 what do you think if we put a color 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.190
 totally blue and we put it in color 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.170
 blue we send from the h 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.000
 we have all this whole selection are 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.819
 five pages that we can 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.129
 Choose different icons according to 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.440
 our taste I for example I'm going to 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.170
 select this from the world we also 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.139
 gives another frame really this allows us 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.260
 many options we have a framework one that 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:11.690
 it allows us to select for our 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.549
 main logo of this workshop by 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.500
 example I'm going to select boulder 2 and 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.979
 now as you can observe this 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.690
 logo is no longer square 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.570
 circular then let's say that the 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.240
 world get a little bigger we can 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.530
 select the position of this logo by 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.800
 example right now is in the part 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.020
 lower superior to the right to the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.880
 left in the next tab is the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.919
 style if for example we do not 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.840
 is liking how the type is 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.810
 We can support these templates that 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.389
 they are extremely diverse and they are very, very 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.430
 functional from my particular point of 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.280
 seen practically we can 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.740
 change the rest of the icon for example 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.380
 The outer frame of the rectangle is 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.780
 white we can put it to be 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.419
 the color black background the color of 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.370
 our subject that is gray or that is of 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.560
 according to a subject that comes predefined 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.780
 in windows phones and preferably not 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.940
 we know they cover all these colors that 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.340
 if we want to select myself by 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.349
 example I'm going to select a green and 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.880
 now you can see that it has changed 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.099
 in the tab on the right we come 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.750
 the guidelines of our icon or of 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.580
 our text I for example in his 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.289
 moment you can not see any 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.990
 change because it's not the configuration 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.680
 but you can do this in this tab 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.780
 in the next 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.520
 tab will show us the fund that 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.620
 we can configure this guy 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.360
 us starting windows with 8.1 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.060
 we can define it as such 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.639
 transparent as a black color or a 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.780
 custom color again by 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.479
 example what do you think if now what 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.419
 we put on a pink color like you 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:46.120
 you can see and well here I already have my 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.919
 so finished you can edit the 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.560
 who want once we have 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.930
 to edit we will have to click on 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.030
 where it says save and will keep us 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.979
 will send a confirmation message and 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.740
 finally we can give a touch in the 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.750
 tack so you do not anchor it to start and 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.060
 here as you can see it has already 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.190
 anchored to start I for example I'm going to 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.580
 put here in the middle to be separated 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.830
 the apps for example network with respect to 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.060
 the rest of the others yes now I'm going to 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.880
 the top I have already created 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.009
 some other issues and then you 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.710
 let your imagination fly the size of 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.330
 the styles also like some logos myself 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.699
 for example here I have my name 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.710
 channel some windows phones logos and 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.470
 at the bottom I have the 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.430
 indicator that to the right or this 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.010
 binder 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:36.670
 basically includes all the games that 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.830
 I have xbox here we have already put the 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.410
 that I have created previously so 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.470
 of you depends on how you want it 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.640
