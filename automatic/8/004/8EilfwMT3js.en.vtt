it<00:02:08.879> someday<00:02:09.149> i<00:02:09.299> guess<00:02:09.929> my<00:02:10.079> attack<00:02:10.319> will<00:02:10.440> be

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
it someday i guess my attack will be

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.430 
it someday i guess my attack will be
increased<00:02:10.829> by<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.700> bit<00:02:12.140> what<00:02:13.140> your<00:02:13.260> mind

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
control kind of reveals that he just

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.910 
control kind of reveals that he just
didn't<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.540> any<00:02:15.840> place<00:02:16.640> ok<00:02:17.640> i<00:02:18.470> mean<00:02:19.470> he<00:02:19.590> he

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
didn't have any place ok i mean he he

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.350 
didn't have any place ok i mean he he
had<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.310> auction<00:02:20.579> go<00:02:20.700> for<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:20.879> Nick<00:02:21.030> seen<00:02:21.209> any

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
had the auction go for it Nick seen any

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.210 
had the auction go for it Nick seen any
was<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:21.720> yeah<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:21.870> backward<00:02:22.379> probably<00:02:22.709> was

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
was but yeah that backward probably was

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.670 
was but yeah that backward probably was
a<00:02:23.310> reason<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.670> one<00:02:27.150> no<00:02:27.299> two<00:02:27.510> turns<00:02:27.780> any<00:02:28.379> let's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
a reason so one no two turns any let's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.650 
a reason so one no two turns any let's
just<00:02:28.859> uh<00:02:31.549> guess<00:02:32.549> we'd<00:02:32.700> go<00:02:32.849> for<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.239> an<00:02:33.359> attack

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
just uh guess we'd go for just an attack

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.199 
just uh guess we'd go for just an attack
I'm<00:02:34.140> pretty<00:02:34.709> sure<00:02:34.829> he's<00:02:34.859> acres<00:02:35.190> tak<00:02:35.430> but<00:02:36.090> if<00:02:36.150> he

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
I'm pretty sure he's acres tak but if he

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.809 
I'm pretty sure he's acres tak but if he
does<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.599> would<00:02:36.840> hope<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.200> would<00:02:37.319> destroy<00:02:37.819> what

pretty much after dark hole though um
yeah<00:04:06.430> fortunately<00:04:07.430> looks<00:04:07.849> like<00:04:07.970> on<00:04:08.090> that<00:04:08.209> I

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
yeah fortunately looks like on that I

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:09.610 
yeah fortunately looks like on that I
don't<00:04:08.569> need<00:04:08.629> to<00:04:08.750> darko<00:04:09.019> because<00:04:09.200> I<00:04:09.230> can't<00:04:09.470> I

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
don't need to darko because I can't I

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.250 
don't need to darko because I can't I
mean<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.040> guess<00:04:10.069> I<00:04:10.280> could<00:04:10.430> technically<00:04:10.819> set

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
mean I guess I could technically set

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.130 
mean I guess I could technically set
mirror<00:04:12.260> force<00:04:12.349> and<00:04:13.329> hope<00:04:14.329> to<00:04:14.359> plus<00:04:14.780> off<00:04:14.959> that

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
mirror force and hope to plus off that

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.770 
mirror force and hope to plus off that
even<00:04:15.410> more<00:04:16.030> but<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:17.180> think<00:04:17.359> I'm<00:04:17.479> just<00:04:17.510> gonna<00:04:17.690> go

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
even more but I think I'm just gonna go

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.400 
even more but I think I'm just gonna go
with<00:04:17.900> this<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.660> we're<00:04:23.960> special<00:04:24.260> something

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
with this so we're special something

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.240 
with this so we're special something
that<00:04:24.680> because<00:04:25.490> we<00:04:25.820> had<00:04:26.919> no<00:04:27.919> other<00:04:28.039> monsters

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
that because we had no other monsters

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.300 
that because we had no other monsters
and<00:04:29.199> then<00:04:30.199> we<00:04:30.289> reactivate<00:04:30.919> future<00:04:31.160> fusion

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
and then we reactivate future fusion

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:39.969 
and then we reactivate future fusion
again<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.900> go<00:04:36.080> for<00:04:36.289> another<00:04:36.380> shining<00:04:38.830> so<00:04:39.830> we'll

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
again to go for another shining so we'll

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:46.020 
again to go for another shining so we'll
send<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.310> li<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:40.760> grave

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.950 
play to go off if I got heavy storms I
get<00:04:59.500> heavy<00:04:59.680> stormed<00:05:00.570> well<00:05:01.570> I<00:05:01.600> just<00:05:01.630> pretty

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
get heavy stormed well I just pretty

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.600 
get heavy stormed well I just pretty
much<00:05:02.020> because<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.470> only<00:05:02.590> monster<00:05:02.950> I<00:05:02.980> have<00:05:03.160> so

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
I mean I guess it could have saved the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.700 
I mean I guess it could have saved the
economy<00:05:08.220> but<00:05:09.220> um<00:05:09.550> I<00:05:09.990> just<00:05:10.990> don't<00:05:11.350> want<00:05:11.470> to<00:05:11.530> have

before you can actually use that dark
arm<00:05:34.890> okay<00:05:35.890> so<00:05:35.950> we're<00:05:36.220> going<00:05:36.370> to<00:05:36.520> make<00:05:36.580> this

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.870 

pretty<00:05:43.270> comes<00:05:43.660> out<00:05:43.870> I<00:05:44.280> can't<00:05:45.280> lengths<00:05:45.610> to<00:05:45.700> save

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
pretty comes out I can't lengths to save

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.580 
pretty comes out I can't lengths to save
my<00:05:46.000> ocean<00:05:46.150> though<00:05:50.520> so<00:05:51.520> this<00:05:51.910> will<00:05:52.060> die<00:05:52.240> though

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
my ocean though so this will die though

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.650 
my ocean though so this will die though
and<00:05:53.610> that's<00:05:56.460> okay<00:05:57.460> then<00:05:58.060> we<00:05:58.180> have<00:05:58.270> super<00:05:58.480> poly

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
and that's okay then we have super poly

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.100 
and that's okay then we have super poly
so<00:05:58.900> even<00:05:59.530> if<00:05:59.590> he<00:05:59.650> gets<00:05:59.800> out<00:05:59.890> dark<00:06:00.130> arm<00:06:00.280> is<00:06:00.370> fine

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
so even if he gets out dark arm is fine

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.360 
so even if he gets out dark arm is fine
so<00:06:02.110> we<00:06:02.170> get<00:06:02.290> oceans<00:06:02.590> effect<00:06:02.830> and<00:06:03.010> we<00:06:03.130> get<00:06:03.280> to

so we get oceans effect and we get to

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.640 
so we get oceans effect and we get to
add<00:06:03.550> a<00:06:03.850> hero<00:06:04.420> to<00:06:04.720> our<00:06:04.810> hand<00:06:05.050> and<00:06:05.260> we're<00:06:05.560> gonna

currently<00:06:22.660> this<00:06:22.840> is<00:06:22.900> not<00:06:23.140> four<00:06:23.410> thousand<00:06:23.830> so

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
currently this is not four thousand so

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.700 
currently this is not four thousand so

that one
there<00:06:32.230> we<00:06:32.320> go<00:06:34.950> unless<00:06:35.950> he<00:06:36.070> has<00:06:36.160> Baylor<00:06:36.840> because

there we go unless he has Baylor because
then<00:06:38.050> Baylor<00:06:38.500> would<00:06:39.300> stop<00:06:40.300> this<00:06:42.750> cuz<00:06:43.750> that

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
then Baylor would stop this cuz that

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.000 
then Baylor would stop this cuz that
would<00:06:43.990> be<00:06:44.110> four<00:06:44.260> thousand<00:06:44.530> hours<00:06:44.590> less<00:06:44.800> he<00:06:44.890> has

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.180 
would say the three miracles and then

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.820 
would say the three miracles and then
after<00:07:37.570> that<00:07:37.600> unless<00:07:38.020> you're<00:07:38.380> playing<00:07:38.530> like<00:07:38.650> an
