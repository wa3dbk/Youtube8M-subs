basically i'm using this my friend

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.609 
basically i'm using this my friend
server<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.710> help<00:01:38.860> me<00:01:38.950> process<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.580> videos

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
server to help me process the videos

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.889 
server to help me process the videos
using<00:01:41.619> some<00:01:41.979> scripts<00:01:42.399> and<00:01:42.550> his<00:01:43.300> server<00:01:43.660> he

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
using some scripts and his server he

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.800 
using some scripts and his server he
just<00:01:44.110> moved<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:45.399> so<00:01:45.640> it's<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.450> really<00:01:46.630> bad

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
just moved it and so it's a really bad

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.779 
just moved it and so it's a really bad
connection<00:01:47.410> now<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:47.860> it's<00:01:48.009> slow<00:01:48.369> so<00:01:48.670> it

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
connection now so it's slow so it

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.210 
connection now so it's slow so it
actually<00:01:48.910> takes<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.390> long<00:01:49.690> time<00:01:49.720> for<00:01:50.410> his

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
actually takes a long time for his

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.029 
actually takes a long time for his
server<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.940> download<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.539> source<00:01:53.530> vids<00:01:53.890> and

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
server to download the source vids and

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.590 
server to download the source vids and
upload<00:01:54.369> them<00:01:54.490> so<00:01:54.610> that's<00:01:54.759> why<00:01:54.910> my<00:01:55.119> games<00:01:55.479> have

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.749

and<00:02:10.869> uploaded<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:11.530> they'll<00:02:12.340> all<00:02:12.520> get<00:02:12.640> up<00:02:12.700> there

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
and uploaded so they'll all get up there

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.750 
and uploaded so they'll all get up there
eventually<00:02:13.709> although<00:02:14.709> this<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:15.010> Game<00:02:15.220> five<00:02:15.490> so

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
eventually although this is Game five so

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.220 
eventually although this is Game five so
i<00:02:15.790> guess<00:02:16.090> game<00:02:16.480> threes<00:02:16.750> already<00:02:16.870> up<00:02:17.050> by<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
i guess game threes already up by the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.620 
i guess game threes already up by the
time<00:02:17.410> you're<00:02:17.560> watching<00:02:18.160> this<00:02:18.360> no<00:02:19.360> likelihood

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
time you're watching this no likelihood

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.300 
time you're watching this no likelihood
of<00:02:20.500> any<00:02:21.340> way<00:02:21.610> yeah<00:02:22.270> by<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.720> way<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:22.900> want<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.310> wow

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
of any way yeah by the way I want to wow

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.640 
of any way yeah by the way I want to wow
did<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:24.970> kid<00:02:25.270> come<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.750> starcraft<00:02:26.470> match

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
did that kid come the starcraft match

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.210 
did that kid come the starcraft match
with<00:02:26.830> his<00:02:26.950> mom<00:02:27.160> that's<00:02:28.060> cool<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.130> would

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
with his mom that's cool and that would

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.680 
with his mom that's cool and that would
suck<00:02:30.400> if<00:02:30.520> that<00:02:30.640> was<00:02:30.760> like<00:02:30.849> his<00:02:31.000> sister<00:02:31.450> and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.540 
suck if that was like his sister and
then

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
then

this<00:02:36.840> dough<00:02:37.020> just<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.710> hunch<00:02:38.720> anyway<00:02:40.220> what<00:02:41.220> was

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
this dough just a hunch anyway what was

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.380 
this dough just a hunch anyway what was
I<00:02:41.460> gonna<00:02:41.670> say<00:02:41.760> oh<00:02:42.150> yeah<00:02:42.390> yeah<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:45.060> one<00:02:45.330> of

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
I gonna say oh yeah yeah so it's one of

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.450 
I gonna say oh yeah yeah so it's one of
the<00:02:45.480> cool<00:02:45.630> things<00:02:45.660> about<00:02:45.870> doing<00:02:46.320> games<00:02:47.130> a

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
the cool things about doing games a

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.160 
the cool things about doing games a
little<00:02:47.940> bit<00:02:48.030> staggered<00:02:48.300> like<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:48.990> that<00:02:49.020> I

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
little bit staggered like this is that I

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.510 
little bit staggered like this is that I
get<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.350> read<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.770> comments<00:02:50.250> from<00:02:50.400> the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
get to read the comments from the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.970 
get to read the comments from the
previous<00:02:50.940> games<00:02:51.210> before<00:02:51.990> devaney<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:52.740> I<00:02:52.800> can

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
previous games before devaney so I can

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.490 
previous games before devaney so I can
actually<00:02:53.220> respond<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.670> them<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:53.870> voice<00:02:54.870> yeah

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
actually respond to them in voice yeah

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.650 
actually respond to them in voice yeah
so<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.220> said<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:56.730> already<00:02:56.880> ate<00:02:57.120> stacked<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.600> a

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
so I said that already ate stacked and a

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.840 
so I said that already ate stacked and a
couple<00:02:57.840> we<00:02:57.960> were<00:02:58.110> like<00:02:58.260> new<00:02:58.440> dude<00:02:58.860> videos<00:02:59.820> to

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
couple we were like new dude videos to

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.750 
couple we were like new dude videos to
stick<00:03:00.420> your<00:03:00.630> noble<00:03:01.260> trip<00:03:01.560> okay<00:03:02.490> they<00:03:02.580> didn't

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
stick your noble trip okay they didn't

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.930 
stick your noble trip okay they didn't
actually<00:03:02.850> say<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.150> like<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.360> but<00:03:03.720> um<00:03:03.930> I

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
actually say it like that but um I

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.400 
actually say it like that but um I
radiates<00:03:05.940> don't<00:03:06.120> stack<00:03:06.390> on<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.660> units<00:03:07.200> that's

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
radiates don't stack on the units that's

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.470 
radiates don't stack on the units that's
irradiated<00:03:07.890> but<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.340> splash<00:03:08.730> damage<00:03:09.060> does

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
irradiated but the splash damage does

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.560 
irradiated but the splash damage does
stack<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.650> if<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.010> have<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.550> Science<00:03:12.510> Vessel

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
stack so if you have a Science Vessel

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.390 
stack so if you have a Science Vessel
float<00:03:13.140> that's<00:03:13.410> irradiated<00:03:13.830> floating<00:03:14.280> above

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
float that's irradiated floating above

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.830 
float that's irradiated floating above
something<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.880> damages<00:03:15.300> what's<00:03:15.540> underneath

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
something it damages what's underneath

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.890 
something it damages what's underneath
right<00:03:16.710> so<00:03:17.700> have<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:17.880> have<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.360> science

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
right so have you have to science

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.620 
right so have you have to science
vessels<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:19.710> are<00:03:19.770> rated<00:03:20.040> at<00:03:20.460> both<00:03:21.300> of<00:03:21.330> the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
vessels that are rated at both of the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.360 
vessels that are rated at both of the
splash<00:03:21.900> damages<00:03:22.380> are<00:03:22.560> each<00:03:22.740> happening<00:03:23.220> to

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
splash damages are each happening to

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.550 
splash damages are each happening to
whatever's<00:03:23.700> underneath<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:25.080> if<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.350> have

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
whatever's underneath and if you have

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.900 
whatever's underneath and if you have
five<00:03:26.540> vessels<00:03:27.540> irradiated<00:03:28.020> they<00:03:28.800> do<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.310> ton<00:03:29.880> of

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
five vessels irradiated they do a ton of

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.140 
five vessels irradiated they do a ton of
damage<00:03:30.420> per<00:03:31.230> second<00:03:31.680> two<00:03:32.220> units<00:03:32.610> are<00:03:32.730> neat<00:03:32.940> and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
damage per second two units are neat and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.170 
damage per second two units are neat and
basically<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:35.340> know<00:03:35.430> it's<00:03:35.580> actually<00:03:35.760> viable

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
basically you know it's actually viable

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.180 
basically you know it's actually viable
you<00:03:36.510> can<00:03:36.660> kill<00:03:37.110> off<00:03:37.260> hydrolysis<00:03:37.860> by<00:03:37.980> just

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
you can kill off hydrolysis by just

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.270 
you can kill off hydrolysis by just
having<00:03:38.280> four<00:03:38.760> or<00:03:39.360> five<00:03:39.860> irradiated<00:03:40.860> vessels

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
having four or five irradiated vessels

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.860 
having four or five irradiated vessels
and<00:03:41.400> floating<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:41.910> top<00:03:41.940> but<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.360> hydras<00:03:42.660> can't

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
and floating on top but the hydras can't

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.060 
and floating on top but the hydras can't
get<00:03:42.989> away<00:03:43.050> and<00:03:43.200> they<00:03:43.260> can't<00:03:43.470> kill<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.709> vessels

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
get away and they can't kill the vessels

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.250 
get away and they can't kill the vessels
fast<00:03:44.310> enough<00:03:44.580> it's<00:03:44.790> pretty<00:03:45.600> pone<00:03:45.840> it's<00:03:46.110> kind

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
fast enough it's pretty pone it's kind

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.330 
fast enough it's pretty pone it's kind
of<00:03:46.290> interesting<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.800> mean<00:03:46.830> either<00:03:47.130> as<00:03:47.280> a

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
of interesting I mean either as a

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.699 
of interesting I mean either as a
potential<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.820> lose<00:03:48.030> them<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.500> scourge<00:03:49.500> or

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
potential to lose them to scourge or

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.290 
potential to lose them to scourge or
whatever<00:03:49.980> but<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.850> it's<00:03:50.970> kind<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.330> more<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.630> a

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
whatever but so it's kind of a more of a

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.490 
whatever but so it's kind of a more of a
closing<00:03:54.300> tactic<00:03:54.750> if<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:54.960> really<00:03:55.260> have<00:03:55.410> your

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
closing tactic if you really have your

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.620 
closing tactic if you really have your
opponent<00:03:55.860> beaten<00:03:56.100> already<00:03:56.340> anyway<00:03:56.700> by<00:03:57.569> the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
opponent beaten already anyway by the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.210 
opponent beaten already anyway by the
way<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:57.810> should<00:03:58.230> really<00:03:58.380> be<00:03:58.560> tend<00:03:58.770> to<00:03:58.860> change<00:03:58.980> to

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
way I should really be tend to change to

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.010 
way I should really be tend to change to
this<00:03:59.310> game<00:03:59.520> sit<00:04:00.209> it<00:04:00.300> over<00:04:00.540> doing<00:04:00.780> great<00:04:00.930> out

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
this game sit it over doing great out

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.680 
this game sit it over doing great out

he goes observers first if he goes for
an<00:04:48.419> observatory<00:04:48.780> first<00:04:49.200> this<00:04:49.320> could<00:04:49.500> be<00:04:49.590> very

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
an observatory first this could be very

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.200 
an observatory first this could be very
bad<00:04:49.950> for<00:04:50.010> free<00:04:50.400> actually<00:04:50.580> free<00:04:50.910> with<00:04:51.060> two

silly is just about to finish we're
going<00:04:56.100> to<00:04:56.190> see<00:04:56.430> if<00:04:56.550> he<00:04:56.640> goes<00:04:56.790> for<00:04:56.850> an

going to see if he goes for an
observatory<00:04:57.630> first<00:04:58.080> if<00:04:58.290> he<00:04:58.350> calls<00:04:58.530> for<00:04:58.680> an

observatory first if he calls for an

observatory first if he calls for an
observatory<00:04:59.100> first<00:04:59.460> it<00:04:59.610> could<00:04:59.729> be<00:04:59.850> good<00:05:00.110> from

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
observatory first it could be good from

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.159 
observatory first it could be good from
basically<00:05:01.770> it's<00:05:01.919> kind<00:05:02.100> of<00:05:02.130> come<00:05:02.520> down<00:05:02.669> to<00:05:02.820> that

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
basically it's kind of come down to that

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.240 
basically it's kind of come down to that
even<00:05:04.169> if<00:05:04.260> he<00:05:04.350> doesn't<00:05:04.620> get<00:05:04.680> to<00:05:04.800> observatory

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
even if he doesn't get to observatory

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.250 
even if he doesn't get to observatory
first<00:05:05.640> if<00:05:06.150> he<00:05:06.300> somehow<00:05:06.479> manages<00:05:06.840> to<00:05:06.870> scout<00:05:07.169> the

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
first if he somehow manages to scout the

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260 
first if he somehow manages to scout the
deities<00:05:07.680> earlier<00:05:08.130> he<00:05:08.310> could<00:05:08.729> build<00:05:08.970> a<00:05:09.060> knobs

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
deities earlier he could build a knobs

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.730 
deities earlier he could build a knobs
and<00:05:09.570> then<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.380> then<00:05:11.000> block<00:05:12.000> his<00:05:12.210> ramp

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
and then and then block his ramp

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.610 
and then and then block his ramp
and<00:05:13.910> as<00:05:14.910> he<00:05:15.240> got<00:05:15.539> a<00:05:15.860> did<00:05:16.860> see<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.430> probes<00:05:17.729> going

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
and as he got a did see the probes going

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.950 
and as he got a did see the probes going
no<00:05:19.620> he's<00:05:19.949> building<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.460> shuttle<00:05:20.940> he's<00:05:21.539> building

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
no he's building a shuttle he's building

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.779 
no he's building a shuttle he's building
a<00:05:22.050> shuttle<00:05:22.470> instead<00:05:22.800> of<00:05:22.889> an<00:05:22.979> observer<00:05:23.280> he

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
a shuttle instead of an observer he

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.249 
a shuttle instead of an observer he
could<00:05:24.030> theoretically<00:05:24.300> still<00:05:24.690> been<00:05:24.840> observe

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
could theoretically still been observe

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.870 
could theoretically still been observe
her<00:05:25.349> between<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:26.039> shuttle<00:05:26.280> on<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.460> river<00:05:26.669> but

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
her between the shuttle on the river but

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.370 
her between the shuttle on the river but
no<00:05:27.090> okay<00:05:27.389> wait<00:05:27.539> wait<00:05:27.630> never<00:05:27.870> mind<00:05:27.900> there's<00:05:28.199> the

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
no okay wait wait never mind there's the

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.650 
no okay wait wait never mind there's the
observatory<00:05:28.860> ok<00:05:29.310> so<00:05:29.400> he<00:05:29.639> might<00:05:29.669> go<00:05:30.090> for

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
observatory ok so he might go for

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.809 
observatory ok so he might go for
observer<00:05:31.080> before<00:05:31.560> going<00:05:31.800> for<00:05:32.039> the<00:05:32.099> robotic

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:32.819 
observer before going for the robotic

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.330 
observer before going for the robotic
support<00:05:33.210> bay<00:05:33.330> and<00:05:34.169> he<00:05:34.289> might<00:05:34.590> be<00:05:34.860> able<00:05:35.009> to<00:05:35.160> get

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
support bay and he might be able to get

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.219 
support bay and he might be able to get
an<00:05:35.430> observer<00:05:35.759> out<00:05:35.880> frankly<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.539> dt<00:05:36.930> is<00:05:36.990> out

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
an observer out frankly the dt is out

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.900 
an observer out frankly the dt is out
now<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.530> first<00:05:37.770> DT<00:05:38.130> is<00:05:38.160> out<00:05:38.340> he's<00:05:38.759> actually

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
now the first DT is out he's actually

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.670 
now the first DT is out he's actually
got<00:05:39.150> to<00:05:39.419> DTS<00:05:39.870> on<00:05:39.990> the<00:05:40.080> way<00:05:40.139> he's<00:05:40.319> actually<00:05:40.440> got

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
got to DTS on the way he's actually got

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.809 
got to DTS on the way he's actually got
to<00:05:40.830> gateway<00:05:41.130> so<00:05:41.190> he's<00:05:41.400> probably<00:05:41.550> going<00:05:41.729> to

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
to gateway so he's probably going to

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.399 
to gateway so he's probably going to
even<00:05:42.330> go<00:05:42.449> for<00:05:42.630> more<00:05:42.840> DTS<00:05:43.259> after<00:05:43.560> that<00:05:43.880> and<00:05:45.409> you

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
even go for more DTS after that and you

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.920 
even go for more DTS after that and you
know<00:05:46.530> just<00:05:47.030> try<00:05:48.030> and<00:05:48.090> do<00:05:48.300> as<00:05:48.389> much<00:05:48.419> damage<00:05:48.599> as

the<00:05:59.849> observatory<00:06:00.479> is<00:06:00.599> up<00:06:00.840> he's<00:06:01.409> going<00:06:01.680> to<00:06:01.740> be

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
the observatory is up he's going to be

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.409 
the observatory is up he's going to be
able<00:06:01.979> to<00:06:02.190> get<00:06:02.340> an<00:06:02.430> observer<00:06:02.759> observers<00:06:03.300> are

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
able to get an observer observers are

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.129 
able to get an observer observers are
very<00:06:03.690> fast<00:06:04.229> building<00:06:04.650> in<00:06:04.800> it<00:06:04.919> so<00:06:06.139> he's

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
very fast building in it so he's

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:08.089 
very fast building in it so he's
probably<00:06:07.349> gonna<00:06:07.500> get<00:06:07.770> all<00:06:07.889> the<00:06:07.919> way<00:06:08.039> but

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
probably gonna get all the way but

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:09.439 
probably gonna get all the way but
unfortunately<00:06:08.669> jae-hoon<00:06:08.940> is<00:06:09.060> put<00:06:09.210> his<00:06:09.300> Jew

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
unfortunately jae-hoon is put his Jew

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:10.879 
unfortunately jae-hoon is put his Jew
goon<00:06:09.659> out<00:06:09.780> there<00:06:09.990> first<00:06:10.199> is<00:06:10.349> taking<00:06:10.620> some<00:06:10.740> hits

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
goon out there first is taking some hits

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.770 
goon out there first is taking some hits
if<00:06:11.340> he<00:06:11.430> killed<00:06:11.669> off<00:06:11.819> at<00:06:11.940> your<00:06:12.090> goon<00:06:12.240> those<00:06:12.449> TTS

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
if he killed off at your goon those TTS

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.939 
if he killed off at your goon those TTS
will<00:06:12.900> still<00:06:13.110> be<00:06:13.169> able<00:06:13.229> to<00:06:13.380> do<00:06:13.470> a<00:06:13.500> lot<00:06:13.560> of<00:06:13.740> damage

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
will still be able to do a lot of damage

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.409 
will still be able to do a lot of damage
to<00:06:14.099> the<00:06:14.190> probes<00:06:14.460> he's<00:06:14.970> actually<00:06:15.120> trying<00:06:15.300> to

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
to the probes he's actually trying to

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.870 
to the probes he's actually trying to
surround<00:06:15.750> his<00:06:16.380> you're<00:06:16.590> good<00:06:16.740> with<00:06:17.009> the<00:06:17.580> probes

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
surround his you're good with the probes

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.580 
surround his you're good with the probes
so<00:06:18.180> they<00:06:18.330> could<00:06:18.509> protect<00:06:18.840> the<00:06:18.930> g<00:06:19.050> good<00:06:19.199> he's

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
so they could protect the g good he's

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.469 
so they could protect the g good he's
killed<00:06:19.919> several<00:06:20.280> probes<00:06:20.639> already<00:06:21.000> even<00:06:21.240> with

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
killed several probes already even with

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.360 
killed several probes already even with
just<00:06:21.630> that<00:06:21.810> one<00:06:21.870> d<00:06:22.770> team<00:06:22.949> running<00:06:23.130> in<00:06:23.250> there

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
just that one d team running in there

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.640 
just that one d team running in there

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
and that CT has two kills on it as well

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.709 
and that CT has two kills on it as well
and<00:06:26.009> he's<00:06:26.729> chasing<00:06:27.270> around<00:06:27.449> with<00:06:27.630> the

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:27.719 
and he's chasing around with the

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.379 
and he's chasing around with the
observer<00:06:27.960> finally<00:06:28.409> kills<00:06:28.620> it<00:06:28.740> off<00:06:28.969> another<00:06:29.969> dt

he's<00:06:41.020> not<00:06:41.260> the<00:06:41.610> sharpest<00:06:42.610> egg<00:06:43.000> in<00:06:43.240> the<00:06:43.330> box<00:06:43.540> but

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
he's not the sharpest egg in the box but

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.040 
he's not the sharpest egg in the box but
uh<00:06:43.960> he<00:06:44.860> is<00:06:44.890> at<00:06:45.130> least<00:06:45.570> you<00:06:46.570> know<00:06:46.690> I<00:06:46.720> mean<00:06:46.840> he's<00:06:46.990> a

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
uh he is at least you know I mean he's a

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.240 
uh he is at least you know I mean he's a
programmer<00:06:47.260> so<00:06:47.620> he's<00:06:47.740> not<00:06:47.860> going<00:06:47.920> to<00:06:48.070> make<00:06:48.130> any

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
programmer so he's not going to make any

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.030 
programmer so he's not going to make any
really<00:06:48.730> stupid<00:06:49.060> mistakes<00:06:49.710> he's<00:06:50.710> going<00:06:50.860> to<00:06:50.920> get

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
really stupid mistakes he's going to get

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.380 
really stupid mistakes he's going to get
another<00:06:51.220> observer<00:06:51.460> out<00:06:51.760> probably<00:06:52.060> or<00:06:52.330> at

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:52.390 
another observer out probably or at

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.580 
another observer out probably or at
least<00:06:52.540> he's<00:06:52.690> gonna<00:06:52.810> keep<00:06:53.020> that<00:06:53.200> one<00:06:53.320> observer

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
least he's gonna keep that one observer

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.200 
least he's gonna keep that one observer
with<00:06:53.800> his<00:06:53.950> army<00:06:54.250> yeah<00:06:54.760> it<00:06:54.820> looks<00:06:54.970> like<00:06:55.090> he's

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
with his army yeah it looks like he's

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.730 
with his army yeah it looks like he's
sending<00:06:55.480> it<00:06:55.600> his<00:06:55.720> observer<00:06:56.110> to<00:06:56.230> Scouts<00:06:56.500> he's

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
sending it his observer to Scouts he's

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.020 
sending it his observer to Scouts he's
probably<00:06:56.890> gonna<00:06:57.040> get<00:06:57.220> a<00:06:57.250> second<00:06:57.580> observer<00:06:57.850> and

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030 
probably gonna get a second observer and

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.940 
probably gonna get a second observer and
rally<00:06:58.210> at<00:06:58.390> to<00:06:58.540> his<00:06:58.660> choke<00:06:58.900> point<00:06:59.170> to<00:06:59.710> meet<00:06:59.860> up

00:06:59.940 --> 00:06:59.950 
rally at to his choke point to meet up

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.340 
rally at to his choke point to meet up
with<00:06:59.980> his<00:07:00.160> army<00:07:00.510> and<00:07:01.510> the<00:07:01.600> actual<00:07:01.780> oh<00:07:02.050> look

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350 
with his army and the actual oh look

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.030 
with his army and the actual oh look
here<00:07:02.920> comes<00:07:03.160> to<00:07:03.280> dt<00:07:03.960> well<00:07:04.960> maybe<00:07:05.380> I<00:07:05.500> was<00:07:05.800> wrong

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:06.040 
here comes to dt well maybe I was wrong

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.310 
here comes to dt well maybe I was wrong
maybe<00:07:06.940> oh<00:07:07.060> look<00:07:07.480> at<00:07:07.570> this<00:07:07.630> he's<00:07:07.810> got<00:07:07.990> a<00:07:08.020> wall

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
maybe oh look at this he's got a wall

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.890 
maybe oh look at this he's got a wall
okay<00:07:09.190> he's<00:07:09.400> has<00:07:09.610> a<00:07:09.640> wall<00:07:09.970> the<00:07:10.150> dt<00:07:10.480> can't<00:07:10.750> get

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:10.900 
okay he's has a wall the dt can't get

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.380 
okay he's has a wall the dt can't get
past<00:07:11.220> nice<00:07:12.220> except<00:07:12.730> he<00:07:12.790> just<00:07:12.970> opened<00:07:13.270> up<00:07:13.330> that

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.390 
past nice except he just opened up that

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.920 
past nice except he just opened up that
wall<00:07:13.690> which<00:07:14.380> is<00:07:14.500> interesting<00:07:15.360> maybe<00:07:16.360> didn't

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:16.930 
wall which is interesting maybe didn't

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.480 
wall which is interesting maybe didn't
make<00:07:17.050> another<00:07:17.380> observer<00:07:17.820> which<00:07:18.820> would<00:07:19.030> be

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
make another observer which would be

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.640 
make another observer which would be
silly<00:07:21.690> silly<00:07:22.690> would<00:07:22.930> be<00:07:23.050> a<00:07:23.080> word<00:07:23.470> of
