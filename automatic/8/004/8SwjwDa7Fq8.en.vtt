00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.569

because<00:02:45.579> I<00:02:45.939> look<00:02:46.510> like<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.750> boy<00:02:46.959> growing<00:02:47.440> up<00:02:47.739> I

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
because I look like a boy growing up I

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.250 
because I look like a boy growing up I
always<00:02:49.030> had<00:02:49.209> my<00:02:49.420> brother's<00:02:49.690> hand-me-downs

always had my brother's hand-me-downs

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.569 
always had my brother's hand-me-downs
because<00:02:50.829> we're<00:02:51.040> small<00:02:51.340> for<00:02:51.790> for<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:53.340> my<00:02:54.340> mom

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
because we're small for for and my mom

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.170 
because we're small for for and my mom
really<00:02:54.940> didn't<00:02:56.220> care<00:02:57.220> about<00:02:57.400> fashion<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:58.000> guess

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
really didn't care about fashion I guess

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.680 
really didn't care about fashion I guess
and<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:59.139> I<00:02:59.470> always<00:02:59.739> had<00:02:59.980> boys<00:03:00.190> clothes<00:03:00.489> ah

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
and so I always had boys clothes ah

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.170 
and so I always had boys clothes ah
maybe<00:03:02.530> that's<00:03:02.739> why<00:03:02.950> everything<00:03:03.519> I<00:03:03.639> design<00:03:03.940> is

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180

until<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:47.240> was<00:04:47.540> much<00:04:47.870> older<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.790> my<00:04:49.790> mother<00:04:49.970> was

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
until I was much older and my mother was

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.430 
until I was much older and my mother was
surprised<00:04:50.540> that<00:04:50.750> I<00:04:50.840> had<00:04:50.960> switched<00:04:51.110> careers

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
surprised that I had switched careers

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.310 
surprised that I had switched careers
and<00:04:51.970> she<00:04:52.970> thought<00:04:53.150> maybe<00:04:53.389> was<00:04:53.660> because<00:04:53.990> I<00:04:54.020> was

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
and she thought maybe was because I was

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.350 
and she thought maybe was because I was
running<00:04:54.800> my<00:04:55.100> blood

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.950 

I<00:04:59.479> think<00:05:00.050> most<00:05:00.229> much<00:05:00.469> as<00:05:00.650> we<00:05:00.830> tell<00:05:01.039> a<00:05:01.069> story

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
I think most much as we tell a story

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.790 
I think most much as we tell a story
beginning<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.110> an<00:05:03.169> ending<00:05:03.560> and

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
beginning and an ending and

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.100 
beginning and an ending and
what<00:05:05.099> and<00:05:05.460> it's<00:05:05.669> not<00:05:05.819> the<00:05:06.060> story<00:05:06.419> of<00:05:06.690> a<00:05:06.840> team

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
what and it's not the story of a team

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:26.850 
what and it's not the story of a team
but<00:05:07.650> a<00:05:07.949> story<00:05:08.490> through<00:05:08.879> the<00:05:08.910> designers

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.340 

there<00:05:27.860> has<00:05:28.010> to<00:05:28.040> be<00:05:28.160> a<00:05:28.220> reason<00:05:28.610> for<00:05:29.110> being<00:05:30.110> a

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
there has to be a reason for being a

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.380 
there has to be a reason for being a
designer<00:05:30.680> what's<00:05:31.220> so<00:05:31.580> different<00:05:31.850> about<00:05:32.210> this
