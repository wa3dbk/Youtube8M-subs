screens or a little round icons versus

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.089 
screens or a little round icons versus
yes<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:40.300> an<00:02:40.750> idea<00:02:41.019> with<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.349> versus<00:02:42.069> the

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
yes so an idea with that versus the

yes so an idea with that versus the
usual<00:02:42.550> square<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.030> we've<00:02:43.180> seen<00:02:43.480> everywhere

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
usual square that we've seen everywhere

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.180 
usual square that we've seen everywhere
else<00:02:44.200> in<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.380> iOS<00:02:44.709> although<00:02:44.950> it's<00:02:45.069> not

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
else in the iOS although it's not

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.160 
else in the iOS although it's not
technically<00:02:45.610> iOS<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.660> let's<00:02:46.810> take<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:46.989> look

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
technically iOS so let's take a look

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.170 
technically iOS so let's take a look
here<00:02:47.290> what<00:02:47.440> we<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:47.590> top<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.489> top<00:02:48.640> finally

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
here what we have top the top finally

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.789 
here what we have top the top finally
mentioned<00:02:49.630> there's<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> little<00:02:50.170> power<00:02:50.350> button

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
mentioned there's a little power button

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.020 
mentioned there's a little power button
which<00:02:51.040> is<00:02:51.100> little<00:02:51.220> bit<00:02:51.340> different<00:02:51.519> before<00:02:51.790> you

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
which is little bit different before you

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.460 
which is little bit different before you
hold<00:02:52.180> down<00:02:52.269> like<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.569> pause<00:02:52.780> button<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.319> get

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
hold down like the pause button to get

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.220 
hold down like the pause button to get
it<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.680> go<00:02:53.940> over<00:02:54.940> on<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.390> side<00:02:55.720> here<00:02:56.049> what<00:02:56.140> do

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
it to go over on the side here what do

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.630 
it to go over on the side here what do
we<00:02:56.290> get<00:02:56.440> so<00:02:56.590> we<00:02:56.680> have<00:02:56.769> a<00:02:56.890> volume<00:02:57.190> up<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.580> down

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
we get so we have a volume up and down

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.820 
we get so we have a volume up and down
looks<00:02:58.420> like<00:02:58.569> there's<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.780> middle<00:02:59.110> click<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.620> on

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
looks like there's a middle click to on

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.280 
looks like there's a middle click to on
this<00:03:00.069> if<00:03:00.819> you<00:03:00.880> I'm<00:03:01.420> not<00:03:01.540> too<00:03:01.690> sure<00:03:01.840> if<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:01.989> does

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
this if you I'm not too sure if it does

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.199 
this if you I'm not too sure if it does
anything<00:03:02.799> if<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.040> hold<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.340> down<00:03:03.519> but<00:03:03.730> there<00:03:04.090> is

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
anything if I hold it down but there is

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.880 
anything if I hold it down but there is
that<00:03:04.420> then<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.080> got<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.290> home<00:03:05.470> button<00:03:05.769> then

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
that then you got the home button then

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.160 
that then you got the home button then
