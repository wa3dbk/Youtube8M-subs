little<00:00:34.739> eyes<00:00:35.070> I'm<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.820> think<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> eyes<00:00:36.630> are

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.180 
little eyes I'm I think the eyes are
chocolate<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.800> probably<00:00:38.129> just

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
chocolate but it's it's probably just

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.100 
chocolate but it's it's probably just
some<00:00:38.370> sort<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.579> food<00:00:38.760> coloring<00:00:39.210> who<00:00:39.450> knows<00:00:39.660> if

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
some sort of food coloring who knows if

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.330 
some sort of food coloring who knows if
there<00:00:40.410> were<00:00:40.500> chocolate<00:00:40.710> that'd<00:00:41.010> be<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> nice

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
there were chocolate that'd be a nice

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.560 
there were chocolate that'd be a nice
touch<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.700> think<00:00:41.730> there<00:00:41.940> are<00:00:42.059> chocalate<00:00:42.390> peeps

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
touch I think there are chocalate peeps

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.560 
touch I think there are chocalate peeps
these<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:44.340> no<00:00:44.760> idea<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:45.149> flavor<00:00:45.390> they

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
these I have no idea what flavor they

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.959 
these I have no idea what flavor they
are<00:00:45.739> babies<00:00:46.739> don't<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> flavor<00:00:47.670> I

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
are babies don't really have a flavor I

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.209 
are babies don't really have a flavor I
don't<00:00:48.120> think<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.690> marshmallow<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.920> I

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
don't think it's just marshmallow and I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.369
