00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.579
 our friend domingo guzmÃ¡n makes us the 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.439
 next question how often is it 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.989
 do in carbohydrate loading 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.780
 in what proportion what kind of 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:36.280
 carbohydrates and if it's better to drink between 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.280
 meals or during meals 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.420
 and on Sunday I guess when you 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.390
 you mean to do carbohydrate loading 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.120
 it's because you're preparing for a 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.989
 competition and we need first 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.640
 download download the body of 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.400
 glycogen to create by a super 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.670
 compensation that on stage 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.409
 of the event 7 fullest half fullest and 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.689
 better definition well 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.609
 the proportion you should have of 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.039
 carbohydrates mathematically for 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:13.200
 that you do not lie in the next my 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:17.009
 advice is to start the load by taking 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.679
 or what are 3 grams 33 grams per 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.990
 pound of carbohydrates net of 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:25.439
 food by body weight so what 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.530
 that equal about 6 or 7 grams per kilo of 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.299
 net carbohydrate body weight the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.119
 type of carbohydrate to choose is the one 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.920
 higher glycemic index contain because 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.899
 in this way the high peaks of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.959
 Insulin will help us by loading 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.030
 better glycogen muscle and more 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.310
 quickly 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.200
 and the next question if it's better 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.570
 between meals or during meals 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.200
 in the case of loading the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.960
 carbohydrates is better to take all 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.960
 Daily water distributed with meals
