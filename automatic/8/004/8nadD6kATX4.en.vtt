get<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:13.060> with<00:01:13.330> that<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:13.930> main<00:01:14.170> body<00:01:14.470> theme<00:01:14.799> we

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
get so with that the main body theme we

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.760 
get so with that the main body theme we
call<00:01:15.549> function<00:01:16.150> sculpting<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.899> mainly<00:01:17.560> we

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
call function sculpting and mainly we

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.889 
call function sculpting and mainly we
wanted<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.490> create<00:01:18.880> something<00:01:19.119> not<00:01:19.659> only

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
wanted to create something not only

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.109 
wanted to create something not only
functional<00:01:20.170> but<00:01:20.440> beautiful<00:01:21.040> but<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.850> form

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
functional but beautiful but the form

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.450 
functional but beautiful but the form
seemed<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.509> be<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.659> result<00:01:23.110> of<00:01:23.409> what<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.250> wind

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
seemed to be a result of what the wind

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.510 
seemed to be a result of what the wind
is<00:01:24.610> doing<00:01:24.670> for<00:01:25.330> cooling<00:01:26.399> requirements<00:01:27.399> and

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
is doing for cooling requirements and

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.060 
is doing for cooling requirements and
also<00:01:27.789> air<00:01:28.000> management<00:01:28.830> clearly<00:01:29.830> some<00:01:30.039> of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
also air management clearly some of

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.649 
also air management clearly some of
these<00:01:30.220> shapes<00:01:30.549> that<00:01:30.759> we've<00:01:30.940> created<00:01:31.210> would<00:01:31.509> be

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
these shapes that we've created would be

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.870 
these shapes that we've created would be
a<00:01:31.690> bit<00:01:31.930> difficult<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.740> realize<00:01:33.490> in<00:01:33.670> sheet

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
a bit difficult to realize in sheet

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
the rear and air outlet actually the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.620 
the rear and air outlet actually the
tail<00:01:55.780> light<00:01:56.399> system<00:01:57.399> we<00:01:57.549> actually<00:01:57.580> if<00:01:58.450> you

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
tail light system we actually if you

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.270 
tail light system we actually if you
look<00:01:58.840> at<00:01:59.080> it<00:01:59.229> there's<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.470> there's<00:01:59.860> a<00:01:59.920> crease

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
look at it there's a there's a crease

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.910 
look at it there's a there's a crease
and<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:00.580> has<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.729> bit<00:02:00.909> of<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:01.090> fin<00:02:01.590> idea<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:02.770> it's

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
and it has a bit of a fin idea so it's

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.529 
and it has a bit of a fin idea so it's
actually<00:02:03.100> could<00:02:03.549> function<00:02:03.970> as<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.119> bit<00:02:04.390> of<00:02:04.420> a

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
actually could function as a bit of a

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.749 
actually could function as a bit of a
spoiler<00:02:04.840> as<00:02:05.200> well<00:02:05.409> for<00:02:05.740> creating<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.549> bit<00:02:06.670> of

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
spoiler as well for creating a bit of

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.969 
spoiler as well for creating a bit of
downforce<00:02:07.240> on<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.630> rear<00:02:07.810> so<00:02:08.410> wanted<00:02:08.709> that<00:02:08.860> to

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
downforce on the rear so wanted that to

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.430 
downforce on the rear so wanted that to
be<00:02:09.039> functional<00:02:09.970> as<00:02:10.090> well<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:11.019> the<00:02:11.170> front

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
be functional as well and the front

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.960 
be functional as well and the front
we're<00:02:11.680> flowing<00:02:12.070> of<00:02:12.370> more<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.760> horizontal

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
we're flowing of more of a horizontal

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.380 
we're flowing of more of a horizontal
motif<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.989> keep<00:02:14.140> things<00:02:14.410> low<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.920> wide<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:15.519> an

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
motif to keep things low and wide and an

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.450 
motif to keep things low and wide and an
LED<00:02:16.680> system<00:02:17.680> without<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:18.010> lens<00:02:18.340> cover

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
LED system without a lens cover

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.210 
LED system without a lens cover
so<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.610> has<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.910> bit<00:02:20.120> more<00:02:20.290> raw<00:02:21.290> pure<00:02:21.860> authentic

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
so it has a bit more raw pure authentic

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.640 
so it has a bit more raw pure authentic

wants to develop more exciting cars so I

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.420 
wants to develop more exciting cars so I
think<00:02:34.910> all<00:02:35.240> that<00:02:35.450> falling<00:02:36.050> into<00:02:36.350> in<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.250> line

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
think all that falling into in the line

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.280 
think all that falling into in the line
really<00:02:37.820> made<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.150> car<00:02:38.360> possible<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.140> we

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
really made this car possible that we

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.650 
really made this car possible that we
could<00:02:39.440> show<00:02:39.680> it<00:02:39.860> here<00:02:40.010> in<00:02:40.100> Detroit<00:02:40.460> now<00:02:40.660> so

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
could show it here in Detroit now so

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.150 
could show it here in Detroit now so
some<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.020> interesting<00:02:42.320> design<00:02:42.620> features

are<00:02:54.290> these<00:02:54.950> standalone<00:02:55.460> meters<00:02:55.820> so<00:02:56.690> in<00:02:57.020> the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
are these standalone meters so in the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.500 
are these standalone meters so in the
style<00:02:58.070> of<00:02:58.190> everything<00:02:58.670> in<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.850> car<00:02:59.060> we're

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
style of everything in the car we're

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.700 
style of everything in the car we're
trying<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.960> bring<00:03:00.230> things<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.620> are

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
trying to bring things that are

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.040 
trying to bring things that are
sometimes<00:03:01.160> quiet<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.240> mundane<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.810> make

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
sometimes quiet and mundane and make

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.440 
sometimes quiet and mundane and make
them<00:03:03.260> engaging<00:03:03.650> in<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.070> entertaining<00:03:04.790> so<00:03:05.360> we

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
them engaging in it entertaining so we

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.910 
them engaging in it entertaining so we
have<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.690> temperature<00:03:06.050> meter<00:03:06.590> which<00:03:06.890> is

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
have the temperature meter which is

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.130 
have the temperature meter which is
actually<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.430> physical<00:03:07.670> meter<00:03:08.060> coming<00:03:08.870> off<00:03:08.990> the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
actually a physical meter coming off the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.710 
actually a physical meter coming off the
stock<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:10.130> fuel<00:03:10.370> on<00:03:10.550> this<00:03:10.700> side<00:03:10.880> they

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
stock and the fuel on this side they

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.270 
stock and the fuel on this side they
kind<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:11.990> look<00:03:12.170> like<00:03:12.200> thermometers<00:03:12.890> but<00:03:12.950> I

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
kind of look like thermometers but I

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.220 
kind of look like thermometers but I
think<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.210> for<00:03:14.330> anybody<00:03:14.690> who<00:03:14.840> consists<00:03:15.200> in

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
think and for anybody who consists in

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.750 
think and for anybody who consists in
this<00:03:15.350> space<00:03:15.590> they<00:03:15.890> kind<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:16.220> get<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.370> sense<00:03:16.430> that

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
this space they kind of get a sense that

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.070 
this space they kind of get a sense that
there's<00:03:17.030> something<00:03:17.240> special<00:03:17.390> about<00:03:17.840> them

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
there's something special about them

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.440 
there's something special about them
they're<00:03:18.440> not<00:03:18.620> just<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.070> typical<00:03:19.250> meter<00:03:19.610> we<00:03:20.240> kind

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
they're not just a typical meter we kind

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.910 
they're not just a typical meter we kind
of<00:03:20.540> came<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.780> conclusion<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.320> we<00:03:21.530> want<00:03:21.770> your

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
of came the conclusion that we want your

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.640 
of came the conclusion that we want your
eyes<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.130> come<00:03:22.550> here<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.000> focus<00:03:23.840> ahead<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.560> the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
eyes to come here and focus ahead to the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.890 
eyes to come here and focus ahead to the
heads-up<00:03:24.950> meter<00:03:25.160> yet<00:03:25.790> you<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.450> want<00:03:26.720> some

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
heads-up meter yet you you want some

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.450 
heads-up meter yet you you want some
kind<00:03:27.080> of<00:03:27.140> connectivity<00:03:27.590> from<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.010> seat<00:03:28.250> here

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
kind of connectivity from the seat here

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.270 
kind of connectivity from the seat here
so<00:03:29.000> like<00:03:29.960> I<00:03:30.020> said<00:03:30.170> we<00:03:30.560> feel<00:03:30.770> that<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:30.950> are<00:03:31.190> the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
so like I said we feel that you are the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.830 
so like I said we feel that you are the
projectile<00:03:31.790> in<00:03:31.970> this<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.210> you<00:03:32.270> complete<00:03:32.660> the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
projectile in this and you complete the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.170 
projectile in this and you complete the
shape<00:03:33.050> but<00:03:33.350> it's<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:34.640> didn't<00:03:34.910> just<00:03:35.060> happen

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
shape but it's a it didn't just happen

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.810 
shape but it's a it didn't just happen
overnight<00:03:35.510> it's<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:35.930> it's<00:03:36.110> a<00:03:36.200> very<00:03:36.820> reasoned

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
overnight it's a it's a very reasoned

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.970 
overnight it's a it's a very reasoned
approach<00:03:38.260> another<00:03:39.260> really<00:03:39.530> unique<00:03:39.650> feature

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
approach another really unique feature

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.500 
approach another really unique feature
is<00:03:40.250> actually<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.670> material<00:03:41.030> choices<00:03:41.240> that

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
is actually the material choices that

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.740 
is actually the material choices that
went<00:03:41.660> into<00:03:41.840> creating<00:03:42.530> this<00:03:43.190> vehicle<00:03:43.750> because

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
went into creating this vehicle because

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.330 
went into creating this vehicle because
it's<00:03:45.080> a<00:03:45.140> very<00:03:45.350> technical<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:46.010> advanced

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
it's a very technical and advanced

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.430
