encountered the aqua hotel and my very

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.319 
encountered the aqua hotel and my very
first<00:00:19.269> trip<00:00:19.509> to<00:00:19.720> Japan<00:00:20.169> and<00:00:20.820> there<00:00:21.820> was<00:00:21.999> in<00:00:22.179> the

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
first trip to Japan and there was in the

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.220 
first trip to Japan and there was in the
early<00:00:22.499> 1980s<00:00:23.499> and<00:00:24.509> there's<00:00:25.509> kind<00:00:25.869> of<00:00:25.960> a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
early 1980s and there's kind of a

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.229 
early 1980s and there's kind of a
instant<00:00:27.419> falling<00:00:28.419> in<00:00:28.569> laughs<00:00:30.149> traditions<00:00:31.149> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
instant falling in laughs traditions and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.590 
instant falling in laughs traditions and
artisanship<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:36.370> in<00:00:36.519> a<00:00:36.640> very<00:00:37.199> modern<00:00:38.199> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
artisanship but in a very modern and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.830 
artisanship but in a very modern and
extremely<00:00:40.600> contemporary<00:00:41.019> way<00:00:41.590> so<00:00:42.550> I<00:00:43.000> thought

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
extremely contemporary way so I thought

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.560 
extremely contemporary way so I thought
it<00:00:43.960> was<00:00:44.019> very<00:00:44.140> very<00:00:44.530> impressive<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:46.300> think

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
it was very very impressive and I think

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.490 
it was very very impressive and I think
the<00:00:47.379> lesson<00:00:47.829> is<00:00:47.949> also<00:00:48.629> about<00:00:49.629> the<00:00:49.989> idea<00:00:50.320> of

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
the lesson is also about the idea of

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.529 
the lesson is also about the idea of
collaboration<00:00:51.190> I<00:00:51.699> think<00:00:52.179> here<00:00:52.899> you<00:00:53.170> have<00:00:53.469> a

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
collaboration I think here you have a

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.040 
collaboration I think here you have a
visionary<00:00:55.559> owner<00:00:56.969> commissioner<00:00:57.969> you<00:00:58.539> have<00:00:58.780> an

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
visionary owner commissioner you have an

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.739 
visionary owner commissioner you have an
outstanding<00:00:59.499> architect<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:00.850> a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
outstanding architect and a

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.690 
outstanding architect and a
collaboration<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:04.710> artisans<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:06.040> artists

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
collaboration with artisans and artists

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.650 
collaboration with artisans and artists
that<00:01:06.880> bring<00:01:07.660> this<00:01:08.290> building<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:09.610> level<00:01:10.300> that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
that bring this building to a level that

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.990 
that bring this building to a level that
is<00:01:10.840> exceptional<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:11.890> I<00:01:12.430> think<00:01:12.670> this<00:01:12.850> is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
is exceptional and I think this is

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.330 
is exceptional and I think this is
something<00:01:13.420> that<00:01:13.450> can<00:01:13.780> only<00:01:13.960> happen<00:01:14.380> when<00:01:15.040> all

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
something that can only happen when all

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.150 
something that can only happen when all
those<00:01:15.580> ingredients<00:01:16.090> has<00:01:16.570> come<00:01:16.840> together<00:01:17.160> we

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
those ingredients has come together we

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.900 
those ingredients has come together we
all<00:01:18.400> rely<00:01:18.760> on<00:01:18.790> something<00:01:19.330> that<00:01:20.200> has<00:01:20.860> been<00:01:21.160> done

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
all rely on something that has been done

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.630 
all rely on something that has been done
to<00:01:21.940> perfection<00:01:22.300> and<00:01:23.140> that<00:01:23.500> is<00:01:23.710> there<00:01:24.010> that<00:01:24.340> we

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
to perfection and that is there that we

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.170 
to perfection and that is there that we
can<00:01:24.850> go<00:01:25.030> back<00:01:25.300> to<00:01:25.540> and<00:01:26.050> rely<00:01:26.620> on<00:01:27.010> too<00:01:27.580> and<00:01:27.790> I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
can go back to and rely on too and I

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.690 
can go back to and rely on too and I
think<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.750> is<00:01:28.930> why<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.560> core<00:01:30.220> should<00:01:30.520> be

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
think that is why the core should be

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.000 
think that is why the core should be
preserved<00:01:31.120> because<00:01:31.540> it's<00:01:31.900> in<00:01:32.020> an<00:01:32.170> exceptional

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
preserved because it's in an exceptional

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.400 
preserved because it's in an exceptional
structure<00:01:33.640> that<00:01:34.090> part<00:01:34.360> exceptional<00:01:35.020> people

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
structure that part exceptional people

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.230 
structure that part exceptional people
together<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:36.190> I<00:01:36.280> think<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:36.640> will<00:01:36.760> never<00:01:36.940> be

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
together and I think it will never be

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.970 
together and I think it will never be
replicated<00:01:37.450> again<00:01:38.320> I<00:01:38.620> would<00:01:39.220> like<00:01:39.510> to<00:01:40.510> help<00:01:40.980> to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
replicated again I would like to help to

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.240 
replicated again I would like to help to
preserve<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:43.180> Okura
