00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
to create a wall so retaining the soul

to create a wall so retaining the soul
of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> house

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
of the house

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.840 
of the house
it's<00:02:01.259> exactly<00:02:01.560> what<00:02:02.189> about<00:02:02.399> these<00:02:02.579> steel

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
it's exactly what about these steel

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.639 
it's exactly what about these steel
structures<00:02:03.329> I'm<00:02:03.450> sure<00:02:03.600> that's<00:02:03.810> for<00:02:04.170> support

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
structures I'm sure that's for support

structures I'm sure that's for support
as<00:02:04.770> well<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.040> aesthetics<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.640> try<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.939> follow

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
as well as aesthetics I try to follow

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.900 
as well as aesthetics I try to follow
the<00:02:06.390> old<00:02:06.540> adage<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.110> form<00:02:07.469> follows<00:02:07.860> function

when<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:08.940> design<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> house

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
when I design a house

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.930 
when I design a house
I<00:02:10.110> try<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.560> look<00:02:10.800> at<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.190> structure<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.820> an

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
I try and look at the structure in an

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.330 
I try and look at the structure in an
unusual<00:02:12.480> way<00:02:12.510> for<00:02:12.930> example<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.310> a

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
unusual way for example this is a

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.400 
unusual way for example this is a
concrete<00:02:14.640> flare<00:02:15.360> which<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.780> resting<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.380> a

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
concrete flare which is resting on a

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.620 
concrete flare which is resting on a
beam<00:02:16.710> on<00:02:16.740> column<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:17.850> I've<00:02:17.970> extended<00:02:18.360> the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
beam on column but I've extended the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.780 
beam on column but I've extended the
column<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.560> beam<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.580> looks

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
column and the beam so that it looks

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.670 
column and the beam so that it looks
like<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:21.180> floating<00:02:21.450> almost<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.170> create<00:02:22.440> an

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
like it's floating almost to create an

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.650 
like it's floating almost to create an
effect<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.070> at<00:02:23.220> being<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.460> cantilever<00:02:23.970> slab<00:02:24.390> I

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
effect of at being a cantilever slab I

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.340 
effect of at being a cantilever slab I
like<00:02:25.050> it

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
like it

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.650 
like it
every<00:02:25.770> room<00:02:26.040> merges<00:02:26.820> with<00:02:26.850> its<00:02:27.180> external

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
every room merges with its external

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.410 
every room merges with its external
surrounds<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.890> result<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.610> feeling<00:02:30.090> of

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
surrounds the result is a feeling of

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.930 
surrounds the result is a feeling of
absolute<00:02:30.770> freedom<00:02:31.770> I<00:02:32.160> want<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.550> show<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.760> my

favorite room in the house I can see why

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.350 
favorite room in the house I can see why
this<00:02:35.070> would<00:02:35.310> be<00:02:35.400> one<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.670> my<00:02:35.760> favorite<00:02:36.150> rooms

till we close up all the doors it

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.560 
till we close up all the doors it

becomes more of an intimate space but in

becomes more of an intimate space but in
summer<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.260> opens<00:02:46.830> up<00:02:46.980> completely<00:02:47.160> and

when I designed this house I had this

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.530 
when I designed this house I had this
piece<00:03:04.800> in<00:03:05.010> mind<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.430> knew<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.120> just<00:03:06.150> needed

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
piece in mind I knew that it just needed

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.630 
piece in mind I knew that it just needed
to<00:03:06.840> be<00:03:06.990> on<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.440> wall<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.280> fact<00:03:08.490> it

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
to be on this wall and in fact it

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.490 
to be on this wall and in fact it
inspired<00:03:09.030> that<00:03:09.209> fireplace<00:03:09.630> which<00:03:10.050> is<00:03:10.320> also

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
inspired that fireplace which is also

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.130 
inspired that fireplace which is also
parquet<00:03:11.340> floor<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:12.060> have<00:03:12.150> been<00:03:12.330> cut<00:03:12.600> up<00:03:12.870> and

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
I've kept the old bits of glue and all

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.600 
I've kept the old bits of glue and all
the<00:03:16.110> different<00:03:16.260> colors<00:03:16.980> just<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.280> give<00:03:17.489> it

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
the different colors just to give it

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.120 
the different colors just to give it
that<00:03:17.640> edge<00:03:18.000> then<00:03:18.269> patina<00:03:18.750> we've<00:03:19.680> been<00:03:19.800> looking

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
that edge then patina we've been looking

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.320 
that edge then patina we've been looking
at<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> art<00:03:20.459> on<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.640> wall<00:03:20.820> I'm<00:03:21.000> looking<00:03:21.239> at

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
at the art on the wall I'm looking at

at the art on the wall I'm looking at
the<00:03:21.450> natural<00:03:21.630> media<00:03:22.200> outside<00:03:22.290> it's

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
the natural media outside it's

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.620 
the natural media outside it's
interesting<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.820> should<00:03:23.850> say<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.480> was

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
interesting you should say that that was

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.840 
interesting you should say that that was
exactly<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.350> concept<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.070> house<00:03:26.250> we

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
exactly the concept of this house we

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.580 
exactly the concept of this house we
wanted<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.330> make<00:03:27.510> sure<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.900> wherever<00:03:28.110> there

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
wanted to make sure that wherever there

wanted to make sure that wherever there
was<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:29.190> view<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.700> be<00:03:29.820> captured<00:03:30.330> it<00:03:30.810> was

was a view to be captured it was

was a view to be captured it was
captured<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.590> we<00:03:31.709> were<00:03:31.830> quite<00:03:31.950> specific

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
captured and we were quite specific

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.640 
captured and we were quite specific
about<00:03:32.820> where<00:03:33.600> they<00:03:33.720> would<00:03:33.870> be<00:03:33.989> glazing<00:03:34.470> if

about where they would be glazing if
