00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.499
 our society has got used to want to consume bundled with fake 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:14.909
 that's how a lot of products for his transfer are 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.869
 transformed with the years look for example chewing gum candies 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.689
 and confectionery now impossible to cross a radius without seeing 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.489
 appear without sugar a no caloric value actually without them this 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.349
 naming is meant to make me feel better we have so much 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.140
 afraid to consume badly while our desires are very strong that we 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.739
 are looking for products that do not bring us calories but that should 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.070
 to bring us satisfaction 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.760
 for candies and chewing gums we found a new 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.510
 product race called polyols 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.500
 which are actually what's called alcohol sugars that they have them 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.140
 characteristics of sugar but with a chemical alcohol function which makes 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.650
 instead of the loire 4 calories per gram a ball usually comma 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.050
 capra de comma 7 calories per gram 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.850
 that does not mean it runs do not contain calories that 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.220
 does it mean it contain half less 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.190
 but you know the benefits we rarely have an advantage of being whole and 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.790
 this one has a disadvantage is that these sugars alcohol moderately 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.320
 well digested by the intestine will give you from time to time some 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.570
 digestive disorders and bloating with small intestinal discomfort 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.100
 so you have the right to consume when you take these sugar-free products they 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.940
 contain half the energy of conventional products, but know 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.980
 that the consequences it will be a small time barragued aspect that could 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.800
 become very embarrassing 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.500
 consumption of these products 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.340
 finally remember that as it is about candies 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.740
 that contain calories or that do not contain moderation is 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.740
 consider on products not for what they contain 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.190
 for those who turn it into beautiful eating behavior then machaie 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.510
 some chewing gum and then finally made the rule of two by two 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.850
 without sugar and a hit successfully and you will see that you will take as many 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.120
 pleasure 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.290
 good day ride said
