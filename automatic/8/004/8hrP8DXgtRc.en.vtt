00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.069
 current top five killstreak 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.090
 compilation for this week today 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.309
 exceptionally only with clips from call of 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.900
 Duty we do not want time again 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.130
 lose and start today with the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.279
 placement number of call of duty 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.529
 black ops 2 1 1 broadcast by user monster 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.090
 he just makes us feel like 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.859
 nice and moldy in the corner and mold 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.060
 one opponent after another switched off 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.199
 Not so bad at all 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.609
 bad but I honestly 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.080
 said already done 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.269
 maybe not necessarily in call of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.619
 duty black ops 2 1 goes the can 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.219
 not yet seen 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.420
 for sure 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.430
 one or the other with me already 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.800
 can have played by now 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.170
 still attest respect to the user 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.270
 monster makes it really cool here 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.620
 I personally find even if the one 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.239
 or others certainly a bit 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.930
 what witzbold fighting has to do so 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.820
 top placement number 4 bsc is hotmail 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.289
 or you want to pronounce it completely 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.210
 short clip but that does not matter 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.280
 we see the user same again he 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.399
 has played call of duty modern warfare 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.680
 3 and also modern warfare 3 is a clip 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.840
 Placement number three here from the user 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.790
 stay soldier he shows us how to get here 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.490
 just beautiful through the map is running 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.510
 and one kill after another 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.159
 also shaves off when I personally like that 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.409
 all the way to those weird golden emblems 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.210
 Personally, I do not understand how 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.619
 one with a golden or another 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.420
 worse with such swarovski stones 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.689
 own what he runs through the area 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.729
 can 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.750
 honestly that 's not something I'm proud of 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.240
 would be 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.409
 no matter place number two know the user 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 we are a bit fat or 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.280
 incentive I have no idea 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.590
 of course pronounce call of duty black 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.390
 ops 2 and he shows us again 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.820
 Of course we will use that again 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.869
 already how to neat black ops 24 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.590
 plays so I have it already 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.840
 indicated bsc sports field only one, too 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.369
 here with the golden waffles he lmg 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.579
 shows us how to be nice here on the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.470
 ship properly cashed or one 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.970
 wiped out opponents one by one and 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.229
 I can tell you one equals 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.570
 again nice showdown 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.250
 nice very end here drop the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.619
 complete opposing team at one 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.880
 Just put it that 's it 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.350
 For this week I say thanks for 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.719
