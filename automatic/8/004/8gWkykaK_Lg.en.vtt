00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
to make one of these things it's a

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.059 
to make one of these things it's a
volume<00:00:05.850> control<00:00:06.890> originally<00:00:07.890> it<00:00:07.980> was

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
volume control originally it was

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.610 
volume control originally it was
attached<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.639> set<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.000> headphones<00:00:09.620> so

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
attached to a set of headphones so

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.810 
attached to a set of headphones so
here's<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.920> meeting<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.309> would<00:00:11.429> go<00:00:11.580> into

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
here's the meeting that would go into

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.109 
here's the meeting that would go into
the<00:00:15.230> mp3<00:00:16.230> player<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.770> then<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:17.940> side

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the mp3 player and then this side

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.120 
the mp3 player and then this side
normally<00:00:18.390> had<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> set<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.869> headphones<00:00:19.050> with<00:00:19.560> a

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
normally had a set of headphones with a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.660 
normally had a set of headphones with a
little<00:00:20.490> volume<00:00:21.330> control<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.710> basically<00:00:23.460> what

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
little volume control and basically what

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.330 
little volume control and basically what
I<00:00:23.699> did<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.119> took<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.840> apart<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.380> put<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
I did was I took this apart and put in a

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.400 
I did was I took this apart and put in a
pinch<00:00:29.340> mini<00:00:29.609> female<00:00:30.090> adapter<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.320> I

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
pinch mini female adapter so that I

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.049 
pinch mini female adapter so that I
could<00:00:31.590> plug<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.890> any<00:00:32.009> set<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.309> headphones<00:00:32.430> into

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
could plug in any set of headphones into

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.630 
could plug in any set of headphones into
it<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:36.079> have<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> volume<00:00:37.469> control<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.399> say

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it and have a volume control and you say

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.270 
it and have a volume control and you say
why<00:00:38.850> would<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.120> want<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.329> well<00:00:39.980> clay<00:00:40.980> made<00:00:41.250> a

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
why would you want that well clay made a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.400 
why would you want that well clay made a
very<00:00:41.550> good<00:00:41.640> point<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.239> I've<00:00:42.390> also<00:00:42.960> ran<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
very good point and I've also ran to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.190 
very good point and I've also ran to
that<00:00:43.440> same<00:00:43.920> issue<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.489> when<00:00:45.420> I'm<00:00:45.539> using<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
that same issue of when I'm using the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.139 
that same issue of when I'm using the
snow<00:00:46.410> blower<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.860> listen<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> an<00:00:47.460> mp3<00:00:47.760> player

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
snow blower I listen to an mp3 player

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.880 
snow blower I listen to an mp3 player
that<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.420> put<00:00:48.629> into<00:00:48.750> my<00:00:48.870> pocket<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.530> dip<00:00:49.770> it

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
that I put into my pocket and I dip it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.470 
that I put into my pocket and I dip it
up<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.760> closed<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.949> usually

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
up and it's closed and and usually

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.729 
up and it's closed and and usually
inadvertently<00:00:54.480> hit<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> hole<00:00:55.110> button<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.710> now

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
inadvertently hit the hole button so now

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.650 
inadvertently hit the hole button so now
I<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.160> adjust<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.520> volumes<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.300> big

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
I can adjust the volumes it's this big

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.420 
I can adjust the volumes it's this big
process<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.379> mean<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.800> pretty<00:00:59.010> nice<00:00:59.219> I

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
process I mean this is pretty nice I

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.849 
process I mean this is pretty nice I
could<00:00:59.579> just<00:00:59.730> clip<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> front<00:01:01.680> you

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
could just clip this on the front you

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.520 
could just clip this on the front you
know<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.719> then<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.960> my<00:01:04.949> volume<00:01:05.250> control<00:01:05.549> so

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
know and then have my volume control so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.350 
know and then have my volume control so
it's<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.619> couple<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.950> steps<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.490> because<00:01:09.299> I

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
it's a couple of steps that I because I

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.240 
it's a couple of steps that I because I
previously<00:01:09.810> recorded<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.409> how-to<00:01:10.830> part

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
previously recorded the how-to part

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.500 
previously recorded the how-to part
there's<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> couple<00:01:11.670> steps<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.479> I

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
there's a couple steps in there that I

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.730 
there's a couple steps in there that I
didn't<00:01:14.000> been<00:01:15.000> talked<00:01:15.270> about<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
didn't been talked about and one is the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.980 
didn't been talked about and one is the
polarity<00:01:17.040> now<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:20.100> problem<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.600> me<00:01:21.600> telling

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
polarity now the problem with me telling

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
polarity now the problem with me telling
you<00:01:22.049> exactly<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.619> color<00:01:22.860> wires<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> fact

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you exactly what color wires is the fact

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.590 
you exactly what color wires is the fact
they're<00:01:24.030> all<00:01:24.150> different

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
they're all different

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.700 
they're all different
the<00:01:25.170> original<00:01:26.159> was<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> blue<00:01:27.540> red<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the original was a blue red with the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.289 
the original was a blue red with the
ground<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:30.799> mini<00:01:31.799> part<00:01:32.070> had<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> black

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
ground and this mini part had a black

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.960 
ground and this mini part had a black
red<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> ground<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.400> only<00:01:35.610> way<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> make

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
red with the ground the only way to make

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 
red with the ground the only way to make
sure<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.509> definitely<00:01:37.380> 100%<00:01:37.740> correct

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
sure you get it definitely 100% correct

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.810 
sure you get it definitely 100% correct
is<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:39.720> use<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> meter<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.520> don't<00:01:41.700> have

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
is to use a meter but if you don't have

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.520 
is to use a meter but if you don't have
a<00:01:41.850> meter<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.630> general<00:01:43.110> rule<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:45.570> one

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
a meter the general rule is if the one

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.950 
a meter the general rule is if the one
of<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> wires<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.189> black<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:48.450> always<00:01:48.810> going

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
of the wires is black it's always going

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.210 
of the wires is black it's always going
to<00:01:48.990> be<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> right<00:01:49.350> channel<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.100> have

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
to be the right channel so you can have

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.330 
to be the right channel so you can have
a<00:01:50.250> white<00:01:50.700> black<00:01:51.060> blue<00:01:51.689> black<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> red<00:01:52.470> black<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
a white black blue black a red black the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.830 
a white black blue black a red black the
black<00:01:53.610> will<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.149> right<00:01:54.360> channel<00:01:55.130> if<00:01:56.840> you

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
black will be the right channel if you

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.480 
black will be the right channel if you
have<00:01:57.990> other<00:01:58.259> color<00:01:58.969> in<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.210> red

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
have other color in a red

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.310 
have other color in a red
then<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.240> red<00:02:02.479> is<00:02:02.509> always<00:02:02.990> gonna<00:02:03.110> be<00:02:03.229> the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
then the red is always gonna be the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.810 
then the red is always gonna be the
right<00:02:03.439> channel<00:02:03.829> so<00:02:03.979> if<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:04.159> have<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.310> blue<00:02:04.549> red

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
right channel so if you have a blue red

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.330 
right channel so if you have a blue red

color<00:02:13.190> combination<00:02:13.840> white<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:15.020> left<00:02:15.319> red<00:02:15.950> is

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
color combination white is left red is

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.820 
color combination white is left red is
right<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:16.989> let's<00:02:17.989> get<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.319> demo<00:02:18.500> if

usually<00:03:46.840> any<00:03:47.840> electronics<00:03:48.440> supply<00:03:49.130> place<00:03:49.400> so

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
usually any electronics supply place so

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.440 
usually any electronics supply place so
here<00:03:50.540> we<00:03:50.690> have<00:03:50.900> our<00:03:51.110> volume<00:03:51.380> control<00:03:51.770> unit<00:03:52.450> it

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
here we have our volume control unit it

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.790 
here we have our volume control unit it
has<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:54.050> volume<00:03:54.709> in<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:56.050> stereo<00:03:57.050> mono<00:03:57.319> switch

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
has a volume in a stereo mono switch

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.800 
has a volume in a stereo mono switch
which<00:03:58.580> I've<00:03:58.790> never<00:03:58.940> seen<00:03:59.180> on<00:03:59.300> any<00:03:59.330> other<00:03:59.510> ones

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
which I've never seen on any other ones

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.900 
which I've never seen on any other ones
but<00:04:00.050> that's<00:04:00.380> a<00:04:00.560> pretty<00:04:00.800> cool<00:04:00.950> feature<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:01.690> and

there you have it and we're going to
place<00:04:06.470> this<00:04:06.890> mini<00:04:07.340> so<00:04:07.910> that<00:04:08.330> way<00:04:08.420> we<00:04:08.570> can<00:04:08.630> use

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
place this mini so that way we can use

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.120 
place this mini so that way we can use
any<00:04:09.019> set<00:04:09.709> of<00:04:09.830> headphones<00:04:10.120> with<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:11.300> instead<00:04:11.570> of

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
any set of headphones with it instead of

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.310 
any set of headphones with it instead of
having<00:04:13.130> it<00:04:13.250> just<00:04:13.489> dedicated<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:14.060> one<00:04:14.209> pair<00:04:14.480> now

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
having it just dedicated to one pair now

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.590 
having it just dedicated to one pair now
you<00:04:15.530> don't<00:04:16.040> have<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.250> do<00:04:16.430> this<00:04:16.579> and<00:04:16.940> you<00:04:17.269> can

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.130 
still follow these instructions and use
a<00:04:20.919> normal<00:04:21.919> set<00:04:22.160> of<00:04:22.280> headphones<00:04:22.900> instead<00:04:23.900> of

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
a normal set of headphones instead of

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.600 
a normal set of headphones instead of
putting<00:04:24.290> this<00:04:24.380> on<00:04:24.560> but<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.860> liked<00:04:25.250> this<00:04:25.400> idea

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
putting this on but I liked this idea

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.790 
putting this on but I liked this idea
better<00:04:25.970> because<00:04:26.450> that<00:04:26.660> way<00:04:26.780> I'm<00:04:27.050> not<00:04:27.169> fixed<00:04:27.710> to

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
better because that way I'm not fixed to

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.500 
better because that way I'm not fixed to
one<00:04:27.830> pair<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:29.950> you<00:04:30.950> have<00:04:31.100> it<00:04:31.300> so<00:04:32.300> now<00:04:32.450> the

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
one pair and you have it so now the

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.030 
one pair and you have it so now the
first<00:04:32.930> thing<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.200> do<00:04:33.260> is<00:04:33.500> take<00:04:33.680> this<00:04:33.860> thing

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
first thing I do is take this thing

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.070 
first thing I do is take this thing
apart<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:36.160> this<00:04:37.160> one<00:04:37.400> had<00:04:37.700> a<00:04:38.060> set<00:04:38.810> screw<00:04:39.020> that

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
apart and this one had a set screw that

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.530 
apart and this one had a set screw that
was<00:04:39.320> behind<00:04:39.650> this<00:04:39.800> door<00:04:40.280> that<00:04:40.550> was<00:04:41.360> in<00:04:41.479> the

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
was behind this door that was in the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.900 
was behind this door that was in the
back<00:04:41.750> of<00:04:41.930> his<00:04:42.050> unit<00:04:42.410> so<00:04:43.100> I<00:04:43.130> removed<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.700> door

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
back of his unit so I removed the door

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.240 
back of his unit so I removed the door
revealed<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:45.020> set<00:04:45.260> screw<00:04:45.820> right<00:04:46.820> there<00:04:48.250> took

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
revealed the set screw right there took

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.219 
revealed the set screw right there took
the<00:04:49.370> set<00:04:49.580> screw<00:04:49.820> out<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:51.820> voila<00:04:52.820> it<00:04:53.419> came

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
the set screw out and voila it came

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.700 
the set screw out and voila it came
apart<00:04:54.850> so<00:04:55.850> now<00:04:56.479> you<00:04:56.539> need<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.229> do<00:04:57.350> a<00:04:57.380> little<00:04:57.590> bit

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
apart so now you need to do a little bit

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.029 
apart so now you need to do a little bit
visual<00:04:58.010> inspection<00:04:58.610> see<00:04:59.560> make<00:05:00.560> sure<00:05:00.740> you<00:05:00.890> have

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039

myself
here<00:05:29.450> we<00:05:29.510> go<00:05:29.810> so<00:05:29.960> we're<00:05:30.740> removing<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.340> wires

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
here we go so we're removing the wires

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.200 
here we go so we're removing the wires
that<00:05:32.539> go<00:05:32.600> to<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:32.930> headphone<00:05:33.970> siding<00:05:34.970> are<00:05:35.090> we

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
that go to the headphone siding are we

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.640 
that go to the headphone siding are we
just<00:05:35.390> touching<00:05:35.690> the<00:05:35.720> side<00:05:36.229> iron<00:05:36.500> to<00:05:36.620> the

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
just touching the side iron to the

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.740 
just touching the side iron to the
solder<00:05:36.950> points<00:05:37.190> and<00:05:37.550> give<00:05:38.330> it<00:05:38.419> a<00:05:38.510> slight<00:05:38.720> tug

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
solder points and give it a slight tug

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.610 
solder points and give it a slight tug
and<00:05:39.169> the<00:05:39.229> wires<00:05:39.470> coming<00:05:39.830> off<00:05:40.070> and<00:05:41.320> so<00:05:42.320> now<00:05:42.470> it's

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
and the wires coming off and so now it's

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.920 
and the wires coming off and so now it's
removed<00:05:42.979> out<00:05:43.370> here<00:05:43.729> we<00:05:43.940> cut

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
removed out here we cut

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.999 
removed out here we cut
stripped-back<00:05:45.620> the<00:05:46.070> mini<00:05:46.789> and<00:05:47.539> now<00:05:48.500> we<00:05:48.560> are

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
stripped-back the mini and now we are

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:50.800 
stripped-back the mini and now we are
tending<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.820> wires<00:05:50.030> and<00:05:50.330> what<00:05:50.449> you<00:05:50.539> do<00:05:50.690> is

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
tending the wires and what you do is

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.840 
tending the wires and what you do is
basically<00:05:50.990> touch<00:05:51.560> the<00:05:51.770> solder<00:05:52.130> to<00:05:52.280> the<00:05:52.580> tip<00:05:52.759> of

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
basically touch the solder to the tip of

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.330 
basically touch the solder to the tip of
the<00:05:52.910> iron<00:05:53.060> and<00:05:53.380> touch<00:05:54.380> the<00:05:54.620> iron<00:05:54.800> to<00:05:55.009> the<00:05:55.130> wire

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
the iron and touch the iron to the wire

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.730 
the iron and touch the iron to the wire
and<00:05:55.639> it<00:05:55.820> touch<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.240> solder<00:05:56.479> to<00:05:56.780> the<00:05:56.960> wire<00:05:57.320> not

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
and it touch the solder to the wire not

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.680 
and it touch the solder to the wire not
to<00:05:58.009> the<00:05:58.190> the<00:05:58.520> iron<00:05:58.729> again<00:05:58.910> and<00:05:59.240> the<00:05:59.330> solder

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
to the the iron again and the solder

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.200 
to the the iron again and the solder
will<00:05:59.870> get<00:06:00.020> sucked<00:06:00.350> into<00:06:00.560> your<00:06:00.889> braids<00:06:01.130> so<00:06:01.400> now

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
will get sucked into your braids so now

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.640 
will get sucked into your braids so now
here<00:06:02.570> we<00:06:02.660> are<00:06:02.690> attaching<00:06:03.139> the<00:06:03.500> wire<00:06:04.900> and<00:06:05.900> it's

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
here we are attaching the wire and it's

seconds<00:06:33.370> until<00:06:34.370> it<00:06:34.970> sticks<00:06:35.780> and<00:06:37.720> there<00:06:38.720> you

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810
