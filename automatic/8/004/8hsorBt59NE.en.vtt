00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
picked up from tap plastics and we

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.560 
picked up from tap plastics and we
custom<00:00:39.160> design<00:00:39.580> and<00:00:39.880> make<00:00:40.030> each<00:00:40.239> of<00:00:40.450> these

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
robot Ruth Built but everybody wants to

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.219 
robot Ruth Built but everybody wants to
build<00:01:06.220> their<00:01:06.430> own<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.720> we've<00:01:07.960> actually

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
build their own so we've actually

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.010 
build their own so we've actually
designed<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:08.950> kit<00:01:09.220> here<00:01:09.520> at<00:01:09.640> Bob<00:01:09.850> bash<00:01:10.149> we<00:01:10.840> call

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
designed a kit here at Bob bash we call

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.320 
designed a kit here at Bob bash we call
them<00:01:11.200> battle<00:01:11.590> brickhead<00:01:12.100> that<00:01:12.820> uses<00:01:13.180> all

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
them battle brickhead that uses all

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.420 
them battle brickhead that uses all
finger<00:01:13.720> tech<00:01:13.930> robotics<00:01:14.440> components<00:01:15.130> but<00:01:15.280> then

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
finger tech robotics components but then

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.969 
finger tech robotics components but then
we<00:01:15.550> make<00:01:15.729> this<00:01:15.910> custom<00:01:16.420> frame<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:17.500> can<00:01:17.619> build

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
we make this custom frame that can build

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.480 
we make this custom frame that can build
any<00:01:18.610> robot<00:01:19.090> you<00:01:19.240> want<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.479> build<00:01:20.100> there's<00:01:21.100> five

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
any robot you want to build there's five

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.700 
any robot you want to build there's five
different<00:01:21.520> slots<00:01:22.149> for<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.479> motors<00:01:22.780> three

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
different sizes the middle rails and

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.480 
different sizes the middle rails and
anything<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:26.380> can<00:01:26.560> imagine<00:01:26.649> we<00:01:27.130> can<00:01:27.340> make

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
anything you can imagine we can make

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.899 
anything you can imagine we can make
that<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.700> 12<00:01:28.090> step<00:01:28.450> son

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
that a 12 step son

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.539

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
it's based off their own design we talk

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.349 
it's based off their own design we talk
about<00:01:37.530> physics<00:01:38.069> and<00:01:38.250> engineering<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.210> go

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359
