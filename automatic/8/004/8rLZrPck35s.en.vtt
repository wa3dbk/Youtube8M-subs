00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.870
 in medicine opened vitalist logic 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.829
 formed is a vision 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.079
 a way to make medicine 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.269
 in an excellent way 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.839
 the vision that the father had the hippocratic medicine should the 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.079
 individual as the whole 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.539
 as a military unit 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.759
 lived a habit or commune way of seeing 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.419
 the being in all its dimension 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.719
 a way to operate at the level of the mental body dimension 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.220
 vital 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.650
 building one 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.640
 my ingeniando 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.659
 for health 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.969
 such a curtain balance 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.730
 the individual 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.710
 and the social 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.430
 that that was the vision of the father medicine unfortunately 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.440
 from the physician, medicine ceased to be 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.890
 percent practice 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.540
 and we move to a system 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.830
 health percent 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.280
 already a focus 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.210
 in a way to care for the patient 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.289
 of extraction adam entre désirade focusing 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.320
 in the symptomatology or in the current picture in some way so the 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.840
 patient consumes 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.550
 somehow suppressing that symptomatology by paying that 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.060
 symptomatology 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.440
 with the illusion of what we are talking about it was true that from that way 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.880
 it's not percent 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.010
 It is not pure to the patient but we are returning imbalance 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.040
 in all those dimensions to be in health 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.240
 and we understand that the mission of the doctor the noblest mission that 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.810
 ec cure what really the patient 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.200
 li and what moves him wolf do 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.450
 suffer in some way 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.050
 we understand that what is worth curing 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.290
 is in the depths of the individual that is 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.930
 the spirit behind all that symptomatology by which the patient 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.300
 query 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.360
 some emotion with populist 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.210
 that we have to try to address 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.940
 that's also why the doctors are not ready 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.540
 incorporated a set of psychologists to address that mental part 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.159
 and that go to the hidden emotion and 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.409
 or not 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.229
 so that way 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:25.049
 the patient can 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.339
 for this one address that emotion 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:31.339
 and transferred to day we have crossed the 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.069
 who feels that emotion produces 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.629
 earl to the lactase that situation to be able 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.659
 for a hundred and nothing the cause of that disease that is always 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:52.379
 this é unha motion a living experience of certain circumstances of 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.159
 life of the individual 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.369
 and that's the way we do medicine that we have 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:59.499
 that hippocratic approach 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:02.699
 that's why it's called vitalistic biological medicine 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.729
 where we still unite 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:09.029
 what we are p energy 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:10.929
 vital 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:13.909
 and the biological of matter the body 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.849
 where everything is where it is in a set 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.699
 and we have in case that more 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.569
 hippocrates co that all diseases 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.669
 they have the common denominator of the imbalance of that vitality 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.619
 that when we recompose that vitality 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:33.609
 we are going to recompose the biological 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.950
 vidal inclán de salteras the biological is also altered 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.709
 then the logo the vital 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.659
 for there to be life there has to be that vital force that vital energy 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.549
 p the difference between the living and dead and six living rooms 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.139
 we work 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.959
 in that approach 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.959
 Hippocrates power has sold as a unit and such 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.939
 where that unit and such has 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.379
 a start and an end 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.379
 is that of the passage 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:09.419
 e for the life of each one of us 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.109
 and in that framework of the aforementioned and what shouts list that we pay different 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.539
 Services working on different body dimensions 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:19.249
 for example 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.719
 I have stopped apart 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:23.889
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.059
 physical or body 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:30.619
 and vital we have the treatment jan if for example where it is a treatment to 

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:32.529
 Dialog cactus base is 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.189
 that recomposes 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:38.749
 balance that energy of italy you want vital energy recomposes 

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:41.279
 the immune system 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:44.520
 this serving therefore for diseases 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.279
 where is always altering the vital energy 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:50.020
 and the defenses 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.190
 when defense are the most aggressors to maintain until last month 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.199
 and when they get sick they're 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.330
 like cancer the AIDS the vat
