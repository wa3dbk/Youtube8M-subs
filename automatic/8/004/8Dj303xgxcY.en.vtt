00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
would pair of the M ones

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.599 
would pair of the M ones
so<00:00:19.800> I'll<00:00:19.890> just<00:00:19.980> look<00:00:20.070> at<00:00:20.189> those<00:00:20.279> were<00:00:20.430> quick

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
and maybe look at the few differences

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.779 
and maybe look at the few differences
they<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:23.150> hers<00:00:24.150> iam<00:00:24.330> ones<00:00:25.460> no<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
they have hers iam ones no this is the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.800 
they have hers iam ones no this is the
first<00:00:27.029> year<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.330> came<00:00:27.420> out<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:27.689> their

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
first year that came out with their

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.830 
first year that came out with their
magnetic<00:00:28.310> technology<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:30.029> basically<00:00:30.390> they

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
magnetic technology so basically they

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.220 
magnetic technology so basically they
have<00:00:31.610> in<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> m16<00:00:34.070> magnets<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:36.780> hold<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.079> lens

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
have in the m16 magnets to hold the lens

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.560 
have in the m16 magnets to hold the lens
in<00:00:37.440> place<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.980> get<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> lens<00:00:38.969> out<00:00:39.120> kind<00:00:39.510> of

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
in place so get the lens out kind of

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.889 
in place so get the lens out kind of
just<00:00:39.719> twist<00:00:40.079> pops<00:00:40.800> out<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.690> kind<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.719> just

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
just twist pops out and kind of just

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.840 
just twist pops out and kind of just
peel<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.170> off<00:00:43.399> so<00:00:44.399> these<00:00:44.670> are<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.879> M<00:00:45.030> ones<00:00:45.379> the

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
peel it off so these are the M ones the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.220 
peel it off so these are the M ones the
2012/2013<00:00:47.850> models<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> first

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
2012/2013 models and this is the first

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.619 
2012/2013 models and this is the first
model<00:00:49.410> they<00:00:49.559> had<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:51.059> them<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.539> know

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
model they had and I like them you know

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.790 
model they had and I like them you know
they're<00:00:51.840> alright

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
they're alright

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.380 
they're alright
I<00:00:52.829> think<00:00:53.399> there<00:00:53.520> are<00:00:53.550> better<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:53.940> goggles<00:00:54.059> out

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
I think there are better or goggles out

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.760 
I think there are better or goggles out
there<00:00:54.539> or<00:00:54.660> tell<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> truth<00:00:55.140> better-looking

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
there or tell the truth better-looking

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.310 
there or tell the truth better-looking
goggles<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.250> well<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:57.390> at<00:00:57.539> change<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> lens

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
goggles as well be at change the lens

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.760 
goggles as well be at change the lens
it's<00:00:59.129> pretty<00:00:59.309> easy<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.289> you<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> mean<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
it's pretty easy so you I mean you

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.080 
it's pretty easy so you I mean you
wouldn't<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.070> it'd<00:01:02.219> get<00:01:02.399> much<00:01:02.609> easier<00:01:02.640> than

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
wouldn't think it'd get much easier than

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.560 
wouldn't think it'd get much easier than
that<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:04.430> yeah<00:01:05.430> we'll<00:01:05.610> check<00:01:05.640> out<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> M<00:01:06.090> -<00:01:06.299> so

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570

so there's that and then the bag and I
mean<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.320> says<00:01:31.500> I'm<00:01:31.680> too<00:01:31.860> honest<00:01:32.189> oh<00:01:33.079> and<00:01:34.079> here

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
mean it says I'm too honest oh and here

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.569 
mean it says I'm too honest oh and here
are<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.680> M<00:01:34.770> tubes<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.100> these<00:01:35.220> are<00:01:35.340> actually

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
are the M tubes and these are actually

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.230 
are the M tubes and these are actually
the<00:01:35.700> mark<00:01:36.180> Landvik<00:01:36.630> Pro<00:01:36.960> models<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:38.880> think

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the mark Landvik Pro models so I think

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.990 
the mark Landvik Pro models so I think
these<00:01:39.570> are<00:01:39.630> are<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.439> best<00:01:40.650> one<00:01:40.890> M<00:01:41.280> twos<00:01:41.729> they

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
these are are the best one M twos they

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.300 
these are are the best one M twos they
have<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.509> kind<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.590> few<00:01:43.770> differences<00:01:44.189> they

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
have and kind of a few differences they

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.520 
have and kind of a few differences they
have<00:01:44.490> our<00:01:44.840> last<00:01:45.840> year<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.140> M<00:01:46.229> ones<00:01:46.409> they

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
have our last year in the M ones they

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.990 
have our last year in the M ones they
had<00:01:46.619> six<00:01:46.920> magnets<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.520> year<00:01:47.759> they<00:01:47.880> have

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
had six magnets this year they have

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.840 
had six magnets this year they have
eight<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.560> obviously<00:01:50.009> see<00:01:50.340> these

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
eight and you can obviously see these

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.910 
eight and you can obviously see these
are<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.299> m2<00:01:51.570> s<00:01:51.630> or<00:01:51.810> more<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.110> frameless<00:01:52.649> look

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
are the m2 s or more of a frameless look

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.520 
are the m2 s or more of a frameless look
so<00:01:53.220> they<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.640> any<00:01:54.360> sort<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.750> frame<00:01:55.020> you

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
so they don't have any sort of frame you

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.050 
so they don't have any sort of frame you
know<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> outside<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.850> see<00:01:56.969> on

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
know on the outside and you can see on

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.060 
know on the outside and you can see on
the<00:01:57.180> M<00:01:57.270> ones<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.810> know<00:01:57.899> there<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> frame<00:01:58.530> so

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the M ones you know there is a frame so

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.289 
the M ones you know there is a frame so
I<00:01:59.100> definitely<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> frameless<00:02:00.090> look

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
I definitely like the frameless look

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.609 
I definitely like the frameless look
better<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.719> seems<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> lot<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.320> companies

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
better it seems like a lot of companies

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.940 
better it seems like a lot of companies
are<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:03.560> it's<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.799> said

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
are going to that and it's like I said

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.100 
are going to that and it's like I said
there's<00:02:05.130> eight<00:02:05.310> magnets<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.180> year<00:02:06.509> instead

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
there's eight magnets this year instead

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.630 
there's eight magnets this year instead
of<00:02:07.250> six<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.780> honestly<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:10.170> really<00:02:10.470> easy<00:02:11.370> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
of six and honestly it's really easy to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.900 
of six and honestly it's really easy to
change<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.000> lens<00:02:12.209> it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
change the lens it

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.440 
change the lens it
seesee<00:02:13.290> basically<00:02:14.290> just<00:02:14.500> do<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.800> so<00:02:15.450> you

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
seesee basically just do that so you

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.000 
seesee basically just do that so you
know<00:02:16.510> I'm<00:02:16.600> not<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.810> big<00:02:17.020> one<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.380> like<00:02:17.530> carry

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
know I'm not a big one to like carry

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.370 
know I'm not a big one to like carry
lenses<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.550> my<00:02:18.580> code<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.930> know<00:02:20.020> change

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
lenses in my code and you know change

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.140 
lenses in my code and you know change
them<00:02:20.590> throughout<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.010> day<00:02:21.160> like<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:21.940> I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
them throughout the day like that so I

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.890 
them throughout the day like that so I
think<00:02:22.690> like<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.050> quick<00:02:23.670> lens<00:02:24.670> change<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.540> deal

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
think like the quick lens change to deal

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.110 
think like the quick lens change to deal
a<00:02:25.930> lot<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.500> companies<00:02:26.860> are<00:02:26.950> going<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.310> maybe<00:02:28.030> a

a lot of companies are going to maybe a
little<00:02:28.150> overrated<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:29.170> know<00:02:29.230> hopefully<00:02:29.920> has

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
little overrated I know hopefully has

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.740

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
their air brakes

two point seven five pounds of pressure
for<00:02:57.880> pull<00:02:58.240> force<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.650> add<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.220> up<00:03:00.340> like<00:03:00.640> 22

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
for pull force so add it up like 22

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.120 
for pull force so add it up like 22
pounds<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.380> was<00:03:02.530> seeing<00:03:02.680> some<00:03:02.950> stuff

really big company I'm sure they have an
extensive<00:03:12.970> R&amp;D<00:03:13.630> department<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.410> I'm<00:03:14.530> sure

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
I'm not even worried about that and if

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.790 
I'm not even worried about that and if
you're<00:03:18.750> crashing<00:03:19.750> hard<00:03:19.959> enough<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.410> pop<00:03:20.590> out

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
you're crashing hard enough to pop out

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.199 
you're crashing hard enough to pop out
your<00:03:20.920> lens<00:03:21.100> you've<00:03:21.370> probably<00:03:21.700> got<00:03:21.970> bigger

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
your lens you've probably got bigger

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.690 
your lens you've probably got bigger
issues<00:03:22.390> anyways<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.740> did<00:03:24.250> notice<00:03:24.459> there's

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
issues anyways so I did notice there's

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.570 
issues anyways so I did notice there's
no<00:03:24.850> silicone<00:03:25.420> bead<00:03:25.690> around<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:27.040> inside<00:03:27.520> of

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
no silicone bead around the inside of

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.640 
no silicone bead around the inside of
the<00:03:27.820> strap<00:03:28.209> which<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.510> you<00:03:29.260> know<00:03:29.350> they<00:03:29.470> think

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
the strap which is you know they think

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.010 
the strap which is you know they think
they'd<00:03:29.770> you<00:03:30.070> know<00:03:30.760> just<00:03:31.209> do<00:03:31.360> that<00:03:31.540> real<00:03:31.750> quick

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
they'd you know just do that real quick

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.620 
they'd you know just do that real quick
and<00:03:32.250> spend<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.340> few<00:03:33.490> extra<00:03:33.550> cents<00:03:34.150> I'm<00:03:34.360> sure<00:03:34.540> it

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
and spend a few extra cents I'm sure it

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.500 
and spend a few extra cents I'm sure it
takes<00:03:34.900> just<00:03:35.709> for<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.400> no<00:03:36.520> helmet<00:03:36.880> user<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:37.450> it

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
takes just for you no helmet user so it

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.449 
takes just for you no helmet user so it
grabs<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.900> little<00:03:38.080> bit<00:03:38.170> better<00:03:38.290> but<00:03:38.620> obviously

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
grabs a little bit better but obviously
