 new level 1 tablespoon mustard that comes 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:15.230
 Here's a wonderful way to get away from the body 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.230
 do 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.450
 Now we come to our apple vinegar 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:31.260
 of apple vinegar namely a small one 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:36.120
 teaspoon teaspoon of apple cider he cares 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.380
 for a little the necessary sum 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.510
 we need it for now 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.510
 little pepper into the game so pepper 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.190
 valent I've got that on it 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:03:02.640
 easier for me a little salt like that 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:05.250
 salt and now just for the color 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.859
 a bit of paprika between 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:13.609
 color gets it all done 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.609
 then we know that 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:23.500
 and then we see that is slow 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:27.920
 but certainly also in color to the big sauce 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.300
 transforms what can see their color 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.050
 you can not smell and could 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.170
 also do not taste 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.180
 can you believe me that tastes too 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.690
