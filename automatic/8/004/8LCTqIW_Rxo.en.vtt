00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 hernals fashion Outdoors welcome to 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.690
 directory I was thinking about asking 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.469
 she determines a few people where are they 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.719
 whole battery is or where is the or 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.090
 the weapon therefore decided to 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.760
 just go through the whole web 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.350
 and to show what it's all about 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.970
 hangs and where it is mainly on the wall 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.830
 By the way , that depends on live comments because 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.880
 that's a memorial that would be hard to do otherwise 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.260
 cut that will be a few 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.820
 take minutes in demanding 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.670
 That's why I thought so 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.350
 in the live commentary sad and catching 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.760
 We'll be here right now 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.930
 here at the spot 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.550
 here is the olympia 4 500 i would 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.620
 do not recommend at all especially 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.020
 shotguns right at the beginning to buy the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.730
 is not recommended that you can 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.050
 find it mixed and have it here 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.460
 we still the 14th 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.309
 the cost of 500 I would not 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.280
 So really recommend this at first 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.420
 you do not really have to buy 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.200
 Here we come to the next one 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.850
 this is the pgw 7 future for 1000 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.020
 Points 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.530
 this is definitely more the case 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.150
 Recommend than the other two weapons 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:20.040
 has people for moni in detail 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.880
 magazine and well , relatively little moni 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.880
 total actually why too 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.240
 svs which costs 1000 is also 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.000
 by the way important for the sec so would have to 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.860
 I definitely remember the spot like that 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.860
 I should not be here 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.420
 nothing at all 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:53.799
 the next village there we have the call 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:57.640
 on 16.1 for 1200 I have never 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.930
 bought and yes I'm doing the video 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.320
 I already in a separate 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.380
 made but very bucket on the way 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.880
 lies 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.399
 I just have to go here 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.430
 think 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.760
 I think I was here to buy 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.900
 only a bit further down 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.900
 but I'm up to safety 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.450
 be placed everything must graze 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.450
 not be here 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.620
 in each case to the budget rather away so here 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.180
 are the shortened it is after the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.670
 first jump down 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.620
 there you see how here in this little 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.310
 room for 6000 in any case too 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.190
 recommend 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.730
 especially the nowak roÃŸlau wants to do 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.630
 Merkel's sinful one is a great one 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.400
 help even in very high rounds 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.250
 but also the bmf is dead and that falls 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.010
 you can still smile and see 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.380
 that's the only way to barely a bit like that 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.960
 a very good weapon in multiplayer 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.720
 both here and in zombie mode 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:19.930
 all because she has 30 shot under 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:24.260
 normal tractor altogether so again 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:28.720
 extra ammo than a total of more than 30 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.720
 so it should come here only mixed 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.630
 But how did a number tell us? 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.010
 to go and prefer everything somehow max 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.280
 small room also somewhere 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:45.110
 but is not actually hidden as 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:51.510
 next for the ak 74 udall below 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:53.390
 We go there once out there for 1200 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.670
 is actually also good weapon he 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.840
 is a bit of a stupid spot so ok 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:04.710
 I think I have had several times 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.390
 go through the remington 870 nc or 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:18.420
 visa is exactly the same whether each 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:20.870
 remington 78 mcs i almost is not quite 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.220
 so my favorite thing here in zombies 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.220
 but in any case you can find it here 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.150
 and i believe in this case while 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.580
 that would be the labyrinth here too 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.580
 have been at the bottom of weapons here 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:42.270
 go how you have a little higher there 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.280
 that it actually also a few weapons 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.620
 give 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.860
 but why did something turn and I barely buy 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.430
 except for the mp five and at most the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.300
 npd that is what you can do here once everywhere 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:00.569
 the ak bahn to bbi always annoys here 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.009
 is still around and even in the current space 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:07.110
 nothing will happen then let's go 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:13.590
 few floors higher and exactly to his 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:19.340
 new piece or first floor 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.340
 deeper yes why not no problem anymore 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.690
 so is still a ruin set right 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:46.150
 just what happens there you get it 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:48.710
 content of the elevator is up here 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.390
 are up here several parts here 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.990
 For example, the claims are 4000 and 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:06:01.010
 I have my own line buying so far 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:04.460
 enjoy a few victorious driving situations 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:07.220
 so that's it help so by the way that 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.440
 bmf costs as always 3000 namely 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:17.120
 very helpful against these nowak rollers 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:18.800
 and then meant down here is 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.150
 already relatively good to recommend 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.900
 actually always my first was for 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.570
 to take you 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.360
 I'm going to drive fast today 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.120
 fast high medium lift and hope 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.310
 that a sofa to get away and then he can 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.120
 I can only get from the field 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:38.770
 recommend down here should be mine 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.770
 no more opinion, 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:45.640
 there 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:50.710
 then it'll actions can semtex 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:53.650
 These are a bit dome decorated 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:56.080
 I have 250 I do not know ten 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.690
 It's not worth the tracks of 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.020
 really always to buy so that's me 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.020
 really do not care 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.820
 so they do not decide so bad 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:09.490
 But they are not so, above all else 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.700
 leave you and a weapon you 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:17.980
 probably can miss is the b 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:21.100
 31 22 r4 1000 here on the wall at the 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:26.430
 table where to steam on the jam or 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:28.150
 the tram can post whatever builds and 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:32.350
 I will not be now 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:34.500
 was that all about wall weapons in drais 

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.500
 and 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:40.610
 more time is also correctly located that is 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:45.390
 about 78 minutes will stay 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:46.580
 and brainstorm again where it is 

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.660
 maybe forgot 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.540
 but actually I am already here 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.790
 up if what we are doing now 

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:56.070
 I'm sorry but I guess over it 

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.840
 see and I hope it back to you 

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.050
 and then see you in the 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.050
 next
