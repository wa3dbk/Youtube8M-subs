variant of flood whereby the zombies are

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.570 
variant of flood whereby the zombies are
quicker<00:00:24.779> than<00:00:24.990> normal<00:00:25.070> however<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.369> is

quicker than normal however that is
countered<00:00:27.119> by<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.330> fact<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.720> they<00:00:27.900> have

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670

slightly the dye easier sorry and they

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.889 
slightly the dye easier sorry and they
do<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.730> slight<00:00:32.850> camo<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.450> them<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.719> if<00:00:33.809> they

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
do have a slight camo to them so if they

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.270

on<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> map<00:01:27.479> however<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.350> being<00:01:28.500> said<00:01:28.979> um<00:01:29.250> at

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
on the map however that being said um at

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.030 
on the map however that being said um at
first<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:30.659> was<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> little<00:01:31.409> bit<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.590> cycling

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
first there was a little bit of cycling

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.700 
first there was a little bit of cycling
but<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.299> time<00:01:33.689> went<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.229> started<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
but with as time went on we started to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.649 
but with as time went on we started to
bunker<00:01:35.100> down<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.460> specific<00:01:35.970> spots<00:01:36.240> which<00:01:36.509> I

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
bunker down in specific spots which I

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.450 
bunker down in specific spots which I
figured<00:01:37.110> he<00:01:37.320> might<00:01:37.500> want<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.799> kind<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.280> define

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
figured he might want to kind of define

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.550 
figured he might want to kind of define
a<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:39.090> bit<00:01:39.210> more<00:01:39.390> I'm<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:40.140> instance<00:01:40.439> he's

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
a little bit more I'm for instance he's

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.230 
a little bit more I'm for instance he's
got<00:01:40.740> these<00:01:40.860> different<00:01:41.189> ships<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.909> boats<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
got these different ships and boats that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.330 
got these different ships and boats that
are<00:01:42.329> docked<00:01:42.600> here<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.079> place<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:44.159> feel

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
are docked here at this place and I feel

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.920 
are docked here at this place and I feel
like<00:01:44.369> some<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.880> them<00:01:44.970> are<00:01:45.060> very<00:01:45.360> good<00:01:45.600> hold<00:01:45.810> up

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
like some of them are very good hold up

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.389 
like some of them are very good hold up
positions<00:01:46.350> however<00:01:46.740> he<00:01:46.950> doesn't<00:01:47.189> really

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
positions however he doesn't really

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.249 
positions however he doesn't really
defined<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.090> location<00:01:48.689> yet<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:48.960> people

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
defined that location yet so people

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.210 
defined that location yet so people
don't<00:01:49.380> really<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.740> where<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.920> go<00:01:50.070> they

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
don't really know where to go they

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.649 
don't really know where to go they
subconsciously<00:01:50.640> Walker<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.390> map<00:01:51.540> and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
subconsciously Walker on the map and

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.300 
subconsciously Walker on the map and
look<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:51.990> somewhere<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> hide<00:01:52.380> out<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.770> posted

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
look for somewhere to hide out I posted

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.490 
look for somewhere to hide out I posted
a<00:01:53.399> video<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.180> exact<00:01:54.630> thing<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:55.200> couple

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
a video on this exact thing a couple

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.490 
a video on this exact thing a couple
weeks<00:01:55.799> ago<00:01:55.969> and<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.329> feel<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.780> map<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.020> I

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
weeks ago and I feel like this map is I

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.999 
weeks ago and I feel like this map is I
don't<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.640> can<00:02:00.360> use<00:02:00.630> some<00:02:01.020> work<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.469> stuff

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
don't know it can use some work on stuff

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.590 
don't know it can use some work on stuff
like<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.549> defining<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.240> hold<00:02:03.450> out

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
like that like just defining as hold out

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.749 
like that like just defining as hold out
areas<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.860> being<00:02:04.890> said<00:02:05.130> they<00:02:05.579> are

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
areas but that being said they are

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.359 
areas but that being said they are
people<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.719> still<00:02:07.110> gravitate<00:02:07.619> toward<00:02:08.099> them<00:02:08.220> so

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
people do still gravitate toward them so

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.249 
people do still gravitate toward them so
it<00:02:08.489> kind<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.729> works<00:02:08.910> out

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
it kind of works out

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.679 
it kind of works out
I<00:02:09.319> don't<00:02:09.920> know<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.489> did<00:02:11.180> like<00:02:11.299> the<00:02:11.420> fact<00:02:11.569> that

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:11.689 
I don't know so I did like the fact that

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:13.059 
I don't know so I did like the fact that
this<00:02:11.870> Matt<00:02:12.049> did<00:02:12.260> play<00:02:12.439> really<00:02:12.620> well<00:02:12.830> even

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
this Matt did play really well even

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.920 
this Matt did play really well even
though<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.760> didn't<00:02:14.000> really<00:02:14.120> define<00:02:14.540> its<00:02:14.750> hold

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
though it didn't really define its hold

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.390 
though it didn't really define its hold
outside<00:02:15.230> well<00:02:15.409> because<00:02:15.650> we<00:02:15.769> did<00:02:15.920> kind<00:02:16.069> of<00:02:16.159> find

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
outside well because we did kind of find

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.380 
outside well because we did kind of find
where<00:02:16.549> they<00:02:16.670> were<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.939> can<00:02:17.060> see<00:02:17.180> here<00:02:17.360> that

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
where they were you can see here that

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.149 
where they were you can see here that
more<00:02:17.840> people<00:02:17.989> are<00:02:18.260> coming<00:02:18.409> to<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.650> ship<00:02:18.950> um

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
more people are coming to the ship um

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.069 
more people are coming to the ship um
this<00:02:19.610> was<00:02:19.819> also<00:02:20.000> our<00:02:20.209> third<00:02:20.390> round<00:02:20.629> so<00:02:20.840> we<00:02:20.959> had

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
this was also our third round so we had

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.479 
this was also our third round so we had
kind<00:02:21.379> of<00:02:21.500> worked<00:02:21.680> with<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.950> map<00:02:22.069> a<00:02:22.099> little<00:02:22.370> bit

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
kind of worked with the map a little bit

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.190 
kind of worked with the map a little bit
found<00:02:22.670> out<00:02:22.790> what<00:02:22.879> worked<00:02:23.090> what<00:02:23.269> didn't<00:02:23.569> I'm<00:02:23.750> so

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
found out what worked what didn't I'm so

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.479 
found out what worked what didn't I'm so
I<00:02:24.260> feel<00:02:24.439> that<00:02:24.590> he<00:02:24.709> could<00:02:24.860> like<00:02:24.980> kind<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.280> take

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
I feel that he could like kind of take

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.979 
I feel that he could like kind of take
this<00:02:25.640> position<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.239> make<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.720> clear<00:02:26.959> that

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
this position and make it clear that

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.449 
this position and make it clear that
it's<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.379> good<00:02:27.500> place<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.829> hide<00:02:27.950> out<00:02:27.980> on<00:02:28.280> maybe

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
it's a good place to hide out on maybe

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.559 
it's a good place to hide out on maybe
put<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.670> turret<00:02:29.000> somewhere<00:02:29.269> near<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.510> or

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
put a turret somewhere near it or

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.660 
put a turret somewhere near it or
something<00:02:29.840> like<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.220> but<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.400> also

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
something like that but that also

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.160 
something like that but that also
another<00:02:31.970> little<00:02:32.269> complaint<00:02:32.659> i<00:02:32.780> had<00:02:32.930> about<00:02:33.019> the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
another little complaint i had about the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.690 
another little complaint i had about the
map<00:02:33.290> was<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.530> fact<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.829> there<00:02:34.010> are<00:02:34.040> areas<00:02:34.459> of

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
map was the fact that there are areas of

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.460 
map was the fact that there are areas of
the<00:02:34.790> map<00:02:34.879> that<00:02:35.060> are<00:02:35.209> in<00:02:35.450> water<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.319> can

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
the map that are in water that you can

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.410 
the map that are in water that you can
actually<00:02:36.620> go<00:02:36.859> in<00:02:37.010> however<00:02:37.760> there<00:02:38.060> are<00:02:38.180> areas

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
actually go in however there are areas

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.599 
actually go in however there are areas
on<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.810> map<00:02:38.840> in<00:02:39.200> water<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.829> you<00:02:39.950> can't<00:02:39.980> go<00:02:40.430> in

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
on the map in water that you can't go in

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.069 
on the map in water that you can't go in
and<00:02:40.819> so<00:02:41.090> it's<00:02:41.209> kind<00:02:41.359> of<00:02:41.390> hard<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.629> different

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
and so it's kind of hard to different

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.319 
and so it's kind of hard to different
differentiate<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.609> difference<00:02:43.940> between<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
differentiate the difference between the

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.849 
differentiate the difference between the
areas<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.930> can<00:02:45.079> go<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.379> you<00:02:45.409> can<00:02:45.470> go<00:02:45.739> and

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
areas that you can go and you can go and

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.140 
areas that you can go and you can go and
I<00:02:45.920> know<00:02:45.980> he<00:02:46.220> set<00:02:46.370> up<00:02:46.459> ladders<00:02:46.849> and<00:02:46.970> little

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
I know he set up ladders and little

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.119 
I know he set up ladders and little
ramps<00:02:47.420> into<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.810> water<00:02:48.019> that<00:02:48.739> being<00:02:48.980> said

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
ramps into the water that being said

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.740 
ramps into the water that being said
those<00:02:49.310> are<00:02:49.459> kind<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:49.760> not<00:02:50.150> hidden<00:02:50.420> but<00:02:50.690> you

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
those are kind of not hidden but you

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.140 
those are kind of not hidden but you
don't<00:02:50.900> really<00:02:50.989> notice<00:02:51.230> them<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.459> I<00:02:52.849> know

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
don't really notice them so you I know

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.759 
don't really notice them so you I know
at<00:02:53.450> least<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.810> few<00:02:53.959> people<00:02:54.260> actually<00:02:54.379> ended<00:02:54.709> up

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
at least a few people actually ended up

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.440 
at least a few people actually ended up
walking<00:02:54.980> into<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.489> water<00:02:55.700> which<00:02:55.940> kind<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.329> was

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
walking into the water which kind of was

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.670 
walking into the water which kind of was
a<00:02:56.690> little<00:02:56.989> bit<00:02:57.079> poopy<00:02:58.720> but<00:02:59.720> I<00:02:59.840> think<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.409> he

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
a little bit poopy but I think that he

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.660 
a little bit poopy but I think that he
could<00:03:00.829> have<00:03:00.980> made<00:03:01.099> it<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> little<00:03:01.370> bit<00:03:01.549> more

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
could have made it a little bit more

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.800 
could have made it a little bit more
clear<00:03:01.940> where<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.239> can<00:03:02.420> go<00:03:02.569> in<00:03:02.629> the<00:03:02.690> water

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
clear where you can go in the water

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.180 
clear where you can go in the water
where<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.079> can't<00:03:03.290> like<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.590> personally<00:03:04.069> know

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
where you can't like I personally know

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.500 
where you can't like I personally know
where<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.430> could<00:03:04.579> but<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.389> average

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
where you could but to the average

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.729 
where you could but to the average
