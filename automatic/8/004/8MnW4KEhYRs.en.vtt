00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.230
 You're slow 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:10.040
 Everyone after a long time I pure 3 this slowly Reimu 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.280
 The hard-earned person being thrown around by a self-proclaimed pure maiden slowly Marisa 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:18.080
 I think that I love the most act in the world is Sanae slowly 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.890
 By the way, this time we will do team death match, this time assault soldiers and the main in ae form 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.890
 Ikunda 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.369
 I have not used aek at all because there is no site attached 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.900
 In fact, this is the guy I recorded a long time ago 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:35.430
 The battlefield 4 was released and it was a guy I shot about a week later 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.570
 Why does the previous one so much live now ? It happened to fit the mouth of the folder 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.059
 Because I found 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.910
 I'm shooting around while the rule rate goes around 30, so I'm a little ticketer 4 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.110
 Still more than 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:52.600
 It's supposed to be a good thing because you're on a stable frame rate language decision 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:57.730
 Well, I do not 's another Capture introduction likely it aside I return to the play-by-play 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.780
 By the way, as I mentioned earlier, this is the age of a full-fledged recruit, so it's a shameful turnaround and aim 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.620
 It stands out 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.900
 Certainly it seems that it might have been a time when the rank 25 was not constant either 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.470
 Okay 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:12.110
 I was pretty bad fighting I had seen before, et al editing 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.800
 Now and have seen the game contents of the recruits era little was I I Act II can feel and become better 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.050
 It can not be said 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.150
 Is it a touch lever 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:24.160
 You are tempted to say whether there is really a rank 119, either, but what 's the bad soldier of the level ? 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:27.160
 Well guess fact Well not Ikaese anything because it is actually against the not well fact Well 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.220
 Proceed with the remains crispy and the game is called 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:34.040
 What do you say when there is no ability to finish quickly 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:39.710
 marika-san , I want to show you a little good feeling of playing 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:44.070
 Around a do you'll Oh comes to puberty and junior high school students I guy of feeling that made want to say I I Tsue 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:50.250
 And the first half of elaborate because there is no interest for 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:55.080
 So why so good job I'm fine I've put in while injecting Reimu 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.979
 It is the kindness of our casualness We can only look at the kindness of the heart as opposed to casually gougish 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.340
 There was no 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:04.090
 By the way, there is no big show in the second half, but let's do it 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.210
 s I'm going to put an unlocked cobra site along the way of the festival scene. 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.640
 It is the best favorite among close-up students 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:17.470
 Runner Reimu basically uses this site I personally sleep very easy to see site 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:22.390
 It should be great to be able to rock large response rock This site is a battle pack 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.080
 There are a lot of patterns that do not come out, so it's probably because of cheap and popular . 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.790
 Also really in it 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.730
 Turn around the cover and a building If it is rather strong from nowadays it's a tree 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.470
 I'm sorry I don't like eel games 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.310
 Hey Sanae it's not Do soldiers fraud but Tara strong since I was a Yatteku good does that mean 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.019
 Or 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.650
 Because There 's no aperture such de n me useless Once or dominating wear a lot to unwillingly 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:49.940
 Hey such a de m I was not tied up I was not 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.720
 Seriously return 4 episodes or is it all right 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.310
 Oh, the post office 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.960
 It is now live on 3rd in this way, but maybe it will be live on 4th presse 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.450
 The possibility came out 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:09.030
 No , I would like to ask if I still have the 3rd edition of Presse, but the environment is ready. 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:11.710
 It's because I don't have it, so it's good too. 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.810
 Taken with the features of Presse 4 at the next Presse 4 Apde 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:21.400
 it if the equipment in the translation was a only seems to be able to be transferred to usd 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.980
 I don't know what it would be like to be able to do something without it 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.130
 I told you that there is only possibility 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.730
 Is there anything like a chance of being a dog ? 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:36.860
 Well that's right, so it won't be 60 fps if you can 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:42.170
 It Is not gotta do not fall outside of Mr. Reimu Polo ze'm here 2 weeks 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:45.409
 Oh, it was right I forgot a little The same slow live broadcaster and villager 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.080
 I did my pre-war in the video 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:53.870
 I prewar Mr. Teku a good video, even if like us 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.680
 'Cause Thank you very much yet and who have also propaganda of the invitation that we run 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.510
 Thank you very much 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.310
 You can jump from the video description column to the village 's video where you can see interesting talks of speed 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.519
 I'll do it, so let's see it 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.510
 You can see a talk that is 100 times more interesting than us 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:13.799
 Meet from around, we don't have any interesting exchanges 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.939
 A corner of thank you for advertising more than I think I feel so stiff 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.670
 It was 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.750
 That 5 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:23.350
 Sometimes I was in this corner or just came up with it 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.000
 That's right the idea came in my ranking 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.600
 What an egg key group is junking 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.550
 Severely me specter tag up of Ya why .... Just I was told 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.770
 I can not understand what is in it from now on but it is not good until today 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.780
 It is said that we will see insistence and insistence and insistence 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:50.590
 It is a bit hard to see here, but it has achieved the knife kill domestic ranking in Preste 4 format 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:50.780
 I'm up to 26 at the editing stage , but I'm sure it's great but Reimu 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.680
 I will 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:58.160
 But it's likely this extra Kano tab and keep specter tag becomes healthy 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.060
 Do not you already have a monster tag keiko or Encyclopedia Doh ? 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.060
 What Deya 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.080
 I will do it 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:28.090
 It was over without touching high tide 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.810
 There was content that does not touch until there is time to No I still game had won the NomaNika game 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:34.480
 Why 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:36.070
 8 I do not even know whether I played an active part Complete the contents of the game from the middle 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.800
 Because it was a shame 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:44.690
 Nehonto of cormorants was the game when still 20 rank is also not entered 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.470
 It was an era of new soldiers, and you can often get up to 119 ranks if you look at this 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.900
 It was 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:53.960
 It's about 120 when I see Kanst's first but I 'm a little impressed at the beginning of a long road 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.409
 The rank increase from over 110 is a real hell 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.790
 Well then, I guess it 's up to here this time 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:05.030
 Oh , I scored 1st on the machine 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.030
 I will finish my leisure so thank you for watching
