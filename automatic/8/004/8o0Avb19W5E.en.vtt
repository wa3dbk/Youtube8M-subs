00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
get a draw in an away game like this and

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.060 
get a draw in an away game like this and
you<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.020> get<00:01:46.260> my<00:01:46.410> laid-back<00:01:46.680> well<00:01:46.920> they'll

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
you can get my laid-back well they'll

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.380 
you can get my laid-back well they'll

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
consider that it's going to be out of

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.420 
consider that it's going to be out of
them<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.690> Marseille<00:01:49.080> who<00:01:49.260> finishes<00:01:49.590> 2nd<00:01:50.070> so

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
them and Marseille who finishes 2nd so

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.980 
them and Marseille who finishes 2nd so
certainly<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.360> mrs.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
certainly this is not mrs.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.390 
certainly this is not mrs.
psychologically<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:53.040> going<00:01:53.310> that

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
psychologically this is not going that

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.810 
psychologically this is not going that
they<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.640> afford<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.970> lose<00:01:54.860> as<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.159> say<00:01:56.340> that

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
they can afford to lose as you say that

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.000 
they can afford to lose as you say that

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
France unless it's that's a well-known

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.160 
France unless it's that's a well-known
fact<00:02:01.980> and<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:03.030> will<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.330> a<00:02:03.360> tough<00:02:03.600> game<00:02:03.780> okay

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
fact and this will be a tough game okay

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.440 
fact and this will be a tough game okay
I<00:02:04.200> see<00:02:04.470> when<00:02:04.590> an<00:02:04.710> if<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:05.760> get<00:02:05.940> something<00:02:06.150> here

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
I see when an if then get something here

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.240 
I see when an if then get something here
will<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.780> more<00:02:07.020> than<00:02:07.050> that<00:02:07.500> moment<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:08.009> think

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
will be more than that moment I think

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.410 
will be more than that moment I think
that<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:08.459> relieved<00:02:08.729> if<00:02:08.879> they<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.239> get<00:02:09.330> out

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that we relieved if they can get out

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.820 
that we relieved if they can get out
with<00:02:09.599> appointment<00:02:10.080> I'm<00:02:10.140> sure<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.470> quality<00:02:10.619> of

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
with appointment I'm sure the quality of

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.440 
with appointment I'm sure the quality of
Marseille<00:02:11.220> having<00:02:11.580> said<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.819> well<00:02:12.239> they

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
Marseille having said that well they

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.640 
Marseille having said that well they
spend<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.780> lot<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.930> money<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.379> summer<00:02:13.590> of

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
spend a lot of money in the summer of

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.440 
spend a lot of money in the summer of
Marseille<00:02:14.190> they<00:02:14.400> finished<00:02:14.819> second<00:02:15.360> and

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
Marseille they finished second and

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.729 
Marseille they finished second and
eventually<00:02:15.840> glass<00:02:16.019> here<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.379> saw<00:02:16.530> them<00:02:16.680> in

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
eventually glass here but we saw them in

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.619 
eventually glass here but we saw them in
Europe<00:02:16.769> last<00:02:17.099> year<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.519> in<00:02:17.879> Liverpool's<00:02:18.390> group

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
Europe last year in in Liverpool's group

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.789 
Europe last year in in Liverpool's group
and<00:02:18.810> they<00:02:18.870> finished<00:02:19.170> third<00:02:19.409> in<00:02:19.590> their<00:02:19.739> group

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
and they finished third in their group

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.620 
and they finished third in their group
so<00:02:20.489> they<00:02:21.079> need<00:02:22.079> to<00:02:22.200> come<00:02:22.349> on

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
so they need to come on

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.960 
so they need to come on
leaps<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.200> bounds<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:24.400> there<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.670> get<00:02:24.790> through

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
leaps and bounds is there to get through

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.040 
leaps and bounds is there to get through
although<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.420> fat<00:02:25.570> man<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.870> week

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
although the fat man and a week

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.530 
although the fat man and a week
certainly<00:02:26.860> gives<00:02:27.520> them<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.670> chance<00:02:27.700> well<00:02:28.450> we

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
certainly gives them a chance well we

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.970 
certainly gives them a chance well we
think<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.780> drawer<00:02:28.990> might<00:02:29.170> be<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.380> best<00:02:29.590> bet

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
think the drawer might be the best bet

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.680 
think the drawer might be the best bet
on<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.370> game<00:02:30.430> not<00:02:30.970> convinced<00:02:31.360> about<00:02:31.390> either

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
on this game not convinced about either

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.390 
on this game not convinced about either
team's<00:02:32.020> ability<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.530> win<00:02:32.710> it<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.160> drawers

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
team's ability to win it the drawers

team's ability to win it the drawers
available<00:02:33.910> at<00:02:34.060> nine<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.540> four<00:02:35.160> but<00:02:36.160> if<00:02:36.220> you

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
available at nine to four but if you

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.530 
available at nine to four but if you
want<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.430> different<00:02:36.550> way<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.850> play<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.150> we're
