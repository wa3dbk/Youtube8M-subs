00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
this stuff works because I've tried the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.310 
this stuff works because I've tried the
screen<00:00:44.460> protectors<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.059> past<00:00:45.329> there<00:00:46.110> is

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
screen protectors in the past there is

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.920 
screen protectors in the past there is
without<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.670> clean<00:00:48.030> room<00:00:48.300> there<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.899> no

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
without like a clean room there is no

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.020 
without like a clean room there is no
way<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.860> perfectly<00:00:50.280> apply<00:00:50.610> them<00:00:50.820> without

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
way to perfectly apply them without

caught<00:00:53.190> under<00:00:53.489> them<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.899> there's<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
caught under them so so there's that

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.840 
caught under them so so there's that
they're<00:00:55.770> very<00:00:56.010> difficult<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> get<00:00:56.730> on

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
they're very difficult to get on

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.610 
they're very difficult to get on

scratching<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.780> cracking<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.500> that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
scratching and cracking and all that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.560 
scratching and cracking and all that
kind<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.920> good<00:01:10.979> stuff<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.640> doesn't<00:01:12.210> claim

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
kind of good stuff so this doesn't claim

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.570 
kind of good stuff so this doesn't claim
to<00:01:12.720> provide<00:01:12.869> any<00:01:13.200> kind<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.619> crack<00:01:13.979> resistance

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
to provide any kind of crack resistance

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.429 
to provide any kind of crack resistance
but<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:14.970> does<00:01:15.390> claim<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.869> provide<00:01:16.020> screen

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
but it does claim to provide screen

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.910 
but it does claim to provide screen
resistance<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.549> all<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.420> is

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
resistance so all you have to do is

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.850 
resistance so all you have to do is
spray<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.049> do<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.229> you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
spray it on and then what you do is you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.460 
spray it on and then what you do is you
you<00:01:23.549> wipe<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.970> off<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.360> leave<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.080> 10

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470

mean<00:01:46.049> these<00:01:46.229> are<00:01:46.680> some<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.759> things<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
mean these are some of the things that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.649 
mean these are some of the things that
okay<00:01:49.140> could<00:01:49.439> be<00:01:49.619> pretty<00:01:50.100> beneficial<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:51.360> let's

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
okay could be pretty beneficial so let's

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.660 
okay could be pretty beneficial so let's
see<00:01:51.810> what's<00:01:52.020> inside<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.500> box<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.369> the

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.979 
after use okay now the tech film will
continue<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.640> harden<00:03:30.970> over<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.180> 24<00:03:31.750> hour<00:03:31.780> period

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
continue to harden over a 24 hour period

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.660 
continue to harden over a 24 hour period
so<00:03:32.470> that's<00:03:32.620> how<00:03:32.739> long<00:03:32.799> it<00:03:33.010> takes<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.370> cure<00:03:35.670> and

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
should show the other kit too so this

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.229 
should show the other kit too so this
one<00:04:11.890> is<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.070> convenience<00:04:12.579> kit<00:04:12.820> which<00:04:13.000> just

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
one is a convenience kit which just

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.229 
one is a convenience kit which just
includes<00:04:13.570> four<00:04:14.190> pre-moistened<00:04:15.239> microfiber

includes four pre-moistened microfiber
polishing<00:04:16.840> cloths<00:04:17.109> so<00:04:17.500> this<00:04:18.250> is<00:04:18.489> just<00:04:19.330> without

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
polishing cloths so this is just without

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.300 
polishing cloths so this is just without
the<00:04:19.720> spray<00:04:20.169> this<00:04:20.560> one's<00:04:20.769> probably<00:04:20.919> a<00:04:21.130> better

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
the spray this one's probably a better

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.110 
the spray this one's probably a better
value<00:04:21.519> because<00:04:21.849> it

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
value because it

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.939 
value because it
with<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.330> cloths<00:04:22.540> and<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.110> and<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.710> spray-on

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
stuff but this I guess is well

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.469
