first<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:40.530> mark<00:00:40.860> everybody<00:00:41.370> shares<00:00:41.820> gotta

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
first of all mark everybody shares gotta

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:42.979 
first of all mark everybody shares gotta
be<00:00:42.180> marked<00:00:42.480> because<00:00:42.600> they<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.899> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
be marked because they have to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.630 
be marked because they have to
understand<00:00:43.350> 16<00:00:43.920> inches<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.489> 22<00:00:44.760> inches<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
understand 16 inches and 22 inches and

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.459 
understand 16 inches and 22 inches and
usually<00:00:47.640> most<00:00:47.789> fruit<00:00:48.120> would<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.480> go<00:00:48.600> 16<00:00:49.140> inches

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
usually most fruit would we go 16 inches

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.950 
usually most fruit would we go 16 inches
or<00:00:49.620> less<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:50.940> real<00:00:51.090> low<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.480> these<00:00:51.690> I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
or less if it's real low like these I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.630 
or less if it's real low like these I
don't<00:00:52.289> care<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:52.620> want<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> bring<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.219> you

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
don't care if they want to bring it you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:21.050 
don't care if they want to bring it you
throw<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.030> up<00:00:54.210> there<00:01:09.950> because<00:01:20.060> anything

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
throw that up there because anything

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.450 
throw that up there because anything
might<00:01:21.840> throw<00:01:22.020> my<00:01:22.140> shoes<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.650> there<00:01:22.830> they<00:01:23.280> got

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
might throw my shoes up there they got

might throw my shoes up there they got
him<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:23.780> thirty<00:01:24.780> inches<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.290> way<00:01:25.470> too

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
him up here thirty inches is way too

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.999 
him up here thirty inches is way too
long<00:01:25.890> these<00:01:26.610> whips<00:01:26.909> gotta<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.450> between<00:01:27.869> 20<00:01:28.439> 16

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
inches and 22 inches Chris has said that

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.679 
inches and 22 inches Chris has said that
he<00:01:31.799> wants<00:01:32.220> 22<00:01:32.909> inches<00:01:33.650> from<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.689> origination

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
he wants 22 inches from the origination

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.880 
he wants 22 inches from the origination
of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.229> secondary<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.970> tip<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.890> the

tertiary Bob Peterson one of the
godfathers<00:01:44.880> at<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> pistachio<00:01:46.380> industry<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
godfathers at the pistachio industry to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.069 
godfathers at the pistachio industry to
develop<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.909> system<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.570> what<00:01:48.720> he<00:01:48.840> called

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
develop this system of what he called

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.160 
develop this system of what he called
ratio<00:01:49.590> pruning<00:01:50.100> which<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.299> two

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
ratio pruning which is to have two

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.910 
ratio pruning which is to have two
branches<00:01:52.820> arising<00:01:53.820> from<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:55.200> previous

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
branches arising from the previous

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.249 
branches arising from the previous
structural<00:01:56.640> branch<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.630> you're<00:01:57.810> building<00:01:58.170> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
structural branch so you're building a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.499 
structural branch so you're building a
house<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.860> his<00:01:59.009> feeling<00:01:59.490> very<00:01:59.790> strongly<00:02:00.119> was

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
house and his feeling very strongly was

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.950 
house and his feeling very strongly was
that<00:02:01.200> by<00:02:01.409> if<00:02:02.070> he<00:02:02.189> had<00:02:02.340> one<00:02:02.610> primary<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.840> you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
that by if he had one primary then you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.959 
that by if he had one primary then you
would<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.500> secondaries<00:02:05.219> arising<00:02:05.820> from

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
would have to secondaries arising from

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.410 
would have to secondaries arising from
that<00:02:06.060> primary<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.049> if<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.770> had<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:08.700> you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that primary and if you had then you

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.839 
that primary and if you had then you
have<00:02:09.599> off<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:10.050> each<00:02:10.289> secondaries<00:02:11.160> then<00:02:11.700> you

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
have off of each secondaries then you

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.010 
have off of each secondaries then you
would<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.150> to

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
would have to

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.320 
would have to
tertiary<00:02:13.590> branches<00:02:14.430> arising<00:02:15.030> off<00:02:15.180> the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
tertiary branches arising off the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.640 
tertiary branches arising off the
secondary<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.290> an<00:02:16.380> accurate

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
secondary is that an accurate

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.740 
secondary is that an accurate
description<00:02:16.770> test<00:02:17.460> okay<00:02:18.330> that's<00:02:18.570> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
description test okay that's the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.130 
description test okay that's the
principle<00:02:19.290> behind<00:02:20.210> racial<00:02:21.210> pruning<00:02:21.630> but<00:02:21.900> we

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
principle behind racial pruning but we

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.690 
principle behind racial pruning but we
want<00:02:22.380> if<00:02:22.590> we<00:02:22.620> want<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.010> build<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.430> framework

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
want if we want to build this framework

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.120 
want if we want to build this framework
is<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.300> about<00:02:24.420> six<00:02:24.780> years<00:02:25.050> maybe<00:02:25.770> seven

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
is you have about six years maybe seven

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.790 
is you have about six years maybe seven
years<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:27.330> get<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.750> structure<00:02:28.080> get<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
years to get the structure get the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.370 
years to get the structure get the
canopy<00:02:29.100> then<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.610> fruit<00:02:29.820> cup<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.810> once<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
canopy then the fruit cup and once the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.080 
canopy then the fruit cup and once the
fruit<00:02:31.620> comes<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.160> bob<00:02:32.310> could<00:02:32.520> relate<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.940> this

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
fruit comes and bob could relate to this

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.750 
fruit comes and bob could relate to this
the<00:02:33.870> growth<00:02:34.110> slows<00:02:34.440> down<00:02:34.710> so<00:02:35.430> if<00:02:35.490> you<00:02:35.580> don't

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
the growth slows down so if you don't

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.540 
the growth slows down so if you don't
build<00:02:35.970> your<00:02:36.180> tree<00:02:36.450> by<00:02:37.260> at<00:02:37.680> least<00:02:37.830> year<00:02:38.160> seven

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
build your tree by at least year seven
