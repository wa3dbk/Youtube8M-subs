 bike battery and to break a branch 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.950
 when you travel you will take 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.220
 your smartphone and this is on-site 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.320
 You need to make a load 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.350
 charge the cell phone as fast as possible 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.820
 or even play that of a movie during 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.010
 a trip 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.140

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:55.750
 motorola and first open it né 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.620
 to be able to send the wires 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.040
 correctly 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:07.810
 I picked up from there the red thread one 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:13.630
 black wire and even the same connectors on the 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:17.380
 Car Charger which has the ball 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.020

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:25.630
 and it is where the philosopher finds himself in the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.380
 my case where you find that the arts 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.470
 metallic 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.980

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:07.690
