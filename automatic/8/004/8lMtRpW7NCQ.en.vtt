these<00:02:35.010> shoes<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.640> feet<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.520> can<00:02:38.670> see<00:02:38.730> I

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
these shoes on feet so as you can see I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.890 
these shoes on feet so as you can see I
have<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.570> Air<00:02:39.840> Jordan<00:02:40.100> 17<00:02:41.100> loads<00:02:41.460> on<00:02:41.880> feet<00:02:42.630> I

have the Air Jordan 17 loads on feet I

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.320 
have the Air Jordan 17 loads on feet I
guess<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.530> all<00:02:43.710> can<00:02:43.980> call<00:02:44.280> these<00:02:44.580> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
guess you all can call these the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.690 
guess you all can call these the
lightning<00:02:46.110> come<00:02:46.410> away<00:02:46.650> yellow<00:02:47.340> black

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
lightning come away yellow black

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.110 
lightning come away yellow black
majority<00:02:48.540> white<00:02:49.320> but<00:02:50.160> anyways<00:02:50.490> I<00:02:50.790> thought

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
majority white but anyways I thought

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.570 
majority white but anyways I thought
they<00:02:51.300> came<00:02:51.540> out<00:02:51.570> pretty<00:02:51.780> good<00:02:52.260> after<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:53.070> little

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
they came out pretty good after a little

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.470 
they came out pretty good after a little
bit<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:54.030> cleaning<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.530> some<00:02:55.770> elbow<00:02:56.220> grease

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
bit of cleaning and some elbow grease

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.900 
bit of cleaning and some elbow grease
but<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.660> major<00:02:57.960> flaw<00:02:58.440> on<00:02:58.680> these<00:02:58.980> shoes<00:02:59.280> has<00:02:59.640> to

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
but the major flaw on these shoes has to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.740 
but the major flaw on these shoes has to
be<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.690> toe<00:03:00.960> box<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.710> do<00:03:02.250> believe<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.210> the

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
be the toe box I do believe that the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.990 
be the toe box I do believe that the
person<00:03:03.990> who<00:03:04.710> had<00:03:04.920> these<00:03:05.160> shoes<00:03:05.220> played

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
person who had these shoes played

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.480 
person who had these shoes played
basketball<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.110> toes<00:03:07.380> because<00:03:08.310> they're

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
basketball and the toes because they're

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.860 
basketball and the toes because they're
actually<00:03:08.970> pretty<00:03:09.300> worn<00:03:09.950> on<00:03:10.950> both<00:03:11.280> shoes<00:03:12.030> look

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
actually pretty worn on both shoes look

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.960 
actually pretty worn on both shoes look
like<00:03:12.900> they've<00:03:13.260> been<00:03:13.290> stepped<00:03:13.860> on<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.640> pressed

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
like they've been stepped on and pressed

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.480 
like they've been stepped on and pressed
and<00:03:15.360> creased<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.960> just<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.800> know<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:16.980> lot<00:03:17.280> has

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
and creased and just you know a lot has

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.640 
and creased and just you know a lot has
happened<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:18.090> these<00:03:18.270> shoes<00:03:18.600> but<00:03:19.260> other<00:03:19.440> than

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
happened to these shoes but other than

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.290 
happened to these shoes but other than
that<00:03:19.770> I<00:03:20.100> still<00:03:20.520> think<00:03:20.730> they<00:03:20.850> look<00:03:21.090> pretty

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
that I still think they look pretty

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.140 
that I still think they look pretty
clean<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:23.220> shoes<00:03:23.459> are<00:03:23.489> very<00:03:23.820> comfortable

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
clean and the shoes are very comfortable

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.320
