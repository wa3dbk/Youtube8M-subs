okay well preparation preparation I do

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.729 
okay well preparation preparation I do
have<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> plan<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.770> use<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> plan<00:00:59.370> as<00:01:00.739> an

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
have a plan and I use a plan as an

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.460 
have a plan and I use a plan as an
orienting<00:01:02.510> structure<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.960> know<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.350> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
orienting structure and I know that I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.640 
orienting structure and I know that I
can<00:01:04.650> always<00:01:04.710> fall<00:01:05.100> back<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.339> something

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
can always fall back on something

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.530 
can always fall back on something
because<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> plan<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.549> think<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> plan<00:01:09.270> would

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
because the plan I think the plan would

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.800 
because the plan I think the plan would
would<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:09.960> constraining<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:11.880> now

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
would be constraining if you know now

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.179 
would be constraining if you know now
I've<00:01:12.960> got<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.500> now<00:01:13.560> I've<00:01:13.830> got<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.100> do

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
I've got to do this now I've got to do

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.010 
I've got to do this now I've got to do
this<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:14.400> let's<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> group

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
this now let's do this because the group

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.810 
this now let's do this because the group
is<00:01:16.140> very<00:01:16.170> creative<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.100> different<00:01:17.700> things

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
is very creative so different things

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.390 
is very creative so different things
happen<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.500> may<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.650> very<00:01:19.920> interesting

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
happen so there may be very interesting

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.429 
happen so there may be very interesting
questions<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.030> follow<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.479> I'll<00:01:21.930> make<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.380> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
questions to follow up I'll make it a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.429 
questions to follow up I'll make it a
new<00:01:22.560> exercise<00:01:22.890> idea<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.869> need<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
new exercise idea so I need to have that

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.800 
new exercise idea so I need to have that
flexibilities<00:01:26.189> but<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.210> plan<00:01:27.450> gives<00:01:27.689> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
flexibilities but the plan gives a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.749 
flexibilities but the plan gives a
confidence<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:29.490> there's<00:01:29.670> kind<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.880> default

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
confidence so there's kind of default

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.179 
confidence so there's kind of default
secondly<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.090> want<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:33.960> fun<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:35.040> have

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
secondly I want to have fun I do have

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.240 
secondly I want to have fun I do have
fun<00:01:35.430> okay<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.750> that's<00:01:37.350> very<00:01:37.560> important

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
fun okay so that's very important

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.130 
fun okay so that's very important
because<00:01:38.369> fun<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> really<00:01:39.540> good<00:01:39.689> state<00:01:39.960> if

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
because fun is a really good state if

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.520 
because fun is a really good state if
you<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.409> keep<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.799> state<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.040> fun<00:01:41.460> then

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
you can keep in a state of fun then

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.590 
you can keep in a state of fun then
everything's<00:01:43.530> much<00:01:43.680> easier<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:47.600> guess

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
everything's much easier and I guess

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.889 
everything's much easier and I guess
that<00:01:50.960> it's<00:01:51.960> also<00:01:52.170> about<00:01:53.149> curiosity<00:01:54.149> as<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that it's also about curiosity as a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.090 
that it's also about curiosity as a
balance<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.439> know<00:01:55.619> what's<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.040> happen

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
balance you know what's going to happen

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.149 
balance you know what's going to happen
what's<00:01:57.110> how<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.649> turn<00:01:58.829> out

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
what's how is this going to turn out

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.280 
what's how is this going to turn out
what<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.549> people<00:01:59.729> can<00:02:00.000> say<00:02:00.360> because

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
what do people can say because

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.270 
what do people can say because
everything<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.950> new

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
everything is new

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.310 
everything is new
anyway<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.630> never<00:02:03.810> give<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> same

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
anyway you can never give the same

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.230 
anyway you can never give the same
training<00:02:04.710> because<00:02:05.640> you're<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> different

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
training because you're a different

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.580 
training because you're a different
person<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:07.220> different

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
person and different

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.089 
person and different
so<00:02:09.220> everything's<00:02:09.729> new<00:02:10.650> so<00:02:11.650> there's<00:02:11.800> no<00:02:11.920> way

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
so everything's new so there's no way

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.330 
so everything's new so there's no way
that<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.430> could<00:02:12.610> get<00:02:12.730> bored<00:02:13.890> if<00:02:14.890> anything

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
that you could get bored if anything

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.760 
that you could get bored if anything
happens<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:16.860> isn't<00:02:17.860> in<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.069> plan<00:02:18.989> then<00:02:19.989> who

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
happens that isn't in the plan then who

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
happens that isn't in the plan then who
knows<00:02:20.920> whether<00:02:21.250> it's<00:02:21.489> good<00:02:21.670> or<00:02:21.700> bad<00:02:22.260> if<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:24.040> feel

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
knows whether it's good or bad if I feel

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.140 
knows whether it's good or bad if I feel
some<00:02:25.180> anxiety<00:02:25.720> about<00:02:26.650> that

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
some anxiety about that

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.949 
some anxiety about that
then<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:29.050> will<00:02:29.940> kind<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.030> make<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.239> negotiation

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
then I will kind of make a negotiation

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.589 
then I will kind of make a negotiation
with<00:02:32.110> myself

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
with myself

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.600 
with myself
yeah<00:02:34.599> like<00:02:34.900> okay<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.830> don't<00:02:36.280> want<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.489> think

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
yeah like okay I don't want to think

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.170 
yeah like okay I don't want to think
