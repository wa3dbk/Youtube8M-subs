00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hi girls so today I 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.980
 wanted to show you what I did 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.750
 like shots on the nails with a 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.780
 little son stickers that I bought 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.519
 at lm cosmetics so I'm going to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.020
 show what that gives and that's enough 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:23.670
 nice I did not think it would make 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:25.410
 like that so that's it hop here I'm them 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.779
 pose and position them as if I had 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.890
 wanted to highlight a french fatou 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.890
 create a french that's what it gives 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.640
 so in fact so I used everything 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.180
 first my base slips so any 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.649
 simple one red 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:52.620
 we speak in a red from these flora 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:55.710
 then the bloody satin here is the boudy 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.360
 satin from sephora so it's 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.520
 invariant that someone actually gave 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.629
 because on them it's the thing 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.190
 did not do well I did not try 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.720
 again that's what it gives you very 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.250
 happy and so after the little 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.810
 son stickers it comes as 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.210
 it's a bit cheap it's a small 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.500
 roller 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.850
 there are different colors I took 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.390
 silvered what I could do 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:23.159
 the silvery catch the little end and 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.380
 you unroll and its stickers 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.729
 so in fact you position yourself on your 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.200
 finger where you want to support yourself and 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.640
 after you cut the building then be 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.670
 this is the most annoying it 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.759
 must be cut properly because 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.240
 otherwise after on the edge it tends to 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.299
 hang on 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.159
 hence the absolute necessity to put 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.020
 a top coat there I did a fair 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.880
 a layer for the stands and I find 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.829
 that I still feel too much on the side I 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.060
 sense that it hangs 3 again so I 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.710
 will do a second coat just now 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.790
 but here I wanted to show you what 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.420
 that it gives super nice here I am 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.180
 very happy 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.829
 So here's what you say 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.829
 think and I'll see you soon
