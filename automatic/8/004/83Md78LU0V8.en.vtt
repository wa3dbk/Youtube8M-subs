my<00:03:05.630> advice<00:03:06.019> is<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.500> wait<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.680> split<00:03:06.890> second

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
my advice is the wait a split second

my advice is the wait a split second

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
following the footstool so that you can
