00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.199 
up and then if you want to take this
part<00:02:27.350> off<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:27.680> can<00:02:27.860> actually<00:02:27.950> sit<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.060> new

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
part off you can actually sit the new

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.210 
part off you can actually sit the new
peg<00:02:29.450> in<00:02:29.660> there<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.260> his<00:02:30.500> head<00:02:30.770> will<00:02:31.010> fit<00:02:31.160> right

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
peg in there and his head will fit right

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.229 
peg in there and his head will fit right
in<00:02:31.459> there<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:31.820> let's<00:02:31.940> put<00:02:32.150> rabbit<00:02:33.140> in<00:02:33.260> there

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
in there so let's put rabbit in there

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.850 
in there so let's put rabbit in there
his<00:02:35.239> head<00:02:35.480> will<00:02:35.600> fit<00:02:35.780> right<00:02:35.989> in<00:02:36.140> there<00:02:36.380> it's

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
his head will fit right in there it's

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.380 
his head will fit right in there it's
Kate<00:02:37.130> fits<00:02:37.370> very<00:02:37.550> nicely<00:02:37.730> too<00:02:38.120> there's

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
Kate fits very nicely too there's

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.350 
Kate fits very nicely too there's
actually<00:02:38.720> room<00:02:38.870> under<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.290> first<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.910> then

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
actually room under it first and then

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.210 
actually room under it first and then
you<00:02:41.570> can<00:02:41.690> put<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.959> teeth<00:02:42.110> here<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:43.040> know<00:02:43.160> you

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
you can put the teeth here you know you

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.520 
you can put the teeth here you know you
can<00:02:43.340> put<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.760> teeth<00:02:43.940> down<00:02:44.209> on<00:02:44.390> him<00:02:44.570> and<00:02:44.810> then

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
can put the teeth down on him and then

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.250 
can put the teeth down on him and then
you<00:02:45.830> can<00:02:46.070> just<00:02:46.750> close<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:48.200> up<00:02:48.489> like<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.850> and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
you can just close this up like that and

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.900 
you can just close this up like that and
it's<00:02:51.260> not<00:02:51.410> exactly<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.130> one<00:02:52.400> from<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.760> game

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
it's not exactly the one from the game

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.720 
it's not exactly the one from the game
but<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.570> mean<00:02:54.019> it's<00:02:54.200> pretty<00:02:54.500> close<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.519> guess

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
but I mean it's pretty close I guess

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.820 
but I mean it's pretty close I guess
it's<00:02:56.000> not<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.300> slightly<00:02:56.600> close<00:02:56.870> I'm<00:02:57.080> sorry<00:02:57.290> but

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
it's not a slightly close I'm sorry but

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.340 
it's not a slightly close I'm sorry but
it's<00:02:58.820> one<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.120> those<00:02:59.209> man-eating<00:02:59.510> plants<00:03:00.170> and

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
it's one of those man-eating plants and

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.850 
it's one of those man-eating plants and
he'll<00:03:00.530> just<00:03:00.680> be<00:03:00.769> eaten<00:03:01.400> behind<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:02.000> leaf

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
he'll just be eaten behind this leaf

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.770 
he'll just be eaten behind this leaf

here's<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.850> part<00:03:20.090> where<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.269> attaches<00:03:20.510> and

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
here's the part where it attaches and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.750 
here's the part where it attaches and
it's<00:03:21.290> just<00:03:21.440> attached<00:03:21.860> to<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.310> back<00:03:22.459> of<00:03:22.640> this

thing like that and then just this thing
it<00:03:26.540> can<00:03:26.750> use<00:03:26.959> this<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.560> can<00:03:27.590> like<00:03:27.890> attached

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
it can use this so it can like attached

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.509 
it can use this so it can like attached

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
it up on Clouseau and the mock would be

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.910 
it up on Clouseau and the mock would be
the<00:03:51.350> full<00:03:51.530> Botanical<00:03:52.070> Gardens<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:53.660> maybe<00:03:54.590> it

the sets also I might do this a little
bit<00:04:08.450> on<00:04:08.570> designed<00:04:08.989> by<00:04:09.109> me<00:04:09.290> of<00:04:09.320> something<00:04:09.739> you

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
bit on designed by me of something you

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.170 
bit on designed by me of something you
have<00:04:09.859> some<00:04:10.100> parts<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.519> I<00:04:10.549> don't<00:04:10.700> have<00:04:10.940> that

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
have some parts that I don't have that

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.970 
have some parts that I don't have that
they'd<00:04:11.329> have<00:04:11.480> fun<00:04:11.630> design<00:04:11.900> by<00:04:12.019> me<00:04:12.200> so<00:04:12.829> I<00:04:12.859> don't

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
they'd have fun design by me so I don't

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.940
