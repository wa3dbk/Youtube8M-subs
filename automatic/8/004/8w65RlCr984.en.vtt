00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:09.880
 this is fred frith is hamburg and fred 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.580
 rice on 22.9 is a federal election 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.500
 and more but it comes at the same time 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.260
 another important decision 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.150
 oh yes yes then fred per 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.189
 help people to decide that the 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.650
 supply networks for electricity gas and 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.279
 district heating back to the public sector 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.869
 come 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.919
 i know fred will say na and 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.510
 in fact, there are many good reasons 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:36.070
 for the buyback also for fred 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.989
 freedom of design gas flow and 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.399
 District heating network are in the hand of 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.649
 vattenfall and e.on 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.640
 the city only has a share of 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.399
 25.1 percent too little to actively influence 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.230
 to take on the company policy 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.559
 For example, the conversion of the networks for the 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.690
 energy turnaround or pricing 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.300
 hamburg will only be 100 percent 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.219
 independent financing that of 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.010
 household by taking over with two 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:06.610
 billion euros is charged is wrong 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.610
 as well as the purchase of the shares of 25.1 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.770
 percent was carried out in a budget-neutral manner 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.130
 also the one hundred percent buyback 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.350
 budget-neutral possible as the whole 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.380
 simply by a credit of 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.270
 urban society hgv the profits 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.729
 from the mains operation are significantly higher 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.990
 as the loan interest rates the financing 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.780
 is secured with it 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.909
 a good deal every hamburgerin and 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.930
 Every hamburger is on the energy networks 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.630
 reliant 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.060
 with the nets in the hands of the citizens they stay 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.030
 profits in hamburg estimates 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.750
 these are down to 50 million euros 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.240
 interest guaranteed every year 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.340
 basic electricity and heat are included 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.079
 for the basic needs of the population and 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.170
 therefore under democratic control 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.149
 and not in the hand profit-oriented 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.240
 Company employees and know how 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.100
 will be accepted only one 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.350
 municipal network operator is the 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.990
 Committed in common means that 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.440
 fair prices secure jobs and 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.519
 investments in the energy transition 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.519
 model hamburg water 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.420
 Transparency only in public hands 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.420
 Prices are made transparent 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.719
 future the decision who gas and 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.689
 power grid gets valid for the next 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:31.629
 20 years the FernwÃ¤rmenetz however 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:33.310
 is sold irretrievably only 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.890
 now citizens can 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.560
 make the soft for more climate protection 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.750
 only in public hands is a reconstruction 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.220
 the energy transition is really possible 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.950
 pushes forward and what do you say now fred o 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.109
 no problem fred nor is it yes 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.340

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.530
 ready to play in this film 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.849
 He then sends this to Karla 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.250
 nati alfons and everyone else agrees 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.389
 in the popular vote with yes for the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.689

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.310
