00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
and here we've got a picture of the

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.929 
and here we've got a picture of the
typical<00:00:16.989> medicine<00:00:17.769> cabinet<00:00:18.189> condition<00:00:18.789> it's

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
typical medicine cabinet condition it's

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
stick it on the wall and it's a big

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.279 
stick it on the wall and it's a big
clunk<00:00:25.300> that's<00:00:25.630> right<00:00:25.810> and<00:00:25.960> if<00:00:26.019> you<00:00:26.140> do<00:00:26.259> a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
clunk that's right and if you do a

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.779 
clunk that's right and if you do a
little<00:00:26.529> bit<00:00:26.679> of<00:00:26.739> forethought<00:00:27.249> and<00:00:27.310> a<00:00:27.550> little

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
little bit of forethought and a little

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.099 
little bit of forethought and a little
bit<00:00:27.909> of<00:00:28.029> design<00:00:28.390> work<00:00:28.630> you<00:00:28.779> can<00:00:28.929> actually

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
bit of design work you can actually

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.010 
bit of design work you can actually
integrate<00:00:29.829> that<00:00:30.009> into<00:00:30.609> the<00:00:31.089> end<00:00:31.659> of<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:31.839> house

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
integrate that into the end of the house

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.690 
integrate that into the end of the house
and<00:00:32.230> a<00:00:32.290> much<00:00:32.439> better<00:00:32.619> way<00:00:32.860> here<00:00:33.100> we<00:00:33.220> see<00:00:33.430> one

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
and a much better way here we see one

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.420 
and a much better way here we see one
that<00:00:34.270> has<00:00:34.690> been<00:00:34.870> inset<00:00:35.410> into<00:00:35.830> the<00:00:35.950> wall<00:00:36.160> and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
that has been inset into the wall and

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.250 
that has been inset into the wall and
that's<00:00:36.790> you<00:00:37.390> know<00:00:37.420> again<00:00:37.780> not<00:00:37.990> not

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
that's you know again not not

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.680 
that's you know again not not
groundbreaking<00:00:39.010> work<00:00:39.910> but<00:00:40.150> what<00:00:40.300> is<00:00:40.420> nice<00:00:40.660> is

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
groundbreaking work but what is nice is

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.750 
groundbreaking work but what is nice is
the<00:00:40.960> way<00:00:41.080> in<00:00:41.200> which<00:00:41.320> it's<00:00:41.500> in<00:00:41.680> detail<00:00:42.100> you<00:00:42.640> can

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
the way in which it's in detail you can

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.700 
the way in which it's in detail you can
see<00:00:42.820> that<00:00:43.120> we've<00:00:43.240> got<00:00:43.390> a<00:00:43.660> frameless<00:00:44.080> mirror

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
see that we've got a frameless mirror

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.030 
see that we've got a frameless mirror
that<00:00:45.640> acts<00:00:45.880> as<00:00:46.060> the<00:00:46.120> door<00:00:46.480> it's<00:00:46.960> offset<00:00:47.560> off<00:00:47.800> of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
that acts as the door it's offset off of

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.440 
that acts as the door it's offset off of
the<00:00:48.160> wall<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.580> then<00:00:48.820> you<00:00:48.970> can<00:00:49.150> so<00:00:49.270> that<00:00:49.300> you

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
the wall and then you can so that you

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.390 
the wall and then you can so that you
can<00:00:49.660> grab<00:00:49.900> the<00:00:50.110> underside<00:00:50.590> on<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.950> side<00:00:51.130> of<00:00:51.280> it

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
can grab the underside on the side of it

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.850 
can grab the underside on the side of it
and<00:00:51.580> open<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.360> door<00:00:52.510> so<00:00:52.630> it<00:00:52.930> makes<00:00:53.290> it<00:00:53.530> has<00:00:53.680> two

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
and open the door so it makes it has two

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.430 
and open the door so it makes it has two
purposes<00:00:54.130> if<00:00:54.630> shields<00:00:55.630> the<00:00:55.810> inside<00:00:56.260> of<00:00:56.380> the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
purposes if shields the inside of the

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.770 
purposes if shields the inside of the
medicine<00:00:56.800> cabinet<00:00:56.829> it<00:00:57.310> also<00:00:57.520> looks<00:00:58.090> like<00:00:58.300> it's

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
medicine cabinet it also looks like it's

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.319 
medicine cabinet it also looks like it's
floating<00:00:59.140> in<00:00:59.440> space<00:01:00.010> off<00:01:00.430> of<00:01:00.760> that<00:01:00.910> back<00:01:01.120> wall

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
floating in space off of that back wall

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.510 
floating in space off of that back wall
yeah<00:01:01.540> really<00:01:02.410> good<00:01:02.650> detail<00:01:02.980> for<00:01:03.190> a<00:01:03.220> small

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520

space if you have a slightly bigger
bathroom<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:05.979> can<00:01:06.219> do<00:01:06.640> a<00:01:06.670> variation<00:01:07.060> on<00:01:07.450> that

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
bathroom you can do a variation on that

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.300 
bathroom you can do a variation on that
theme<00:01:07.659> and<00:01:08.109> this<00:01:08.259> is<00:01:08.409> where<00:01:08.649> the<00:01:08.890> medicine

cabinets are and there's two medicine
cabinets<00:01:17.049> here<00:01:17.289> and<00:01:17.439> again<00:01:17.979> same<00:01:18.340> detail

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
cabinets here and again same detail

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.919 
cabinets here and again same detail
there's<00:01:18.880> a<00:01:18.939> slight<00:01:19.179> overhang<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.630> reach

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
there's a slight overhang you reach

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:21.660 
there's a slight overhang you reach
underneath<00:01:20.259> and<00:01:20.530> you<00:01:20.590> open<00:01:20.920> those<00:01:21.039> up<00:01:21.100> there's

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
underneath and you open those up there's

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.120 
underneath and you open those up there's
storage<00:01:22.090> in<00:01:22.450> behind<00:01:22.840> these<00:01:23.139> units<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:23.740> then

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
storage in behind these units and then

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.800 
storage in behind these units and then
the<00:01:24.159> other<00:01:24.369> units<00:01:24.759> are<00:01:24.939> for<00:01:25.179> electrical<00:01:25.689> and

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
the other units are for electrical and

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.599 
the other units are for electrical and
if<00:01:25.899> we<00:01:25.990> just<00:01:26.139> look<00:01:26.289> at<00:01:26.380> this<00:01:26.530> on<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:27.130> side<00:01:27.369> this

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
if we just look at this on the side this

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.550 
if we just look at this on the side this
is<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.789> really<00:01:28.060> clever<00:01:28.270> detail<00:01:28.749> because<00:01:28.929> what's

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
is a really clever detail because what's

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.929 
is a really clever detail because what's
happening<00:01:30.039> is<00:01:30.159> the<00:01:30.369> mirror<00:01:30.609> is<00:01:30.789> actually

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
happening is the mirror is actually

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.059 
happening is the mirror is actually
overhanging<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:32.079> little<00:01:32.740> bit<00:01:32.859> of<00:01:32.979> the

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
overhanging a little bit of the

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.459 
overhanging a little bit of the
countertop<00:01:33.579> so<00:01:33.850> if<00:01:33.909> our<00:01:33.999> sink<00:01:34.329> is<00:01:34.450> here<00:01:34.929> like

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
countertop so if our sink is here like

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.469 
countertop so if our sink is here like
that<00:01:35.679> you<00:01:35.979> just<00:01:36.490> reach<00:01:36.729> your<00:01:36.759> hand<00:01:37.149> underneath

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
that you just reach your hand underneath

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.629 
that you just reach your hand underneath
and<00:01:37.899> you<00:01:38.049> pull<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.560> mirror<00:01:38.889> and<00:01:38.950> open<00:01:39.429> it<00:01:39.549> up

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:39.639 
and you pull that mirror and open it up

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:41.190 
and you pull that mirror and open it up
and<00:01:39.819> you've<00:01:40.240> got<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.479> storage<00:01:40.719> and<00:01:40.929> behind

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
and you've got the storage and behind

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.230 
and you've got the storage and behind
and<00:01:41.859> then<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.100> last<00:01:42.280> example<00:01:42.490> is<00:01:42.939> a<00:01:42.969> project

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
and then the last example is a project

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.440 
and then the last example is a project
of<00:01:43.600> ours<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.229> here<00:01:45.130> we've<00:01:45.310> integrated<00:01:45.729> the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450
