the noise a lot of people on YouTube
they've<00:00:49.570> been<00:00:49.690> looking<00:00:49.930> for<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.410> there<00:00:50.590> is<00:00:50.710> no

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
video for that so I figure I just make a

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.360 
video for that so I figure I just make a
quick<00:00:52.930> video<00:00:53.140> to<00:00:53.350> show<00:00:53.620> you<00:00:53.649> guys<00:00:53.920> where

quick video to show you guys where

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.970 
quick video to show you guys where
exactly<00:00:54.670> these<00:00:54.910> bomb<00:00:55.239> these<00:00:56.079> sensors<00:00:56.590> are<00:00:56.770> so

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
exactly these bomb these sensors are so

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.459 
exactly these bomb these sensors are so
you<00:00:57.070> can<00:00:57.190> pop<00:00:57.399> them<00:00:57.670> off<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:59.140> one<00:00:59.320> we're

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
you can pop them off the one we're

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.110 
you can pop them off the one we're
talking<00:00:59.649> about<00:00:59.890> right<00:01:00.219> now<00:01:00.370> which<00:01:00.579> is<00:01:00.610> on<00:01:00.820> Bank

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
talking about right now which is on Bank

talking about right now which is on Bank
One<00:01:01.450> um<00:01:02.230> you<00:01:03.190> can<00:01:03.309> get<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.460> call<00:01:03.760> from<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:04.030> iPad

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
One um you can get a call from the iPad

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.539 
One um you can get a call from the iPad
this<00:01:04.509> is<00:01:04.570> actually<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.199> diagram<00:01:05.740> of<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.310> arm

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
this is actually a diagram of the arm

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.459 
this is actually a diagram of the arm
the<00:01:07.180> morning<00:01:07.540> it<00:01:07.659> doesn't<00:01:08.020> matter<00:01:08.350> whether

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
the morning it doesn't matter whether

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:14.219 
the morning it doesn't matter whether
you're<00:01:08.619> driving<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.069> 350z<00:01:10.350> m35<00:01:11.350> or<00:01:12.899> fx35<00:01:13.899> all

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
you're driving a 350z m35 or fx35 all

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.840 
you're driving a 350z m35 or fx35 all
that<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.469> basic<00:01:14.799> same<00:01:14.979> setup<00:01:15.280> with<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.609> motor

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
that the basic same setup with the motor

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.449 
that the basic same setup with the motor
but<00:01:16.539> anyhow<00:01:16.840> what<00:01:17.079> we're<00:01:17.229> looking<00:01:17.530> at<00:01:17.619> is<00:01:17.859> 20

on<00:01:18.639> the<00:01:19.030> engine<00:01:19.329> control<00:01:19.420> component<00:01:20.459> diagram

00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:21.459 
on the engine control component diagram

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.910 
on the engine control component diagram
which<00:01:22.270> is<00:01:22.479> right<00:01:22.779> here<00:01:22.810> that's<00:01:23.560> what<00:01:23.679> it<00:01:23.770> looks

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
which is right here that's what it looks

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.069 
which is right here that's what it looks
like<00:01:23.979> on<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.159> on<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.639> on<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.270> diagram<00:01:25.810> this

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
like on the on the on the diagram this

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.050 
like on the on the on the diagram this
is<00:01:26.139> where<00:01:26.350> you<00:01:26.469> actually<00:01:26.649> act<00:01:27.009> right<00:01:27.459> here<00:01:27.819> on

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
is where you actually act right here on

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.019 
is where you actually act right here on
the<00:01:28.600> motor<00:01:28.869> this<00:01:29.770> part<00:01:30.189> actually<00:01:30.369> sits<00:01:30.819> up

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:31.029 
the motor this part actually sits up

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:33.629 
the motor this part actually sits up
here<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.499> vacuum<00:01:32.889> lines<00:01:33.130> you're<00:01:33.490> going

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:33.639 
here for the vacuum lines you're going

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:35.099 
here for the vacuum lines you're going
to<00:01:33.700> you're<00:01:33.909> going<00:01:33.999> to<00:01:34.060> have<00:01:34.299> to<00:01:34.420> remove<00:01:34.779> this

to you're going to have to remove this
there's<00:01:35.469> nothing<00:01:35.709> real<00:01:35.829> because<00:01:36.130> it's<00:01:36.249> a

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
there's nothing real because it's a

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.099 
there's nothing real because it's a
tongue<00:01:36.549> ten<00:01:36.909> millimeter<00:01:37.299> socket<00:01:37.359> I<00:01:37.810> mean<00:01:37.959> on

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
tongue ten millimeter socket I mean on

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.169 
tongue ten millimeter socket I mean on
bolt<00:01:38.469> right<00:01:38.649> there<00:01:38.709> just<00:01:39.399> pull<00:01:39.609> that<00:01:39.639> bolt<00:01:39.969> out

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
bolt right there just pull that bolt out

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.059 
bolt right there just pull that bolt out
move<00:01:40.990> this<00:01:41.139> over<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.319> the<00:01:41.409> tire<00:01:41.679> and<00:01:41.979> remove

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
move this over to the tire and remove

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.399 
move this over to the tire and remove
the<00:01:42.399> arm<00:01:42.609> vacuum<00:01:43.420> lines<00:01:43.659> you<00:01:43.840> can<00:01:43.959> get<00:01:44.170> there

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
the arm vacuum lines you can get there
