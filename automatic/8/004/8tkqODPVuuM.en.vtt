I was pretty much in love with Nicole or
at<00:01:38.700> least<00:01:38.850> what<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> seven-year-old<00:01:39.600> thinks

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
at least what a seven-year-old thinks

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.960 
at least what a seven-year-old thinks
love<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.770> was<00:01:41.010> too<00:01:41.159> shy<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.460> scared<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
love is but I was too shy and scared to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.910 
love is but I was too shy and scared to
say<00:01:42.150> anything<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.600> her<00:01:42.690> until<00:01:43.380> years<00:01:43.650> later

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
say anything to her until years later

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.859

fifth grade I moved schools for middle
school<00:01:47.700> sixth<00:01:47.940> grade<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.240> specifically<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
school sixth grade was specifically a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.960 
school sixth grade was specifically a
terrible<00:01:49.619> year<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:49.890> me<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.400> only<00:01:50.640> did<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> lose

terrible year for me not only did I lose
all<00:01:51.150> my<00:01:51.180> friends<00:01:51.270> because<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.869> was<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.080> your

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
all my friends because it was in your

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.840 
all my friends because it was in your
school<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:52.920> because<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.369> was<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> charter

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
school but because it was a charter

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.910 
school but because it was a charter
school<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.360> had<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> take<00:01:54.720> tests<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.380> see

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
school we all had to take tests to see

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.590 
school we all had to take tests to see
where<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.220> would<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.460> placed<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.150> guess<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.570> for

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
where we would be placed I guess and for

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.210 
where we would be placed I guess and for
some<00:01:57.869> reason<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.290> got<00:01:58.439> placed<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> older

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
some reason I got placed with the older

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.980 
some reason I got placed with the older
kids<00:01:59.460> at<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.150> time<00:02:00.330> I<00:02:00.360> thought<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.720> was<00:02:00.900> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
kids at the time I thought this was a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.270 
kids at the time I thought this was a
good<00:02:01.140> thing<00:02:01.200> because<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.650> thought<00:02:01.799> older<00:02:02.100> kids

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
good thing because I thought older kids

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.590 
good thing because I thought older kids
would<00:02:02.400> think<00:02:02.520> I'm<00:02:02.610> cool<00:02:02.820> because<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.240> skipped<00:02:03.510> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
would think I'm cool because I skipped a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.270 
would think I'm cool because I skipped a
grade<00:02:03.630> however<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.530> was<00:02:04.680> pretty<00:02:05.010> much<00:02:05.220> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
grade however it was pretty much the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.820 
grade however it was pretty much the
opposite<00:02:06.080> so<00:02:07.080> this<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.409> part<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.619> story

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
opposite so this is the part of story

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.719 
opposite so this is the part of story
that<00:02:07.890> most<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.399> don't<00:02:08.489> know<00:02:08.610> about

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that most of you don't know about

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.279 
that most of you don't know about
because<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.269> never<00:02:09.569> really<00:02:09.840> addressed<00:02:10.049> it

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
because I never really addressed it

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.080 
because I never really addressed it
publicly<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.370> know<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.610> lot<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:11.909> you

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
time that I think most if not all

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.879 
time that I think most if not all
teenagers<00:02:45.719> go<00:02:46.019> through<00:02:46.230> at<00:02:46.319> some<00:02:46.559> point<00:02:46.799> in

teenagers go through at some point in
their<00:02:47.010> lives<00:02:47.129> or<00:02:47.669> perhaps<00:02:47.939> it<00:02:48.269> was<00:02:48.329> just

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
their lives or perhaps it was just

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.610 
their lives or perhaps it was just
puberty<00:02:48.689> messing<00:02:49.109> with<00:02:49.139> my<00:02:49.319> head<00:02:49.469> I<00:02:49.499> don't

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:54.229 
and I actually found a way to end the
bullying<00:02:53.489> on<00:02:53.609> my<00:02:53.700> own<00:02:53.819> terms

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
bullying on my own terms

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.369 
bullying on my own terms
I<00:02:54.329> notice<00:02:54.599> that<00:02:54.659> the<00:02:54.779> reason<00:02:55.049> dick<00:02:55.200> was

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
I notice that the reason dick was

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.989 
I notice that the reason dick was
bullying<00:02:55.680> me<00:02:55.739> was<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.129> make<00:02:56.249> people<00:02:56.459> laugh<00:02:56.639> so

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:56.999 
bullying me was to make people laugh so

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:58.339 
bullying me was to make people laugh so
I<00:02:57.059> figured<00:02:57.419> that<00:02:57.569> if<00:02:57.719> I<00:02:57.840> could<00:02:57.989> make<00:02:58.139> them

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
I figured that if I could make them

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.140 
I figured that if I could make them
laugh<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.889> become<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.519> funny<00:02:59.760> guy<00:02:59.939> they

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
laugh and become the funny guy they

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.759 
laugh and become the funny guy they
would<00:03:00.299> stop<00:03:00.510> treating<00:03:00.959> me<00:03:01.049> like<00:03:01.169> I<00:03:01.439> was<00:03:01.590> less

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
would stop treating me like I was less

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.409 
would stop treating me like I was less
than<00:03:01.799> them<00:03:02.129> and<00:03:02.489> surprisingly<00:03:03.059> it<00:03:03.239> worked

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
than them and surprisingly it worked

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.119 
than them and surprisingly it worked
every<00:03:03.749> time<00:03:04.200> they<00:03:04.319> made<00:03:04.439> fun<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.650> me<00:03:04.829> I<00:03:04.859> ran

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
every time they made fun of me I ran

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.769 
every time they made fun of me I ran
within<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.669> I<00:03:05.730> made<00:03:05.939> fun<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.239> myself<00:03:06.419> even

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:06.779 
within and I made fun of myself even

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.089 
within and I made fun of myself even
more<00:03:07.019> than<00:03:07.139> they<00:03:07.290> could<00:03:07.529> kind<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.859> like<00:03:08.010> that

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
more than they could kind of like that

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.649 
more than they could kind of like that

this<00:04:57.030> was<00:04:57.180> by<00:04:57.300> far<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.570> most<00:04:57.720> I've<00:04:58.139> ever<00:04:58.380> had

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
this was by far the most I've ever had

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.020 
this was by far the most I've ever had
to<00:04:58.710> lose<00:04:58.919> in<00:04:59.070> such<00:04:59.220> a<00:04:59.310> short<00:04:59.610> amount<00:04:59.729> of<00:04:59.970> time
