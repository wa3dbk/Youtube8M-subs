00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.450 
this iphone 4 so that means if i put the
screen<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.920> iphone<00:01:11.250> knows

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
screen like this the iphone knows

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.670 
screen like this the iphone knows
exactly<00:01:11.760> where<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.270> at<00:01:12.450> where<00:01:13.080> I'm<00:01:13.320> at<00:01:13.530> and

phone around the the phone is exactly in
the<00:01:33.210> game<00:01:33.390> knows<00:01:33.630> exactly<00:01:34.020> where<00:01:34.979> I'm

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
the game knows exactly where I'm

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.819 
the game knows exactly where I'm
positioning<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.540> thing<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.200> amazing<00:01:37.740> i

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
been able to before so let me take a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.910 
been able to before so let me take a
couple<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.720> shots<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.110> some<00:01:46.229> things<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.649> it's

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
couple of shots of some things here it's

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.069 
couple of shots of some things here it's
kind<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.159> hard<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> do<00:01:47.520> cordon<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.210> get

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
kind of hard to do cordon and get

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.050 
kind of hard to do cordon and get
accurate<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:50.390> let's<00:01:51.390> say

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.880 

gravity<00:01:56.020> all<00:01:56.290> right<00:01:56.439> there<00:01:56.619> we<00:01:56.710> go<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.649> as<00:01:59.829> you

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
gravity all right there we go so as you

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.700 
gravity all right there we go so as you
can<00:02:00.070> see<00:02:00.369> I<00:02:00.610> can<00:02:00.790> really<00:02:01.299> focus<00:02:01.570> in<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.229> zoom

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
can see I can really focus in and zoom

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.700 
can see I can really focus in and zoom
on<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.220> targets<00:02:03.640> just<00:02:04.420> like<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.840> was<00:02:05.259> focusing

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
on the targets just like I was focusing

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.479 
on the targets just like I was focusing
with<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:05.890> real<00:02:06.100> gun<00:02:06.220> it's<00:02:07.060> pretty<00:02:07.720> crazy<00:02:08.489> so

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
with a real gun it's pretty crazy so

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.690 
with a real gun it's pretty crazy so
this<00:02:09.910> is<00:02:10.090> gun<00:02:10.899> range<00:02:11.200> eliminate<00:02:12.099> gun<00:02:12.250> range<00:02:12.550> by

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
this is gun range eliminate gun range by

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.210 
this is gun range eliminate gun range by
ng<00:02:13.090> moco<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.750> it's<00:02:14.410> one<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.739> first<00:02:14.890> apps

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
ng moco and it's one of the first apps

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.710 
ng moco and it's one of the first apps
in<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.550> App<00:02:15.730> Store<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:16.150> take<00:02:16.330> full<00:02:16.569> advantage

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
in the App Store to take full advantage

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.350 
in the App Store to take full advantage
of<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.290> gyroscope<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.130> cannot<00:02:18.670> wait<00:02:18.849> to<00:02:19.209> see

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
of the gyroscope I cannot wait to see

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.059 
of the gyroscope I cannot wait to see
what<00:02:19.510> happens<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.080> future<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.530> gaming<00:02:20.680> and

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
what happens in the future of gaming and

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.400 
what happens in the future of gaming and
also<00:02:21.910> some<00:02:22.209> other<00:02:22.330> cool<00:02:22.540> ideas<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.989> had<00:02:23.170> was

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
also some other cool ideas I had was

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.589 
also some other cool ideas I had was
maybe<00:02:23.620> using<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.580> gyroscope<00:02:25.090> for<00:02:25.330> video

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
maybe using the gyroscope for video

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.360 
maybe using the gyroscope for video
conferencing<00:02:26.050> so<00:02:26.800> if<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:26.950> have<00:02:27.069> one<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.310> those

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
conferencing so if you have one of those

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.900 
conferencing so if you have one of those
cool<00:02:27.700> cameras<00:02:28.360> as<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.600> 360<00:02:29.260> going<00:02:29.860> angle<00:02:30.220> if<00:02:30.340> you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
cool cameras as a 360 going angle if you

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.309 
cool cameras as a 360 going angle if you
could<00:02:31.090> move<00:02:31.239> your<00:02:31.480> phone<00:02:31.630> around<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.049> see<00:02:32.200> who

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
could move your phone around the see who

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.750 
could move your phone around the see who
else<00:02:32.440> was<00:02:32.590> in<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.830> room<00:02:32.860> if<00:02:33.489> you're<00:02:33.670> not

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
else was in the room if you're not

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.979 
else was in the room if you're not
actually<00:02:34.000> there<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:34.630> your<00:02:34.780> video

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
actually there but your video

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.350 
actually there but your video
conferencing<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:36.130> would<00:02:36.370> be<00:02:36.549> kind<00:02:36.850> of

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
conferencing that would be kind of

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.570 
conferencing that would be kind of
amazing<00:02:37.989> too<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:38.500> I<00:02:38.709> don't<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.489> the

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
amazing too so I don't have the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.190 
amazing too so I don't have the
resources<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:40.060> make<00:02:40.209> that<00:02:40.390> happen<00:02:40.540> but<00:02:41.110> if

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
resources to make that happen but if

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.080 
resources to make that happen but if
somebody<00:02:41.349> else<00:02:41.620> does<00:02:41.860> I<00:02:42.130> want<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.790> see<00:02:42.940> what
