00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
and this is one of the units for the

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.849 
and this is one of the units for the
five<00:00:02.610> pointed<00:00:02.970> star<00:00:03.259> make<00:00:04.259> five<00:00:04.680> units

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
five pointed star make five units

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.740 
five pointed star make five units
exactly<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.010> same<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.490> we<00:00:09.150> are<00:00:09.389> going<00:00:09.660> to

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
exactly the same and we are going to

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.700 
exactly the same and we are going to
assemble<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.650> just<00:00:11.070> like<00:00:11.990> the<00:00:12.990> five-pointed

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
assemble it just like the five-pointed

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.220 
assemble it just like the five-pointed
the<00:00:13.980> regular<00:00:14.400> five<00:00:14.610> pointed<00:00:14.969> star<00:00:15.030> lift<00:00:16.020> up

the regular five pointed star lift up
the<00:00:16.410> triangle<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.240> tuck<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.480> section<00:00:19.050> right

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
the triangle and tuck this section right

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:36.049 
the triangle and tuck this section right
into<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.609> rabbit<00:00:21.600> ear<00:00:27.199> collapse<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:35.059> take
