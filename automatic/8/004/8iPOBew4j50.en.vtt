 threatened his safety and that of his 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.680

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.399
 full 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.730

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.520
 is to die think or not and now that I'm going to 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.940

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.030
 very hard-working and I felt like in 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.580
 first place be a burden for the 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:57.489
 family he has always been a person 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:01:00.400
 very motivated a strong person what 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:04.110
 before losing sight it was always a 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.000
 person who lived creating by imagining and 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.700
 making things and that's what he did 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.680
 let your imagination fly looking 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.450
 a form of entertainment well not 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.580
 it took to become the way in which 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.740
 he makes a living making boards 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.670
 chess for the blind then in guatemala 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.950
 nobody made us I thought it could be that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.009
 yes I am if I am blind if I went blind 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.890
 is for some reason and I have to do 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.820
 many things 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.610
 so that people see that you can still 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.229
 move forward for five years now 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.350
 dedicate to making this type of boards 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.400
 chess that have the requirements 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.159
 international to make it a board 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.140
 professional the first one who did it put together 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.930
 in his rehabilitation center there 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.280
 He learned to work in wood because 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.369
 he has managed several things for me to 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.350
 to be able to cut the tables to be able 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.509
 prepare the parts the procedure 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.119
 start by gluing two pieces of wood 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.240
 which takes off small tables of 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.420
 an inch that form the frame this 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.010
 must be linked and then painted black 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.200
 the towns or caps make them 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.170
 cutting a wooden bar of 16 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.720
 inches the reagan them and sticks them 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.280
 at the base of the board to each cap 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.739
 he makes a hole in the middle so that 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.780
 each piece is key after the 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.730
 board is formed is varnished and it 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.550
 two hinges on the back 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.320
 so that the pieces become foldable 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.150
 purchases made and filled in for 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.819
 place a type of nail that 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.069
 inserted in the holes of the board 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.260
 the black pieces unlike some 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.880
 small nails that you put in the part 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.590
 top 4 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.540
 the 5 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.489

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.349
 type of boards also plays chess 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.690

 had the opportunity to travel to 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.310
 play because they do not have the resources 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.470
 economic and requires selling their 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.560
 boards to have a little income 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.450
 He sells them but as they are asked 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.910
 then he begins to prepare but 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.920
 the process is long because it has 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.140
 that give their good finish so they remain 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.930
 presentable if it's something that he likes 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.329
