 to laugh about it yes there are some and so on 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.199
 one is currently available for hire 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.609
 and sale had come and we 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.320
 but take a close look 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.320
 namely grammer 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.570
 Beautiful day on it is going to be a storm 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.949
 then they really look deep 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.949
 lying a few approach 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.970
 July is a corpse from what does he want 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.280
 jesus kun almost died when there were some 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.620
 Know where you are the long against 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.420
 scam we have a resort and 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.860
 is only a few booze 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.860
 we must protect pull through 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.729
 No 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.159
 his 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.750
 with difficulties simply pushes off 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.659
 In 2012 94 minutes must go like this 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.100
 a lot of like translated and translated 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.869
 tells the story or the one 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.670
 History in Ireland in a coastal village 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.200
 There usually happens 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.970
 not much as a head you will be there one 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.680
 Criminal offenses have been built and 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.450
 that's what our main actor is all about 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.040
 really you wilder just not 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 come this sleepy 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.310
 everybody knows everyone 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.049
 yes that's just normal if that 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.240
 population limit is very limited 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.190
 only at one time whales are stranded at the 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.509
 coast that is very unusual and it 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.860
 comes to an attack directly on 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.590
 the beginning of the film on a fishing boat 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.539
 of a kind of giant squad and what 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.820
 it is only in the background 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.500
 Run this 94 minutes to explain us 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.110
 only with all we can be sure 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.640
 It is a monster from the undersea or 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.289
 maybe from the universe that the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.269
 population is coming close and threatening 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.739
 this decimates until you find out 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.600
 that a fisherman strangely 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.580
 Survived these animals was exposed and 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.700
 why is that because you find out 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.260
 that he was totally drunk and this 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.880
 Just do not breathe blood in alcohol 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.010
 tolerated or vice versa 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.510
 Alcohol in the blood are tolerated 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.489
 she is allergic and then that is the only one 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.880
 means to save yourself from this and 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.130
 her to drink until the doctor comes that yes 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.140
 Grass is the story more trashy 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.670
 I'm probably already 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.410
 I'm on a very good measure and on 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.329
 Animals and the question takes this film 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.650
 seriously or not and that does 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.630
 the difference between good and not 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.130
 well this b movie definitely has 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.810
 the bow out and know exactly 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.610
 even that he is quite a crap 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.350
 That's why it's pretty funny 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.000
 on the cover you can even would 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.890
 otherwise it is written by the author 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.030
 from the director of the producer 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.310
 and a huge movie title is here 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.109
 special effects from harry potter that is 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.090
 also very unusual and exactly this 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.160
 to grab a drawer the story is here 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.930
 so unimportant as it is uninteresting but it is 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.850
 watch funny if the one 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.350
 or others in full drunk mode at the wheel 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.329
 turns and this funny animated 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.340
 strange fivaz no alcohol tolerates 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.049
 Hundreds of babies scattered on the island 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.430
 then that's just as uninteresting as 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.019
 but also jokes here makes in easy 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.510
 the group dynamics fun and for everyone 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.100
 like these monster madness movies 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.959
 that exactly in quotation marks 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.850
 bad level of filming the 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.380
 can enrich harmony and thus 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.260
 we have an evaluation here a tremendous 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.360
 Discrepancy which accordingly quite 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.519
 is logical as a monster movie the 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.739
 The movie gets a trashy way for me 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.540
 absolutely stupid funny one sees just 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.950
 of 10 possible points and is accurate 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.599
 for this feeling for the people the 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.190
 maybe that's what they need 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.510
 right and worth watching fresh in the 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.030
 rental and sale since the fourth 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.650
 december but otherwise if you have the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.030
 film really thumb screw applies and 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.349
 says compare me again 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.709
 to all the other movies in the world is 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.450
 of course it's such a crÃªpe again 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.909
 For example, the Arabs you can 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.049
 film highly praise halt for his genre 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.400
 Not a tap after all 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.230
 Cream is and therefore the film comes 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.690
 for me in total only two and a half of 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.060
 10 possible points for all fans please 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.640
 value to the genre and 8 for it is 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.409
 ok there then what of me for today 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.370
 with this enormous difference of two 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.810
 I would like another one 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.549
 wonderful day tomorrow at 15 o'clock there 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.070
 of course it's a new review as well 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.450
 as we regularly expanded trailer 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.070
 checks make us look on facebook 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.390
 twitter with me if we otherwise 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.340
 about filmmaker I want you 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.440
 another wonderful day makes it good 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.900
 I hope to 59 clock, of course 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.900
 of course again tomorrow at 3 o'clock
