00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.649
 FC Utrecht always has a hard time in Alkmaar 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.429
 of the 29 in the away games at azvd only 5 won 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.070
 the last time it worked was in the 2005 2006 season 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.349
 last season came too late for national champion it 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.349
 became 2 0 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.020
 not normally keep inside 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.430
 but it looks a bit on the sidelines meanwhile radio button 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.740
 the zeeuw afterwards all android 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.740
 gets the chance of the disease 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.130
 a switch from sergio 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.130
 But that is the responsibility they hold many of the year 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.320
 wonderful goal of the world 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600
 so don't stop 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.220
 so far nothing to gain 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.750
 we were only allowed a little tap 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.750
 the members sit down 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.470
 leroy shorts with a but 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.650
 steered the construction time 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.359
 because that other than just goes inside 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.560
 there are the competition 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.560
 furthermore, it will take its place but will have to for the time being 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.420
 utrecht solve the problems with ten people 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.420
 the driver stopped there 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.830
 hatch stijn scarce stood by the ball 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.130
 that is a first basic place for itself 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.130
 just take a free kick 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.719
 do space at jolanda 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.629
 countries are currently still ali el hamdaoui 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.509
 non voice 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.899
 I can easily figure this out 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:39.019
 more cleared on the ball 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.459
 and with a good luck that is almost possible 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.459
 london anp more than a hundred countries 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.489
 but the side to come 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.169
 search now 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.459
 but also relapse at utrecht after a good start 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.029
 afterwards it's good 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:04.289
 next chance 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.289
 became quite easy 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.799
 be placed like this 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.219
 martens it in between 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.549
 the android 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.189
 but he asks for the ball 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.189
 indeed yes nice device there 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.869
 how did that happen 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.859
 he puts on 2 0 comes 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.339
 with a few minutes until the rest there is no more to save 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:32.189
 carry out 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.739
 after ten o'clock 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:34.920
 so six in the hall 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.049
 deus duel clean his goal in a row 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.889
 this is a bit tricky the ball that has had 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.969
 in utah there is completely wrong christa debeck 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.969
 prandelli is beside it but the chance of that 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.589
 in short we are not 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.419
 quite different minorities they normally 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.539
 in blood form 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:00.939
 four men from az against three from utrecht this should be the decision 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:01.879
 to be 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.879
 the place of another is not good for me 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.789
 committed in the first hour with a short space 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:15.789
 life is heading for martens 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:23.270
 driven but with this top man the prosecutor thinks it's going there with me 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.379
 At the end of September you should still be happy that it is still a long tail 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:29.330
 that is not a moderate team 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.520
 through the little boy that gig 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.590
 the nos reports that 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.590
 twelve minutes before the extra time starts 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.509
 your android 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:45.779
 seek it is a judge to get it out and it makes a difference 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.610
 shooter walked forward 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.370
 do the walk yourself for too much power 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.659
 one of the best people in the field left the site 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:18.830
 the 2 0 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.669
 and so it is final 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.479
 so it must end 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.479
 a deserved win 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.539
 meanwhile the country is defending
