 Hi everyone, I'm here today to make you 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.750
 see the top line of sleeping bags 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.810
 nash sub 20 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.930
 how can you see this and little 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.230
 cumbersome is a double appeal sack 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:33.600
 winter layer and let's see 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.600
 because it is so space-saving 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:50.399
 who knows open hat is very much 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.809
 aesthetically beautiful ie the logo of nash 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:59.799
 placed on the lower left side e 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.559
 to the touch is something I think that 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:06.039
 be exceptional because it always comes 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:09.159
 want to pet it you can see 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:13.890
 anyway how soft this is that you don't 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:19.899
 sa double layer hat indeed one can 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:25.360
 eliminate the top layer that is 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:28.810
 useful in the middle of winter and having who knows 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.140
 what hat for half a season always 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.280
 with the usual aesthetic I add that 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.700
 this is a completely material 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.640
 waterproof and breathable is a lot a 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.299
 patented hair let's see that 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.299
 under 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:56.260
 we call it a species of us 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.870
 baffle here it is and this is the 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.840
 patented and less bulky part 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:06.130
 because there is this this part in file 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.560
 here if a person is thin or is a 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.220
 a little more robust, no matter why 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.800
 here it will always touch touching create 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.530
 more warmth than having heaven and 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.080
 so this part here absolutely 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.330
 important for the bulk the fabric 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:29.620
 interior is extremely comfortable 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:34.030
 extremely delicate to the very touch 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:41.400
 robust however it is a top sleeping bag 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:45.880
 of home nash provides at its under 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.770
 strap to anchor it to the pocket bed 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.770
