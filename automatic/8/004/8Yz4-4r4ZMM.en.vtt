00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
changes to the device so I ended up

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.840 
changes to the device so I ended up
having<00:00:19.170> two<00:00:19.410> questions<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.130> device<00:00:20.430> is

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
having two questions for this device is

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.340 
having two questions for this device is
it<00:00:21.029> worth<00:00:21.180> its<00:00:21.359> price<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.930> should<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.140> go<00:00:22.320> for

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
it worth its price and should you go for

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.800 
it worth its price and should you go for
a<00:00:22.529> 6<00:00:22.800> plus<00:00:22.980> instead<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.640> 6<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.359> terms<00:00:24.539> of

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
a 6 plus instead of the 6 in terms of

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.509 
a 6 plus instead of the 6 in terms of
design<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.170> build<00:00:25.470> quality<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:26.160> 6<00:00:26.400> plus

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
design and build quality the 6 plus

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.519 
design and build quality the 6 plus
really<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> step<00:00:27.420> ahead<00:00:27.539> compared<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> 6

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
really is a step ahead compared to the 6

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.070 
really is a step ahead compared to the 6
it<00:00:29.189> uses<00:00:29.580> more<00:00:29.789> premium<00:00:30.269> materials<00:00:30.779> which

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
it uses more premium materials which

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.319 
it uses more premium materials which
give<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.500> very<00:00:31.740> premium<00:00:32.009> look<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:33.030> besides

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
give it a very premium look but besides

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.880 
give it a very premium look but besides
of<00:00:33.420> looking<00:00:33.690> more<00:00:33.809> premium<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> materials

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
of looking more premium the materials

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.069 
of looking more premium the materials
also<00:00:35.100> make<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.610> lot<00:00:35.820> nicer<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.239> hold<00:00:36.570> the

also make it a lot nicer to hold the
aluminum<00:00:37.530> bezel<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:38.040> example<00:00:38.489> also<00:00:38.670> gives

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
aluminum bezel for example also gives

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.970 
aluminum bezel for example also gives
some<00:00:39.149> extra<00:00:39.329> grip<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.899> device<00:00:40.230> then<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
some extra grip to the device then the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.619 
some extra grip to the device then the
same<00:00:41.340> traits<00:00:41.610> look<00:00:41.790> very<00:00:42.090> nice<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.360> are

perfectly built into the bezel which I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.400 
perfectly built into the bezel which I
see<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> big<00:00:45.059> upgrade<00:00:45.480> compared<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> 6

surprised me to start off I never saw
any<00:01:18.299> pixels<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.140> course<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.530> very

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
any pixels and that of course is very

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800 
any pixels and that of course is very
good<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.430> colors<00:01:20.729> really<00:01:21.060> came<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> right

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.390 
good the colors really came to the right
and<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> display<00:01:22.439> could<00:01:22.619> get<00:01:22.830> very<00:01:23.130> bright

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and the display could get very bright

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
and the display could get very bright
making<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.150> joy<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.420> use<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.869> device<00:01:25.170> even

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
making it a joy to use the device even

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.859 
making it a joy to use the device even
in<00:01:25.770> direct<00:01:26.070> sunlight<00:01:26.310> only<00:01:26.880> when<00:01:27.420> holding<00:01:27.750> the

phone<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.229> probably<00:01:28.500> end<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.040> covering<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
phone you probably end up covering the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.580 
phone you probably end up covering the
rear<00:01:29.729> facing<00:01:30.030> speakers<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> same<00:01:31.350> issue

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
rear facing speakers it's the same issue

speakers on a 6 plus the sound quality
though<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.829> good<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.430> not<00:01:38.640> impressive<00:01:38.909> but

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
though is good it's not impressive but

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.929 
though is good it's not impressive but
when<00:01:40.200> using<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.650> speakers<00:01:41.159> you'll<00:01:41.460> be<00:01:41.640> happy

it's the biggest upgrade compared to the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.510 
it's the biggest upgrade compared to the
6<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> biggest<00:02:01.710> reason<00:02:02.070> why<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.250> should

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
6 and the biggest reason why you should

6 and the biggest reason why you should
buy<00:02:02.670> these<00:02:02.909> files<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.020> real<00:02:04.170> facing

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
buy these files so it's real facing

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.620 
buy these files so it's real facing
camera<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.860> will<00:02:05.040> find<00:02:05.340> 2<00:02:05.670> 8<00:02:05.909> megapixel

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
camera you will find 2 8 megapixel

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.119 
camera you will find 2 8 megapixel
sensors<00:02:07.079> now<00:02:07.469> because<00:02:07.710> there<00:02:07.829> are<00:02:07.890> two

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
sensors now because there are two

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.830 
sensors now because there are two
sensors<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:09.030> really<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.629> lot<00:02:09.810> of

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
sensors you really have a lot of

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.809 
sensors you really have a lot of
benefits<00:02:10.349> first<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.979> all<00:02:11.099> it's<00:02:11.340> capable<00:02:11.550> of

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
benefits first of all it's capable of

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.390 
benefits first of all it's capable of
capturing<00:02:12.060> more<00:02:12.510> light<00:02:12.750> which<00:02:13.050> is

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
capturing more light which is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.339 
capturing more light which is
Goodwyn<00:02:13.849> being<00:02:14.090> in<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.420> low<00:02:14.629> light<00:02:14.810> condition

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
Goodwyn being in a low light condition

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.380 
Goodwyn being in a low light condition
and<00:02:15.560> result<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.099> there<00:02:16.340> bitch<00:02:16.819> shred<00:02:17.060> talk<00:02:17.239> in

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
and result is there bitch shred talk in

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.180 
and result is there bitch shred talk in
low-light<00:02:17.720> conditions<00:02:18.260> really<00:02:18.590> look<00:02:18.950> very

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
low-light conditions really look very

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.490 
low-light conditions really look very
good<00:02:19.430> now<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.180> course<00:02:20.209> is<00:02:20.540> very<00:02:20.780> cool<00:02:21.110> but

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
good now this of course is very cool but

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.080 
good now this of course is very cool but
the<00:02:21.590> reason<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.040> use<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.400> camera<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:22.879> much

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
the reason I use this camera that much

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.059 
the reason I use this camera that much
is<00:02:23.330> because<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.930> wide<00:02:24.140> aperture<00:02:24.739> feature

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
is because of the wide aperture feature

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.979 
is because of the wide aperture feature
this<00:02:25.700> allows<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.120> focus<00:02:26.420> on<00:02:26.690> something

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
this allows you to focus on something

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.869 
this allows you to focus on something
change<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.709> level<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.040> blur<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.549> take<00:02:28.760> the

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
change the level of blur and take the

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.490 
change the level of blur and take the
picture<00:02:29.239> but<00:02:29.659> here<00:02:29.840> comes<00:02:30.049> the<00:02:30.140> cool<00:02:30.349> thing

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
picture but here comes the cool thing

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.380 
picture but here comes the cool thing
about<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.920> when<00:02:31.489> going<00:02:31.790> back<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.209> picture

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
about it when going back to the picture

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.869 
about it when going back to the picture
you<00:02:32.989> can<00:02:33.019> just<00:02:33.379> completely<00:02:33.769> relay<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.400> focus

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
you can just completely relay the focus

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.430 
you can just completely relay the focus
as<00:02:35.030> well<00:02:35.209> as<00:02:35.329> change<00:02:35.629> the<00:02:35.659> blur<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.049> have<00:02:36.260> on

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
as well as change the blur you have on

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.729 
as well as change the blur you have on
it

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
it

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:37.990 
it
and<00:02:36.829> even<00:02:37.069> though<00:02:37.190> there<00:02:37.370> are<00:02:37.400> some<00:02:37.819> other

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
and even though there are some other

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.850 
and even though there are some other
apps<00:02:38.269> in<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.659> Google<00:02:38.690> Play<00:02:39.079> Store<00:02:39.140> which<00:02:39.530> let

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
apps in the Google Play Store which let

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.710 
apps in the Google Play Store which let
you<00:02:40.010> do<00:02:40.190> sort<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.670> same<00:02:40.819> thing<00:02:40.879> it<00:02:41.420> still

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
you do sort of the same thing it still

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.630 
you do sort of the same thing it still
impressed<00:02:42.079> me<00:02:42.260> because<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:43.190> just<00:02:43.400> have<00:02:43.549> to

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
impressed me because you just have to

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.979 
impressed me because you just have to
take<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.909> picture<00:02:44.239> without<00:02:44.360> having<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.900> do

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
take the picture without having to do

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.140 
take the picture without having to do
anything<00:02:45.440> extra<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:46.040> if<00:02:46.459> this<00:02:46.609> all<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.970> not

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
anything extra and if this all is not

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.270 
anything extra and if this all is not
enough<00:02:47.420> yet<00:02:47.629> there<00:02:48.170> still<00:02:48.530> are<00:02:48.769> a<00:02:48.799> bunch<00:02:49.190> of

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
enough yet there still are a bunch of

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.130 
enough yet there still are a bunch of
other<00:02:49.459> settings<00:02:49.910> in<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.299> easy-to-understand

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
other settings in the easy-to-understand

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.140 
other settings in the easy-to-understand
camera<00:02:51.500> app<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:51.920> just<00:02:51.950> really<00:02:52.700> enjoyed<00:02:52.940> using

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
camera app I just really enjoyed using

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.970 
camera app I just really enjoyed using
the<00:02:53.420> camera<00:02:53.690> on<00:02:53.750> 6<00:02:54.049> plus<00:02:54.260> because<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.799> wide

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
the camera on 6 plus because of the wide

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.309

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
still go on for quite some time these

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.920 
still go on for quite some time these
were<00:04:25.610> just<00:04:25.789> the<00:04:25.940> ones<00:04:25.969> I<00:04:26.240> like<00:04:26.419> the<00:04:26.450> most

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.730 
did it kept performing like when it was
cool<00:05:01.820> so<00:05:02.389> in<00:05:02.509> the<00:05:02.660> end<00:05:02.810> is<00:05:03.050> it<00:05:03.259> worth<00:05:03.470> its<00:05:03.680> price

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740
