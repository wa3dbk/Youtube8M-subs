 from her Safety Kate or does not need him 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.250
 that is probably the biggest problem of founding which new prospectus 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.150
 Weather warning has interest and a topic 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.199
 in this case camping 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.199
 Welcome to the site of Fabrizio 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.759
 Many things always start with the new track leading what 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:29.440
 developed 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.800
 and, above all, how Stone seeks to procure brochures in large numbers 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.920
 to rise and to leaf through 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.890
 This is the same with camping 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.980
 so I have with many 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.150
 People only friend still asked from me the people asked 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.870
 8 30 years of camping can help me on what I have to look out for 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.230
 do not buy in the apartment and the like 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.200
 Of course he always likes to know where I am 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.400
 to help or to be able to do 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.730
 as a musician I'm just so what 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.970
 there not even leisure Kemper because no profile's professional fights of course 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.630
 Not 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.590
 but barely over the years Kanisch and claim that I 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.590
 have experienced some things and the BZ to be able to 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.530
 the Guinness important tips 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.590
 first of all this is about caravans 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.060
 and there is Trier Koblenz for caravans 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.230
 but we come to later 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.460
 this actually only it was an introductory video so first know 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.210
 what is going on here 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.340
 now that he is the question of course 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.830
 Camping yes or no everyone has to decide for themselves 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.710
 and because you are starting now 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.130
 Do you want it does not change the next question if I know the makers 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.800
 Water always knows how to legally do tent camping 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.330
 in the caravan in the camper 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.890
 what comes to me to pieces of various possibilities something 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.650
 close 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.000
 just buying a tent is one thing in itself the VAG mixed one 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.560
 leave the wallet 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.750
 It is the same with housing 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.540
 about housing, of course, that the whole maintenance costs and 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.970
 similar things to look out for 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.930
 I have myself last year 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.519
 bought a new apartment 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.930
 and it will be here I had to rebuild some things because easy 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.789
 Percent my needs or requirements for a caravan 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.889
 and the simplification and camping 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.919
 Of course, I also had changes on every occasion 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.409
 planned 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:29.189
 and percent would have to give the winning side more or less tips percent 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.419
 which makes certain things easier 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.369
 because, as I said, these schools are always big leaflets 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:38.279
 the most possible at prices percent being more common thing also cheaper 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.289
 simplified but can parry or can change 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.879
 Process as an electrician or similar 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.189
 but beware who has no idea about gateProtect in terms of bird price drivers 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:49.919
 Electrical 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.419
 certainly not at that to watch out for equipment 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.059
 Since he always had a consultant, we want to on the a9 of NATO to one 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.019
 Friend who knows it 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.840
 "It's still too easy just to warm up when you're living on it 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.279
 public terrain stands 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.479
 where others are standing around 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.829
 and if anything happens there it is not so good that we all want 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.899
 Not 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.949
 very brief instruction to the question remains 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:16.159
 Camping year 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.099
 Well, once you've decided to go camping it's relative 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.199
 easy 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.369
 and ever 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:25.159
 the only borders most of them really start with a tent 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:28.609
 Percent awaken the next of his youth to the children 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.009
 At that time we also wanted to camp my friend or neighbor 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.939
 there are some already the first standing experience 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.129
 if it goes on to the family afterwards 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.269
 maybe it is already appropriate 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.040
 The once to buy a caravan or a camper comes 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.799
 Of course, it's about length on a place 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.459
 or is on the move because we see something of the world the two-parter there 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.609
 Two-parter Dark Void Michels 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.649
 Of course, there is the motorhome 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:58.939
 In general you have to say that campers under the caravan the 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.519
 Infant interiors and all the things you call courageous 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.049
 actually identical 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.809
 it comes even the vehicle itself also an apartment has the advantage one 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:08.739
 damage 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.919
 the towing vehicle had the case the car around can take a look at everything 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.639
 drive away without problems at the apartment remains firmly Mainburger one 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.340
 just the problem 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.389
 from my point of view if you are there on site though 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.729
 One wants to question Opel here last Isotow degree or author percent 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.029
 additional masts would be meaningless mostly traded bicycles with 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:33.239
 But in order to cope with further damage you would have the motorhome then 

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:35.050
 back to life and is a thing in itself 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.469
 I personally 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:41.129
 peacefully did not include the caravan because that was easy for 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.620
 me 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.660
 The best solution is that you have to decide for yourself in court 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:51.139
 short introduction sound short story I hope I have a lot on my side 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.169
 fun 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.240
 it would be nice if you have questions and also the others at the shipyard 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.279
 Percentage as primary it is also irritated down in the percent 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:01.999
 comments 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:03.029
 and around 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:06.909
 just then I could have picked up questions or answered questions 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.770
 show something 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.840
 In percentages can often work also what is to be respected 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.389
 I have something next to buy the caravans over time 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.860
 What do I have to look out for? What's wrong with her? 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.849
 and then what these women of course have nothing at all camper 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.419
 who less will this site be edited where I am there where mobile 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.740
 Technically there is a lot of experience 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.870
 I'll say that in a minute 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.450
 I can count to Massa and I can tell you by caravan 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:37.349
 help 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.960
 and I hope that's percent of what you guys are 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.960
 wanted to learn 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.310
 because otherwise to be in Soldos crucial housing or a convertible in the world 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.309
 then welcome to the family of campers 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:51.309
 or maybe you know each other in October and a camping place 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.639
 Percent if he already had to stay where I drive anyway 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.300
 there it is very beautiful for me personally 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.930
 being beautiful and and Max 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.949
 There are places in Germany surrounding foreign countries 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:06.889
 where you can spend wonderful holidays 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.030
 then in the church that's fun Venier catalogs continue to adorn victims 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.719
 times the prices now center is going through some miracles and also 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:16.610
 frightening what that costs 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.009
 Percent requires but again and again if so what things to buy it is 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:24.300
 Further it was said Euro as a smaller is convinced that no 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.680
 Mass production is 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.680
 Still, you can say you can do some things that are cheaper 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:31.409
 around 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:34.050
 and also the topic safety returns again 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.779
 if we could the area maybe 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.900
 "These are the club clutch brake systems 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.880
 The one at the beginning of the primary school grows percent was earlier there in one 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.880
 so-called big worked hard over two hours 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:49.960
 it has not been around for quite some time now or maybe it still exists 

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:52.979
 but is never used anymore because of that these strengthening systems are the ones 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.580
 currently there 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.870
 «Inter - where normal photos show the picture that we are far stronger 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.460
 promoted 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.610
 Wimmer is cooking 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.919
 To see Peter 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.240
 but that has the advantage Luczak the Parc the car Mor car 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:12.500
 and then with integrated system simply activate braking system 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.720
 and thus a being is given stability in a ride with the 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.659
 caravan 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:21.529
 because that is not insignificant from my place of residence on what you have to 

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:23.649
 Make sure it does not start to roll 

00:07:23.649 --> 00:07:27.239
 Blatter in a preschool see a4 pages in the apartment on the highway 

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:32.649
 then we are first as I said a lot of fun 

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:35.749
 and percent I hope we see each other again on this site 

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:38.389
 and I'll try it was all topics gradually 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:39.830
 abzuhandeln 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.900
 that co2 buying his caravan on what should I pay attention 

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:47.330
 and then I show you a few quirks where often 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.279
 pay attention that Russia can be done and and 

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:53.409
 as the first full-length beauty day and until next time
