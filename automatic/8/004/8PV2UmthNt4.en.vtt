00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.840
 hello friends of 'not yourself mexico this 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.330
 it's our first video we're going to 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.600
 show how to give a different touch to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.550
 our home by using pictures 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.070
 of cloth 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.070
 let's show them what material is 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.500
 you use and in what way you can do 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.840
 how can you do it 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.630
 same 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.080
 what material are we going to use to make 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.700
 our theme paintings first 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.960
 wooden bars with bars 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.050
 15-millimeter squares or 150 meters 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.829
 High 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.790
 arch and described as a bra fastener for 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.410
 cut wood a bra and a table 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.949
 of work to hold the wood and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:59.100
 make the cuts 4 white glue 5 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:03.989
 daughters for wood 6 electrical tape 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:10.140
 etesa meters 7 a stapler the noises 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:13.590
 for furniture 8 room staples 16 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.220
 millimeters and 9 the fabric to cover 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.220
 our paintings 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.259
 this is what we are going to need to 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.259
 make our plaid fabric 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.789
 first of all let's do our 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.280
 frames for each frame we will use 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:37.469
 very split wooden bars 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:41.149
 15 millimeter squares by one meter 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:44.159
 50 high a cut of 30 is made 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.549
 centimeters is going to do four 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.189
 cuts of 30 centimeters in moment to 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.230
 show them how to make the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.960
 cuts 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.110
 in this case I have the frame made 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.600
 but what will the next do the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.080
 wooden bar grabbing the first 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.680
 wooden stick and perform the measurement of 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.310
 30 centimeters place it on the shore 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.990
 that you can from your work goal and go 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:21.590
 to use the bra so you do not 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.590
 move both the wood and do not leave chueca 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.470
 This is the bra that I speak 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.600
 only turn the turnstile in the 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.960
 bottom to fit the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.960
 measure 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.720
 they can go using the first cut that 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.290
 they did as a measure for others 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.290
 cuts 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.760
 so that the ends of each of the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.560
 cuts that is the best possible 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.519
 That's when you use the sandpaper 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.519
 for wood 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.660
 very useful for each end 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.320
 because that way there will be a 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.320
 a little bit better 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.549
 to join each of the corners of 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.969
 our framework what we are going to do is what 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:12.599
 next first of all let's go a 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:17.349
 little bit of what is the white glue 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:20.409
 and on top of that we are going to use a 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:23.579
 staple can be one or can be two 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.579
 as you prefer 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.660
 We are going to do this for each of 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.470
 the corners and for both sides of 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.840
 our framework is to say since we finished 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.120
 each of the four corners 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.830
 we flip the frame and do the same thing again 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.550
 same 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.830
 we give some white glue and 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.660
 we put what the staples are like 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.600
 you fix the staples to give 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.709
 put it in such a way that they can 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:00.700
 live each of the bars 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:03.269
 if you notice the staple crosses between 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.269
 the two bars 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.990
 for this we use our recorder 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:15.480
 the 6-millimeter gratings a quarter and 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.480
 what is the white glue 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.110
 after they've seen all the 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.710
 corners of your frame that you have left 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:27.370
 Check frame on a surface 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.800
 flat that the frame has no game is 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.980
 say do not get up from any of the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.520
 sides if that were to happen what 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.940
 can do is put something that has 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.880
 some weight during a good amount 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.490
 of minutes can be some time two 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:50.400
 hours so that you can and if at 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.400
 final no longer have movement the box 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:56.559
 This process can take around 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.559
 an hour or so 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:05.180
 the fabric they are going to buy for their 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.639
 pictures should be of the thick 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.900
 only one detail commented on first 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.820
 Place of asking one meter cloth 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.840
 second place when they do the 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:20.509
 cut they do not totally straight by 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:26.560
 So here we will give them a click away 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:26.560
 that this square fits its web 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.550
 of the part of the shore and that they 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:36.940
 made the cut will take what is 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.560
 one of the threads that protrudes 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.560
 and you're going to start stretching 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:53.409
 is letting go and if you notice 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:56.289
 being marked if we are marked and 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:58.479
 what you are allocating in this way 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.289
 you are going to grab your scissors and go 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:03.479
 shorten 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.479
 enrich from that brand the thread 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.570
 and 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.990
 there they are making the cut for the 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.990
 mask 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.100
 and here they are going to do us 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.240
 until it is finished, not all the cloth 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.620
 there the brand remains 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:33.880
 they are going to make the cut 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:38.280
 in this way at the end 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.790
 sutel to auction the lechita well 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.790
 okay 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.669
 it was time to cut our topic 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:49.669
 for this we are going to do it from the 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:53.360
 next way first of all we put 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:55.819
 our activity on the back and above 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.120
 let's put our frame that already 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:58.120
 we did 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.360
 first of all the frame goes with what 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.920
 that is going to be placed at five centimeters 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.920
 from one of the banks 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:14.400
 here we are going to do it for each of 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.919
 the rods at the top you 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.159
 let's give 5 centimeters and we're going to 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.159
 mark 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.569
 and brand 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.470
 we mark the shoulder 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:32.409
 will not have 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:44.149
 m 

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:44.149
 we are seeing 

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.860
 by rodrigo 

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.300
 let's divide the explanation in two 

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:14.790
 on how to make wooden pictures 

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.790
 until here we arrive with the first part
