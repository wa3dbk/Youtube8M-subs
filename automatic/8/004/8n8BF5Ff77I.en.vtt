00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.979
 it's called cybers or apache x 1 are the just presented here in the fight 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:18.720
 2009 and already has all the points to become one of the most 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.080
 interesting of this edition and is that although it may seem a compact is a 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.170
 long more than eight shots one is endowed with 20 increases this ax x1 is the 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.860
 first sonic comparsa in corcoran ponce moss 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.310
 with technology this 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.390
 what is quite good is not everything is that there is not much to say 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.780
 this towel to what already seen in previous diverse 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.880
 the same penalties of benefits are maintained including the screen 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.429
 3 inch folding 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:46.229
 which is one of the details that we most unfortunately like another detail that 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.889
 I like very much missing that is the revolving vial after praising eighths 

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:50.530
 for 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.110
 four commands a little bit more is difficult to handle fortunately 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.630
 we have a new rear road which also has the option of pulsation and 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.160
 As you can see if we are going to work with manual adjustments 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.090
 example can be really useful 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.890
 novelties to be wanted, not because we started with the most obvious and is the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.400
 Optical traveling sum 20 increases answering optical viewfinder 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:11.920
 this notice 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.780
 I must walk from the table of the camera that 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.210
 classic carl zeiss disappears that percent uses two are in the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.880
 most of its compact stern by a the type objective 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.259
 if it is a type of optics that up to now it has been possible to see in some 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.649
 sony cameras and also 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.850
 in founding tall lady of goals for her kick and thales 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.180
 no doubt the main novelty the main asset of starz x 1 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.650
 these new topics d is not negative cc that clarify that it is about luce 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.500
 smaller is the type of sensor that is commonly used in 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.899
 compact cameras and did not stop of type ap st 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.340
 reserved for recitals of your friend of any other brand 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.550
 What's new that brings advantages descent I respect the coup 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.690
 of cd 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.440
 some days we still can not talk is to say the sony promise us 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.540
 that is improving the performance so sensitive sometimes is a prototype like this 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.100
 that you have not yet been able to verify 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.070
 yes we know it is so for example the h x1 pass the first compact cameras 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.340
 that is going to have finished high resolution video 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.419
 30 milko and 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.039
 another of the great advantages of the great arguments that this 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.870
 sensor of mos 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.449
 is the speed is proven to only have 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.259
 of a mechanical shutter instead of the other reader and like many others 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:21.099
 compact i in its quick reform mode allows you to shoot 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.559
 the frames per second with a limit to massa resolution with a 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:29.359
 limit of 10 photos not only to 60 photos per second that allows for example the 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:30.829
 casio exilim that f1 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.829
 but the truth is that it is not bad 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.930
 but that there will be no solutions for leisure that is able to offer these 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.320
 problems in the x 1 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.990
 is to have a very spectacular feature listed as Swiss panorama what 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.350
 allows you to create a panoramic image from a high-speed shot 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.350
 in rafah 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.569
 José can see the eyes of Andrea, but above 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.499
 it works more foolishly fast just second we have the 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.499
 panoramic created what if we check 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.099
 that this very well united 2 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.960
 for now limited catalog of compact cameras that instead of windows sensor 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.260
 ccd use others 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.440
 since there were no inhabitants the sony cyber soto ax x1 of brown bazán declared 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.000
 smiling that arrives willing to stand up to the canon is x 1 that also 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.220
 they use concepts 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.870
 so far only missing 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.430
 it was welded 9 to pixels an angular zoom of sale increased quite spectacular 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.840
 high definition video 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.670
 and the bursts and a panoramic mode that the truth that is what has most 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.939
 liked in fact let's keep trying
