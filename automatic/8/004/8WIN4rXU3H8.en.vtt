00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.080
 year 2013 in steam and now the guys from 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.740
 tm clinker have brought it to us 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.740
 Playstation 4 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.590
 good 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.619
 it's a survival sandbox 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.539
 where we will start driving wilson 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.349
 a scientist who has been transported 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.349
 for a mysterious world 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.300
 we will have to start picking 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.070
 objects that will seem to us of little 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.620
 how stones can be important 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.420
 branches and berries among other things with 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.490
 that we can make our own 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.380
 tools and cooking our food in 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.900
 the time we will discover that nothing is so 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.150
 simple as it seems from the first 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.500
 moment where the player is free 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.500
 to do what he wants 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.970
 there are no tutorials to tell us that 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.920
 we have to do the absence of 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.410
 tutorials is replaced by a small 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.390
 Object manufacturing menu lts list 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.190
 the objects that we can build and the 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.270
 materials and necessary tools 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.100
 for it 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.170
 in the world in which we are 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.909
 surviving will not be an easy task since 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.859
 we can die in different ways 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.679
 depending on our level of health 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:26.899
 hunger and sanity when the night falls 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.549
 to survive we should not stay 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.770
 Dark anxiety with the absence of light 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.479
 we will be attacked by beings that 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.939
 seem or will only attack us in the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.649
 darkness the difficulty of the game is 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.420
 focuses on the fact that worlds are generated 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.219
 random way so no 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.869
 game will be the same as the previous one and 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.819
 because when our life comes to its 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.979
 end we must start again except 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.869
 in the case that we have activated an altar 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.149
 that will bring life back to a unique 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.640
 time or making use of advanced objects 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.500
 prior to our death if the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.450
 difficulty seems to us the right one for 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.399
 our level of game you can modify 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.200
 some options before you start to 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.450
 make your experience then be 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.280
 simpler or more intense depending 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.509
 of the modifications that you do before 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.509
 that your world is generated 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.500
 besides the way in which we started 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.350
 we can access the adventure mode to 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.910
 through the maxwell gate the mode 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.370
 adventure we will have to go through a 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.230
 total of 5 worlds to go through each of 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.300
 one of them we will have to find several 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.140
 objects that will open the doors to us 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.140
 next world 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.460
 we can manage a total of 8 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.790
 characters each with their own 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.790
 characteristics 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.400
 to unlock we must win 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.170
 experience points accumulating days 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.640
 over lived or meet certain 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.830
 requirements during our adventure 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.270
 the adaptation of the controls to the tube 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.980
 to the sacral shock with respect to those of the 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.319
 steam vision has been good since 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.240

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.400
 difficulty at the graphic level or start tone 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.250

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.600
 his drawn designs endorsed 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.760
 note that it is not dubbed into Spanish 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.650
 so we should play it in English 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.870
 although the simplicity of the language used 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.350
 in the game will not cause problems to the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.350
 time to play 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.720
