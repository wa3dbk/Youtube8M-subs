00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.300 
aspects in judging market steers is
certainly<00:03:50.290> have<00:03:50.500> got<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.740> have<00:03:50.860> possible

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
certainly have got to have possible

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.620 
certainly have got to have possible
because<00:03:51.490> that's<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.850> product<00:03:52.090> of<00:03:52.480> the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
because that's the product of the

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.750 
because that's the product of the
marketing<00:03:53.140> you've<00:03:53.920> got<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:54.190> have<00:03:54.310> some<00:03:54.580> degree

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
marketing you've got to have some degree

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.210 
marketing you've got to have some degree
of<00:03:54.940> finish<00:03:55.390> so<00:03:55.660> hopefully<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.200> Kalalau<00:03:56.560> will

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
of finish so hopefully the Kalalau will

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.980 
of finish so hopefully the Kalalau will
get<00:03:57.370> closer<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:57.940> choice<00:03:58.180> great<00:03:58.630> or<00:03:58.840> better

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
get closer to the choice great or better

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.310 
get closer to the choice great or better
because<00:04:00.150> certainly<00:04:01.150> were<00:04:01.360> a<00:04:01.420> quality<00:04:01.990> product

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
because certainly were a quality product

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.590 
because certainly were a quality product
and<00:04:02.830> I<00:04:02.980> think<00:04:03.340> that's<00:04:03.520> what<00:04:03.700> brides<00:04:04.030> repeat

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
and I think that's what brides repeat

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.390 
and I think that's what brides repeat
business<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.290> quality<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.070> needing

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
business and quality and needing

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.610 
business and quality and needing
experience<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:07.870> think<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:08.170> go<00:04:08.320> along<00:04:08.590> with

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
experience and I think to go along with

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.440 
experience and I think to go along with
that<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.220> have<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.550> battle<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:10.060> have<00:04:10.210> enough

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
that you have that battle to have enough

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.830 
that you have that battle to have enough
body<00:04:10.890> enough<00:04:11.890> depth<00:04:12.280> enough<00:04:13.120> capacity<00:04:13.330> to

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
body enough depth enough capacity to

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.840 
body enough depth enough capacity to
have<00:04:14.110> some<00:04:14.320> performance<00:04:14.920> but<00:04:15.640> that's

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
have some performance but that's

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.620 
have some performance but that's
certainly<00:04:16.050> conversion<00:04:17.050> cost<00:04:17.320> again

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
certainly conversion cost again

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.990 
certainly conversion cost again
very<00:04:18.780> important<00:04:19.350> equation<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:20.760> think

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
very important equation and I think

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.670 
very important equation and I think
fourthly<00:04:21.420> you've<00:04:22.080> got<00:04:22.230> to<00:04:22.320> have<00:04:22.440> some

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
fourthly you've got to have some

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.560 
fourthly you've got to have some
structural<00:04:23.130> practice<00:04:23.640> because<00:04:24.060> for<00:04:24.450> those

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
structural practice because for those

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.440 
structural practice because for those
that<00:04:24.950> don't<00:04:25.950> think<00:04:26.250> that<00:04:26.400> structure<00:04:27.000> impacts

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
that don't think that structure impacts

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.410 
that don't think that structure impacts
performance<00:04:27.780> with<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.980> long<00:04:29.220> night<00:04:29.670> that's<00:04:30.240> how

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
performance with a long night that's how

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.410 
performance with a long night that's how
truth<00:04:30.780> we<00:04:31.050> did<00:04:31.230> say<00:04:31.520> unfortunately<00:04:32.520> is<00:04:33.090> last

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
truth we did say unfortunately is last

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.480 
truth we did say unfortunately is last
year<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.020> do<00:04:34.170> think<00:04:34.530> what<00:04:34.740> if<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.220> would

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
year so I do think what if that would

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.700 
year so I do think what if that would
have<00:04:35.670> been<00:04:35.910> very<00:04:36.510> profitable<00:04:36.870> for<00:04:37.260> a<00:04:37.500> while

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
have been very profitable for a while

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.790 
have been very profitable for a while
but<00:04:38.660> structure<00:04:39.660> is<00:04:39.780> important<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.470> think<00:04:40.500> it's

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
but structure is important I think it's

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.500 
but structure is important I think it's
important<00:04:41.220> that<00:04:41.250> markets<00:04:41.700> do<00:04:41.880> is<00:04:42.180> like<00:04:42.360> an

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
important that markets do is like an

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.760 
important that markets do is like an
ingredient<00:04:42.870> cabinet

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
ingredient cabinet

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.230 
ingredient cabinet
so<00:04:44.040> that's<00:04:44.220> what<00:04:44.400> we've<00:04:44.610> attempted<00:04:44.730> to<00:04:45.060> do

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
so that's what we've attempted to do

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.120 
so that's what we've attempted to do
today<00:04:45.390> there's<00:04:45.810> been<00:04:46.020> some<00:04:46.230> trade-off<00:04:46.710> you

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
today there's been some trade-off you

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.130 
today there's been some trade-off you
know<00:04:47.580> times<00:04:47.850> have<00:04:48.030> changed<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.780> where<00:04:48.960> we

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
know times have changed and where we

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.300 
know times have changed and where we
what's<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.920> right<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:50.370> wait<00:04:50.580> on

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.809 

most<00:04:53.879> laxative<00:04:54.449> discount<00:04:55.229> for<00:04:56.069> carcasses<00:04:56.610> and

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
most laxative discount for carcasses and

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.909 
most laxative discount for carcasses and
what<00:04:56.970> stay<00:04:57.150> over<00:04:57.419> a<00:04:57.449> thousand<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.259> in<00:04:58.710> some

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
what stay over a thousand and in some

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.070 
what stay over a thousand and in some
instances<00:04:59.430> some<00:04:59.490> part<00:04:59.940> sometimes<00:05:00.539> the

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
instances some part sometimes the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.450 
instances some part sometimes the
factory<00:05:01.530> should<00:05:01.590> pick<00:05:01.860> that<00:05:01.889> up<00:05:02.069> there<00:05:02.370> the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
factory should pick that up there the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.119 
factory should pick that up there the
balance<00:05:02.849> and<00:05:03.000> 50<00:05:03.419> I<00:05:03.840> think<00:05:04.139> the<00:05:04.470> curious<00:05:04.889> part

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
balance and 50 I think the curious part

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.399 
balance and 50 I think the curious part
always<00:05:05.490> is<00:05:05.669> on<00:05:05.879> these<00:05:06.030> markets<00:05:06.300> tears<00:05:06.750> or

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
always is on these markets tears or

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.309 
always is on these markets tears or
things<00:05:07.680> every<00:05:07.919> way<00:05:08.099> and<00:05:08.669> as<00:05:09.659> you<00:05:09.840> go<00:05:10.020> through

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
things every way and as you go through

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.040 
things every way and as you go through
these<00:05:10.590> you<00:05:10.770> judge<00:05:11.039> or<00:05:11.430> try<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.639> evaluate<00:05:12.539> that

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
these you judge or try to evaluate that

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.260 
these you judge or try to evaluate that
as<00:05:13.259> you<00:05:13.440> go<00:05:13.620> but<00:05:14.310> again<00:05:14.580> it's<00:05:14.729> going<00:05:14.940> to<00:05:15.030> place

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
as you go but again it's going to place

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.309 
as you go but again it's going to place
here<00:05:15.539> I<00:05:15.599> think<00:05:15.960> steer<00:05:16.919> shows<00:05:17.159> are<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.490> lot<00:05:17.699> of

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 
here I think steer shows are a lot of

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.809 
here I think steer shows are a lot of
there<00:05:19.319> something<00:05:20.099> that<00:05:20.220> I've<00:05:20.340> always<00:05:20.610> enjoyed

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
there something that I've always enjoyed

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.339 
there something that I've always enjoyed
with<00:05:21.300> on<00:05:21.419> and<00:05:21.690> again<00:05:21.930> if<00:05:22.080> you've<00:05:22.229> got<00:05:22.259> a

with on and again if you've got a

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:22.820 
with on and again if you've got a
pleasure

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
pleasure

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.890 
pleasure
