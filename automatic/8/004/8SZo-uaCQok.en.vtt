 he 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.800
 nissan is back on the segment of 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.510
 compact sedans with the pulsar a 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.960
 sedan that has big ambitions in 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.150
 Europe 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.380
 little tour of the owner before 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.380
 try it at the next school year 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.110
 the pulsar adopts the stylistic codes 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.840
 recent nissan le vichy is there 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.220
 as on the qashqai and the x-trail he 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.440
 starts with ribs that 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.059
 go through the hood they meet on 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.149
 the grille forming the boomerang 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.860
 chrome that surrounds the logo the grille 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.269
 Honeycomb still leaves the face 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.269
 before and joins the two fires 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.060
 we are dealing with a nissan this 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.190
 impression is confirmed by the back 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.450
 with fires there again close to those 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.450
 qashqai for example 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.740
 the success of qashqai this new 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.940
 pulsar should be at least 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.940
 aesthetically found his audience 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.079
 the interior plays on the materials and 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.710
 the shapes to draw something 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.450
 flattering 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.450
 although relatively basic 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.670
 miss and especially that you are equipments and 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.470
 life aboard this nissan pulsar 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.980
 should seek to stand out from the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.580
 competition 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.950
 a chest of 380 liters a wheelbase 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.000
 of 2 meters 70 the pulsar promises to 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.000
 pamper the passengers 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.479
 to judge on pieces it will take 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.549
 wait until September for 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.999
 the life-size test of this nissan 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.999
