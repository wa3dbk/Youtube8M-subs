00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.439
 welcome more people possible 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:13.669
 these tests he weaves with a royal course of particularly areas 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.669
 technical and sometimes even somewhat dangerous 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.609
 all competitors are for him 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.449

 philip crowley winner in 96 was intent on this year's 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.090
 reissue his performance because even if this test 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.250
 but no championship 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.990
 it enjoys international notoriety it justifies more all 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.960
 revealed hanging on his record 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.350
 the central commission 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.350
 Passenger successes more efficient 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.770
 unfortunately for him the area of ​​the waterfall will be fatal 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.750
 finish third 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.970
 for almost everything 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.920
 service men in london footsie 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.290
 by making very few mistakes 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.060
 but in the area of ​​tree trunks here but we will see its reception and loses 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.830
 all hope of victory 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.140
 a shame because he showed a good mastery in the many 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.210
 traps of bercy 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.929
 going to 0 in the waterfall the most difficult area of ​​the summer 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.600
 carissimi so 2nd at six points behind his compatriot double origin 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.430
 Only 22 years old it is a list of winners already largely 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.790
 is reigning world champion and incidentally winner of the edition 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.250
 97 basswood bercy 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.660
 as always his father martinho 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.430
 World Champion in 75 is at his side to advise him the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.740
 encourage a personal pair 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740
 the proof 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.190
 but when the man who puts you down 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.539
 it's because he does not have a choice and he prefers to score a point 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.539
 and remember his passing demonstration 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.559
 an exit that allows him to win for the second time 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:25.609
 consecutive 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.799
 a victory or the man who has not impressed by his serenity 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.919
 they will be so needed it was the favorite of this season 98
