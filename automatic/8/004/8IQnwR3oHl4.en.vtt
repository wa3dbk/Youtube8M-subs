we have different methods for trimming

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.420 
we have different methods for trimming

your<00:00:44.370> joke<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:46.140> reason<00:00:46.470> why<00:00:46.589> we<00:00:46.800> train<00:00:47.040> is

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
your joke the reason why we train is

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.060 
your joke the reason why we train is
that<00:00:47.790> we<00:00:48.570> want<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> cancel<00:00:49.050> out<00:00:49.350> any<00:00:49.650> control

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
that we want to cancel out any control

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.060 
that we want to cancel out any control
forces<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.780> trim<00:00:52.019> for<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> certain

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
forces and we trim for a certain

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.479 
forces and we trim for a certain
airspeed<00:00:53.549> and<00:00:53.790> frost<00:00:54.239> setting<00:00:54.979> if<00:00:55.979> your<00:00:56.220> plane

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
move in the opposite direction if you

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.280 
move in the opposite direction if you
want<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.799> trim<00:01:02.010> nose<00:01:02.309> up<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.449> trim<00:01:03.659> tab<00:01:03.900> will

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
want to trim nose up the trim tab will

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.149 
want to trim nose up the trim tab will
move<00:01:04.470> down<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.670> elevator<00:01:06.060> will<00:01:06.659> move<00:01:06.900> up

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
move down and the elevator will move up

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.910 
move down and the elevator will move up
if<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.340> want<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> trim<00:01:08.850> nose<00:01:09.240> down<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:10.680> tab

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
if you want to trim nose down the tab

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.740 
if you want to trim nose down the tab
moves<00:01:11.549> up<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.119> elevator<00:01:13.049> moves<00:01:13.770> down<00:01:14.040> the

moves up and elevator moves down the
negative<00:01:15.750> side<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.189> will<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:17.340> less

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
negative side is that you will have less

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.399 
negative side is that you will have less
control<00:01:18.150> Authority<00:01:19.049> more<00:01:19.979> drag<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:21.110> also<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
control Authority more drag and also a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.850 
control Authority more drag and also a
less<00:01:22.650> CD<00:01:23.130> range<00:01:23.510> if<00:01:24.510> your<00:01:25.050> airplane<00:01:25.590> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
less CD range if your airplane is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.210 
less CD range if your airplane is
equipped<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:27.090> stabilizer<00:01:27.750> or<00:01:28.140> an<00:01:28.890> oil

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
equipped with a stabilizer or an oil

equipped with a stabilizer or an oil
moving<00:01:29.460> tail<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:31.110> entire<00:01:31.440> surface<00:01:31.800> will<00:01:32.460> move

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
moving tail the entire surface will move

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.800 
moving tail the entire surface will move
and<00:01:33.170> your<00:01:34.170> angle<00:01:34.620> of<00:01:34.710> incidence<00:01:35.159> will<00:01:35.340> change

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
and your angle of incidence will change

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.230 
and your angle of incidence will change
this<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.960> good<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.560> several<00:01:38.130> reasons<00:01:38.580> for

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
this is good for several reasons for

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.360 
this is good for several reasons for
example<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.870> will<00:01:40.050> have<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.230> larger<00:01:40.710> CG<00:01:41.100> range

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
example we will have a larger CG range

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.030 
example we will have a larger CG range
we<00:01:41.940> will<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.210> less<00:01:42.510> drag<00:01:42.870> and<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.920> will

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
we will have less drag and you will

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.370 
we will have less drag and you will
always<00:01:44.370> have<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.730> same<00:01:44.970> control<00:01:45.540> Authority

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
always have the same control Authority

if we climb with we y we will have a

if we climb with we y we will have a
better<00:05:35.409> rate<00:05:35.740> of<00:05:35.770> climb<00:05:36.219> and<00:05:36.520> a<00:05:36.879> higher

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.089 
better rate of climb and a higher

better rate of climb and a higher

airspeed the best climb speed V Y for a

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.230 
airspeed the best climb speed V Y for a
jet<00:05:43.240> is<00:05:43.509> minimum<00:05:44.349> drag<00:05:44.800> speed<00:05:45.159> and<00:05:45.370> for<00:05:46.210> a

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
jet is minimum drag speed and for a

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.779 
jet is minimum drag speed and for a
propeller<00:05:46.719> it<00:05:46.960> is<00:05:47.229> one<00:05:47.620> point<00:05:47.889> one<00:05:48.099> multiplied

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
propeller it is one point one multiplied

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.559

by<00:05:48.819> the<00:05:49.779> stall<00:05:49.990> speed<00:05:50.669> it's<00:05:51.669> also<00:05:51.939> important

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:52.569 
by the stall speed it's also important

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.019 
by the stall speed it's also important
to<00:05:52.629> know<00:05:52.839> that<00:05:53.139> you<00:05:54.039> will<00:05:54.129> have<00:05:54.339> a<00:05:54.370> better<00:05:54.669> rate

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:55.029 
to know that you will have a better rate

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:57.959 
to know that you will have a better rate
of<00:05:55.060> climb<00:05:55.479> in<00:05:55.779> a<00:05:55.930> clean<00:05:56.169> configuration<00:05:56.969> flaps

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 
of climb in a clean configuration flaps

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.240 
of climb in a clean configuration flaps
is<00:05:58.360> good<00:05:58.599> to<00:05:58.930> reduce<00:05:59.259> your<00:05:59.409> takeoff<00:05:59.830> distance

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
is good to reduce your takeoff distance

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.409 
is good to reduce your takeoff distance
but<00:06:01.149> will<00:06:01.479> reduce<00:06:01.839> your<00:06:02.020> vertical<00:06:02.439> speed<00:06:02.680> and

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
but will reduce your vertical speed and

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.689 
but will reduce your vertical speed and
if<00:06:04.419> you<00:06:04.629> want<00:06:04.810> to<00:06:04.960> avoid<00:06:05.199> obstacles<00:06:05.589> the<00:06:06.490> best

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
if you want to avoid obstacles the best

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:11.159 
if you want to avoid obstacles the best
speed<00:06:07.060> is<00:06:07.330> best<00:06:08.199> angle<00:06:08.979> of<00:06:09.069> climb<00:06:09.189> speed<00:06:09.810> so<00:06:10.810> I

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
speed is best angle of climb speed so I

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.499 
speed is best angle of climb speed so I
