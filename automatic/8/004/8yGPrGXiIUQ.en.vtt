 offenses and prejudices hidden in the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.410
 anonymity that social networks allow 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.170
 or the distance that promotes some 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.899
 people feel comfortable 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.539
 express any kind of aggression and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.699
 spread of lies hurting the honor and 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.190
 dignity of others 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.660
 a study done in 32 emerging countries 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.239
 one of the main centers of 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.820
 negative about the morality 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.030
 internet open universe of much 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.240
 information at a touch yesterday barriers 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.580
 so it's very censorship comes from the very 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.770
 person comes from the consciousness of the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.930
 people but the internet also helps 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.030
 to educate more and more is used in classrooms 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.670
 class a tool seen as good 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.710
 by 62% of internauts 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.119
 the positive influence of the network extends 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.520
 still for the economy and relations 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.500
 on the internet also affects the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.150
 political agenda in Brazil the last 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.100
 demonstrations were mobilized from 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.380
 of social networks an influence 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.659
 in the opinion of 52% of the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.850
 Brazilians, how's it going? 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.470
 practically all day connected 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.689
 you start to have another vision that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.619
 before it was forced by TV and radio 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.210
 huh 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.490
 and begins to come from other people and are 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.280
 several talking then comes from one side 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.329
 comes from the other of the time when the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.000
 devalued some of the main 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.520
 instruments of education until the days of 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.860
 today of new technologies a lot 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.039
 changed but some real-world rules 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.560
 also worth to the virtual dictation world 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.970
 the ancients that our 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.400
 the mothers or grandmothers spoke I did not speak with 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.690
 no stranger does not accept anything 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.640
 no stranger to this valley 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.030
 This is true for our children. 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.130
 and this is good for us is the act 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.080
 gomide here by twitter this is control 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.880
 of the media william how to regulate not 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.430
 achieve freedom of expression 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.080
 I think it's a complicated issue for me. 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.849
 I think it already has a legal framework for 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.709
 deal with these things that I was going to favor 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.620
 freedom of expression in general 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.630
 including freedom for people to say 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.810
 things you do not agree with 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.670
 if not freedom, then it is like 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.010
 said that the phase is attributed to the suit 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.110
 without even knowing who disagrees with everything 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.720
 What did you say but I will defend until 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.060
 death its right to speak these 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.310
 Anything foolish then I think it has 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.349
 time should not limit or express 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.180
 now there is a legal defamation framework 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.489
 slander that things are better 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.260
 already established and already has a legal 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.810
 This means you have to always come back. 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.160
 there dad's government house to say the 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.160
 that you can and who can not pull 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.970
 portela for 20 years on the internet in Brazil 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.579
 is December of 1995 is therefore in Brazil 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.160
 dissemination was not an issue. 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.440
 in the area of education in the family is now 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.489
 now they're going to have to deal with this if they 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.650
 using a part of it to make offense 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.900
 violence, so you have to get the 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.269
 legal framework together with a process of 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.519
 education in order to prevent 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.680
 what is a technology to support the 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.650
 life becomes an instrument of 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.940
 injured from victim offense now 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.370
 a lot of people who do not surf the 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.280
 internet a part shipwreck 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.190
 so it's not such a banal thing 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.930
 for people to deal with on a daily basis 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.910
 Foreigners Begin to Leave Yemen 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.160
 two weeks of air strikes by the
