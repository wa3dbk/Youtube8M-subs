very heavy floating cabinet on the wall

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.060 
very heavy floating cabinet on the wall
here<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.900> after<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:19.439> take<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> measurements

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
here and after we take the measurements

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.560 
here and after we take the measurements
for<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.189> cutouts<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.939> plumbing<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
for the cutouts of the plumbing in the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.349 
for the cutouts of the plumbing in the
back<00:00:21.720> then<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.380> start<00:00:22.859> attacking<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.400> so

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
back then we can start attacking it so

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.710 
back then we can start attacking it so
that<00:00:24.480> may<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.810> easy<00:00:26.000> we're<00:00:27.000> transferring<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
that may be easy we're transferring the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.150 
that may be easy we're transferring the
measurements<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.439> location<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.099> the

plumbing to the back of the cabinet the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.100 
plumbing to the back of the cabinet the
way<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.120> we're<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> use<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.780> drill

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
way that we're going to use this drill

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.650 
way that we're going to use this drill
is<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:35.219> i'm<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> start<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.390> bit

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
is that i'm going to start the bit

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.780 
is that i'm going to start the bit
through<00:00:37.110> from<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> back<00:00:37.649> side<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.250> then<00:00:38.670> i'm

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
through from the back side and then i'm

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.680 
through from the back side and then i'm
going<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> take<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.239> around<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> other

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
going to take it around to the other

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.959 
going to take it around to the other
side<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.440> actually<00:00:40.739> make<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.070> hole<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.579> that

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
side and actually make the hole and that

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.729 
side and actually make the hole and that
way<00:00:42.239> when<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.719> punch<00:00:43.020> through<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.590> have

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
way when you punch through if you have

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.860 
way when you punch through if you have
any<00:00:43.890> splinters<00:00:44.250> or<00:00:44.640> any<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> wood<00:00:45.239> breaks

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
any splinters or any of the wood breaks

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.720 
any splinters or any of the wood breaks
or<00:00:46.230> cracks<00:00:46.410> off<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.190> can't<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.700> from

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
or cracks off you can't see it from

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.160 
or cracks off you can't see it from
inside<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.149> vanity<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.600> you're<00:00:48.719> hiding<00:00:49.079> in

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
inside the vanity so you're hiding in

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.130 
inside the vanity so you're hiding in
the<00:00:49.289> event

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.740 

okay<00:00:53.920> now<00:00:54.700> we<00:00:54.760> got<00:00:54.970> that<00:00:55.120> started<00:00:55.510> it<00:00:55.630> should

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
okay now we got that started it should

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.819 
okay now we got that started it should
be<00:00:55.840> easier<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.079> pop<00:00:56.320> here<00:00:56.500> from<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.680> other

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
be easier to pop here from the other

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.729 
be easier to pop here from the other
side<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.329> the<00:00:58.420> key<00:00:58.600> with<00:00:58.780> this<00:00:58.960> is<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.410> keep<00:00:59.590> it

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
side so the key with this is to keep it

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.680 
side so the key with this is to keep it
kind<00:00:59.890> of<00:01:00.010> rocking<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.700> rolling<00:01:00.879> as<00:01:01.239> you<00:01:01.360> go<00:01:01.480> in

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
kind of rocking and rolling as you go in

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.510 
kind of rocking and rolling as you go in
all<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:01.900> way<00:01:01.960> that<00:01:02.140> just<00:01:02.230> pulls<00:01:02.559> through<00:01:02.949> ok

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
all the way that just pulls through ok

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.880 
all the way that just pulls through ok
so<00:01:03.910> I'll<00:01:04.059> set<00:01:04.269> it<00:01:04.300> right<00:01:04.510> in<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:05.050> hall<00:01:05.590> we<00:01:05.740> have

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
so I'll set it right in the hall we have

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:14.960 
so I'll set it right in the hall we have
