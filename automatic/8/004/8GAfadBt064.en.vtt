myself doing this you know just kind of

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.560 
myself doing this you know just kind of
using<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> first<00:00:38.430> time<00:00:38.820> very<00:00:39.120> basic

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
using it for the first time very basic

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.840 
using it for the first time very basic
curls<00:00:39.870> actually<00:00:40.620> curls<00:00:40.950> more<00:00:41.280> towards<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
curls actually curls more towards the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.580 
curls actually curls more towards the
middle<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> hair<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.780> then<00:00:42.930> down<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
middle of the hair and then down and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.549 
middle of the hair and then down and
just<00:00:44.070> away<00:00:44.309> from<00:00:44.489> my<00:00:44.610> face<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.690> figured<00:00:46.289> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
just away from my face so I figured I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.200 
just away from my face so I figured I
would<00:00:46.590> film<00:00:46.950> myself<00:00:47.129> using<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.030> first

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
really fast and you know like I said you

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.500 
really fast and you know like I said you
don't<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.519> worry<00:01:05.729> about<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.210> different

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
don't have to worry about the different

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.510 
don't have to worry about the different
temperatures<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.350> simple<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.280> off

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
temperatures it's just simple on and off

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.550 
temperatures it's just simple on and off
and<00:01:08.880> yeah<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.960> actually<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> biggest

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
and yeah this is actually the biggest

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.440 
and yeah this is actually the biggest
barrel<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.100> believe<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.729> thirty<00:01:12.150> two

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
barrel I believe this is a thirty two

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.870 
barrel I believe this is a thirty two
millimeter<00:01:12.780> they<00:01:13.409> do<00:01:13.470> have<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> bigger<00:01:14.070> size

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
millimeter they do have a bigger size

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.090 
millimeter they do have a bigger size
thirty<00:01:15.240> three<00:01:15.540> millimeter<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.680> sent<00:01:16.920> me

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
thirty three millimeter but they sent me

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.219 
thirty three millimeter but they sent me
the<00:01:17.250> thirty<00:01:17.520> two<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.360> then<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> also<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
the thirty two and then I also have the

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.740 
the thirty two and then I also have the
25<00:01:22.229> millimeter<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.950> 19<00:01:23.430> millimeter<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.600> this

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
25 millimeter and 19 millimeter so this

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.800 
25 millimeter and 19 millimeter so this
is<00:01:24.869> what<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> set<00:01:25.290> looks<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.830> when<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:27.210> just

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
is what the set looks like when you just

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.140 
is what the set looks like when you just
get<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> packaging<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.610> then

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
get it out of the packaging and then

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.690 
get it out of the packaging and then
when<00:01:30.479> you

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
when you

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.569 
when you
open<00:01:31.030> it<00:01:31.149> up<00:01:31.360> this<00:01:31.930> is<00:01:32.140> how<00:01:32.170> its<00:01:32.649> laid<00:01:32.920> out<00:01:33.130> so

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
open it up this is how its laid out so

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.359 
open it up this is how its laid out so
these<00:01:34.299> smaller<00:01:35.009> interchangeable<00:01:36.009> one<00:01:36.189> is

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
these smaller interchangeable one is

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.910 
these smaller interchangeable one is
over<00:01:36.700> here<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:37.659> medium<00:01:38.079> size<00:01:38.320> is<00:01:38.500> here<00:01:38.770> and

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
over here the medium size is here and

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.560 
over here the medium size is here and
then<00:01:39.039> the<00:01:39.070> curling<00:01:39.520> one<00:01:39.670> was<00:01:39.880> here<00:01:40.119> with<00:01:40.299> the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
then the curling one was here with the

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.810 
then the curling one was here with the
bigger<00:01:41.020> one<00:01:41.289> already<00:01:41.649> on<00:01:41.770> it<00:01:42.130> this<00:01:42.520> is<00:01:42.579> the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
bigger one already on it this is the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.609 
bigger one already on it this is the

know<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.870> little<00:03:27.020> barrel<00:03:27.380> back<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.710> forth

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
know the little barrel back and forth

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.680 
know the little barrel back and forth
between<00:03:28.040> small<00:03:28.490> or<00:03:28.640> large<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:29.120> honestly<00:03:29.480> will

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
between small or large I honestly will

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.090 
between small or large I honestly will
probably<00:03:30.020> get<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.140> most<00:03:30.410> use<00:03:30.710> out<00:03:30.890> of<00:03:30.950> the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
probably get the most use out of the

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.770 
probably get the most use out of the
large<00:03:31.340> because<00:03:31.760> that's<00:03:32.120> just<00:03:32.300> what<00:03:32.390> I<00:03:32.510> prefer

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
large because that's just what I prefer

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.130 
but not only did I receive a great set
of<00:03:35.930> curling<00:03:36.470> irons<00:03:36.770> or<00:03:37.070> curling<00:03:37.520> wands<00:03:38.150> but<00:03:38.780> a

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
of curling irons or curling wands but a

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.740

Flatiron let me know I think it's pretty
basic<00:03:56.300> so<00:03:57.050> I<00:03:57.140> haven't<00:03:57.500> done<00:03:57.620> one<00:03:57.830> or<00:03:58.040> included

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.030 
underneath it does come with a set of
