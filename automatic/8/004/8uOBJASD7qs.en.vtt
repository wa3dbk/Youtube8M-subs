00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
so long life has been happening and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.429 
so long life has been happening and
until<00:00:28.349> life<00:00:28.619> gets<00:00:29.210> less<00:00:30.260> happening<00:00:31.260> I

probably won't be on a regular schedule
I<00:00:34.550> am<00:00:35.550> hoping<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.860> shorter<00:00:37.860> videos<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.820> a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.580 
I am hoping to do shorter videos on a
more<00:00:39.930> consistent<00:00:39.960> basis<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.960> probably<00:00:42.960> less

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
more consistent basis like probably less

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.209 
more consistent basis like probably less
than<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:44.070> or<00:00:44.190> two<00:00:44.219> minutes<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.090> then<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:46.219> I

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
than one or two minutes and then as I

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.990 
than one or two minutes and then as I
get<00:00:47.430> more<00:00:47.579> used<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.829> life<00:00:49.829> got<00:00:50.760> glass

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
get more used to this and life got glass

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.540 
get more used to this and life got glass
