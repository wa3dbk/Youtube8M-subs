00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.800
 It is Hirose thunder Tai Yamada sight 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.439
 Cross the border to the fourth generation- 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:11.649
 It is eco-friendly 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:15.689
 Event sprinter toreno from the station known as feab 86 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.320
 I will introduce about 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.249
 This car appeared in sek about 83 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.849
 Other bullets and hatchbacks are far away 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.179
 While becoming 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.529
 It remained as a picture of Ek spring 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.930
 It is a sports car 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.360
 Equipped with a 1.6 liter straight 4 engine at the front 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.190
 Packaging that drives the rear wheel 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.740
 I think it is a car that is loved even now 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.340
 In particular 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.720
 Cross border 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.840
 Corolla Levin and Sprinter Torino of the '86 Four Seasons 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.320
 I'm wearing 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.560
 Body variation is estimated 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.730
 And sports flowers' area v 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.610
 And 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.870
 Additional power steering double gear luxury gtr-tx production model 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.990
 It has become 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.970
 We are talking to everyone as this 86 engine 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.140
 Though it is engine called summary age 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.549
 1.62 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.370
 And 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.910
 The 130 hp torque is 15.2 kg 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.430
 Now it is very compact and small displacement 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.140
 Though it is an engine 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.530
 This engine is 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.530
 8 best players are the best example 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.020
 Actually 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.020
 It's on the top and I'm driving. 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.350
 I have a human 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.330
 To publish 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.400
 Very rich with medium and low speed range 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.939
 Therefore that 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.579
 Even if you step in from around 3000 rotations of the regular use area 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:44.850
 It feels like it's coming 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.590
 Well, I'm not always a fun same generation 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.240
 It was easy to run as a rival 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.160
 There was an opinion that said that and took the car 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.610
 Even though 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.150
 Seems to have been the least 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.940
 On your left ear 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.430
 I feel comfortable running 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.810
 To spring 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.220
 Speaking of yeah 86, along with that engine 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.119
 Determine the steering feel 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.510
 I think there is a chassis and suspension lol 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.120
 The type of suspension is efront but McPherson Strut 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.679
 I think the area is tight 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.389
 Connect that policy is not that independent film side please 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.569
 Connected in shape 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.479
 So many dox 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.839
 Yes it is a photo 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.739
 This seems to derail a little 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:30.539
 If it happens 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:35.639
 At that time 70's 60's 70's active in Europe during the 70's 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.749
 It is ミ リ mm 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:39.679
 Of Lotus 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:40.980
 I got such a car 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.269
 And 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.229
 I am improving it to the government 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:46.709
 I think there are any 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.350
 Such in this 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.590
 US 86 is 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.579
 Continues to be popular now 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:52.599
 North 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.399
 And further 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:58.289
 Why is it that way? 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:02.449
 There are places where you want to see the influence of cartoons 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:03.949
 I think though 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.039
 this 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.899
 Factual ease 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:10.289
 It's not just the money side, the packaging is for me 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.279
 Within reach of 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.499
 It is a secretary with that 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:15.689
 vice versa 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.819
 Feeling to handle the minimum in such a package can also be called 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.869
 Like space 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.529
 If it says plainly, it is only really polite in Japan 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:25.759
 Those 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:27.809
 Very small for the military 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.919
 I think it is because there is a feeling of being a sports car 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.459
 Such well-received sports and lifestyle 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.289
 That's why it is compact 86 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:43.639
 Everybody of the user thinks the view as my own sports car 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.599
 As a super car for young people 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.750
 Put your hand on the engine and put your hand on the suspension 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.750
 I think I've been doing hermes up 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.979
 Part 86 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:58.549
 Why cars that can become cost pressures nowadays 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:03:59.730
 Do not come out 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.419
 Considering that 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:02.380
 I agree 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.029
 this is 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:07.000
 If you take out from the owner's own position 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.039
 I say that 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:10.159
 The beginning 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.409
 Just because packaging yen gfr 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:14.749
 I do not feel 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.479
 That is that 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.569
 Only with Toyota 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.329
 I'm Corolla 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.159
 Sometimes 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.059
 another 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:24.199
 Priest 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.249
 Only from January 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:29.340
 Some people really love motorsport 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.629
 There was a case that it could be used properly 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:35.000
 After that, people at the time of development 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.599
 Maybe I put it in this car 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.629
 I feel that feeling 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:42.550
 Something like a fact 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.979
 I feel like it is based 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.669
 That's why 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:47.640
 86 is 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.430
 And be loved 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.780
 That's how I think
