00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.450
 choice let's see how to make flats 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.460
 realistic 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.280
 with trini max for this we are going to require 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.519
 two scripts one is going to be for the texture 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.730
 and another one for floors well these scripts 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:23.590
 here are flower generator and a text 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.449
 multi texture version 1.0 on the 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.390
 description of the video I will leave the 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.460
 download links for these same 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.489
 these are free and so what are we going 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.340
 to see right now is how to install the 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.590
 yes this is very simple I'm going to open this 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.750
 good folder this folder nothing else there 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.539
 to give you extract here and we're going to 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:48.760
 contain the floor generator and this other 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:50.770
 we are going to give you extract in multi text yes 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.539
 and this content let's see how to copy 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.630
 the good thing the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.829
 to install this 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.670
 It is very simple 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.710
 let's go to max script a script and 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.369
 text 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.320
 Floriano editor and open and with that already 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.010
 we have installed or with that we can 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.750
 run basically good the following 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.870
 for the multi texture we are going to need 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.540
 copy these files in fact we're going to 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.870
 copy nothing else this according to your 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.090
 version mine stream mac 2014 but 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.260
 works perfectly that of 2013 and 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.540
 version 64 bytes this copied it I'm going to 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.680
 go to my program files folder 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.360
 I'm going to look 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.620
 autodesk at autodesk rÃ­mac 2014 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.620
 and in the subfolder 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.670
 plugins I'm going to press for that 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.000
 send plugins and here I am going to paste 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.910
 they pay attention I am retreat imax 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.130
 to copy and paste this because because 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.560
 with the tri dimax loaded they would not have 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.930
 installed yes or no if I had run 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.780
 well basically that's what we're going to 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.040
 need to work also as 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.130
 detail 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.190
 well here I will open the page 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.850
 these were downloaded from sg shows 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.280
 dot com 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.500
 if you have to register it is very simple 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.200
 to be able to download the content these 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.690
 good files I see them in the next 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.670
 choice where we will apply these scripts 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.670
 to generate a realistic floor
