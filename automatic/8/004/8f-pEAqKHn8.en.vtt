just going to work this tube out so I

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.620 
just going to work this tube out so I
just<00:01:57.250> took<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.760> little<00:01:58.860> valve<00:01:59.860> off<00:02:00.630> cap

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
just took the little valve off cap

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.200 
just took the little valve off cap
through<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.560> valve<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:03.009> I'm<00:02:03.910> going<00:02:04.180> to

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
through the valve and I'm going to

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.930 
through the valve and I'm going to
insert<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:05.020> in<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:07.240> then<00:02:07.840> feed<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.229> around<00:02:08.940> it

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
insert it in and then feed it around it

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.670 
insert it in and then feed it around it
needs<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.300> be<00:02:10.420> able<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.600> match<00:02:11.020> up<00:02:11.050> right<00:02:11.440> there

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
needs to be able to match up right there

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.740 
needs to be able to match up right there
so<00:02:11.920> that's<00:02:12.040> what<00:02:12.430> I'm<00:02:12.700> going<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.030> do<00:02:13.270> first<00:02:13.480> and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
so that's what I'm going to do first and

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.900 
so that's what I'm going to do first and
then<00:02:13.930> just<00:02:14.140> feed<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.500> in<00:02:14.620> around<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.550> sew<00:02:15.760> it

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
then just feed it in around and sew it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.810 
then just feed it in around and sew it
that's<00:02:16.120> back<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.840> I'm<00:02:17.800> just<00:02:18.040> put<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.610> cap

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
that's back in and I'm just put the cap

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.800 
that's back in and I'm just put the cap
back<00:02:18.850> on<00:02:19.270> so<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:19.990> when<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.200> feed<00:02:21.420> when<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.450> push

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
back on so that when I feed when I push

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.720 
back on so that when I feed when I push
the<00:02:23.130> tire<00:02:24.130> back<00:02:24.550> into<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.480> wheel<00:02:26.580> then<00:02:27.580> I'm

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
the tire back into the wheel then I'm

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.479 
the tire back into the wheel then I'm
not<00:02:27.910> that<00:02:28.330> I'm<00:02:28.420> not<00:02:28.570> going<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.750> lose<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.890> valve

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.880 

so<00:02:33.489> I'm<00:02:33.550> just<00:02:33.730> working<00:02:33.910> this<00:02:34.269> back<00:02:34.570> into<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
so I'm just working this back into the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.850 
so I'm just working this back into the
wheel<00:02:36.100> here<00:02:36.959> slowly<00:02:37.959> going<00:02:38.290> around<00:02:38.590> pushing

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
wheel here slowly going around pushing

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.449 
wheel here slowly going around pushing
it<00:02:39.100> in<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:40.660> it's<00:02:40.750> all<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.930> way<00:02:40.959> in<00:02:41.190> now<00:02:42.190> both

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
it in so it's all the way in now both

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.490 
it in so it's all the way in now both
sides<00:02:42.640> I'm<00:02:43.420> just<00:02:43.660> going<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.840> air<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.140> back<00:02:44.320> up

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
sides I'm just going to air it back up

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.970 
sides I'm just going to air it back up
slowly<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.750> hopefully<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:47.380> fixes<00:02:47.799> our

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
slowly and hopefully that fixes our

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.630 
slowly and hopefully that fixes our
leaking<00:02:48.310> issue<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.620> fully<00:02:51.070> aired<00:02:51.400> back

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
leaking issue so it is fully aired back

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.530 
leaking issue so it is fully aired back
