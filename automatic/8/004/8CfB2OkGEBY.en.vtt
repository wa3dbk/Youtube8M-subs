model railway project video which is the
networker<00:00:10.550> 466<00:00:11.550> revisited<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:13.230> while<00:00:14.040> back<00:00:14.280> on

networker 466 revisited a while back on

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.939 
networker 466 revisited a while back on
my<00:00:14.639> channel<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:15.120> uploaded<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.839> very<00:00:16.199> short<00:00:16.560> video

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
my channel I uploaded a very short video

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.150 
my channel I uploaded a very short video
showing<00:00:17.760> what<00:00:18.150> I'd<00:00:18.869> done<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.740> network

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
showing what I'd done to the network

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.060 
showing what I'd done to the network
previously<00:00:21.150> but<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.320> time<00:00:22.529> I'm<00:00:22.680> going<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.920> go

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
previously but this time I'm going to go

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.279 
previously but this time I'm going to go
through<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.640> bit<00:00:23.789> more<00:00:23.910> detail<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.600> you'll

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
through in a bit more detail and you'll

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.820 
through in a bit more detail and you'll
also<00:00:25.470> see<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:25.859> there<00:00:26.250> are<00:00:26.430> now<00:00:26.670> two<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.300> them

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
also see that there are now two of them

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.560 
also see that there are now two of them
this<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.980> because<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.060> one<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
this is because this is one of the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.479 
this is because this is one of the
things<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.080> got<00:00:31.320> from<00:00:31.380> modern<00:00:31.800> Scotland

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
things that I got from modern Scotland

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.319 
things that I got from modern Scotland
is<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.540> got<00:00:33.780> another<00:00:34.140> networker<00:00:34.829> unit<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.820> I

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
is I got another networker unit and I

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.290 
is I got another networker unit and I
bought<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:36.989> 40<00:00:37.350> quid<00:00:37.730> okay<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:39.270> are

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
bought this for 40 quid okay so here are

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.010 
bought this for 40 quid okay so here are
the<00:00:39.570> two<00:00:39.840> networkers<00:00:41.390> side-by-side<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the two networkers side-by-side and the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.100 
the two networkers side-by-side and the
one<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.290> left<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.010> most<00:00:44.399> recent<00:00:45.110> purchase

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
one the left is the most recent purchase

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.680 
one the left is the most recent purchase
from<00:00:46.350> modern<00:00:46.770> else<00:00:46.920> cutland<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.539> one<00:00:48.660> on

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
from modern else cutland and the one on

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.290 
from modern else cutland and the one on
the<00:00:48.870> right<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.579> my<00:00:50.579> original<00:00:51.300> project<00:00:53.300> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the right is my original project the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.520 
the right is my original project the
first<00:00:54.510> difference<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.930> you'll<00:00:55.110> see<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
first difference that you'll see is the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.410 
first difference that you'll see is the
light<00:00:55.710> now<00:00:55.980> obviously<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:57.000> want<00:00:57.239> I've<00:00:57.390> got

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
light now obviously you want I've got

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.779 
light now obviously you want I've got
from<00:00:58.260> modern<00:00:58.500> rail<00:00:58.620> Scotland<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> hasn't<00:00:59.460> been

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
from modern rail Scotland is hasn't been

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.510 
from modern rail Scotland is hasn't been
DC<00:01:00.210> seed<00:01:00.480> yet<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.440> both<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.010> lights<00:01:02.219> are<00:01:02.399> being

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
DC seed yet so both the lights are being

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.690 
DC seed yet so both the lights are being
fed<00:01:02.850> which<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.449> red<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.890> yellow

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
fed which are the red and the the yellow

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.149 
fed which are the red and the the yellow
on<00:01:05.970> there<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.570> I've<00:01:06.750> changed<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.590> lights<00:01:07.890> on

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
on there but I've changed the lights on

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.910 
on there but I've changed the lights on
the<00:01:08.310> other<00:01:08.430> side<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:09.810> white<00:01:10.049> lights<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.650> that

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the other side to white lights and that

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.649 
the other side to white lights and that
also<00:01:11.100> provides<00:01:11.549> light<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> cab<00:01:12.270> through

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
also provides light to the cab through

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.399 
also provides light to the cab through
the<00:01:12.780> DCC<00:01:13.229> decoder<00:01:14.540> and<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.689> plan<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.170> change

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the DCC decoder and I plan to change

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.340 
the DCC decoder and I plan to change
over<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.220> only<00:01:17.430> Warner<00:01:17.970> End<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:19.170> these

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
over see only Warner End of these

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.370 
over see only Warner End of these
because<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.830> will<00:01:20.040> run<00:01:20.250> them<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.939> pair<00:01:21.380> so

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
because I will run them as a pair so

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.109 
because I will run them as a pair so
what<00:01:22.619> I've<00:01:22.770> done<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.549> actually<00:01:23.759> just

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
what I've done is I have actually just

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.870 
what I've done is I have actually just
taken<00:01:24.509> out<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> motor<00:01:25.049> from<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.340> latest

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
taken out the motor from the latest

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.210 
taken out the motor from the latest
model<00:01:27.299> rail<00:01:27.450> Scotland<00:01:27.960> purchase<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.009> left

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
model rail Scotland purchase on the left

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.760 
model rail Scotland purchase on the left
and<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.570> runs<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:30.960> basically<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.409> dummy

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and it just runs as basically a dummy

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.760 
and it just runs as basically a dummy
two-car<00:01:32.400> unit<00:01:32.939> which<00:01:33.150> attaches<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.810> my

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
two-car unit which attaches to my

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.640 
two-car unit which attaches to my
original<00:01:35.250> project<00:01:36.079> okay<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
original project okay so this is the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.899 
original project okay so this is the
original<00:01:39.530> networker<00:01:40.530> project<00:01:41.009> which<00:01:41.579> shows

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
original networker project which shows

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.330 
original networker project which shows
the<00:01:42.320> motor<00:01:43.320> chassis<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:46.049> Batman<00:01:46.979> turbo

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the motor chassis and the Batman turbo

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.770 
the motor chassis and the Batman turbo
star<00:01:47.610> motor<00:01:47.909> for<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> middle<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.610> the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
star motor for it in the middle and the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.840 
star motor for it in the middle and the
turbo<00:01:51.780> star<00:01:52.079> motor<00:01:52.560> bogies<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.220> either<00:01:53.369> end<00:01:53.700> so

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
turbo star motor bogies at either end so

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.870 
turbo star motor bogies at either end so
I've<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.270> taken<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.159> out<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.759> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
I've just taken all of that out of a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.050 
I've just taken all of that out of a
turbo<00:01:57.299> start<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.869> put<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.409> into<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.070> chassis

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
turbo start and put it into the chassis

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.660 
turbo start and put it into the chassis
of<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> networker<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:02.490> provides

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
of the networker and this then provides

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.920 
of the networker and this then provides
power<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.600> both<00:02:04.670> bogies<00:02:05.670> front<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.299> back<00:02:06.689> on

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
power to both bogies front and back on

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.080 
power to both bogies front and back on
that<00:02:07.229> chassis<00:02:07.560> there<00:02:07.979> rather<00:02:08.640> than<00:02:08.849> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
that chassis there rather than the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.639 
that chassis there rather than the
original<00:02:09.629> networker

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
original networker

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.760 
original networker
which<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.190> provided<00:02:11.700> power<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:13.260> one

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
which just provided power in the one

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.880 
which just provided power in the one
chassis<00:02:14.310> which<00:02:14.460> was<00:02:14.670> not<00:02:14.970> enough<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:16.590> get<00:02:16.770> it

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
chassis which was not enough to get it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.130 
chassis which was not enough to get it
moving<00:02:17.310> basically<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.300> wasn't<00:02:18.510> happy<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:18.930> I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
moving basically and I wasn't happy so I

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.590 
moving basically and I wasn't happy so I
had<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.470> come<00:02:19.620> up<00:02:19.680> with<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.890> solution<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.600> this

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
had to come up with a solution and this

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.950 
had to come up with a solution and this
was<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:23.130> as<00:02:23.340> we<00:02:23.550> moved<00:02:23.760> down<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.720> end

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
was it so as we moved down to this end

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.430 
was it so as we moved down to this end
as<00:02:25.140> well<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:26.730> can<00:02:26.910> see<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:28.650> put<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:30.440> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
as well you can see that to put in the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.210 
as well you can see that to put in the
Batman<00:02:32.130> motor<00:02:32.730> bogie<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.620> Backman<00:02:34.620> turbo

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
Batman motor bogie and Backman turbo

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.210 
Batman motor bogie and Backman turbo
star<00:02:35.430> bogies<00:02:35.880> rather<00:02:36.180> than<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> Hornby<00:02:36.900> ones

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
star bogies rather than the Hornby ones

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.250 
star bogies rather than the Hornby ones
I<00:02:38.220> had<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.820> chop<00:02:39.030> off<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.540> rear<00:02:39.810> end<00:02:40.020> of<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
I had to chop off the rear end of the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.200 
I had to chop off the rear end of the
chassis<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:41.430> can<00:02:41.550> see<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.850> difference

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
chassis you can see the difference

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.780 
chassis you can see the difference
behind<00:02:42.600> with<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.200> latest<00:02:44.100> one<00:02:44.370> from<00:02:44.670> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
behind with the latest one from the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.740 
behind with the latest one from the
model<00:02:45.060> L<00:02:45.150> Scotland

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
model L Scotland

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.620 
model L Scotland
where<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.860> comes<00:02:47.160> down<00:02:47.370> at<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.640> end<00:02:47.850> next<00:02:48.510> to

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
where it comes down at the end next to

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.570 
where it comes down at the end next to
the<00:02:48.690> little<00:02:49.020> orange<00:02:49.230> bit<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.190> had<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.400> cut

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
the little orange bit and I had to cut

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.970 
the little orange bit and I had to cut
that<00:02:50.700> off<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.090> was<00:02:51.300> able<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.630> put<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:53.840> NEM

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
that off so I was able to put in the NEM

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.470 
that off so I was able to put in the NEM
sockets<00:02:55.980> underneath<00:02:56.730> there<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.330> they

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
sockets underneath there so that they

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.210 
sockets underneath there so that they
would<00:02:57.660> couple<00:02:58.050> up<00:02:58.550> with<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.760> other<00:03:00.470> coach<00:03:01.470> so

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
would couple up with the other coach so

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.530 
would couple up with the other coach so
that<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.270> had<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:04.310> cut<00:03:05.310> off<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.850> then<00:03:06.090> I'll<00:03:06.360> show

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
that I had to cut off and then I'll show

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.980 
that I had to cut off and then I'll show
there

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
there

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.640 
there
that's<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.440> original<00:03:08.810> little<00:03:09.810> pin<00:03:10.140> socket

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
that's the original little pin socket

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.630 
that's the original little pin socket
basically<00:03:11.220> which<00:03:11.970> Hornby<00:03:12.450> designed

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
basically which Hornby designed

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.370 
basically which Hornby designed
so<00:03:14.640> I've<00:03:14.910> kept<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.420> on<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.960> one<00:03:16.170> because

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
so I've kept that on that one because

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.030 
so I've kept that on that one because
obviously<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:17.010> haven't<00:03:17.430> changed<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:19.560> bogies

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
obviously I haven't changed the bogies

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.590 
obviously I haven't changed the bogies
over<00:03:20.459> but<00:03:21.300> on<00:03:21.450> this<00:03:21.660> one<00:03:22.220> I've<00:03:23.220> put<00:03:23.670> in<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:24.090> caddy

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
over but on this one I've put in a caddy

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.290 
over but on this one I've put in a caddy
coupling<00:03:25.020> as<00:03:25.140> well<00:03:25.550> to<00:03:26.550> make<00:03:26.670> sure<00:03:26.730> it's

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
coupling as well to make sure it's

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.460 
coupling as well to make sure it's
closely<00:03:28.230> connected<00:03:28.530> as<00:03:28.830> possible

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
closely connected as possible

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.410 
closely connected as possible
finally<00:03:31.470> I've<00:03:31.740> then<00:03:32.070> also<00:03:32.400> got<00:03:32.610> these<00:03:32.880> great

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
finally I've then also got these great

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.680 
finally I've then also got these great
little<00:03:33.480> gangways<00:03:34.520> on<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.910> end<00:03:36.090> rather<00:03:36.480> than

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
little gangways on the end rather than

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.240 
little gangways on the end rather than
the<00:03:37.020> rubbish<00:03:37.470> Hornby<00:03:37.860> one<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.160> they

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
the rubbish Hornby one that they

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.050 
the rubbish Hornby one that they
provided<00:03:38.959> which<00:03:39.959> when<00:03:40.290> joined<00:03:40.680> together<00:03:41.060> it

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
provided which when joined together it

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.380 
provided which when joined together it
looks<00:03:42.300> really<00:03:43.010> more<00:03:44.010> authentic<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
looks really more authentic and the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.020 
looks really more authentic and the
black<00:03:45.600> does<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.050> better<00:03:46.230> justice<00:03:46.800> than<00:03:47.760> the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
black does it better justice than the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.480 
black does it better justice than the
grey<00:03:48.390> ones<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:48.959> all<00:03:49.170> be<00:03:49.320> provided<00:03:49.920> with<00:03:50.100> the

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
grey ones that all be provided with the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
been done by another goodie coupling

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.220 
been done by another goodie coupling
trying<00:04:02.010> get<00:04:02.100> to<00:04:02.220> focus<00:04:02.670> on<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:02.970> which<00:04:03.959> has<00:04:04.080> been

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
put into the front row seat of that one

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.479 
put into the front row seat of that one
there<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:08.400> also<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:10.650> front<00:04:10.860> of<00:04:11.130> that<00:04:11.280> one

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
there and also the front of that one

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.599 
there and also the front of that one
there<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:13.709> these<00:04:14.520> have<00:04:14.910> been<00:04:14.940> put<00:04:15.390> into<00:04:16.609> the

there and these have been put into the

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.750 
there and these have been put into the
very<00:04:17.790> bottom<00:04:18.209> front<00:04:19.100> of<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.400> networker

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
very bottom front of the networker

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.570 
very bottom front of the networker
inside<00:04:21.270> there<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.860> provides<00:04:23.250> enough

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
inside there so it provides enough

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.320 
inside there so it provides enough
flexibility<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.360> move<00:04:24.660> around<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.990> corners

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
flexibility to move around the corners

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.370 
flexibility to move around the corners
in<00:04:27.330> an<00:04:27.480> nem<00:04:27.810> socket<00:04:28.260> as<00:04:28.350> well<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.900> I<00:04:30.930> now<00:04:31.140> show

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
in an nem socket as well so I now show

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.110 
in an nem socket as well so I now show
you<00:04:31.440> a<00:04:31.530> few<00:04:31.860> running

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
you a few running

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.860 
you a few running
shots<00:04:33.630> of<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.470> new<00:04:34.500> networker<00:04:35.100> as<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:36.000> two-car

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
shots of the new networker as a two-car

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.530 
shots of the new networker as a two-car
and<00:04:37.170> then<00:04:38.040> both<00:04:38.250> coupled<00:04:38.670> together<00:04:38.790> as<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.270> four

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
and then both coupled together as a four

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.170 
and then both coupled together as a four
car<00:04:39.810> going<00:04:40.020> around<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.380> layout<00:04:41.060> thanks<00:04:42.060> very
