00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.850
 every day it is more common for us to leave 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.130
 finding powerful machines and even 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.230
 high performance pc gamer in sizes 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.630
 very reduced is why today 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.020
 we have a very special product 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.320
 it's about the knightley ms the night light is 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.470
 a vermont machine that is a pre pc 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.560
 assembled by mc and of course 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.300
 pertaining to gaming 6 if you 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.130
 Interested to know all the details of what 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.690
 that is inside this box you 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.180
 I invite you to stay with us to 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.460
 continuation 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.320
 as we mentioned the night late 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.090
 is a new bet of the company that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.600
 seeks to take a pc to our homes 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.220
 pre- assembled gamer by ms ie the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.290
 basic components are already installed 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.970
 and we can only choose the rest of 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.780
 them to give you the characteristics 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.970
 final techniques to this pc in a view 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.720
 overall we see that it is a very small pc 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.380
 with a simple and very elegant design in 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.300
 its side 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.760
 we see the dragon of the gaming series of 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.660
 mc and in a paint job that what 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.810
 It shows as if it were in relief 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:22.280
 now we will look at the front panel first 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.119
 we see that we have four usb ports 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.650
 then the microphone input followed 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.759
 by the output of hearing aids we have a 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.190
 button to regulate the lighting 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.690
 we also have led indicators that 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.430
 show us the activity of the hard disk 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:47.030
 and connectivity and of course the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.040
 power button in a rear view 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.869
 we see that the motherboard is already 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.420
 installed the rear fan also 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.450
 and of course we have the connector of 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.300
 energy to open the cabinet not 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.690
 we need tools for it enough 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.640
 with move that these insurance and already 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.410
 we will have the lid released to be able 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.990
 see the bowels of the night 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.180
 inside we see that it is very compact 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.880
 and that internal order is very important 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.950
 The first thing we see is the optician and 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.320
 then a variety of sata cables 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.540
 energy and data 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.090
 immediately we noticed a large space the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.950
 lower part this will allow us to install 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.380
 later a video card of 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.390
 large size without problems here we can 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.320
 see a little more of the motherboard that is 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.650
 one m 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.180
 85 gaming where the cables to 2 are already 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.220
 connected and even the fan 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.220
 92 millimeter rear is connected 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.290
 the optical drive is 9.5 millimeters is 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.300
 I'll team it up but if something called us the 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.860
 Attention is the connection cable is a 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.680
 cable deals with energy and data 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.840
 all-in-one the x is divided in two by 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.790
 one side we have the data cable and for 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.690
 the other an energy connector with 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.580
 ends to female to energize the 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.310
 graphic card we have two cables 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.380
 6 pin pci-express that will be responsible 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.650
 to give the necessary energy at the time of 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.650
 to play 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.590
 as we still want to see a little more 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.600
 we will remove these screws by hand and 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.600
 we will release the top of the playing card 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.840
 once this is done, now it's enough 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:32.239
 slide and we can see a little more 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.069
 of the interior of this cabinet the first thing 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.409
 that we see is the section for units of 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.400
 2.5 inches where you can scale 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:43.310
 up to two devices and install one 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.900
 SSD unit is very simple for it 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.000
 it is enough to use the brackets that 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.989
 They include nein plate in their accessories and 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.989
 place them in this way 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.530
 then we take a couple of screws and the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.739
 we adjust to be able to place it inside 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.739
 of the cabinet 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.019
 now all we have to do is slide the 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.739
 unit in the slot and is ready to 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.739
 be used 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.740
 following the top we have 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.949
 all internal panel connections 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.500
 control but the most important thing is that 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:38.240
 we already found the source of power this 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.150
 cabinet has a font size 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.370
 traditional 600-watt tx 80 seats 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.990
 with gold certification and to be 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.300
 connected uses this charger that 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.830
 we see here at his side we have 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.139
 immediately the cables that connect the 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.600
 rest of the components ie the audio 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.840
 front the indicator leds the 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.340
 USB ports and the power button but 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.110
 his right immediately highlights the 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:06.560
 big blue connector that is the manager 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:08.509
 of the front USB 3.0 ports now 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.610
 we can only look at the more hidden side 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.949
 of the night law and therefore we will take the 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.720
 another cover of the cabinet to make it 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.720
 we just have to remove these screws 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.029
 and slide the lid 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.400
 here we have two important things 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.960
 first the motherboard is of 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.910
 discovered what facilitates the 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.550
 installation of a cooler that uses 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.470
 rear anchor on the other hand we have 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.570
 this mesh that filters the dust for the 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.210
 power source here it shows more than its 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.810
 traditional tx size and not mini x 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:45.280
 as many thought as I did 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.620
 well with this we finished the 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.520
 presentation of the ms name law if you want 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.050
 see more details 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.430
 check the link of the complete review 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.440
 in our blog that is in the 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.629
 description of the video on my part I 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.069
 dismissal and see you in another video or as 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:59.069
 always in jealousy puntocom
