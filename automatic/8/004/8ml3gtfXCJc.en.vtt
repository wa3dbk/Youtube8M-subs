00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.440 

it's<00:00:09.889> a<00:00:10.040> good<00:00:10.190> idea<00:00:10.340> to<00:00:10.550> clean<00:00:10.970> the<00:00:11.150> threads

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
it's a good idea to clean the threads

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:20.850 
it's a good idea to clean the threads
thoroughly

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.070 

you

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.340 

to<00:00:27.740> begin<00:00:27.860> installation<00:00:28.250> of<00:00:28.760> the<00:00:28.880> new<00:00:29.060> bottom

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 
to begin installation of the new bottom

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.780 
to begin installation of the new bottom
you'll<00:00:30.680> start<00:00:30.920> by<00:00:31.040> installing<00:00:31.280> the<00:00:31.610> right

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
you'll start by installing the right

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.330 
you'll start by installing the right
bearing<00:00:32.270> cup<00:00:32.510> into<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.530> frame<00:00:33.770> completely

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
bearing cup into the frame completely

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.400

don't<00:00:35.000> forget<00:00:35.360> that<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:35.690> right<00:00:35.870> bearing<00:00:36.200> cup

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
don't forget that the right bearing cup

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.410 
don't forget that the right bearing cup
is<00:00:36.620> reverse<00:00:36.920> threaded<00:00:37.280> so<00:00:37.430> you<00:00:37.970> will<00:00:38.150> need<00:00:38.300> to

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
is reverse threaded so you will need to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.600 
is reverse threaded so you will need to
turn<00:00:38.600> it<00:00:38.750> counterclockwise<00:00:39.200> to<00:00:40.130> install<00:00:40.489> it

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610

right bearing cup into the frame the
next<00:00:56.740> step<00:00:56.980> will<00:00:57.160> be<00:00:57.190> to<00:00:57.340> install<00:00:57.880> the<00:00:58.030> spindle

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
next step will be to install the spindle

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.690 
next step will be to install the spindle
pay<00:00:59.230> particular<00:00:59.770> attention<00:00:59.800> on<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.400> spindle

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
pay particular attention on the spindle

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.850 
pay particular attention on the spindle
to<00:01:00.940> which<00:01:01.420> side<00:01:01.720> goes<00:01:02.020> to<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.320> drive<00:01:02.560> side

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
to which side goes to the drive side

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.770 
to which side goes to the drive side
which<00:01:03.250> would<00:01:03.400> be<00:01:03.580> that<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.850> long<00:01:04.059> side<00:01:04.540> of<00:01:04.570> the

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
which would be that the long side of the

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.350 
which would be that the long side of the
shaft<00:01:05.050> sticking<00:01:05.380> out<00:01:05.740> that's<00:01:06.730> the<00:01:07.000> side<00:01:07.210> you

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
shaft sticking out that's the side you

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.460 
shaft sticking out that's the side you
want<00:01:07.510> to<00:01:07.570> stick<00:01:07.810> through<00:01:07.990> that<00:01:08.230> will<00:01:08.320> actually

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
want to stick through that will actually

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.770 
want to stick through that will actually
go<00:01:08.740> in<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:08.950> crank<00:01:09.190> arm<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:10.360> go<00:01:10.480> ahead<00:01:10.630> and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
go in the crank arm so go ahead and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.250 
go in the crank arm so go ahead and
install<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.320> into<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.740> frame<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.900> can<00:01:14.140> be

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
install it into the frame this can be

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.840 
install it into the frame this can be
kind<00:01:14.440> of<00:01:14.500> difficult<00:01:14.710> because<00:01:15.130> it<00:01:15.400> is<00:01:15.430> a<00:01:15.550> kind

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
kind of difficult because it is a kind

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.180 
kind of difficult because it is a kind
of<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:16.000> pressed<00:01:16.300> pit<00:01:16.600> in<00:01:16.810> there<00:01:17.050> now<00:01:17.860> that<00:01:17.890> you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
of a pressed pit in there now that you

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.280 
of a pressed pit in there now that you
installed<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.790> spindle<00:01:19.270> you<00:01:19.450> will<00:01:19.780> continue

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
installed the spindle you will continue

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.320 
installed the spindle you will continue
by<00:01:20.440> putting<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:21.070> left<00:01:21.310> bearing<00:01:21.760> cup<00:01:21.970> into<00:01:22.300> the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
by putting the left bearing cup into the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.510 
by putting the left bearing cup into the
frame<00:01:22.660> this<00:01:23.320> one<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.890> will<00:01:24.040> need<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.340> turn

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
frame this one you will need to turn

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.760 
frame this one you will need to turn
clockwise<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:25.479> get<00:01:25.930> it<00:01:26.050> started<00:01:26.410> into<00:01:26.680> the

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
clockwise to get it started into the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.090 
clockwise to get it started into the
frame<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:31.420> very<00:01:31.660> careful<00:01:32.140> as<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.530> threads<00:01:32.860> in

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
frame be very careful as the threads in

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.700 
frame be very careful as the threads in
the<00:01:33.250> frame<00:01:33.490> are<00:01:33.729> very<00:01:34.150> very<00:01:34.509> small<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.140> if<00:01:35.590> you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
the frame are very very small and if you

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.140 
the frame are very very small and if you
damage<00:01:36.070> them<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:36.310> then<00:01:36.580> you<00:01:36.670> have<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:36.910> replace

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
damage them and then you have to replace

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150 
damage them and then you have to replace
the<00:01:37.420> whole<00:01:37.450> frame<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.320> next<00:01:38.530> step<00:01:38.770> is<00:01:38.950> very

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
the whole frame the next step is very

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.620 
the whole frame the next step is very
crucial<00:01:39.460> in<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:39.850> process<00:01:40.330> of<00:01:40.479> rebuilding
