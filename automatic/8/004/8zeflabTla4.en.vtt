00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.940
 today we are going to make a bluefin tuna 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.800
 madagascar because obviously it takes 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.750
 preserve the weather of the Mediterranean 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.360
 stung with garlic with small tomatoes 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.990
 bunches just switch on the grill at 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.920
 last moment so why one too 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.070
 big piece of graves 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.500
 because the tone is good already very 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.710
 dew inside and that's good when 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.020
 it's cooked in chunks there is some 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.329
 tuna for two and a 400 gram pavÃ© 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.399
 we will do a little bit like a leg 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.720
 alive to take the equivalent of 2 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:48.760
 cloves of garlic that will finely mince 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.030
 and we will pique the tone with in the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.030
 slice 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.290
 we will grill it on both 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.079
 surfaces even on the slice that this 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:06.119
 we have a big thickness 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.440
 count ten minutes of cooking no more 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.440
 I return it 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.260
 he just crusted on the top but there 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.700
 not mention it gives a little film 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.130
 white 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.659
 that's because the tone is going to be there soon 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.380
 puts him the little tomatoes clusters 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.380
 so here I am going to take off the tone 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.190
 so it's fair 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:46.340
 from the tip to the heart to anyone 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:50.180
 but here a very nice cooking always the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.450
 flower of salt in the end alas the lemon 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.980
 just on the white part 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.980
 look at our red party
