00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
hard and be a good test if you notice

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.580 
hard and be a good test if you notice
you<00:01:40.500> get<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.920> team<00:01:41.189> down<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.700> get<00:01:41.850> discouraged

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
you get a team down they get discouraged

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.109 
you get a team down they get discouraged
sometimes<00:01:43.590> sometimes<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.549> happens<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.939> mean

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
sometimes sometimes it happens I mean

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.800 
sometimes sometimes it happens I mean
it's<00:01:45.990> art<00:01:46.170> we're<00:01:46.890> tough<00:01:47.100> match<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.430> talk<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.180> you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
to match up i guess i gotta be hard for

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.120 
to match up i guess i gotta be hard for
teams<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.960> see<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.590> they<00:01:52.680> tried<00:01:52.920> their<00:01:53.070> best

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
teams to see that they tried their best

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.460 
teams to see that they tried their best
and<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.640> sometimes<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.600> not<00:01:54.750> not<00:01:55.290> enough

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
and you sometimes it's not not enough

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.990 
and you sometimes it's not not enough
yeah<00:01:55.799> that's<00:01:56.009> got<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.280> an<00:01:56.549> even<00:01:56.850> bigger

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
yeah that's got to be an even bigger

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.389 
yeah that's got to be an even bigger
edge<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.659> you're<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.170> their<00:01:58.289> heads<00:01:58.439> well

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
edge for you you're in their heads well

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.950 
edge for you you're in their heads well
I<00:01:59.430> guess<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.090> guess<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.539> can't<00:02:00.720> rely<00:02:00.930> on

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
I guess I guess but we can't rely on

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.249 
I guess I guess but we can't rely on
that<00:02:01.200> too<00:02:01.409> much<00:02:02.090> continue<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.119> play<00:02:03.600> hard<00:02:03.930> and

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
that too much continue to play hard and

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.919 
that too much continue to play hard and
play<00:02:04.649> play<00:02:05.490> aggressive<00:02:05.909> because<00:02:06.630> otherwise

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
play play aggressive because otherwise

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.779 
play play aggressive because otherwise
you<00:02:07.350> should<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> couple<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.920> bad<00:02:08.039> habits<00:02:08.220> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
you should be a couple of bad habits and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.510 
you should be a couple of bad habits and
your<00:02:09.090> intensity<00:02:09.869> goes<00:02:10.170> down<00:02:10.769> and<00:02:11.510> injures
