 I am very happy today because

 that the guide I'm working on 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.500

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.630

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.789

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.010
 so in this video I want the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.500
 browse with you to introduce yourself 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.289
 the contents of this guide but first of all 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.590
 why did I realize this 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.720
 guide is good actually I got a lot 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.470

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.110
 share of readers 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.110
 then either as a result of the articles in 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.870
 the comment system is by mail 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.440
 who was asking me how to simply act 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.090
 daily to perform his 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.079
 personal development and to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.690
 to feel better 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.079
 so I thought why not 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.050
 create a guide to help these people 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.850
 and to help you so this guide is 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.129

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.329
 present very tips to set up 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.329

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.439
 so the first thing that we can 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.869
 notice is that this guide actually is 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.939

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.880
 shrine of positive thinking then 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.340
 the sanctuary of positive thinking 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.040
 is not strictly speaking an ebook 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.930
 it's more of a development tool 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.080

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.850

 it's this trick made work the 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.070
 zygomatic 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.260
 each trick is divided into three 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.880
 parties the first part is a 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.709
 rather theoretical part where I present 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.350
 the concept behind 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.630
 the trick the second part the part 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.250

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.390
 finally a problem part is a 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.640
 anecdote around this trick then 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.670

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.260

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.760
 commitment
