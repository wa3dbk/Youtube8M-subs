you<00:00:02.310> don't<00:00:02.460> need<00:00:02.669> Photoshop<00:00:03.360> all<00:00:03.720> you<00:00:03.959> need<00:00:04.140> is

you don't need Photoshop all you need is

you don't need Photoshop all you need is
some<00:00:04.470> graphics<00:00:04.830> editing<00:00:05.220> software<00:00:05.730> I'll<00:00:05.910> be

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
some graphics editing software I'll be

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.960 
some graphics editing software I'll be
using<00:00:06.240> paint.net<00:00:06.750> which<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.680> free

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
using paint.net which is free

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.459 
using paint.net which is free
surprisingly<00:00:08.970> powerful<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.660> linked<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.349> the

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
surprisingly powerful and linked in the

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.200 
surprisingly powerful and linked in the
description<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:11.160> also<00:00:11.490> use<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.790> for<00:00:11.940> my

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
description I also use it for my

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.940 
description I also use it for my
thumbnails<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.929> highly<00:00:13.230> recommend<00:00:13.650> it

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
thumbnails and I highly recommend it

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.980 
thumbnails and I highly recommend it
ok<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.580> let's<00:00:14.849> get<00:00:14.940> started<00:00:15.420> I'm<00:00:15.599> gonna<00:00:15.719> make<00:00:15.960> a

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
ok so let's get started I'm gonna make a

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.019 
ok so let's get started I'm gonna make a
complex<00:00:16.470> animation<00:00:17.160> where<00:00:17.369> only<00:00:17.609> certain

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
complex animation where only certain

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.760 
complex animation where only certain
parts<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.449> picture<00:00:18.600> move<00:00:18.930> behind<00:00:19.529> other

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
parts of the picture move behind other

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.890 
parts of the picture move behind other
translucent<00:00:20.490> layers<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> 3d

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
translucent layers and with the 3d

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.080 
translucent layers and with the 3d
perspective<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.830> your<00:00:23.310> animation<00:00:23.880> is

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
perspective so your animation is

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.700 
perspective so your animation is
probably<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:24.869> even<00:00:25.080> easier<00:00:25.650> than

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
probably going to be even easier than

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.060 
probably going to be even easier than
this<00:00:26.070> first<00:00:26.939> start<00:00:27.630> up<00:00:27.750> your<00:00:27.930> software<00:00:28.470> with<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
this first start up your software with a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.470 
this first start up your software with a
2<00:00:29.519> 5<00:00:29.820> 6<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.330> width<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.929> 1<00:00:31.529> 4<00:00:31.800> 4<00:00:32.040> o<00:00:32.099> hiked<00:00:32.940> pixel

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
animation will be 4 frames long now I'm

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.950 
animation will be 4 frames long now I'm
going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.579> process<00:00:45.000> each<00:00:45.239> one<00:00:45.510> slightly

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
going to process each one slightly

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.380 
going to process each one slightly

save it as a PNG for now because we're

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.820 
save it as a PNG for now because we're
adding<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.420> another<00:01:03.690> image<00:01:03.899> once<00:01:04.530> that

image is finished we'll save that one as
a<00:01:07.020> jiff<00:01:07.880> now<00:01:08.880> select<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> second<00:01:09.720> image<00:01:09.930> at

a jiff now select the second image at
the<00:01:10.170> top<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.560> process<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.250> slightly

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the top and process that one slightly

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.149 
the top and process that one slightly
differently<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.479> first<00:01:12.750> then<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> third
