00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
of that has Center right so it's the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.819 
of that has Center right so it's the
wheel<00:03:44.269> it<00:03:44.810> sounds<00:03:45.109> like<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:45.380> we<00:03:45.500> always<00:03:45.620> like

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
wheel it sounds like so we always like

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.309 
wheel it sounds like so we always like
it<00:03:45.950> won't<00:03:46.130> open<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.970> you<00:03:47.120> plug<00:03:47.269> it<00:03:47.329> in<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.780> it

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
it won't open and you plug it in and it

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.839 
it won't open and you plug it in and it
register<00:03:48.680> believe<00:03:49.219> it<00:03:49.340> won't<00:03:49.430> be<00:03:49.610> otherwise

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
register believe it won't be otherwise

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.910 
register believe it won't be otherwise
it'll<00:03:50.150> be<00:03:50.209> quite<00:03:50.450> frustrating<00:03:50.650> what<00:03:51.650> did<00:03:51.829> you
