well<00:00:01.560> finally<00:00:02.280> got<00:00:02.460> my<00:00:02.580> connectors<00:00:03.090> in<00:00:05.990> first

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
well finally got my connectors in first

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.089 
well finally got my connectors in first
thing<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.230> want<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.440> do<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.710> you<00:00:07.830> want<00:00:08.069> to

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
thing you want to do is you want to

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.930 
thing you want to do is you want to
connect<00:00:08.910> from<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.480> receiver<00:00:10.400> to<00:00:11.400> these<00:00:11.670> and

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
connect from the receiver to these and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.089 
connect from the receiver to these and
make<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.240> lot<00:00:12.450> easier<00:00:12.950> connecting<00:00:13.950> them

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
make it a lot easier connecting them

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.120 
make it a lot easier connecting them
outside<00:00:14.490> then<00:00:14.940> doing<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.420> on<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> inside

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
outside then doing it on the inside

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.750 
outside then doing it on the inside
after<00:00:17.130> you've<00:00:17.400> connected<00:00:17.670> everyone

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.390 

now<00:00:23.760> they<00:00:24.029> got<00:00:24.210> couple<00:00:24.869> more<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.289> connect<00:00:25.710> but

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
now they got couple more to connect but

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.250 
now they got couple more to connect but
I<00:00:26.460> wanted<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.820> give<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.240> basic<00:00:27.630> principle

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
I wanted to give you the basic principle

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.860 
I wanted to give you the basic principle
that<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.470> do<00:00:29.960> I<00:00:31.070> really<00:00:32.070> came<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.700> too<00:00:33.570> much

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
that I do I really came on it too much

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.940 
that I do I really came on it too much
detail<00:00:34.260> because<00:00:34.320> there's<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.620> much<00:00:34.710> detail

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
detail because there's not much detail

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.660 
detail because there's not much detail
to<00:00:35.250> give<00:00:35.930> but<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.230> order<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.430> the

to give but in order to do this the
proper<00:00:38.910> way<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.450> know<00:00:39.809> how<00:00:40.050> people<00:00:40.170> say<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.500> got

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
proper way I know how people say you got

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.369 
proper way I know how people say you got
to<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> professional<00:00:42.110> but<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.200> give<00:00:43.350> you

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
to have a professional but they give you

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.819 
to have a professional but they give you
everything<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.860> need<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.809> that<00:00:45.809> little<00:00:46.649> book

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
everything you need in that little book

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.119 
everything you need in that little book
they<00:00:47.039> call<00:00:47.280> manual<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.789> comes<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:49.129> it's

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
they call manual that comes with it it's

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.650 
they call manual that comes with it it's
pretty<00:00:50.460> simple<00:00:51.379> it<00:00:52.379> tells<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.329> what<00:00:54.329> wires

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
pretty simple it tells you what wires

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.130 
pretty simple it tells you what wires
are<00:00:55.079> positive<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.620> when<00:00:55.800> wires<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.219> negative

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
are positive and when wires are negative

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.069 
are positive and when wires are negative
the<00:00:58.140> whole<00:00:58.350> night<00:00:58.649> I'll<00:00:58.949> tell<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.870> to<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

whole<00:01:03.049> thing<00:01:04.049> about<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> wires<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.610> is

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
whole thing about the wires and this is

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.830 
whole thing about the wires and this is
coming<00:01:06.000> from<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.450> receiver<00:01:07.369> on<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:09.510> pieces

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
coming from the receiver on the pieces

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.780 
coming from the receiver on the pieces
you<00:01:10.170> get<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.950> connector<00:01:11.430> case<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.700> you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
you get on the connector case that you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.530 
you get on the connector case that you
get<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> buy<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> cheap<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.960> your<00:01:13.110> own<00:01:13.260> home

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
get if you buy a cheap on your own home

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.469 
get if you buy a cheap on your own home
but<00:01:15.540> most<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.080> them<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.280> wire<00:01:17.490> itself<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
but most of them do on the wire itself I

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.830 
but most of them do on the wire itself I
know<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.659> can't<00:01:18.930> see<00:01:19.580> I'm<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.640> using<00:01:21.030> my

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
know you can't see I'm just using my

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.170 
know you can't see I'm just using my
iPhone<00:01:22.439> but<00:01:22.830> put<00:01:23.070> theirs<00:01:23.549> letting<00:01:23.970> right

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
iPhone but put theirs letting right

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.780 
iPhone but put theirs letting right
there<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.650> says<00:01:25.860> power<00:01:26.250> antenna

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
there this one says power antenna

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.819 
there this one says power antenna
it's<00:01:29.790> from<00:01:30.030> my<00:01:30.180> antenna<00:01:30.509> which<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.869> won't<00:01:31.619> be

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
it's from my antenna which I won't be

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.999 
it's from my antenna which I won't be
using<00:01:34.009> I'll<00:01:35.009> be<00:01:35.159> using<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.740> turn<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.890> my

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
using I'll be using this as a turn on my

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:48.690 
using I'll be using this as a turn on my
amp<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:38.490> actually<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:41.070> then

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.560 

but<00:01:49.700> that's<00:01:49.910> what<00:01:50.120> you<00:01:50.270> need<00:01:50.480> I<00:01:51.190> got<00:01:52.570> little

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
but that's what you need I got little

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.090 
but that's what you need I got little
cramps<00:01:54.170> I<00:01:54.290> just<00:01:54.530> use<00:01:56.200> regular<00:01:57.200> pliers<00:01:57.770> to

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
cramps I just use regular pliers to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.600 
cramps I just use regular pliers to
clamp<00:01:58.370> on<00:01:58.690> after<00:01:59.690> I<00:01:59.720> get<00:01:59.780> done<00:01:59.990> cramping<00:02:00.410> them

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
clamp on after I get done cramping them

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.980 
clamp on after I get done cramping them
and<00:02:01.610> putting<00:02:02.060> everything<00:02:02.270> together<00:02:02.510> it's

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
and putting everything together it's

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.440 
and putting everything together it's
kind<00:02:03.230> of<00:02:03.260> just<00:02:03.380> matching<00:02:03.800> colors<00:02:04.190> some<00:02:04.490> some

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
kind of just matching colors some some

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.100 
kind of just matching colors some some
wires<00:02:05.660> you<00:02:05.930> won't<00:02:06.110> even<00:02:06.350> use<00:02:07.930> there's<00:02:08.930> usually

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
wires you won't even use there's usually

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.580 
wires you won't even use there's usually
a<00:02:09.320> couple<00:02:09.350> leftover<00:02:10.100> wires<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.729> are<00:02:11.590> for

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
a couple leftover wires that are for

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.310 
a couple leftover wires that are for
other<00:02:13.120> vehicles<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.480> kits<00:02:14.750> made<00:02:14.990> for

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
other vehicles that the kits made for

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.510 
other vehicles that the kits made for
were<00:02:15.470> designed<00:02:15.860> for<00:02:19.120> well<00:02:21.220> forgot<00:02:22.220> about<00:02:22.400> my

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
were designed for well forgot about my

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.400 
were designed for well forgot about my
Karen<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:24.040> skipped<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.130> couple<00:02:25.340> steps<00:02:25.700> Oh

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
Karen I skipped a couple steps Oh

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.310 
Karen I skipped a couple steps Oh
then<00:02:28.280> skip<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.640> couple<00:02:28.850> steps<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.390> just<00:02:29.600> didn't

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
then skip a couple steps I just didn't

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.460 
then skip a couple steps I just didn't
record<00:02:30.740> what<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.460> just<00:02:31.670> did
