am<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.039> to<00:01:32.100> demonstrate<00:01:32.429> for<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.090> how

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
am just going to demonstrate for you how

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.919 
am just going to demonstrate for you how
they<00:01:34.079> compare<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.829> another<00:01:35.720> okay<00:01:36.720> let's

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
they compare with one another okay let's

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.809 
they compare with one another okay let's
start<00:01:37.170> off<00:01:37.350> by<00:01:37.560> showing<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.159> how<00:01:38.340> fast<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
start off by showing you how fast the

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.620 
start off by showing you how fast the
camera<00:01:39.360> loads<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:40.159> 3gs<00:01:41.159> versus<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> 3g<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
camera loads on the 3gs versus a 3g and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.190 
camera loads on the 3gs versus a 3g and
it<00:01:42.750> opened<00:01:43.110> both<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.470> same<00:01:43.710> time<00:01:46.939> damn<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it opened both the same time damn so it

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.440 
it opened both the same time damn so it
is<00:01:49.259> indeed<00:01:49.560> faster<00:01:50.069> so<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.849> question<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.209> if

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
is indeed faster so the question is if

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.850 
is indeed faster so the question is if
it's<00:01:51.599> worth<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.020> upgrade<00:01:52.619> from<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
it's worth it to upgrade from the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.399 
it's worth it to upgrade from the
previous<00:01:53.250> iphone<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.970> i'd<00:01:54.720> say<00:01:54.899> yes<00:01:55.110> or<00:01:55.259> no<00:01:55.380> i

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
previous iphone and i'd say yes or no i

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.929 
previous iphone and i'd say yes or no i
think<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.099> the<00:01:56.220> original<00:01:56.580> iphone

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
think if you have the original iphone

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.550 
think if you have the original iphone
definitely<00:01:57.689> worth<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.110> got<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.319> video

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
definitely worth it you got the video

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.699 
definitely worth it you got the video
camera<00:01:58.830> speed<00:01:59.670> boosts<00:01:59.929> compass<00:02:00.929> great<00:02:01.500> great

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
camera speed boosts compass great great

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.039 
camera speed boosts compass great great
upgrade<00:02:02.039> if<00:02:02.670> you've<00:02:02.849> got<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.000> iphone<00:02:03.270> 3g<00:02:03.689> it's

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
upgrade if you've got the iphone 3g it's

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.149 
upgrade if you've got the iphone 3g it's
not<00:02:04.289> going<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.470> be<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.679> much<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.979> big<00:02:05.130> deal

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
not going to be so much of a big deal
