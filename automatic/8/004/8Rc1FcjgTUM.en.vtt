00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
we do there is we check the torsion bar

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.330 
we do there is we check the torsion bar

them then we look at the rim the quality
of<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.310> rim<00:02:03.520> then<00:02:04.240> we<00:02:04.420> do<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.720> icd<00:02:05.729> inflation

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729
