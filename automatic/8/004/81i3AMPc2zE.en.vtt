00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.020 
that with there but um here we have a
chest<00:01:34.770> full<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.189> illusion<00:01:35.579> blocks<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
chest full of illusion blocks and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.219 
chest full of illusion blocks and
probably<00:01:36.299> asking<00:01:36.540> what<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> heck<00:01:37.140> are

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
probably asking what the heck are

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.990 
probably asking what the heck are
illusion<00:01:37.619> blocks<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.009> call<00:01:38.310> them<00:01:38.460> ghost<00:01:38.700> blocks

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
illusion blocks I call them ghost blocks

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.249 
illusion blocks I call them ghost blocks
in<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> beginning<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> video<00:01:39.930> because

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
in the beginning of the video because

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.590 
in the beginning of the video because
it's<00:01:40.829> really<00:01:41.130> easier<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.119> know<00:01:42.210> explain

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
it's really easier to you know explain

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.639 
it's really easier to you know explain
it<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.780> way<00:01:42.930> any<00:01:43.079> guys<00:01:43.259> probably<00:01:43.470> already

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
it that way any guys probably already

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.170 
it that way any guys probably already
know<00:01:43.799> where<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.189> because<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> said<00:01:44.909> ghost

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
know where it is because I said ghost

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.450 
know where it is because I said ghost
blocks<00:01:45.479> meaning<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.680> know<00:01:46.770> ghosts<00:01:47.310> are

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
blocks meaning that you know ghosts are

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.969 
blocks meaning that you know ghosts are
not<00:01:47.520> real<00:01:47.790> or<00:01:48.270> I'm<00:01:48.750> if<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.470> believe<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.829> ghosts

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
not real or I'm if you believe in ghosts

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.020 
not real or I'm if you believe in ghosts
I'm<00:01:50.130> sorry<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:50.399> I'm<00:01:50.490> defending<00:01:50.700> you

I'm sorry if I'm defending you

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.700 
I'm sorry if I'm defending you
but<00:01:51.570> basically<00:01:51.750> ghosts<00:01:52.290> don't<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.560> any

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
but basically ghosts don't have any

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.920 
but basically ghosts don't have any
physical<00:01:53.250> characteristics<00:01:53.640> now<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.600> distress

there's<00:02:12.409> a<00:02:12.470> lot<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:13.060> variety<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:14.420> could

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
there's a lot of variety and you could

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.670 
there's a lot of variety and you could
use<00:02:14.720> them<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:15.019> build<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.230> lot<00:02:15.379> of<00:02:15.500> cool<00:02:15.650> things

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
use them to build a lot of cool things

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.920 
use them to build a lot of cool things
now<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.489> probably<00:02:16.670> ask<00:02:16.909> yourself<00:02:17.060> again<00:02:17.569> what

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
now I probably ask yourself again what

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.479 
now I probably ask yourself again what
the<00:02:18.049> heck<00:02:18.200> are<00:02:18.409> you<00:02:18.590> supposed<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:19.040> do<00:02:19.250> and

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
the heck are you supposed to do and

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.610 
the heck are you supposed to do and
they're<00:02:20.030> supposed<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.510> just<00:02:20.629> simulate<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
they're supposed to just simulate the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.170 
they're supposed to just simulate the
look<00:02:21.799> of<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.040> blog<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:22.489> here<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:22.760> have<00:02:22.909> a<00:02:22.940> house

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
look of a blog so here we have a house

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.479 
look of a blog so here we have a house
completely<00:02:23.750> made<00:02:24.230> out<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.830> illusion<00:02:25.310> blocks

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
completely made out of illusion blocks

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.190 
completely made out of illusion blocks
except<00:02:25.819> for<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.060> two<00:02:26.480> blocks<00:02:26.720> I'm<00:02:26.870> standing

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
except for the two blocks I'm standing

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.600 
except for the two blocks I'm standing
on<00:02:27.319> so<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.709> can<00:02:27.830> use<00:02:27.920> these<00:02:28.040> illusion<00:02:28.430> blocks

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
on so you can use these illusion blocks

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.490 
on so you can use these illusion blocks
to<00:02:28.790> create<00:02:28.970> things<00:02:29.390> like<00:02:29.540> traps<00:02:30.049> or<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.349> could

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
to create things like traps or you could

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.710 
to create things like traps or you could
create<00:02:30.680> hidden<00:02:31.160> secret<00:02:31.849> rooms<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.269> passages

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
create hidden secret rooms and passages

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.970 
create hidden secret rooms and passages
and<00:02:32.989> what<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.170> mean<00:02:33.319> by<00:02:33.379> that<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.739> if<00:02:33.920> I

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
and what I mean by that is that if I

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.500 
and what I mean by that is that if I
step<00:02:34.220> onto<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.549> block<00:02:34.790> here<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.090> can<00:02:35.209> see<00:02:35.390> that

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
step onto a block here you can see that

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.449 
step onto a block here you can see that
I<00:02:35.569> actually<00:02:35.750> fall<00:02:36.200> down<00:02:36.500> into<00:02:36.799> lava<00:02:37.129> because

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
I actually fall down into lava because

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.100 
I actually fall down into lava because
all<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:38.180> blocks<00:02:38.390> around<00:02:38.690> me<00:02:38.780> except<00:02:39.019> these

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
all the blocks around me except these

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.350 
all the blocks around me except these
two<00:02:39.170> blocks<00:02:39.470> up<00:02:39.650> here<00:02:39.890> are<00:02:40.040> actually<00:02:40.879> illusion

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
two blocks up here are actually illusion

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.580 
two blocks up here are actually illusion
blocks<00:02:41.569> so<00:02:41.720> if<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:41.870> just<00:02:42.019> go<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.230> here<00:02:42.409> you'll

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
blocks so if I just go in here you'll

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.680 
blocks so if I just go in here you'll
see<00:02:42.769> all<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.459> illusion<00:02:43.760> blocks<00:02:43.970> connected<00:02:44.540> to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
see all the illusion blocks connected to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.330 
see all the illusion blocks connected to
this<00:02:44.810> one<00:02:45.049> illusion<00:02:45.440> block<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.890> I'm<00:02:46.190> sorry

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
this one illusion block and I'm sorry

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.380 
this one illusion block and I'm sorry
from<00:02:46.519> saying<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.790> illusion<00:02:47.000> blocks<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.269> lot

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
from saying the illusion blocks a lot

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.270 
from saying the illusion blocks a lot
but<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:47.690> kind<00:02:48.019> of<00:02:48.079> had<00:02:48.620> that's<00:02:48.860> really<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.250> only

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
but I kind of had that's really the only

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.970 
but I kind of had that's really the only
Mecca<00:02:49.579> explained<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:50.230> um<00:02:51.230> yet<00:02:51.620> again<00:02:51.799> if<00:02:51.920> I

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
Mecca explained so um yet again if I

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.440 
Mecca explained so um yet again if I
step<00:02:52.220> off<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.579> these<00:02:52.730> two<00:02:52.910> block<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:53.329> have

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
step off of these two block that I have

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.150 
step off of these two block that I have
here<00:02:53.599> in<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.750> center<00:02:54.079> I<00:02:54.260> will<00:02:54.590> just<00:02:54.950> fall<00:02:55.129> down

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
here in the center I will just fall down

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.339 
here in the center I will just fall down
into<00:02:55.609> the<00:02:55.790> lava<00:02:56.090> pit<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.540> like<00:02:56.989> I<00:02:57.019> said<00:02:57.260> you

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
speaking of hidden chests if I go into

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.819 
speaking of hidden chests if I go into
my<00:03:26.239> wall<00:03:26.510> here<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.230> can<00:03:27.380> see<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:27.680> have<00:03:27.799> a
