00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:03.180
 House this time 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.769
 Uragaku and others would like to let you know about one color 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.480
 What is a fortune teller 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.559
 I get an inquiry from a lot of customers recently 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:16.599
 Yeah 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.599
 The orbit is close to that of rivals 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.550
 It is an inquiry, but that pictologist 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.669
 I would like to inform you about that 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.759
 Current screen 2 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.419
 That's Ebetsu 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.980
 It is tatami 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.260
 That fortune teller 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.030
 If you just don't know the doctor because you're just watching 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.920
 I was a fortune teller 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.920
 I can do it if it is enough to go tatami 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.630
 It seems to be said 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.890
 It seems to be actually used for tatami at home 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.230
 That's right 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.040
 Let's make it a person who doesn't need to go outside the city and Toyone village 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.040
 If you hear the word fortune teller 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.790
 I imagine high 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.370
 Yeah tatami is 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.720
 Foreseeers of the people are themselves 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.990
 But not one 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.730
 If you do not sell itself to high things 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.570
 However, on the other side, tatami mats appear 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.980
 It has not been constructed 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.710
 en What to do with the fortune teller 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.070
 It's nothing so much 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.850
 It will be said that you can see here 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.510
 If 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.300
 In dwarf 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.530
 eh 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.770
 Where is tatami 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.250
 There are many parts of this group 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.620
 A combination of a folk table and tatami mats 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.280
 5 I am finding 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.250
 Emura start is that 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.250
 It's all about me it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.860
 Remove this area 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.190
 Tatami and good throw 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.370
 Tatami table 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.719
 I will rose 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:11.719
 It is lonely 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:21.349
 Because 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.279
 This is what I used to have, but this is what I used to 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:25.949
 Hold the tatami mat 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.949
 Much better 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.889
 Start this 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.479
 And that again 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.000
 It is this two-and-two-male mind 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.979
 Here 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.979
 I also put on a helicopter 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:54.369
 It is 55 on the tatami that this is flipped if there is no English power 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:57.099
 I can get around 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.359
 Because it is yeah 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.489
 that 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.489
 Divination score 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.229
 Other flip over 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.229
 The table of that tatami does not come out 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:15.469
 Fortune tellers are not tatami then Nomura 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:17.969
 Let's see again 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:21.149
 I'm undressing the snake I was thinking of you 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.609
 Table in another form- 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.609
 What's wrong with that 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.579
 If you find 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.229
 This is 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:38.769
 Because it is an individual who is a fortune teller, if material comes out to embroider it, it will be astringent 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:39.249
 To 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.479
 It means that you can protect it 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:45.089
 This is a fortune teller 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:46.710
 Well recently well well 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.189
 There is also an inquiry 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.949
 Customer same temple temple 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.849
 I say that five times 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.519
 Misunderstanding 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.370
 It is such a thing
