development<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.560> in<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:08.400> tutorial<00:00:08.700> I'll

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
development and in this tutorial I'll

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.209 
development and in this tutorial I'll
give<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.690> showing<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.110> how<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.320> create<00:00:10.800> a

give you showing you how to create a
alert<00:00:12.230> so<00:00:13.230> what<00:00:13.980> we<00:00:14.070> do<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.219> go<00:00:14.400> straight<00:00:14.639> to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
alert so what we do we go straight to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.160 
alert so what we do we go straight to
Xcode<00:00:15.330> file<00:00:15.900> new<00:00:16.470> project<00:00:17.779> make<00:00:18.779> sure<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
Xcode file new project make sure it's a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.849 
Xcode file new project make sure it's a
new<00:00:19.500> based<00:00:19.770> application<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> iPhone<00:00:21.859> and

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
new based application for the iPhone and

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.810 
new based application for the iPhone and
we're<00:00:23.310> going<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.460> simply<00:00:23.850> gnome<00:00:24.029> its<00:00:24.330> alert

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.160 

now<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:30.060> make<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.390> bit<00:00:30.599> bigger<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:30.900> it's

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
now just make it a bit bigger so it's

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.560 
now just make it a bit bigger so it's
easy<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.500> see<00:00:31.830> go<00:00:32.369> straight<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.910> our<00:00:33.030> classes

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
easy to see go straight to our classes
