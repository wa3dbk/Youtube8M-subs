00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.510
 to my channel in this video I'm going to 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.639
 teach the last things I've 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.610
 bought on the web page bounce the green 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.800
 is an Italian firm and I advance you 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.350
 Most things are for hygiene 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.710
 body although there are also some 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.269
 cosilla for topics of facial care 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.609
 nothing, if you're interested, you know 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.300
 my favorite product for bath gels 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.489
 and body cream is from here and was the one 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.010
 prompted me to make this request always 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.710
 I ask that they be offers because 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.239
 if you can not be a bit expensive like that 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.280
 He advanced that all the prices of 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.719
 the things that I'm going to tell you have 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.040
 discount 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.230
 I'm going to start with what has not 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.950
 liked the order and so we ended up with 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.180
 good taste in the mouth and it is this axis that is 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.180
 a sandalwood bath gel 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.220
 has 400 milliliters is a bath gel 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.100
 that makes a lot of foam however the 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.840
 smell I find a little masculine smell 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.840
 to put it in some way 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.860
 I do not know is the typical smell to which I 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.960
 I would like a man to run, not for 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.290
 use it from the same line as a 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:22.320
 smallest size of 250 milliliters 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.320
 I teach you this gel that is coconut 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.730
 and that I love because it leaves a smell 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.520
 super coconut but what we find 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.740
 too burdensome and good to follow with 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.440
 the bath gels I'll show you two 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.340
 they are from the same line and they are from 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.440
 my beloved line of vanilla my 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.510
 favorites of the black vanilla and I bought 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.760
 these two that are the ones that I have not tried 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.720
 of vanilla and myrrh and vanilla and 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:52.680
 Cardamom both have 400 milliliters 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.820
 and the two are accompanied by milk 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.030
 bodily 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.760
 also from the same line 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.369
 to see these products if the offer can 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.340
 be a bit expensive but with the offer 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:11.930
 the gels are left in 499 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.060
 and the body milk is also 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.560
 they remain for that same price however 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.690
 when they are not on offers I think the 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.160
 body milk is worth twelve euros one thing 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:25.060
 so it seems very expensive 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.520
 good of these gels I like them I like them 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.190
 the two colors are quite sweet the 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.500
 of myrrh has a point to me that is 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.750
 note a lot and cardamom is more 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.210
 sweet is a completely sweet aroma 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.100
 however I still like nach is from 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.080
 black vanilla although it is true that 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.910
 the aromas a little more sophisticated than 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.120
 to use it every day because maybe 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.480
 Kansas then combined it with these 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.100
 two and with other gels more normalitos the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.810
 milks such as I comment also 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.540
 this vanilla and look I have not opened 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.220
 because I do not want it to spoil me and 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.140
 made vanilla gel itself is the one that 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.970
 what I'm using but the one 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.989
 cardamom yes I have opened it and the 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.250
 texture has surprised me a while ago in 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.900
 some video of finished products 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:19.050
 teach this same cream but from which 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.150
 it's only vanilla that is toned 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.580
 yellows and I did not like anything because I 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.580
 it was too fluid too 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.489
 watery and little consistent however the 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.390
 This texture has improved and I 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.540
 I really like it 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.020
 It is not a cream but neither is it a body 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.600
 very watery milk so yes I like it 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.580
 and leaves a little smell on the skin pressed 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.100
 I teach a product that has entered 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.620
 part of my summer favorites 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.770
 it's about this cleansing gel that 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.720
 It serves for the face and for the eyes and 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.720
 for all skin types 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.210
 As you can see, I've been pretty worn and 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.730
 this is because we simply put a loaf in 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.520
 the hand and with the face moistened then 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.670
 we give ourselves for the whole face bear included 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.410
 and we removed all the makeup my way 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.900
 to use them is that I undo the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.870
 eyes first and then what is the 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.640
 last pass so I give this with the 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.440
 most times my eyes do not sting 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.170
 although I do not know because sometimes yes 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.360
 I escuece 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.670
 but I especially when using them to 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.430
 these days that you get home super late 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.100
 or super tired and I do not feel like walking 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.530
 doing chiki hundred steps to 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.360
 make up my face well then 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:38.570
 this for me is to save time and that's why 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.910
 I like it and then taught two products 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.620
 I have not tried 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.620
 this is an eye contour 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.010
 how good I with the contours of eyes 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.200
 of bottega green I have not had very good 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.280
 experience because I already bought one does 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.900
 a lot of time and it irritated me in the eyes 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.790
 they cried decidedly in an opportunity 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.250
 because he says it's a cream for 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.870
 the outline of water and eyelids then 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.730
 well I think that's why it's for being 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.530
 also for the eyelid maybe it's more 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.810
 soft and do not have much problem with it 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.240
 but I have it closed because I'm 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.160
 still using the carrefour and 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.770
 this has an expiration of six months 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.000
 I do not want him to get bad so 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.820
 well I will tell you in products 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.620
 finished or I'll make a comment for 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.410
 instagram by facebook or some of my 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.870
 social networks and as a gift they 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:31.930
 they sent this kit that is the lime fact 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:35.150
 I do not know why they send these things 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.280
 with the age that I have 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.750
 finally I will finish this by giving my 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.420
 mother that is what I always do when 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.910
 They send me these things and this brings 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.690
 It is a day cream a night cream 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:50.180
 a zero and an eye contour all the 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.920
 mini size format for you to try it and 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.870
 you like the line because you buy it 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.450
 logically 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.940
 she for example from bottega verde one of 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:02.330
 the things that I usually buy them is a 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.819
 cream called retinol obvious plus 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.199
 that is how the plug doraditos 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:08.000
 when they are not offered, it's worth 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.580
 forty euros but when you put it in 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.599
 offer then it costs about ten euros like this and 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.360
 the truth that works great 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:17.300
 well so good if you want to make a 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.770
 gift to mom, you know what 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.439
 I had come to teach I hope that I have 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.270
 liked if you want to make me some 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:25.310
 recommendation of green bottle or you have 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.669
 some doubt about how to buy that 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.900
 buy or more things that I've tried 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:31.310

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.020
 I also leave the link to my blog 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.449

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:39.969
 talking about green bottle products and 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.969
