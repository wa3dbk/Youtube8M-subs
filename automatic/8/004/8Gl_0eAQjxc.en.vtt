we sent our dog for a bike we give the

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.890 
we sent our dog for a bike we give the

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
and let them handle the business they

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.250 
and let them handle the business they
have<00:03:30.139> to<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.859> if<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.780> suspect<00:03:32.780> decides<00:03:33.079> to

have to and if the suspect decides to
give<00:03:33.379> up<00:03:33.409> because<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.069> thought<00:03:34.250> he<00:03:34.400> sees<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:34.609> dog

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
give up because I thought he sees a dog

give up because I thought he sees a dog
that<00:03:35.900> would<00:03:36.019> be<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.260> standoff<00:03:36.680> that's<00:03:36.970> second

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
that would be the standoff that's second

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.300 
that would be the standoff that's second
phase<00:03:38.120> regression<00:03:38.629> and<00:03:38.949> then<00:03:39.949> there<00:03:40.129> is<00:03:40.280> a

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
phase regression and then there is a

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.159 
phase regression and then there is a
reattach<00:03:41.030> say<00:03:41.299> we<00:03:41.419> have<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.660> suspect<00:03:42.109> in

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
reattach say we have the suspect in

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.080 
reattach say we have the suspect in

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
suspect attacks us the dog will attack

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.909 
suspect attacks us the dog will attack
