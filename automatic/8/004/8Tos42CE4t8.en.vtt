00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.850
 it means the essence of what I want to do here 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.780
 this molex connector is powered 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.849
 lived there really 12 volts red 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.450
 5 volt fans usually plugged in 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.510
 12 volts and spin on with 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.520
 rated speed and this moment 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.250
 who wanted to do but then changed his mind 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.170
 this is the potential difference between 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.630
 twelve five it turns out 7 volts 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.970
 I do not recommend this so I 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.660
 still try to make 5 volt 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.700
 nutrition 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.860
 I'm here a little tense why now 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.880
 I'll usually explain here is a 12 volt wire 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.879
 denoted by 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.350
 yellow it's on the power supplies 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.210
 used yellow braid yellow 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.090
 wire insulation it is five volts 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.989
 I have a red one that went to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.530
 Included razomchik development think 10 x 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.510
 for 3 small connectors for power 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.120
 fans and here show red wire 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.090
 I was so tense 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.110
 really 5 volt power was but how 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:09.150
 the manufacturer seems a little nagged 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.520
 I'll show you exactly what mattel is if they 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.150
 decided to save they took here now 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.500
 can be seen if properly connect 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.950
 plug connector that is red sprouted 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.450
 and fight with blue not to yellow 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.610
 put food use yellow 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.259
 insulation wire everything was clear 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.960
 in one word you need to transfer this one 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.700
 here is the plug on the edge and it will be korra 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.320
 fit red 5 volt 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.320
 food now I will show how to do it 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:48.870
 then there are 2 pins left so 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.710
 power supply and the second if you count on the left 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.540
 land accordingly to change 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.220
 fan power supply is not needed 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.290
 this one is left to rearrange 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.000
 right side so he 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.800
 recorded just the actual charge 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.840
 red wire and will then complete 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.460
 conformity 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.180
 how to make the mess so small 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.220
 antennae 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:15.390
 they need to bend and pull out like this 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.760
 antennae looks like this antennae a little 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.950
 with tweezers, she bent off and pulled out not now 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.260
 just paste before you need to insert 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.700
 bend so that nothing is fixed here 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.520
 now everything fits well 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.990
 and by color and i for myself so 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.430
 reminder made because through 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.350
 some world will forget what it is 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.670
 pissed off 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.010
 not to connect there by chance 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.490
 something not that not that not necessary 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.459
 something that is not necessary is not connected now I 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.480
 all the ballast resistor and took off and 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.280
 plugged in 5 volt these fans 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.470
 there is hope that they will rotate 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.180
 slower and quieter the more so it is not 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.300
 fans of air hype which 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.370
 passes through the grate and dust filter 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.160
 and accordingly if the fan 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.519
 come back slower your shows will 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.519
 less
