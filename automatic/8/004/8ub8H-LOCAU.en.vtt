part I'm talking about

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.970 
part I'm talking about

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
sneakers now I don't know if he actually

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.270 
sneakers now I don't know if he actually
got<00:03:56.220> license<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.820> actually<00:03:57.120> put<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.360> Jordan<00:03:57.660> 1

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
got license to actually put the Jordan 1

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.640 
got license to actually put the Jordan 1
color<00:03:59.280> scheme<00:03:59.610> and<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:01.230> sneaker<00:04:01.500> that

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
color scheme and and the sneaker that

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.500 
color scheme and and the sneaker that
look<00:04:01.800> like<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.190> matches<00:04:02.910> drawing<00:04:03.210> one

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
look like this that matches drawing one

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.930 
look like this that matches drawing one
but<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.930> doesn't<00:04:03.960> have<00:04:04.290> any<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.710> logos<00:04:05.100> any

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
but it doesn't have any of the logos any

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.940 
but it doesn't have any of the logos any
of<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.270> Jordan<00:04:06.900> marking<00:04:07.260> any<00:04:07.410> of<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.650> Nike

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
of the Jordan marking any of the Nike

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.800 
of the Jordan marking any of the Nike
markings<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.700> I'm<00:04:08.940> sure<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.510> should<00:04:09.690> be

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
markings so I'm sure it should be

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.540 
markings so I'm sure it should be
punished<00:04:10.230> there<00:04:10.410> should<00:04:10.560> be<00:04:10.650> no<00:04:10.740> problem<00:04:11.190> and

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
punished there should be no problem and

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.100 
punished there should be no problem and
like<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.060> said<00:04:12.240> before<00:04:12.300> you<00:04:12.690> can<00:04:12.870> actually

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
like I said before you can actually

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:21.740 
like I said before you can actually
remove<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:17.330> sneakers<00:04:20.269> you<00:04:21.269> actually<00:04:21.570> remove

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
remove the sneakers you actually remove

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.110 
remove the sneakers you actually remove
the<00:04:21.930> sneakers<00:04:22.290> on<00:04:22.860> both<00:04:23.070> sides<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.700> I<00:04:23.910> guess

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
the sneakers on both sides and I guess

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.420 
the sneakers on both sides and I guess
it<00:04:24.480> just<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.470> reason<00:04:25.740> why<00:04:25.800> they<00:04:25.950> do<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.220> is

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
it just the reason why they do that is

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:36.950 
it just the reason why they do that is
because<00:04:26.820> let<00:04:27.570> me<00:04:27.600> remove<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.169> other<00:04:28.260> side

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.730 

there's<00:04:37.960> no<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.949> reason<00:04:39.099> why<00:04:39.310> they

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
there's no the reason why they

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.629 
there's no the reason why they
disability<00:04:41.740> wants<00:04:42.009> you<00:04:42.099> to<00:04:42.220> know<00:04:42.340> that<00:04:42.370> you

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
disability wants you to know that you

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.570 
disability wants you to know that you
can<00:04:42.759> remove<00:04:43.000> sneakers<00:04:43.479> is<00:04:43.720> because<00:04:44.400> there<00:04:45.400> is

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
can remove sneakers is because there is

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.550 
can remove sneakers is because there is
a<00:04:45.610> display<00:04:46.210> base<00:04:46.479> that<00:04:46.780> comes<00:04:46.990> with<00:04:47.319> the

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
a display base that comes with the

00:04:47.560 --> 00:05:27.920 
a display base that comes with the
figure<00:05:22.259> so<00:05:23.259> here<00:05:23.530> is<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.009> display<00:05:24.370> base<00:05:26.729> and

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
figure so here is the display base and

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.570 
figure so here is the display base and
much<00:05:28.930> of<00:05:29.080> the<00:05:29.229> reason<00:05:29.349> I<00:05:29.560> guess<00:05:29.770> is<00:05:29.979> because<00:05:30.219> it

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
much of the reason I guess is because it

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.330 
much of the reason I guess is because it
makes<00:05:30.729> it<00:05:30.819> easier<00:05:31.210> for<00:05:31.240> you<00:05:31.539> to<00:05:31.569> put<00:05:31.930> the

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
makes it easier for you to put the

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.459 
makes it easier for you to put the
figure<00:05:33.340> onto<00:05:33.580> the<00:05:34.000> display<00:05:34.180> base<00:05:34.569> with<00:05:35.379> the

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:35.469 
figure onto the display base with the

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:38.100 
figure onto the display base with the
shoes<00:05:35.710> taken<00:05:36.340> off<00:05:36.460> unless<00:05:36.789> you<00:05:37.509> try<00:05:37.719> to<00:05:37.780> force

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
shoes taken off unless you try to force

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.959 
shoes taken off unless you try to force
and<00:05:38.379> jam<00:05:38.620> it<00:05:38.800> and<00:05:38.919> maybe<00:05:39.069> one<00:05:39.460> of<00:05:39.490> these<00:05:39.729> things

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
and jam it and maybe one of these things

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.600 
and jam it and maybe one of these things
would<00:05:40.180> break<00:05:40.569> part<00:05:40.930> which<00:05:41.169> it<00:05:41.650> is<00:05:41.860> I<00:05:42.460> don't

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
would break part which it is I don't

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.689 
would break part which it is I don't
think<00:05:42.909> it<00:05:43.000> will<00:05:43.090> happen<00:05:43.240> but<00:05:43.690> you<00:05:43.870> know<00:05:44.699> just

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
think it will happen but you know just

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:51.809 
think it will happen but you know just
in<00:05:45.909> case<00:05:45.940> these<00:05:46.930> things<00:05:47.199> can<00:05:47.590> happen<00:05:50.819> that's

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
in case these things can happen that's

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.080 
in case these things can happen that's
why<00:05:52.000> they<00:05:52.180> make<00:05:52.330> it<00:05:52.449> so<00:05:52.840> that<00:05:53.639> you<00:05:54.639> won't<00:05:54.909> have

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
why they make it so that you won't have

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.180 
why they make it so that you won't have
a<00:05:55.240> chance<00:05:55.509> for<00:05:55.810> it<00:05:55.900> to<00:05:55.990> happen<00:05:56.139> so<00:05:57.840> the

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
a chance for it to happen so the

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.309 
a chance for it to happen so the
sneakers<00:06:00.190> has<00:06:00.460> the<00:06:01.300> display<00:06:01.539> base<00:06:01.870> have<00:06:02.110> these

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
sneakers has the display base have these

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.860 
sneakers has the display base have these
pegs<00:06:02.560> it<00:06:03.099> goes<00:06:03.279> underneath<00:06:03.580> the<00:06:03.819> sneakers<00:06:04.210> as

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
pegs it goes underneath the sneakers as

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.540 
pegs it goes underneath the sneakers as
a<00:06:04.930> whole<00:06:05.229> here<00:06:05.560> as<00:06:05.979> you<00:06:06.099> can<00:06:06.159> see<00:06:08.340> so<00:06:09.340> I'm<00:06:09.430> gonna

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
a whole here as you can see so I'm gonna

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.140 
a whole here as you can see so I'm gonna
put<00:06:09.759> this<00:06:09.849> on<00:06:10.029> there<00:06:11.370> and<00:06:12.370> this<00:06:12.580> is<00:06:12.819> a<00:06:12.849> tight

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
put this on there and this is a tight

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.899 
put this on there and this is a tight
fit<00:06:13.180> in<00:06:13.509> the<00:06:13.599> beginning<00:06:13.870> but<00:06:14.639> that's<00:06:15.639> a<00:06:15.759> good

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
fit in the beginning but that's a good

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.670 
fit in the beginning but that's a good
sign<00:06:16.240> because<00:06:16.509> you<00:06:16.840> don't<00:06:16.990> want<00:06:17.139> the<00:06:17.289> the

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
sign because you don't want the the

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:26.149 
sign because you don't want the the
