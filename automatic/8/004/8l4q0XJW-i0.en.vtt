00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.160
 It was already over 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.849
 Qatar 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.630
 Paulo 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.780
 He says he wants to be better than me but he will not be able to. 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.780
 did not like 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.620
 I know I talked to you 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.890
 But I tried hardcore this, I'm 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.760
 trying to get you strong again 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.420
 Do you think that's the reason? 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.380
 You've let me die. 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.850
 by the way you do not know what's worse 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 your coupons or sense of conservative morality 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.150
 the deal until you tried 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.890
 Why do not they start the fact? 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.890
 But why does it say it all? 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.250
 he is still alive 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.080
 did not give another 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.300
 we have to congratulate the friend he told one of the motes to do said the 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.030
 Qatar 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.550
 so I tried a chair in kukukaya take a photo of the boy's miley 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.840
 first after you and me and then the three of us together after a purchase of each 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.840
 sewerage system 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.000
 and if I stay very quiet I said I did not make the tomato in the cabala 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 spoils pleasure 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.020
 and not what he did in the past 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.230
 according to neither scrupulously less pressure of kilometers and graveyard 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.720
 because it helped fill up with the thousands who already suffered the buses that 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.760
 He left 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.330
 I thought 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
 I thought I'd be the last person you guys hurt. 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.990
 if he had beaten him for being that death if he had taken off per cent 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.180
 world would not have rolled the ends of the earth until they found this pilot 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.049
 despicable how to take care of death 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.909
 and come back later near 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.689
 you do not understand me 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.689
 I think you never understood. 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.649
 What if the moral code or not allowed 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:29.129
 It's so hard to get over the limit not because of everything around us. 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.299
 it would be too easy 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.689
 everything I ever wanted was marked 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.739
 not a day goes by without the sieve getting him to pay for the curiosities that 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.529
 made everyone then the end 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:42.999
 end the shower 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:45.999
 where then I will have firm time 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.969
 but if I 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.969
 If mister low it means 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.009
 I will not be able to return 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.539
 because 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:02.569
 I'm not talking about killing the pibiti the other scarecrow cases so talked about him 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:04.799
 only his 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.419
 this because 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.419
 Why did he take me down c? 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.959
 I can not 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.249
 Sorry 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:18.869
 but it's so cute 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:21.869
 good choice 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.439
 that 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.099
 I do not think that was always the reason 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.689
 you me 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.689
 and now you have to choose 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.719
 if you do not kill these canopies I just want 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.399
 is the magician 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:49.840
 and if you want to repeat 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.270
 You're going to have to kill me, you know I did not turn to his poor biomes. 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.420
 if you want to stop me father had to shoot me right in my face 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:03.039
 happy with life better than expected 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.429
 it's him or me 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:17.849
 I have to decide 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.819
 choose now 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:21.319
 Powel in it 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.319
 scolari 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.259
 like lawyers 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.560
 for nothing 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.590
 to mark
