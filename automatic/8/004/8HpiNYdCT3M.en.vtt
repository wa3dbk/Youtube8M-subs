are<00:01:51.080> so<00:01:53.470> basically<00:01:54.470> we<00:01:54.590> have<00:01:54.620> this<00:01:55.100> here

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
are so basically we have this here

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.230 
are so basically we have this here
salary<00:01:56.570> revenue<00:01:57.760> now<00:01:58.760> we're<00:01:58.940> going<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.090> go<00:01:59.180> to

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
salary revenue now we're going to go to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.010 
salary revenue now we're going to go to
a<00:01:59.420> mall<00:01:59.690> graph<00:01:59.930> effector<00:02:00.830> plane<00:02:01.810> so<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:02.930> have

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
a mall graph effector plane so we have

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.240 
a mall graph effector plane so we have
these<00:02:03.140> two<00:02:03.409> you<00:02:03.530> don't<00:02:03.590> want<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.890> put<00:02:04.100> the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
these two you don't want to put the

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.830 
these two you don't want to put the
magraph<00:02:04.610> under<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.150> plane<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.600> kind<00:02:05.810> of

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
magraph under the plane it kind of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.440 
magraph under the plane it kind of
already<00:02:06.050> coordinates<00:02:06.770> itself<00:02:07.160> with<00:02:07.369> it<00:02:07.550> first

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
already coordinates itself with it first

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.240 
already coordinates itself with it first
you<00:02:08.600> want<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.810> go<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:08.929> up<00:02:09.080> want<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.740> go<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.890> fall

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
you want to go to up want to go to fall

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.790 
you want to go to up want to go to fall
out<00:02:10.280> on<00:02:10.870> the<00:02:11.870> shape<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.350> want<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.590> go<00:02:12.680> to

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
out on the shape you want to go to

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.320 
out on the shape you want to go to
infinite<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:14.060> box<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:15.709> now<00:02:15.830> kind<00:02:16.070> of<00:02:16.130> boxes<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
infinite to box so now kind of boxes the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.559 
infinite to box so now kind of boxes the
capsule<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.459> want<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.670> go<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.790> size<00:02:20.090> and

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
capsule and you want to go to size and

what we want and go halfway at least go
to<00:02:56.989> perimeter<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:58.430> Anzhi<00:02:59.230> bring<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.350> back<00:03:00.560> to

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
to perimeter and Anzhi bring it back to

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.920 
to perimeter and Anzhi bring it back to
negative<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.910> you'll<00:03:02.060> see<00:03:02.239> how<00:03:02.269> come<00:03:02.780> does

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
negative and you'll see how come does

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.539 
negative and you'll see how come does
this<00:03:03.079> affect<00:03:03.530> be<00:03:04.459> really<00:03:04.700> cool<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:06.549> you're

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
this affect be really cool so you're

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.140 
this affect be really cool so you're
going<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:07.880> slide<00:03:08.269> it<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.049> can<00:03:09.200> see<00:03:10.150> it'll

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
going to slide it and you can see it'll

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.180 
going to slide it and you can see it'll
just<00:03:11.180> kind<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.630> bring<00:03:11.900> in<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.140> text<00:03:15.010> we<00:03:16.010> need

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
so if I go eat more it'll come back to

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.990 
so if I go eat more it'll come back to
the<00:03:24.260> other<00:03:24.470> way<00:03:24.709> it's<00:03:25.459> going<00:03:25.610> to<00:03:25.670> go<00:03:25.730> kind<00:03:25.940> of

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
the other way it's going to go kind of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.759 
the other way it's going to go kind of
halfway<00:03:26.239> look<00:03:26.690> here<00:03:27.310> give<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.430> keyframe

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
halfway look here give it a keyframe

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.199 
halfway look here give it a keyframe
then<00:03:30.769> go<00:03:30.920> at<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.100> end<00:03:32.500> bring<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.620> in<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:34.209> give

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
then go at the end bring it in and give

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.390 
then go at the end bring it in and give
it<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.390> keyframe<00:03:35.890> so<00:03:36.890> now<00:03:37.010> if<00:03:37.070> we<00:03:37.130> play<00:03:37.370> this

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
it a keyframe so now if we play this

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.020 
it a keyframe so now if we play this
through<00:03:39.100> it'll<00:03:40.100> kind<00:03:40.310> of<00:03:40.340> just<00:03:40.640> bringing<00:03:40.790> the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030
