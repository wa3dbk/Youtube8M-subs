00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.180
 hello very good to all more but there is no 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.419
 more with you 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.419
 right now 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:20.029
 I said 'you 7.1 the thing is 7.1 2000 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.620
 they have reached me all afternoon below 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:28.820
 There is the truth because here 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:32.640
 and well let's see 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:38.870
 I read a little about the truth 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.870
 so I do not know what to surprise 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.710
 well the first thing we're going to 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.860
 find us here together are the house 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.620
 of which is a wireless 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 this is supposed to be to load them 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.360
 this is the basis this actually for 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.430
 either extend it or puts it this is 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.220
 esteems the tower of last the table and by 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.130
 if you do not get good, actually you 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.119
 I am now playing directly worth 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.119
 the helmets 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.700
 in any way the micro before the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.149
 noise cancellation as it is called 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.540
 quite comfortable at a glance to simple 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.400
 I'll see 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.630
 that by the way I have also received a 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:34.660
 mouse and I will also make a boxing and good 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.660
 the following here is what I wanted 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.330
 the usb for that and what makes them 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.020
 to the field 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.020
 the one in the box this coach and this is 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.300
 light but my niece has lost 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.800
 I also have to think about doing a setup to 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.470
 see the comments to say about 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.340
 mushrooms then the base for helmets 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.340
 with a sample 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.080
 with a lot of work he has then 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:29.460
 these are the hand sample 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.700
 with patience and with saliva the elephant 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.319
 it's the people have slept there I 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.610
 and these add to that and that's it 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.099
 perfect not to be leaving over 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.890
 of the keyboard and the whole roll this is given 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.550
 the instructions all good one boxing 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.550
 of the calculations made 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.440
 good description of the video let me know if 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.769
 they want to see more or less from my corner of 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.769
 vice 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.660
 as I always say there are favorites 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.890
 share and see you in the next 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.890
