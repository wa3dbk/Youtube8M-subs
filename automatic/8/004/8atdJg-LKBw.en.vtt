helicopter<00:00:22.189> it<00:00:23.189> sounds<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> little<00:00:23.820> weird

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
helicopter it sounds a little weird

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.609 
helicopter it sounds a little weird
because<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.930> gears<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> little

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
because one of the gears is a little

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:50.620 
because one of the gears is a little
messed<00:00:25.800> up<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.400> flies<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:27.000> fine

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.690 

try<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.380> land<00:00:51.770> it<00:00:51.950> on<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.130> table<00:00:52.490> and<00:00:52.580> then

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
try to land it on the table and then

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:09.380 
try to land it on the table and then
take<00:00:52.880> back<00:00:53.090> off<00:00:53.300> after<00:00:53.660> you<00:00:53.750> land

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.600 

if<00:01:10.390> like<00:01:10.630> if<00:01:11.409> it's<00:01:11.680> facing<00:01:12.040> this<00:01:12.159> way<00:01:12.220> all<00:01:12.520> the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
if like if it's facing this way all the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.370 
if like if it's facing this way all the
controls<00:01:13.000> are<00:01:13.180> going<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.390> be<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.810> same<00:01:14.080> but

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
controls are going to be the same but

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.530 
controls are going to be the same but
like<00:01:14.470> if<00:01:14.619> it's<00:01:14.740> facing<00:01:15.130> towards<00:01:15.460> you<00:01:15.520> like<00:01:16.390> you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
the helicopter but if it's this way now

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.130 
the helicopter but if it's this way now
it's<00:01:22.030> this<00:01:22.240> way<00:01:22.420> so<00:01:22.479> it's<00:01:22.780> going<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:22.930> be<00:01:22.990> going

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
it's this way so it's going to be going

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.950 
it's this way so it's going to be going
the<00:01:23.320> absolutely<00:01:24.060> no<00:01:25.060> it<00:01:25.210> still<00:01:25.479> works<00:01:25.690> but

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
the absolutely no it still works but

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.780 
the absolutely no it still works but
like<00:01:26.530> it's<00:01:26.830> going<00:01:26.979> to<00:01:27.009> be<00:01:27.130> backwards<00:01:27.610> or

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
like it's going to be backwards or

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.040 
like it's going to be backwards or
sideways<00:01:27.970> depending<00:01:28.659> on<00:01:28.780> which<00:01:28.899> way<00:01:29.020> the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
sideways depending on which way the

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.330 
sideways depending on which way the
helicopter<00:01:29.619> is<00:01:29.649> facing<00:01:30.040> it's<00:01:30.790> stuck<00:01:31.119> stop<00:01:31.899> it

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
helicopter is facing it's stuck stop it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:48.550 
helicopter is facing it's stuck stop it
and<00:01:33.340> let's<00:01:33.490> hit<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:33.729> harder<00:01:34.119> on

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:57.180 

hmm

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.630 

try<00:01:57.820> to<00:01:57.880> land<00:01:58.090> on<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.390> table<00:01:58.720> again

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:18.390 

just<00:02:03.640> 10<00:02:04.350> sabot<00:02:13.380> gonna<00:02:14.380> keep<00:02:14.560> going<00:02:17.040> up<00:02:18.040> we

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
got a couple minutes left of YouTube

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:22.480 
got a couple minutes left of YouTube
time<00:05:15.980> I<00:05:20.860> don't<00:05:21.860> know<00:05:21.920> if<00:05:22.040> it's<00:05:22.130> going<00:05:22.250> to<00:05:22.310> hold

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
time I don't know if it's going to hold

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.990 
time I don't know if it's going to hold
in<00:05:22.700> anymore<00:05:22.970> we'll<00:05:23.330> see<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:28.070> top<00:05:28.340> that<00:05:28.850> it

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
in anymore we'll see the top that it

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.460 
in anymore we'll see the top that it
clicks<00:05:29.210> into<00:05:29.450> is<00:05:29.660> a<00:05:29.690> little<00:05:29.930> bent<00:05:30.170> it's

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
clicks into is a little bent it's

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.630 
clicks into is a little bent it's
probably<00:05:30.680> going<00:05:30.800> to<00:05:30.860> fall<00:05:30.980> out<00:05:31.040> really<00:05:31.460> easily

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
probably going to fall out really easily

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.520 
probably going to fall out really easily
like<00:05:31.970> any<00:05:32.300> more<00:05:32.540> questions<00:05:33.050> will<00:05:33.290> fall<00:05:33.500> out

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
try this and next time Cassie will try

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.580 
try this and next time Cassie will try
the<00:06:57.030> sea<00:06:58.030> will<00:06:58.180> do<00:06:58.330> the<00:06:58.480> number<00:06:58.930> two<00:06:59.140> next<00:06:59.500> the

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
the sea will do the number two next the

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.490 
the sea will do the number two next the
plane<00:06:59.830> next<00:07:00.070> so<00:07:00.970> in<00:07:01.450> a<00:07:01.510> couple<00:07:01.660> days<00:07:01.930> we'll

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
plane next so in a couple days we'll

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.560 
plane next so in a couple days we'll
have<00:07:02.530> the<00:07:02.680> number<00:07:03.040> two<00:07:03.400> it's<00:07:04.300> going<00:07:04.450> to<00:07:04.480> be

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
have the number two it's going to be

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.420 
have the number two it's going to be
warmer<00:07:04.870> outside<00:07:05.020> there<00:07:05.470> were<00:07:05.530> at<00:07:05.650> least<00:07:05.680> not
