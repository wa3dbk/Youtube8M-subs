he<00:00:46.050> has<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> theory<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.250> why<00:00:47.489> bender

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
he has a theory of as to why bender

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.930 
he has a theory of as to why bender
drinks<00:00:48.600> more<00:00:48.840> than<00:00:48.899> other<00:00:49.320> robots<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.789> the

drinks more than other robots now in the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180 
drinks more than other robots now in the
show<00:00:51.120> bender<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.629> constantly<00:00:52.320> seen<00:00:52.590> drinking

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
show bender is constantly seen drinking

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.400 
show bender is constantly seen drinking
beer<00:00:53.610> despite<00:00:54.300> being<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.600> robot<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.199> is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
beer despite being a robot this is

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.959 
beer despite being a robot this is
explained<00:00:55.860> by<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.039> show<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.370> course<00:00:56.550> because

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
explained by the show of course because

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.360 
explained by the show of course because
by<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> fact<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.809> robots<00:00:58.440> run<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.859> alcohol

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
by the fact that robots run on alcohol

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.130 
by the fact that robots run on alcohol
however<00:00:59.730> his<00:01:00.120> theory<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.600> bender<00:01:01.050> has

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
however his theory is that bender has

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.810 
however his theory is that bender has
seen<00:01:01.320> drinking<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.010> much<00:01:02.190> more<00:01:02.399> often<00:01:02.579> than

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
seen drinking so much more often than

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.579 
seen drinking so much more often than
other<00:01:03.000> robots<00:01:03.359> since<00:01:03.989> he's<00:01:04.170> drinking<00:01:04.559> beer

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
other robots since he's drinking beer

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.340 
other robots since he's drinking beer
which<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.820> when<00:01:05.909> 100%<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.479> alcohol<00:01:06.869> he<00:01:07.229> has

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
which is it when 100% of alcohol he has

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.710 
which is it when 100% of alcohol he has
to<00:01:07.439> drink<00:01:07.710> more<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.820> stay<00:01:09.000> powered<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
to drink more of it to stay powered and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.330 
to drink more of it to stay powered and
the<00:01:10.049> reason<00:01:10.290> why<00:01:10.380> he<00:01:10.470> drinks<00:01:10.710> beer<00:01:10.770> instead<00:01:11.250> of

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the reason why he drinks beer instead of

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.890 
the reason why he drinks beer instead of
drinking<00:01:11.610> pure<00:01:11.880> alcohol<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.540> thrusted

robots<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.830> same<00:01:14.040> reason<00:01:14.340> he<00:01:14.369> smokes<00:01:14.820> he

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
robots is the same reason he smokes he

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.080 
robots is the same reason he smokes he

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.599 
and hidden talent ebuddy
now<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.359> why<00:03:30.540> Clyde<00:03:31.409> knows<00:03:31.979> that<00:03:32.190> Cartman

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
now this is why Clyde knows that Cartman

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.670 
now this is why Clyde knows that Cartman
his<00:03:32.699> brother<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.359> he<00:03:33.479> was<00:03:33.540> why<00:03:34.079> he<00:03:34.109> goes<00:03:34.379> along

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
his brother and he was why he goes along

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.619 
his brother and he was why he goes along
with<00:03:34.889> Cartman's<00:03:35.310> plans<00:03:35.639> is<00:03:35.909> more<00:03:36.239> because<00:03:36.419> he

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
with Cartman's plans is more because he

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.599 
with Cartman's plans is more because he
wants<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.840> spend<00:03:37.079> time<00:03:37.290> with<00:03:37.620> his<00:03:38.099> brother

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
wants to spend time with his brother

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.819 
wants to spend time with his brother
very<00:03:39.299> cool<00:03:39.659> theory<00:03:40.109> Murray<00:03:40.290> thank<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.680> for

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
very cool theory Murray thank you for

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.289 
very cool theory Murray thank you for
sending<00:03:40.949> that<00:03:41.069> into<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.459> show<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.729> really<00:03:42.180> do

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
sending that into the show I really do

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.159 
sending that into the show I really do
appreciate<00:03:42.599> that

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
appreciate that

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.930 
appreciate that
so<00:03:43.739> let<00:03:44.040> me<00:03:44.099> know<00:03:44.220> what<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.430> guys<00:03:44.549> think<00:03:44.819> about

them by letting me know in the comment
section<00:03:50.250> by<00:03:50.489> saying<00:03:51.359> one<00:03:51.690> two<00:03:52.049> or<00:03:52.260> three<00:03:52.560> it's

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
section by saying one two or three it's

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.619 
section by saying one two or three it's
a<00:03:52.859> reminder<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.909> very<00:03:54.090> first<00:03:54.329> three<00:03:54.479> was

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
a reminder that the very first three was

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.599 
a reminder that the very first three was
on<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.959> bender<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.530> Futurama<00:03:55.979> the<00:03:56.310> second

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
on a bender and Futurama the second

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.520 
on a bender and Futurama the second
thing<00:03:56.699> it<00:03:56.790> was<00:03:56.879> on<00:03:56.970> Sponge<00:03:57.419> Bob<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:58.229> the<00:03:58.349> third

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
thing it was on Sponge Bob and the third

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.280 
thing it was on Sponge Bob and the third
theory<00:03:58.769> was<00:03:59.099> on<00:03:59.310> South<00:04:00.269> Park<00:04:00.599> so<00:04:00.780> drop<00:04:01.049> drop<00:04:01.260> a

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
theory was on South Park so drop drop a

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.780 
theory was on South Park so drop drop a
comment<00:04:01.620> with<00:04:01.919> which<00:04:02.220> one<00:04:02.459> you<00:04:02.609> thought<00:04:02.729> was
