like fish yes I do certainly actually I
started<00:00:28.009> when<00:00:28.130> I<00:00:28.160> was<00:00:28.220> nine<00:00:28.610> year<00:00:28.820> old<00:00:29.000> we

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:29.149 
started when I was nine year old we

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.049 
started when I was nine year old we
bought<00:00:29.300> my<00:00:29.390> first<00:00:29.509> aquarium<00:00:30.169> I<00:00:30.349> think<00:00:30.590> was<00:00:30.739> a

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.059 
bought my first aquarium I think was a

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.370 
bought my first aquarium I think was a
paradise<00:00:32.059> fish<00:00:32.390> building<00:00:32.809> a<00:00:32.870> bubble<00:00:33.170> nest

paradise fish building a bubble nest
Yeah<00:00:33.860> right<00:00:33.980> okay<00:00:34.760> now<00:00:35.300> your<00:00:35.450> database<00:00:35.990> gets

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
Yeah right okay now your database gets

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.860 
Yeah right okay now your database gets
over<00:00:36.740> a<00:00:36.770> million<00:00:37.130> hits<00:00:37.280> every<00:00:38.090> day<00:00:38.300> who

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
over a million hits every day who

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.320 
over a million hits every day who
exactly<00:00:39.140> is<00:00:39.470> using<00:00:39.950> it<00:00:40.100> well<00:00:41.000> it's<00:00:41.150> mostly

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
exactly is using it well it's mostly

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.300 
exactly is using it well it's mostly
actually<00:00:42.100> anglers<00:00:43.100> divers<00:00:44.060> aquarists<00:00:45.310> and

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
actually anglers divers aquarists and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.620 
actually anglers divers aquarists and
that's<00:00:46.490> funny<00:00:46.730> because<00:00:46.910> we<00:00:47.120> built<00:00:47.360> it<00:00:47.510> for

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
that's funny because we built it for

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.230 
that's funny because we built it for
scientists<00:00:48.200> to<00:00:48.350> help<00:00:48.590> improve<00:00:48.950> fisheries<00:00:49.430> but

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
scientists to help improve fisheries but

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.150 
scientists to help improve fisheries but
they<00:00:50.750> also<00:00:50.930> using<00:00:51.350> it<00:00:51.500> students<00:00:51.980> are<00:00:52.070> using

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
they also using it students are using

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.240 
they also using it students are using
obviously<00:00:52.940> but<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.510> bulk<00:00:53.840> now<00:00:54.290> is<00:00:54.620> really<00:00:54.950> lay

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
obviously but the bulk now is really lay

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.000 
obviously but the bulk now is really lay
persons<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.540> a<00:00:56.630> way<00:00:56.720> I<00:00:56.750> like<00:00:57.020> it<00:00:57.050> well<00:00:57.890> now

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
persons and in a way I like it well now

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.830 
persons and in a way I like it well now
you've<00:00:58.160> been<00:00:58.370> examining<00:00:59.090> the<00:00:59.239> data<00:00:59.450> on<00:00:59.630> fish

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
you've been examining the data on fish

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.720 
you've been examining the data on fish
for<00:01:00.050> about<00:01:00.200> 20<00:01:00.560> years<00:01:00.590> now<00:01:00.920> what<00:01:01.520> would<00:01:01.670> you

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
for about 20 years now what would you

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.660 
for about 20 years now what would you
say<00:01:02.090> is<00:01:02.360> is<00:01:02.810> the<00:01:03.110> most<00:01:03.290> worrisome<00:01:04.040> development

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
say is is the most worrisome development

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.960 
say is is the most worrisome development
most<00:01:05.449> worrisome<00:01:05.930> is<00:01:05.990> that<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:07.670> number<00:01:07.940> of

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
most worrisome is that the number of

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.670 
most worrisome is that the number of
threatened<00:01:08.360> fishes<00:01:08.659> is<00:01:08.810> increasing<00:01:09.440> every

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
threatened fishes is increasing every

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.070 
threatened fishes is increasing every
year<00:01:09.830> we<00:01:10.190> have<00:01:10.310> new<00:01:10.520> reports<00:01:10.940> of<00:01:11.060> youth<00:01:11.270> fish

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
year we have new reports of youth fish

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.830 
year we have new reports of youth fish
is<00:01:12.229> being<00:01:12.470> threatened<00:01:12.860> by<00:01:13.100> extinction<00:01:13.840> also

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
is being threatened by extinction also

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.270 
is being threatened by extinction also
the<00:01:14.930> number<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:15.170> stocks<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.620> are<00:01:15.740> overfished

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the number of stocks that are overfished

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.670 
the number of stocks that are overfished
and<00:01:16.580> threatened<00:01:17.240> by<00:01:17.330> collapse<00:01:17.780> is<00:01:18.020> increasing

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
and threatened by collapse is increasing

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.969 
and threatened by collapse is increasing
every<00:01:18.799> year<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.840> number<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:21.260> fish

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
every year and the number of fish

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.860 
every year and the number of fish
species<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:22.640> we<00:01:22.790> can<00:01:23.000> explore<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.570> do<00:01:23.690> not

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
species that we can explore and do not

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.560 
species that we can explore and do not
yet<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.350> diminishing<00:01:24.979> every<00:01:25.610> year<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:26.360> that

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
yet is diminishing every year so that

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.719 
yet is diminishing every year so that
are<00:01:26.690> very<00:01:26.810> wearisome<00:01:27.200> trends<00:01:27.710> has<00:01:28.460> anything

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
are very wearisome trends has anything

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.469 
are very wearisome trends has anything
improved<00:01:30.010> well<00:01:31.010> our<00:01:31.370> knowledge<00:01:31.820> has<00:01:31.850> improved

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
improved well our knowledge has improved

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.740 
improved well our knowledge has improved
yes<00:01:32.900> that's<00:01:33.380> what<00:01:33.560> we<00:01:33.710> did<00:01:33.920> we<00:01:34.580> there<00:01:35.330> is<00:01:35.510> more

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
yes that's what we did we there is more

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.990 
yes that's what we did we there is more
new<00:01:36.200> information<00:01:36.920> produced<00:01:37.100> about<00:01:37.610> fishes

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
new information produced about fishes

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.230 
new information produced about fishes
this<00:01:38.570> year<00:01:38.840> than<00:01:39.110> 10<00:01:39.440> years<00:01:39.470> ago<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:40.940> we

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
this year than 10 years ago and so we

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.820 
this year than 10 years ago and so we
know<00:01:41.450> more<00:01:41.690> but<00:01:42.020> that<00:01:42.229> really<00:01:42.440> doesn't<00:01:42.650> help

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
know more but that really doesn't help

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.910 
know more but that really doesn't help
them<00:01:43.100> much<00:01:43.280> now<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:44.210> just<00:01:44.720> like<00:01:44.869> we<00:01:45.020> saw<00:01:45.229> in<00:01:45.500> that

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
them much now I just like we saw in that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.460 
them much now I just like we saw in that
report<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.729> also<00:01:47.210> pursued<00:01:47.720> some<00:01:47.930> research<00:01:48.260> in

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
report you also pursued some research in

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.020 
report you also pursued some research in
the<00:01:48.560> Philippines<00:01:48.979> what<00:01:49.250> is<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.610> about<00:01:49.700> that

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
the Philippines what is it about that

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.270 
the Philippines what is it about that
area<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.479> makes<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.110> important<00:01:51.619> well

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
area that makes it so important well

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.890 
area that makes it so important well
when<00:01:52.670> we<00:01:52.820> set<00:01:53.060> up<00:01:53.150> fish<00:01:53.360> base<00:01:53.570> we<00:01:53.720> have<00:01:53.810> to

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
when we set up fish base we have to

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.270 
when we set up fish base we have to
think<00:01:54.110> where<00:01:54.320> in<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.439> world<00:01:54.560> can<00:01:54.770> we<00:01:54.920> do<00:01:55.100> this

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
think where in the world can we do this

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.429 
think where in the world can we do this
they<00:01:55.909> had<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.119> be<00:01:56.240> good<00:01:56.360> in<00:01:56.479> English<00:01:56.780> they<00:01:57.290> had

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
they had to be good in English they had

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.100 
they had to be good in English they had
to<00:01:57.590> be<00:01:57.770> good<00:01:58.040> in<00:01:58.250> science<00:01:58.580> and<00:01:59.090> they<00:01:59.720> had<00:01:59.869> to<00:01:59.990> be

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
to be good in science and they had to be

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.990 
to be good in science and they had to be
affordable<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.890> if<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.220> combine<00:02:01.369> that<00:02:01.580> very

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
affordable and if you combine that very

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.490 
affordable and if you combine that very
few<00:02:02.150> places<00:02:02.360> in<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.659> world<00:02:02.780> come<00:02:03.110> out<00:02:03.290> and

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
few places in the world come out and

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.710 
few places in the world come out and
Philippines<00:02:03.860> is<00:02:03.920> one<00:02:04.070> of<00:02:04.189> them<00:02:04.450> what<00:02:05.450> do<00:02:05.630> you

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
Philippines is one of them what do you

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.990 
Philippines is one of them what do you
think<00:02:05.960> is<00:02:06.080> causing<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.650> most<00:02:06.860> damage<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.580> fish

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
think is causing the most damage to fish

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.550 
think is causing the most damage to fish
stocks<00:02:08.330> at<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.659> moment<00:02:08.929> is<00:02:09.019> it<00:02:09.110> over<00:02:09.319> fishing

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
stocks at the moment is it over fishing

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.339 
stocks at the moment is it over fishing
or<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.310> environmental<00:02:10.970> damage<00:02:11.349> well

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
or is it environmental damage well

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.949 
or is it environmental damage well
actually<00:02:12.859> an<00:02:13.329> environmental<00:02:14.329> pollution<00:02:14.719> and

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
actually an environmental pollution and

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.660 
actually an environmental pollution and
so<00:02:15.169> on<00:02:15.230> works<00:02:15.529> only<00:02:15.709> close<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.159> the<00:02:16.279> coast

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
so on works only close to the coast

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.860 
so on works only close to the coast
too<00:02:16.760> close<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.209> source<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.720> pollution

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
too close to the source of the pollution

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.760 
too close to the source of the pollution
but<00:02:18.860> for<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.160> oceans<00:02:19.580> fishing<00:02:20.330> was<00:02:20.450> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
but for the oceans fishing was the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.070 
but for the oceans fishing was the
really<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.800> devastating<00:02:22.790> impact<00:02:22.910> we<00:02:23.870> are

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
really the devastating impact we are

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.780 
really the devastating impact we are
over<00:02:24.260> fishing<00:02:24.530> for<00:02:24.709> 50<00:02:25.069> years<00:02:25.220> now<00:02:25.370> five

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
over fishing for 50 years now five

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.820 
over fishing for 50 years now five
decades<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:26.900> can<00:02:27.080> see<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.260> results

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
decades and you can see the results

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.589 
decades and you can see the results
about<00:02:28.099> ninety<00:02:28.400> percent<00:02:28.489> of<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.910> biomass<00:02:29.360> that

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
about ninety percent of the biomass that

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.180 
about ninety percent of the biomass that
means<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.080> amount<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.560> fish<00:02:30.739> there<00:02:30.890> wasn't

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
means the amount of fish there wasn't

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.820 
means the amount of fish there wasn't
sea<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:32.120> we<00:02:32.239> could<00:02:32.420> eat<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:32.750> gone<00:02:33.050> so

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
sea and that we could eat is gone so

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.059 
sea and that we could eat is gone so
that<00:02:34.069> was<00:02:34.250> really<00:02:34.280> really<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:35.030> heavy<00:02:35.239> impact

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
that was really really a heavy impact

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.800 
that was really really a heavy impact
billions<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.220> people<00:02:37.400> some<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:37.940> them<00:02:38.180> are<00:02:38.420> the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
billions of people some of them are the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.710 
billions of people some of them are the
world's<00:02:39.170> poorest<00:02:39.590> really<00:02:40.010> depend<00:02:40.550> on<00:02:40.880> protein

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
world's poorest really depend on protein

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.309 
world's poorest really depend on protein
from<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.620> sea<00:02:43.000> can<00:02:44.000> we<00:02:44.300> afford<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.959> tell<00:02:45.140> them

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
from the sea can we afford to tell them

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.710 
from the sea can we afford to tell them
to<00:02:45.350> stop<00:02:45.830> fishing<00:02:46.130> so<00:02:46.459> much<00:02:46.640> well<00:02:47.330> can<00:02:47.599> we

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
to stop fishing so much well can we

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.270 
to stop fishing so much well can we
afford<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.200> continue<00:02:48.380> overfishing<00:02:49.069> and

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
afford to continue overfishing and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.160 
afford to continue overfishing and
further<00:02:49.610> reducing<00:02:50.239> what<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.510> sea<00:02:50.660> producers

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
further reducing what the sea producers

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.370 
further reducing what the sea producers
for<00:02:51.350> them<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:52.670> actually<00:02:53.480> we<00:02:53.600> have<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.900> step<00:02:54.140> in

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
for them so actually we have to step in

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.530 
for them so actually we have to step in
and<00:02:54.590> improve<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.580> situation<00:02:55.790> because<00:02:56.360> if<00:02:56.480> we

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
and improve the situation because if we

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.660 
and improve the situation because if we
do<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.750> then<00:02:57.319> in<00:02:57.500> four<00:02:57.860> or<00:02:57.950> five<00:02:58.190> ten<00:02:58.640> years

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
do that then in four or five ten years

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.150 
do that then in four or five ten years
from<00:02:58.940> now<00:02:59.120> then<00:02:59.480> cave<00:02:59.660> and<00:03:00.019> it<00:03:00.140> can<00:03:00.410> have<00:03:00.560> sixty

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
from now then cave and it can have sixty

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.949 
from now then cave and it can have sixty
percent<00:03:01.280> more<00:03:01.640> than<00:03:01.819> currently<00:03:02.209> from<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.720> sea

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
percent more than currently from the sea

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.770 
percent more than currently from the sea
so<00:03:03.830> can<00:03:04.610> we<00:03:04.700> afford<00:03:04.880> not<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.209> do<00:03:05.390> that<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.690> would

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
so can we afford not to do that it would

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.280 
so can we afford not to do that it would
I<00:03:05.959> would<00:03:06.230> rephrase<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:07.810> where<00:03:08.810> do<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.049> think

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
I would rephrase that where do you think

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.860 
I would rephrase that where do you think
will<00:03:09.769> be<00:03:09.950> about<00:03:10.400> 20<00:03:10.850> or<00:03:10.970> 30<00:03:11.239> years<00:03:11.330> from<00:03:11.660> now<00:03:11.750> do

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
will be about 20 or 30 years from now do

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.630 
will be about 20 or 30 years from now do
you<00:03:12.019> think<00:03:12.200> things<00:03:12.440> will<00:03:12.769> have<00:03:13.010> gotten<00:03:13.400> better

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
you think things will have gotten better

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.090 
you think things will have gotten better
or<00:03:14.030> will<00:03:14.390> they<00:03:14.510> have<00:03:14.600> got<00:03:14.780> Morse<00:03:15.019> I'm<00:03:15.799> see<00:03:16.040> me

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
or will they have got Morse I'm see me

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.250 
or will they have got Morse I'm see me
optimistic<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:16.850> working<00:03:17.120> hard<00:03:17.360> for<00:03:17.690> example

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
optimistic and working hard for example

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.289

in<00:03:18.319> Europe<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:18.860> repair<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.700> european<00:03:20.030> stocks

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
in Europe to repair the european stocks

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.910 
in Europe to repair the european stocks
and<00:03:20.540> if<00:03:20.600> we<00:03:20.690> do<00:03:20.900> then<00:03:21.170> in<00:03:21.290> 20<00:03:21.590> years<00:03:21.680> from<00:03:21.829> now

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
and if we do then in 20 years from now

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.370 
and if we do then in 20 years from now
we<00:03:22.700> will<00:03:22.730> have<00:03:22.940> sixty<00:03:23.269> percent<00:03:23.390> more<00:03:23.810> food

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
we will have sixty percent more food

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.349 
we will have sixty percent more food
from<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.769> sea<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.160> healthy<00:03:25.850> stocks<00:03:26.150> and

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
from the sea and healthy stocks and

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.620 
from the sea and healthy stocks and
large<00:03:26.720> fish<00:03:27.049> and<00:03:27.260> yeah<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:28.519> I'm<00:03:29.329> optimistic

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
large fish and yeah so I'm optimistic

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.560 
large fish and yeah so I'm optimistic
but<00:03:30.470> on<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.859> same<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.459> trends<00:03:31.880> are<00:03:32.030> against

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
but on the same the trends are against

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.849 
but on the same the trends are against
me<00:03:32.630> so<00:03:32.900> they<00:03:33.109> have<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.380> prove<00:03:33.560> me<00:03:33.739> wrong

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
me so they have to prove me wrong
