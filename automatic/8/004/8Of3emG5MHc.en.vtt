00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.959
 trained that the south 

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:06.410
 however there is still a lot left for these prosthetic robots to imitate 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.409
 to perfection the movement of a leg 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:13.229
 the human muscle not only stretches but shrinks but is part of a 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:17.730
 very complex system of force velocity position sensors that a 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.380
 turn 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.380
 is connected to the neurocognitive system 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.849
 In addition, it achieves high levels of power, which together with its high 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.009
 efficiency and low consumption make it very difficult to reduce it with 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.440
 Current technology 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.340
 it's hard for us to compete 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.320
 with biological technology 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.750
 according to the training 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.990
 min in its same field 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.530
 we can compete in the fields for example 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.290
 the speed after descending a bad these people of low compared with the song 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.100
 of information through an electric cable 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.240
 but nevertheless 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.480
 using electrical cables our focus are being 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.870
 we humans do not fall 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.560
 perhaps the answer because our biological system and superior systems 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.500
 robotic and haiti our brain that is able to coordinate the motor system 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.490
 of the body and react in a plastic and flexible way to stimuli 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.520
 of the environment 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.470
 what to learn 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.470
 that uses predictive models to control movement 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.660
 technologically we can compete with nature but paradoxically not 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.660
 we can overcome thousands of years of evolution 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.320
 So actually what is happening to me is that life would be more 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.070
 maskin mass the country be more pleasant more commune so we can 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.490
 start to better use energy efe 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.280
 &amp; poor's I think the reason why people start observing the world 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.210
 natural in search of inspiration is 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.440
 is because we have to find a way to reduce our consumption of 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.590
 fossil fuels option 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.590
 and use the minimum amount of energy 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.310
 but we do not have infinite materials 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.659
 showmatch therefore we must decrease our use of materials 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.420
 Pacho Navarre tells us we are drowning in our own poison ap 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:16.979
 we have to stop using toxic assured and when you go out into the natural world 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:21.799
 when you walk by nature obama you are in a chemistry lab in 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.069
 the one that does not have to wear masks 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.129
 protective crumbs because life has figured out how to do that 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.459
 we try to do now 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.840
 wallace so that if our economy imitate the jimÃ©nez natural world yes 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.269
 our designs to imitate the debate even the economy we would be a 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.739
 most welcome species on the living planet dt 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.109
 you know if that sheet that we talked about before the cis 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.039
 we are going so the most incredible thing of the leaf is the second act of its life because 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:51.009
 this people 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:55.349
 in this sack they have determined to gather solar energy to defend the plant and 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.689
 to control its temperature 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:58.909
 created at the zoo 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.659
 then fell to the ground altogether in spain young and in the second act of his 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.659
 life becomes nutritious substance for something else 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.389
 epic games efe a date a bush a plant 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.889
 adopt 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.289
 acz instead our technologies stop us from infiltrating poison into the earth 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:22.919
 so we should look a little more like the sheet 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:27.469
 that is the trick we must learn if we want to stand 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.649
 I like the idea that 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:36.629
 is really 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.939
 if we inspire weeks 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.389
 about 15 children following the mechanisms of nature 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.809
 we could go around without so much mask 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:51.459
 and without as much protection as we need when we walk 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:53.869
 in the world 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:56.359
 that we have manufactured 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.569
 trying to imitate not nature 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.569
 if not the industry 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:09.049
