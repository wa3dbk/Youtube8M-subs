here I'm gonna drop my barbarian King on

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.949 
here I'm gonna drop my barbarian King on
the<00:02:17.920> camp<00:02:18.220> on<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.459> bottom<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.030> he's<00:02:19.569> gonna<00:02:19.720> go

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
the camp on the bottom and he's gonna go

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.880 
the camp on the bottom and he's gonna go
straight<00:02:20.349> for<00:02:20.560> those<00:02:21.000> what'd<00:02:22.000> he<00:02:22.060> call<00:02:22.120> that

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
straight for those what'd he call that

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.559 
straight for those what'd he call that
barracks<00:02:23.890> yeah<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.310> guess<00:02:25.120> that's<00:02:25.329> what<00:02:25.390> they

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
barracks yeah I guess that's what they

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.899 
barracks yeah I guess that's what they
called<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.049> it's<00:02:27.010> also<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.549> deployment

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
called and it's also that deployment

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.850 
called and it's also that deployment
because<00:02:28.209> barracks<00:02:28.750> are<00:02:28.870> pretty<00:02:29.079> strong<00:02:29.379> if

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
because barracks are pretty strong if

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.890 
because barracks are pretty strong if
you<00:02:29.920> compare<00:02:30.610> them<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.819> any<00:02:31.239> other<00:02:31.450> buildings

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
you compare them to any other buildings

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.170 
you compare them to any other buildings
they<00:02:32.110> have<00:02:32.319> pretty<00:02:32.590> good<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.610> know<00:02:33.640> damage

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
they have pretty good you know damage

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.800 
they have pretty good you know damage
control

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.199 
control

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
now I'm hoping you know that my king is

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.979 
now I'm hoping you know that my king is
gonna<00:02:42.400> take<00:02:42.700> out<00:02:42.879> those<00:02:43.090> four<00:02:43.329> buildings<00:02:43.720> get

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
gonna take out those four buildings get

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.789 
gonna take out those four buildings get
me<00:02:44.109> to<00:02:44.260> 45<00:02:44.769> or<00:02:45.040> 46<00:02:45.790> percent<00:02:46.540> yeah<00:02:47.440> there<00:02:47.680> we<00:02:47.769> go

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
me to 45 or 46 percent yeah there we go

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.099 
me to 45 or 46 percent yeah there we go
45<00:02:48.430> percent<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.180> think<00:02:49.420> that's<00:02:49.599> about<00:02:49.750> it

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
45 percent and I think that's about it

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.789 
45 percent and I think that's about it
so<00:02:50.739> I've<00:02:50.950> deployed<00:02:51.190> my<00:02:51.579> Archer<00:02:52.150> Queen<00:02:52.389> and

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
so I've deployed my Archer Queen and

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.349 
so I've deployed my Archer Queen and
once<00:02:53.799> again<00:02:54.129> like<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.459> said<00:02:54.519> I'm<00:02:54.849> just<00:02:54.879> hoping

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
once again like I said I'm just hoping

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.750 
once again like I said I'm just hoping
that<00:02:55.420> she's<00:02:55.720> gonna<00:02:55.840> be<00:02:56.019> able<00:02:56.139> to<00:02:56.260> take<00:02:56.560> 50%<00:02:57.430> it

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
that she's gonna be able to take 50% it

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.069 
that she's gonna be able to take 50% it
looks<00:02:57.970> like<00:02:58.180> we're<00:02:58.569> not<00:02:58.659> gonna<00:02:58.840> have<00:02:59.049> any

looks like we're not gonna have any
problem<00:02:59.680> but<00:02:59.889> I'm<00:03:00.159> pretty<00:03:00.700> disappointed

that's<00:03:13.690> insane<00:03:14.260> but<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:14.739> was<00:03:15.160> pretty<00:03:15.579> upset

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
that's insane but I was pretty upset

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.210 
that's insane but I was pretty upset
that<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.299> was<00:03:16.419> only<00:03:16.569> one<00:03:16.930> star<00:03:17.290> in<00:03:17.530> only<00:03:17.799> three

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.670 
that it was only one star in only three
trophies<00:03:18.699> but<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.239> would<00:03:19.810> not<00:03:19.959> skip<00:03:20.319> it<00:03:20.440> for<00:03:20.470> the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
trophies but I would not skip it for the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.710 
trophies but I would not skip it for the
world<00:03:20.859> because<00:03:21.310> it's<00:03:22.000> not<00:03:22.269> every<00:03:22.449> day<00:03:22.599> that

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
world because it's not every day that

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.539 
world because it's not every day that
you<00:03:22.959> get<00:03:23.139> to<00:03:23.290> attack<00:03:23.530> some<00:03:23.799> of<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:23.980> legends<00:03:24.340> in

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
you get to attack some of the legends in

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.509 
you get to attack some of the legends in
clash<00:03:24.849> of<00:03:25.030> clans<00:03:25.329> so<00:03:25.660> my<00:03:26.530> camps<00:03:26.919> are<00:03:27.040> full<00:03:27.250> here

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
clash of clans so my camps are full here

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.059 
clash of clans so my camps are full here
it<00:03:28.150> took<00:03:28.329> me<00:03:28.510> that<00:03:28.780> long<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:29.109> find<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.799> decent

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
it took me that long to find a decent

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.640 
it took me that long to find a decent
base<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.639> attack<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.269> what<00:03:32.199> else<00:03:32.349> to<00:03:32.500> do<00:03:32.620> I

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
base to attack and what else to do I

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.490 
base to attack and what else to do I
guess<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:33.280> go<00:03:33.639> back<00:03:33.879> to<00:03:34.540> searching<00:03:34.930> yet

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
guess to go back to searching yet

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.559 
guess to go back to searching yet

the 35 level King also a bunch of

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.160 
the 35 level King also a bunch of
skeletons<00:05:25.860> I<00:05:26.490> had<00:05:27.150> to<00:05:27.360> use<00:05:27.570> his<00:05:27.870> special

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
skeletons I had to use his special

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.610 
skeletons I had to use his special
ability<00:05:28.640> right<00:05:29.640> away<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.180> it<00:05:30.450> gets<00:05:30.690> me<00:05:30.870> to<00:05:30.900> 49

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
ability right away and it gets me to 49

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.300 
ability right away and it gets me to 49
percent<00:05:31.820> that<00:05:32.820> did<00:05:33.000> not<00:05:33.180> go<00:05:33.510> as<00:05:33.540> well<00:05:34.260> but<00:05:35.040> I

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
percent that did not go as well but I

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.640 
percent that did not go as well but I
also<00:05:35.490> think<00:05:36.000> that<00:05:36.090> I've<00:05:36.510> used<00:05:36.990> my<00:05:37.230> Archer

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
also think that I've used my Archer

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.710 
also think that I've used my Archer
Quinn<00:05:37.860> on<00:05:37.950> the<00:05:38.010> top<00:05:38.220> because<00:05:38.610> I<00:05:38.640> thought<00:05:38.970> there

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
Quinn on the top because I thought there

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.330 
Quinn on the top because I thought there
is<00:05:39.750> no<00:05:39.870> way<00:05:40.050> she's<00:05:40.470> gonna<00:05:40.560> fail<00:05:40.890> here<00:05:41.160> she's

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
is no way she's gonna fail here she's

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.160 
is no way she's gonna fail here she's
gonna<00:05:41.460> go<00:05:41.670> for<00:05:41.700> the<00:05:42.030> archer<00:05:42.450> tower<00:05:42.720> first

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
gonna go for the archer tower first

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.010 
gonna go for the archer tower first
that's<00:05:43.500> gonna<00:05:43.710> get<00:05:43.890> me<00:05:43.980> to<00:05:44.280> 50%<00:05:44.850> and<00:05:45.420> then<00:05:45.990> I

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
that's gonna get me to 50% and then I

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.720 
that's gonna get me to 50% and then I
hope<00:05:46.290> she's<00:05:46.560> gonna<00:05:46.680> take<00:05:46.950> out<00:05:47.160> the<00:05:47.280> Town<00:05:47.490> Hall

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
hope she's gonna take out the Town Hall

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.420 
hope she's gonna take out the Town Hall
and<00:05:47.970> that's<00:05:48.420> exactly<00:05:49.290> what<00:05:49.560> is<00:05:49.680> going<00:05:49.770> on<00:05:50.130> here

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430
