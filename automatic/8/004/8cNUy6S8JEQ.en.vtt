like<00:02:07.759> if<00:02:07.880> they're<00:02:08.060> on<00:02:08.179> your<00:02:08.300> roof

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
like if they're on your roof

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.570 
like if they're on your roof
but<00:02:09.379> for<00:02:09.530> these<00:02:09.619> circumstances<00:02:09.950> is

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
but for these circumstances is

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.610 
but for these circumstances is
indeterminate<00:02:13.989> so<00:02:14.989> now<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.170> have<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.410> strip

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
indeterminate so now you have to strip

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.289 
indeterminate so now you have to strip
the<00:02:15.739> ends<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.129> the<00:02:16.280> wires<00:02:16.489> so<00:02:16.910> they'll<00:02:17.120> be<00:02:17.209> able

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
the ends of the wires so they'll be able

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.059 
the ends of the wires so they'll be able
to<00:02:17.420> fit<00:02:17.569> into<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.870> charge<00:02:18.080> controller<00:02:18.349> onto

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
controller wide inch or battery now we

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.960 
controller wide inch or battery now we
have<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:58.920> connect<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.190> panel<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.640> charge

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
have to connect the panel to the charge

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.650 
have to connect the panel to the charge
controller

controller

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.420 
controller
and<00:04:01.200> we<00:04:01.260> do<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.500> in<00:04:01.560> exactly<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.100> same<00:04:02.160> way

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
and we do that in exactly the same way

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.090 
and we do that in exactly the same way
by<00:04:03.239> stripping<00:04:03.510> 1.5<00:04:04.140> centimeters<00:04:04.380> off<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:04.890> end

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
by stripping 1.5 centimeters off the end

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.930 
by stripping 1.5 centimeters off the end
of<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.220> wires

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.640 

and<00:04:13.940> then<00:04:14.090> simply<00:04:14.390> following<00:04:14.780> these<00:04:14.900> in<00:04:15.140> the

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
and then simply following these in the

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.740 
and then simply following these in the
charge<00:04:15.890> controller<00:04:16.190> with<00:04:16.489> positive<00:04:16.970> here<00:04:17.180> and

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
charge controller with positive here and

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.620 
charge controller with positive here and
the<00:04:17.840> negative<00:04:17.989> there<00:04:19.150> so<00:04:20.150> now<00:04:20.299> you<00:04:20.359> need<00:04:20.510> to

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
the negative there so now you need to

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.909 
the negative there so now you need to
work<00:04:20.660> out<00:04:20.930> which<00:04:21.079> is<00:04:21.199> the<00:04:21.260> positive<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.799> the

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
work out which is the positive and the

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.360 
work out which is the positive and the
negative<00:04:21.949> wire<00:04:23.410> on<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.500> back<00:04:24.530> here<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.070> have

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
negative wire on the back here you have

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.610 
negative wire on the back here you have
this<00:04:25.580> one<00:04:25.760> labels<00:04:26.150> negative<00:04:26.600> this<00:04:27.470> one

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
this one labels negative this one

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.800 
this one labels negative this one
labeled<00:04:27.949> is<00:04:28.010> positive<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:29.360> another<00:04:29.600> way<00:04:29.780> of

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
labeled is positive and another way of

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.590 
labeled is positive and another way of
working<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.290> out<00:04:30.470> is<00:04:31.100> that<00:04:31.310> always<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:32.300> solar

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
working it out is that always and solar

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.719 
working it out is that always and solar
panels<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.590> positive<00:04:34.040> is<00:04:34.250> on<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.490> right<00:04:34.699> of
