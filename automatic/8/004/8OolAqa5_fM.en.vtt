00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.920
 good on second unit 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.410
 we will find the question of 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.790
 document-related curriculum 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.519
 official 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.480
 she will present considerations 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.179
 essential in defining the curriculum 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.250
 school as social experiences 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.240
 accumulated by children throughout the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.970
 its existence 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.779
 it is also to contemplate the question 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.599
 curricular activities through existing legislation 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.529
 it is through the expectations of 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.900
 improvement and the sense of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.760
 constant observation of the issues 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.890
 linked to equality and the differences 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.410
 unit plan 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.460
 divided into four sub items 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.190
 the first will talk about the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.840
 Brazilian federal constitution 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.230
 the law of guidelines and bases of education 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.610
 National 9394 96 something about the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.219
 curricular guidelines for education 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.440
 national referential curriculum 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.920
 for early childhood education 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.229
 official documents such as the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.409
 suggested school curriculum formation 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.720
 official documents which means 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.229
 reflect on how it has been treated 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.159
 curricular theme and its importance 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.159
 for the socio- cultural process 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:23.159
 the proposals within this unit are of 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.350
 critical analysis of the way it is formed 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.900
 curriculum referenced in the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.090
 legal documents of the country and which 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.579
 basis for the development of 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.610
 education in our country 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.740
 In this sense, the author opted for the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.619
 from three legal documents 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:48.420
 the federal constitution from 88 to ldb of 96 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.390
 that neither the law 9394 96 nor the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.340
 curriculum for early childhood education 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.439
 it would not be appropriate for the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.659
 one of these documents as I have already stated 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.299
 before what you are seeing is just 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.240
 an extract of what is very good 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.740
 developed there in printed matter 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.930
 so be sure to follow the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.349
 and ask anytime you want 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.709
 know something more clearly 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:16.409
 the constitution at first says that the 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.019
 education is a constitutional right of 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:22.040
 all and is the responsibility of the state 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.030
 the family and in this sense it should be 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.629
 encouraged with the collaboration of 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.940
 society notes that in this case the 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.670
 full development of the person to 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.110
 preparation for the exercise of citizenship 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.629
 professional qualification is 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.790
 evidenced the constitution is a 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.010
 document that is put simply 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.260
 and direct in its purpose that is the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:49.099
 guarantee of citizenship and preparation for 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.420
 the labor market already ldb 9394 96 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:55.799
 defines education in its title a 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.769
 Article 1 as education covers the 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.170
 processes that are developing 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.230
 in family life in human coexistence 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.989
 work to educational institutions and 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.569
 research on social movements and 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.459
 civil society organizations and 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.769
 cultural manifestations 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.720
 consider the definition of 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.329
 school curriculum as the 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.489
 social experiences accumulated by the 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.299
 children and young people throughout their 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.609
 existence 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.549
 time and comes closer to the 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:30.510
 expectations of the study that we are now 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.879
 performing in this unit a brief 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.849
 allusion to curricular guidelines 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.730
 for early childhood education and the 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.230
 national curricular references 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.769
 also for this same stage of education 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.660
 basic and what the reason is a thing 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.760
 important to observe in the curriculum 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.720
 school is that it will start to 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.359
 to delineate 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.120
 from the earliest age although this 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:57.449
 stage of early childhood education is not a 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.120
 passport to the next step it is 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:03.000
 of fundamental importance for 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.370
 some knowledge is built and 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.889
 in it we will find the whole base 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.780
 of what is to come in terms of 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.299
 construction of knowledge and 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.540
 schooling 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:19.530
 summarizing problematizing education and 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.799
 dialogically analyzes during the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.990
 school curriculum formation 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.000
 moments of the country that were 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.129
 created to serve as a basis for 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.870
 development of Brazilian education 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:33.050
 of these documents as I already said 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.830
 formerly part of the constitution 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:40.400
 at ldb 9394 96 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.210
 the constitution of 88 and the referential 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.610
 curriculum for early childhood education 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.340
 the result of the critical analysis of this group 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.490
 school curriculum 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.409
 group of legal documents forming the 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.900
 school curriculum is that the 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:59.629
 should be created and 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.340
 period period and the 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.259
 creators of such documents 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.620
 official documents are professionals 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:09.319
 education and teachers of the school 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.159
 way to contextualize the environment 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.319
 school 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.449
 the school community where 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:18.620
 happening exactly the proposal 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.030
 must be observed is of the utmost importance. 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.940
 importance that is taken into 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.169
 We therefore conclude that the 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.940
 unit 2 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.039
 We are waiting for you in the next unit. 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.830
 remembering that this unit to which 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.050
 we just saw her dealing with the documents 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.680
 important officers you can 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.319
 search the mec website and 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.120
 in the printed material where you 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:43.120
 you will find much more information
