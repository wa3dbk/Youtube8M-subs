00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.250
 and good to all here comment but 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.750
 that are having fun because I 'm going to 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.370
 bored with our new video and the day 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.190
 today we are with a small tutorial 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.410
 of how to change a block an item of a 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.039
 pack of three figures to another and good 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.169
 without further ado let's start 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.579
 and good what they need would be a 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.500
 base textures package that in this 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.210
 case is going to be my faithfull here is 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.300
 and another package in which we want 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.939
 change the block or item of this of this 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.079
 textures pack to the other to the firewall and 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.300
 Well the first thing they have to do is 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:37.000
 open faithfull or face or your package 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:40.250
 of base splugas let's do michael to 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.510
 we are going to give textures and here is inside 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.420
 this folder here is what they are 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.720
 blocks and what are items and that's what 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.720
 What we want 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.640
 good 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.560
 and well inside this folder we hope 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.480
 what are the blocks and the items like that 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.540
 that we drag them or put them on 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.160
 directly to the folder in this 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.540
 case I create a folder called my 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.140
 pack 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.350
 and we passed it or we copied it and here already 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.780
 we will have what is being these 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.260
 blocks and the items now it's still not 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.090
 all 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.100
 this this folder so the saw or the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.200
 leave as you want now let's what 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.450
 which is the other textures package that 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.939
 in this case of the raid craft 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.600
 and good here is basically the same 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.490
 let's make minecraft textures and here 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.670
 is what are blocks and council 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.229
 so they do not get confused put a 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.510
 new folder and enter the name of the 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.700
 so you do not confuse your craft network 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.230
 and within this already can what is is 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.640
 replace or put these blocks 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.490
 items and we drag them here 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.640
 We wait for it to load and once 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:03.260
 it's closed and we open again 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.260
 so that it becomes a little more dynamic 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.470
 well here in this folder and 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.690
 what we will first change 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.690
 what is the king craft blocks 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.190
 what is this 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.500
 in this case I choose what you 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.100
 you want to change in this case I 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.100
 I will choose 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.480
 I do not know what to choose 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.940
 You can choose the diamond block without 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.220
 that I put a control and I put it in 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.950
 the folder and we replace the file in 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.740
 the destination and here is what we change 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.320
 bone we replace so to speak 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.730
 with they can do with all a 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.030
 advice if you want to change the bed 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.860
 copy everything 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.680
 not everyone but everyone who comes here 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.850
 this 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.540
 and everything that has to do 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.230
 the bed duty is put in control c and 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.900
 change it here control 20 and replace 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.000
 the files in the destination and so if 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.420
 they want to do for example at the table the 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.330
 flutter or in the oven and anything 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.310
 good one time 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.750
 and now you take your time I the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:28.860
 I want in the last object 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.300
 the control stone see and replace them 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.500
 good since they have their father and texture 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.390
 you take your calm 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.400
 also of your time everything calmly 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.560
 hurry you do it carefully if 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.020
 you if not a little fast and good and 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.270
 who have it now we go to the interns 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.430
 it can be the other way around in that first 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.950
 goal or if only first blocks 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.579
 and good here what we would have is this 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.500
 the items and here's an infinity of 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:02.030
 things to choose in this case I'm going to 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.030
 put the diamond sword 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.760
 the control copy paste it 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.560
 control and we replaced it 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.550
 and if with all the objects in this case 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:19.190
 I also want the peak control c 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.190
 and against beige or want to wait 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.580
 and now, you see , there are 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.020
 countless things that can do them 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.730
 I repeat that this can not be done 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.650
 also with a couple of cells can be 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.610
 with those who want they can put die 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.230
 cheatle 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.180
 farmer crankcase or what you guys 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.500
 want some consumer imaginations me 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.500
 liked speedboat control c 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:41.410
 and control see 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.680
 and we replace the file in the destination 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.930
 and that's it and once we have 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.900
 we remove this and the base folder or the 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.650
 base package here is already that 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.650
 we open the firewall 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.220
 and what we are going to do is open the 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.400
 folder that I made my impact 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:03.900
 here what we open up to where is 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.750
 assets minecraft textures here these two 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.290
 things that was also we changed everything 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.500
 what is the swords and the bed and everything and 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.820
 good the blocks 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.009
 we can accept 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.379
 and it is already 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.700
 when it is loaded and the package of 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:22.620
 textures or one 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.390
 then the systems that we want 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.060
 change I think we have to you must 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.730
 our minecraft point folder with a 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.650
 air control execute and percent 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.230
 we put it percent app data by 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.690
 hundred in accept let's go to point 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:40.470
 minecraft let's solve texture packs 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.270
 packs depends on what you have and the 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.000
 result then the third pack what 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.470
 we drag to this clear part no 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.530
 another minecraft in this case I have 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.970
 open good I have mods that does not imply 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.970
 nothing for replacing the first language 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:00.300
 we record 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.430
 here in options 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.030
 package of resources and here we have what 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.020
 what is the firewall 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:11.449
 we do not select and you're ready 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.449
 now let's call 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.960
 okay 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.550
 and we wait 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.120
 and in this case I'm going to cut but that 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.770
 It has just started and we are leaving until now 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.699
 and well we are already in what is the micro 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.740
 and I'm in third person and well now 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.920
 let's see the items that were changed 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.650
 for then with the imperative 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.380
 because he's already here and how they saw here is 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.350
 the diamond sword already changed and that 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.840
 other things we change what is the the 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.200
 stone ax changes so it is the 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.200
 bed 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.870
 true 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.650
 and well you see how it is 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.870
 does not have to see the users can 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.810
 make you a texture tunnel that 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:16.350
 we remove what is the ax 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:18.450
 you well and what is the sword 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.460
 so nothing would come but basically 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:23.610
 tutorial I hope you liked it

 tutorials on something of which ms 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:38.520
 If you want it to change, you do not

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:44.830
