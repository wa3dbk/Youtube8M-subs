00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
about this icing sugar so this icing

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.130 
about this icing sugar so this icing
sugar<00:00:40.070> is<00:00:40.399> nothing<00:00:40.879> but<00:00:41.089> powdered<00:00:41.570> sugar

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
sugar is nothing but powdered sugar

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
sugar into a blender pot so first we're

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.289 
sugar into a blender pot so first we're
gonna<00:01:31.700> put<00:01:32.119> it<00:01:32.299> on<00:01:32.450> our<00:01:33.039> crystal<00:01:34.039> sugar<00:01:34.299> so

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
gonna put it on our crystal sugar so

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:43.779 
gonna put it on our crystal sugar so
we'll<00:01:35.509> give<00:01:36.109> it<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.319> pulse<00:01:36.530> few<00:01:36.889> times<00:01:42.280> now<00:01:43.280> just

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
we'll give it a pulse few times now just

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.120 
we'll give it a pulse few times now just
don't<00:01:44.119> put<00:01:44.359> your<00:01:44.600> blender<00:01:44.990> on<00:01:45.170> high<00:01:45.499> and<00:01:45.740> leave

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
don't put your blender on high and leave

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.940 
don't put your blender on high and leave
the<00:01:46.310> sugar<00:01:46.729> part<00:01:47.479> blending<00:01:47.929> for<00:01:48.139> a<00:01:48.200> minute<00:01:48.649> as

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
the sugar part blending for a minute as

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.399 
the sugar part blending for a minute as
the<00:01:49.310> heat<00:01:49.819> under<00:01:50.060> terapia<00:01:50.719> this<00:01:50.959> blender

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
the heat under terapia this blender

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.389 
the heat under terapia this blender
blender<00:01:52.100> blades<00:01:52.310> can't<00:01:53.209> burn<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:54.049> sugar<00:01:54.679> now

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
blender blades can't burn this sugar now

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.940 
blender blades can't burn this sugar now
pulsing<00:01:55.969> this<00:01:56.209> a<00:01:56.420> sugar<00:01:56.840> for<00:01:57.139> a<00:01:57.170> few<00:01:57.439> seconds

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
pulsing this a sugar for a few seconds

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.669 
pulsing this a sugar for a few seconds
then<00:01:58.280> scrapping<00:01:58.759> down<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.090> sides<00:01:59.389> and

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
then scrapping down the sides and

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.769 
then scrapping down the sides and
pulsing<00:02:00.679> it<00:02:00.889> again<00:02:01.369> will<00:02:01.700> prevent<00:02:02.119> this<00:02:02.389> sugar

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:02.779 
pulsing it again will prevent this sugar

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:10.260 
pulsing it again will prevent this sugar
from<00:02:03.079> overheating

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.410 

alright<00:02:11.270> let's<00:02:11.690> check<00:02:12.020> that<00:02:12.170> out

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.790 

perfect<00:02:18.420> now<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:19.880> sugar<00:02:20.880> is<00:02:20.940> ready<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:22.740> has

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
perfect now this sugar is ready it has

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.450 
perfect now this sugar is ready it has
turned<00:02:23.220> into<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.820> fine<00:02:24.270> powder<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:26.340> know

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
turned into a fine powder you know

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.720 
turned into a fine powder you know
finally<00:02:27.300> we'll<00:02:27.510> add<00:02:27.690> in<00:02:28.020> this<00:02:28.640> tablespoon<00:02:29.640> of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
finally we'll add in this tablespoon of

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:42.800 
finally we'll add in this tablespoon of
cornstarch<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:35.600> mix<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.690> Ruffy<00:02:41.810> will

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
cornstarch in that mix that Ruffy will

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.470 
cornstarch in that mix that Ruffy will
close<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.350> up<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.830> we'll<00:02:44.400> give<00:02:45.000> this<00:02:45.180> few

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
close this up and we'll give this few

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.720 
close this up and we'll give this few
more<00:02:45.690> pulses<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.470> cornstarch<00:02:53.070> acts<00:02:53.430> as

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
more pulses and this cornstarch acts as

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.900 
more pulses and this cornstarch acts as
a<00:02:53.790> binding<00:02:54.270> agent<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.900> now<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:56.100> icing<00:02:56.730> sugar

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
a binding agent and now this icing sugar

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.110 
a binding agent and now this icing sugar
is<00:02:57.240> all<00:02:57.570> ready<00:02:57.840> now<00:02:58.740> let<00:02:58.950> me<00:02:59.130> just<00:02:59.640> transfer

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
is all ready now let me just transfer

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:10.800 
is all ready now let me just transfer
this<00:03:02.360> take<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.390> deep<00:03:03.720> purple

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.670 

we'll<00:03:11.810> give<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.710> one<00:03:13.190> more<00:03:13.430> gentle<00:03:13.820> looks

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
we'll give that one more gentle looks

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.720 
we'll give that one more gentle looks
and<00:03:15.680> remove<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.430> forget<00:03:17.360> that

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.150 

and<00:03:22.730> this<00:03:23.600> convert<00:03:24.170> that<00:03:24.440> actually<00:03:24.980> we<00:03:25.130> have

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
and this convert that actually we have

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.050 
and this convert that actually we have
added<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.450> powdered<00:03:26.840> sugar<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:28.060> actually

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
added in the powdered sugar it actually

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.990 
added in the powdered sugar it actually
acts<00:03:29.300> as<00:03:29.570> a<00:03:29.660> binding<00:03:30.380> agent<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:31.100> at<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.760> same

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
acts as a binding agent and at the same

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.360 
acts as a binding agent and at the same
time<00:03:32.300> it<00:03:32.600> also<00:03:32.780> prevents<00:03:33.470> this<00:03:33.650> icing<00:03:34.160> sugar

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
time it also prevents this icing sugar
