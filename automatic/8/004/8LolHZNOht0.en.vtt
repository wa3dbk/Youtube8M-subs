the inside about four inches down the
valve<00:00:25.560> cover<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.670> if<00:00:26.849> they've<00:00:27.060> been<00:00:27.210> on<00:00:27.390> there

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
valve cover so if they've been on there

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.810 
valve cover so if they've been on there
for<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.779> long<00:00:27.930> time<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> tendency<00:00:29.550> of

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
for a long time they have a tendency of

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.179 
for a long time they have a tendency of
dry<00:00:30.179> rot<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.840> dry<00:00:31.140> out<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.740> could<00:00:31.920> become

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
dry rot and dry out and it could become

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.520 
dry rot and dry out and it could become
hard<00:00:32.489> or<00:00:32.669> brittle<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.690> first<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.290> want<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
hard or brittle so first you want to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.049 
hard or brittle so first you want to
twist<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.980> wire<00:00:35.160> just<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.550> little<00:00:35.790> bit<00:00:35.880> back

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
twist the wire just a little bit back

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.540 
twist the wire just a little bit back
and<00:00:36.270> forth<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.600> break<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.960> free<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.410> then<00:00:38.340> just

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and forth to break it free and then just

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.030 
and forth to break it free and then just
slowly<00:00:39.079> try<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.200> keep<00:00:40.320> an<00:00:40.500> even<00:00:40.710> pressure

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
slowly try and keep an even pressure

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.920 
slowly try and keep an even pressure
pull<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> wire<00:00:42.090> straight<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.840> our

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
pull the wire straight up to our

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.139 
pull the wire straight up to our
disconnects<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.680> pull<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:43.920> out<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.430> lay<00:00:45.030> it

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
disconnects and pull it out and lay it

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.700 
disconnects and pull it out and lay it
aside<00:00:47.360> just<00:00:48.360> repeat<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.780> procedure<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
aside just repeat that procedure for the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.049 
aside just repeat that procedure for the
next<00:00:49.980> cylinder<00:00:50.719> pull<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.870> out<00:00:51.960> lay<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.289> aside

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
deteriorate and many times it won't flex

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.690 
deteriorate and many times it won't flex
freely<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.960> doesn't<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:59.070> elect<00:02:00.060> or

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
freely it doesn't have a that elect or

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.039 
freely it doesn't have a that elect or

flexibility that it did when it was new

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.679 
flexibility that it did when it was new
and<00:02:04.500> quite<00:02:04.920> often<00:02:05.189> you'll<00:02:05.640> break<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.509> plastic

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
and quite often you'll break the plastic

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.350 
and quite often you'll break the plastic
clips<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> always<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.489> unbolt<00:02:08.879> them<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
clips so I always just unbolt them and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.790 
clips so I always just unbolt them and
then<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.170> bolt<00:02:10.349> them<00:02:10.500> right<00:02:10.649> back

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
then you can just bolt them right back

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.640 
then you can just bolt them right back
on<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.310> provide

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
on and provide

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:21.119 
on and provide
any<00:02:11.860> damage<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.900> by<00:02:20.049> removing<00:02:20.409> the<00:02:20.620> one<00:02:20.860> bolt

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
any damage so by removing the one bolt

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.130 
any damage so by removing the one bolt
and<00:02:21.430> then<00:02:21.909> I<00:02:22.000> put<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.329> bolt<00:02:22.510> back<00:02:22.689> in<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:22.989> hole

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
and then I put the bolt back in the hole

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.300 
and then I put the bolt back in the hole
again<00:02:23.470> so<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.860> doesn't<00:02:24.519> get<00:02:24.579> lost<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:27.069> leaves

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
again so it doesn't get lost that leaves

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.610 
again so it doesn't get lost that leaves
