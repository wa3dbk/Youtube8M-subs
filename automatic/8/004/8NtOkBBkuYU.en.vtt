00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.180 

so<00:00:00.630> we're<00:00:00.750> working<00:00:01.050> on<00:00:01.170> another<00:00:01.439> sexy<00:00:01.979> black

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
so we're working on another sexy black

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.499 
so we're working on another sexy black
truck<00:00:03.200> and<00:00:04.200> this<00:00:04.560> one<00:00:04.859> has<00:00:05.220> got<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.640> misfire<00:00:06.480> on

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
truck and this one has got a misfire on

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.810 
truck and this one has got a misfire on
cylinder<00:00:07.109> five<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.710> tested<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.220> coil<00:00:08.490> pack<00:00:08.790> I

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
cylinder five I tested the coil pack I

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.610 
cylinder five I tested the coil pack I
verified<00:00:09.510> that<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.809> had<00:00:09.990> spark

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
verified that it had spark

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.430 
verified that it had spark
I<00:00:10.650> pulled<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> spark<00:00:11.790> plugs<00:00:12.120> out<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.750> I

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
I pulled the spark plugs out and I

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.140 
I pulled the spark plugs out and I
verified<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.130> they<00:00:14.280> weren't<00:00:14.460> leaking<00:00:15.030> I

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
verified that they weren't leaking I

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.500 
verified that they weren't leaking I
actually<00:00:15.330> used<00:00:15.780> my<00:00:15.900> Subaru<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.510> and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
actually used my Subaru to do that and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.359 
actually used my Subaru to do that and
then<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.690> did<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> compression<00:00:19.410> test<00:00:19.650> because<00:00:20.250> I

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
then I did a compression test because I

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.519 
then I did a compression test because I
ran<00:00:20.520> out<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.760> stuff<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.660> had<00:00:21.869> fuel<00:00:22.199> going<00:00:22.410> to

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
ran out of stuff and I had fuel going to

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.560 
ran out of stuff and I had fuel going to
the<00:00:22.619> cylinder<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.970> when<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.180> did<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the cylinder and when I did the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.019 
the cylinder and when I did the
compression<00:00:25.140> test<00:00:25.340> cylinder<00:00:26.340> five<00:00:26.699> which<00:00:27.000> is

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
compression test cylinder five which is

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.880 
compression test cylinder five which is
the<00:00:27.180> middle<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> driver's<00:00:28.500> side<00:00:28.529> on

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the middle one on the driver's side on

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.709 
the middle one on the driver's side on
this<00:00:29.070> car<00:00:29.400> because<00:00:29.580> you've<00:00:29.849> got<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:32.570> forget<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
this car because you've got I forget the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.620 
this car because you've got I forget the
numbers<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.680> goes<00:00:34.860> four<00:00:35.430> cylinder<00:00:36.120> four<00:00:36.329> over

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
numbers it goes four cylinder four over

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.440 
numbers it goes four cylinder four over
here<00:00:36.660> cylinder<00:00:37.410> five<00:00:37.649> cylinder<00:00:38.280> six<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.270> what

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
here cylinder five cylinder six so what

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.209 
here cylinder five cylinder six so what
I<00:00:39.480> did<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.350> used<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.950> ratchet<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:44.010> owner

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
I did is I used a ratchet and the owner

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.420 
I did is I used a ratchet and the owner
of<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.640> truck<00:00:45.320> did<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.590> say<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:46.950> used

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
of the truck did I just say I just used

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.650 
of the truck did I just say I just used
you<00:00:47.670> Matt<00:00:48.090> yeah<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.530> put<00:00:50.280> our<00:00:50.430> socket<00:00:51.180> onto<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
you Matt yeah I put our socket onto the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.729 
you Matt yeah I put our socket onto the
crank<00:00:52.110> pulley<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.340> from<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.590> had<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
crank pulley and from there I had the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.119 
crank pulley and from there I had the
spark<00:00:56.039> plug<00:00:56.340> out<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.910> then<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.289> I

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
spark plug out and then what I do is I

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.490 
spark plug out and then what I do is I
take<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.370> screwdriver<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.809> put<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.170> down<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
take a screwdriver and I put it down the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.039 
take a screwdriver and I put it down the
spark<00:01:01.829> plug<00:01:02.100> hole<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:03.059> tap<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.660> keep<00:01:03.899> it

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
spark plug hole and I tap I keep it

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.690 
spark plug hole and I tap I keep it
moving<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.769> doesn't<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> chance<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
moving so it doesn't have a chance to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.359 
moving so it doesn't have a chance to
bind<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:07.049> spark<00:01:07.380> plug<00:01:07.650> threads<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
bind on the spark plug threads on the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.100 
bind on the spark plug threads on the
cylinder<00:01:08.700> head<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.119> Jack<00:01:09.450> them<00:01:09.659> up<00:01:09.780> because

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
cylinder head and Jack them up because

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.320 
cylinder head and Jack them up because
it's<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.439> an<00:01:10.560> angle<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.610> tap<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.240> I

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it's at an angle I just tap it and I

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.710 
it's at an angle I just tap it and I
feel<00:01:12.540> when<00:01:12.869> Matt's<00:01:13.080> cranking<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.799> till<00:01:14.540> let<00:01:15.540> in

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
feel when Matt's cranking it till let in

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.830 
feel when Matt's cranking it till let in
so<00:01:15.930> good<00:01:16.259> either<00:01:17.119> until<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.299> goes<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> top

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
so good either until it goes to the top

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.749 
so good either until it goes to the top
when<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.530> piston<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:19.950> at<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.130> highest<00:01:20.340> point

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
when that piston is at the highest point

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.210 
when that piston is at the highest point
your<00:01:21.390> valves<00:01:21.750> will<00:01:21.930> be<00:01:22.049> closed<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
your valves will be closed and the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.469 
your valves will be closed and the
reason<00:01:23.460> why<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.700> they're<00:01:23.909> closed<00:01:24.210> is

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
reason why that they're closed is

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.330 
reason why that they're closed is
because<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:24.960> about<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.350> explode<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.189> know

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
because it's about to explode you know

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.280 
because it's about to explode you know
it<00:01:26.490> compresses<00:01:26.970> all<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.540> your<00:01:27.750> air<00:01:28.110> fuel

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
it compresses all of your air fuel

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.560 
it compresses all of your air fuel
mixture<00:01:28.380> up<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> top<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> spark

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
mixture up to the top up to the spark

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.480 
mixture up to the top up to the spark
plug<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:30.869> they<00:01:31.079> go<00:01:31.200> bang<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.040> pushes<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
plug and they go bang and it pushes it

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.580 
plug and they go bang and it pushes it
down<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.150> got<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> closed<00:01:33.900> cylinder

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
down so it's got to be a closed cylinder

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.850 
down so it's got to be a closed cylinder
a<00:01:34.619> closed<00:01:34.920> jar<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.060> will<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:37.229> anyway

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
a closed jar like if you will so anyway

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.410 
a closed jar like if you will so anyway
that's<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.850> make<00:01:39.030> sure<00:01:39.210> that

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
that's what we do and we make sure that

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.950 
that's what we do and we make sure that
everything<00:01:40.220> is<00:01:41.220> at<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> top<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.210> then<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.570> use

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
everything is at the top and then I use

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.429 
everything is at the top and then I use
my<00:01:43.220> compression<00:01:44.220> tester<00:01:44.700> hose<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.110> put<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
my compression tester hose and I put the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.950 
my compression tester hose and I put the
compression<00:01:46.740> tester<00:01:47.490> hose<00:01:47.840> into<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
compression tester hose into the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.840 
compression tester hose into the
cylinder<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.799> then<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.070> hook<00:01:50.340> my<00:01:50.610> air

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
cylinder and then I hook my air

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.780 
cylinder and then I hook my air
compressor<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.930> once<00:01:52.799> my<00:01:53.009> air<00:01:53.189> compressors

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
compressor to it once my air compressors

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.940 
compressor to it once my air compressors
hook<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.360> then<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:55.049> where<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.619> leak

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
hook to it then I can see where the leak

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.780 
hook to it then I can see where the leak
is<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> cylinder<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:58.170> case

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
is in the cylinder in this case

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.900 
is in the cylinder in this case
it's<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.690> intake<00:02:01.140> valves<00:02:01.740> because<00:02:02.400> we've<00:02:02.730> got

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
it's the intake valves because we've got

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.270 
it's the intake valves because we've got
a<00:02:02.940> bunch<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.450> smells<00:02:03.720> like<00:02:03.900> gas<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.920> know<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
a bunch it smells like gas you know and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.880 
a bunch it smells like gas you know and
it's<00:02:05.370> blowing<00:02:05.790> out<00:02:05.940> through<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> intake<00:02:06.890> so

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
it's blowing out through the intake so

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.560 
it's blowing out through the intake so
and<00:02:08.570> we<00:02:09.570> go<00:02:09.750> back<00:02:09.960> here<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.180> check<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
and we go back here and we check the

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.570 
and we go back here and we check the
exhaust<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.320> there's<00:02:13.560> nothing<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.430> don't

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
exhaust and there's nothing we don't

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.540 
exhaust and there's nothing we don't
hear<00:02:14.910> anything<00:02:15.150> we<00:02:15.690> don't<00:02:15.810> smell<00:02:16.170> anything<00:02:16.550> we

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
hear anything we don't smell anything we

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.940 
hear anything we don't smell anything we
don't<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:18.210> any<00:02:18.360> detection<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:19.200> anything<00:02:19.650> so

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
don't have any detection of anything so

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.370 
don't have any detection of anything so
apparently<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.390> intake<00:02:21.780> valves<00:02:22.230> is

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
apparently one of the intake valves is

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.860 
apparently one of the intake valves is
not<00:02:22.590> closing<00:02:23.010> or<00:02:23.670> something's<00:02:24.570> wrong<00:02:24.720> with

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
not closing or something's wrong with

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.180 
not closing or something's wrong with
the<00:02:25.020> cylinder<00:02:25.440> head<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.770> where<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.010> not

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
the cylinder head to where it's not

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.510 
the cylinder head to where it's not
seating<00:02:26.610> properly<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:28.020> now<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:28.950> know<00:02:29.280> why

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
seating properly so now we know why

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.850 
seating properly so now we know why
cylinder<00:02:30.120> five<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.660> misfiring<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:31.740> knew

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
cylinder five is misfiring and we knew

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.290 
cylinder five is misfiring and we knew
that<00:02:32.100> because<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.490> got<00:02:32.730> p0<00:02:34.190> 305<00:02:35.190> cylinder<00:02:36.120> five

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
that because we got p0 305 cylinder five

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.950 
that because we got p0 305 cylinder five
misfire<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.200> treble<00:02:37.380> codes<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:39.240> anyway

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
misfire on the treble codes so anyway

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.720 
misfire on the treble codes so anyway
this<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.650> how<00:02:40.710> we<00:02:40.860> diagnose<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.430> that's<00:02:41.580> not

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
this is how we diagnose so that's not

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.790 
this is how we diagnose so that's not
what<00:02:41.910> we'd<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.630> find<00:02:42.870> I'd<00:02:43.200> rather<00:02:43.410> have

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
what we'd like to find I'd rather have

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.620 
what we'd like to find I'd rather have
it<00:02:43.920> be<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.850> know<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> cracked

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
it be like you know like a cracked

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.870 
it be like you know like a cracked
porcelain<00:02:46.050> on<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.830> spark<00:02:47.190> plug<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:47.550> know

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
porcelain on the spark plug you know

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.730 
porcelain on the spark plug you know
maybe<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.180> big<00:02:48.390> heavy<00:02:48.570> black<00:02:48.960> line<00:02:48.990> down<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
maybe a big heavy black line down the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.470 
maybe a big heavy black line down the
side<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.010> like<00:02:50.310> those<00:02:50.610> because<00:02:51.090> then<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.330> just

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
side I like those because then you just

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.990 
side I like those because then you just
change<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.870> plug<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:52.320> easy<00:02:52.530> as<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.790> we're

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
change a plug it's easy as it is we're

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.370 
change a plug it's easy as it is we're
going<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.150> have<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.450> pull<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.780> valve<00:02:55.020> cover

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
going to have to pull the valve cover

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.410 
going to have to pull the valve cover
and<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.610> pull<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.820> valve<00:02:57.000> cover<00:02:57.270> we're<00:02:57.390> going

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
and to pull the valve cover we're going

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.630 
and to pull the valve cover we're going
to<00:02:57.540> pull<00:02:57.720> all<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:58.050> mess<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.709> then<00:02:58.770> once<00:02:59.430> we

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
to pull all this mess and then once we

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.640 
to pull all this mess and then once we
pull<00:02:59.880> all<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.120> off<00:03:00.450> we'll<00:03:00.990> luck<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.530> I'll

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
pull all that off we'll luck and I'll

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.190 
pull all that off we'll luck and I'll
specifically<00:03:02.459> look<00:03:02.790> at<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.450> intake<00:03:03.810> valves

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
specifically look at the intake valves

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.810 
specifically look at the intake valves
will<00:03:04.320> be<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.560> ones<00:03:04.739> on<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.070> side<00:03:05.130> toward<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
will be the ones on this side toward the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.320 
will be the ones on this side toward the
intake<00:03:06.150> manifold<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.520> look<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.760> see<00:03:08.910> if<00:03:09.090> one

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
intake manifold and look and see if one

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.570 
intake manifold and look and see if one
of<00:03:09.510> them<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.750> bent<00:03:10.050> or<00:03:10.350> if<00:03:10.860> it's<00:03:11.070> not<00:03:11.220> closing

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
of them is bent or if it's not closing

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.550 
of them is bent or if it's not closing
all<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:11.880> way<00:03:12.120> because<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.900> not<00:03:13.050> making<00:03:13.290> any

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
all the way because it's not making any

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.650 
all the way because it's not making any
engine<00:03:14.070> noise<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:14.820> I'm<00:03:14.910> thinking<00:03:15.300> it's<00:03:15.450> just

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
engine noise so I'm thinking it's just

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.140 
engine noise so I'm thinking it's just
not<00:03:15.840> seating<00:03:16.320> properly<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.730> I'm<00:03:17.910> gonna<00:03:18.030> have

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
not seating properly so I'm gonna have

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.210 
not seating properly so I'm gonna have
to<00:03:18.300> pull<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:19.380> cylinder<00:03:19.769> head<00:03:19.920> on<00:03:20.070> this

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
to pull this the cylinder head on this

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.120 
to pull this the cylinder head on this
side<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.610> do<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.760> valve<00:03:21.030> job
