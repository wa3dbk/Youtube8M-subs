 [Music] 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.200
 welcome facebook friends youtube 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.690
 twitter and other social networks the 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.200
 today to show that explaining what 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.489
 what is working with photoshop 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.080
 mainly in achieving this effect that 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.200
 I'll show you below 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.200
 [Music] 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.460
 we will explain in theory what we are going 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.420
 to do in this picture 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.960
 the original one that we are going to modify is 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.030
 is 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.850
 if we want to achieve we want to achieve that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.149
 the photograph is 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.449
 like that the black and white background and 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.729
 certain part the image highlight the color 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.130
 increase saturation and detail in 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.040
 image we open our photoshop can 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.080
 be the version 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.530
 cs 364 cs5 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.370
 in this case we have been 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.930
 working with the version 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.550
 [Music] 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.849
 cs 664 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.849
 [Music] 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.100
 we upload the image 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.290
 [Music] 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.150
 once our image loaded in the 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.820
 photoshop 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.820
 The first thing we will do is cut back 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.270
 select the part we want 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.260
 highlight in this case the person his 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.260
 dressed mainly 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.550
 we go to the tool 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.380
 tie 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.100
 we select the lasso tool 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.100
 polygonal 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.850
 Y 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.930
 we increase with the magnifying glass 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.930
 [Music] 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.640
 and 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.000
 and we cut around the contour of the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.000
 person 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.370
 [Music] 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.670
 [Applause] 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.500
 it does not necessarily have to be precise 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.000
 that later we can study it with the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:36.940
 photoshop I'm going to teach you 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:38.800
 [Music] 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:48.980
 Y 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:49.750
 [Music] 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:03:03.689
 [Applause] 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:03:03.689
 [Music] 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.020
 [Music] 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.400
 and once it is selected it has 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.980
 that appear that hairline moving by 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.740
 the outline that means that the 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.490
 selection of is made 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.500
 let's see if we keep the magnifying glass button 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.990
 right only scalar image on screen 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.340
 there it adjusts to the resolution of your 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.690
 screen 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.280
 [Music] 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.280
 after this what are we going to do 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.190
 [Music] 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.360
 we press the right button 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.360
 within the selection 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:56.150
 select inverse what we do with this 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.950
 that all the contour is selected 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.150
 of the object 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.150
 and we achieve this 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.480
 we press perfect up here 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.310
 to perfect 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.410
 [Music] 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.250
 and it will be a sample 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.850
 previously an idea of how it would be 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.300
 cut 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.650
 not the rest of the image erasing the 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.440
 selection that we previously 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.280
 we had done 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.780
 and we can modify 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.640
 [Music] 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.120
 we have to adjust the value in 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:39.750
 where you notice less between white and 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.850
 black and the color that we want to achieve 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.830
 I recommend that you always set 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.400
 play with that number 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.990
 calabria have a bit of blur 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.190
 between the black and white colors 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.720
 reynosa - 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.930
 [Music] 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.930
 let's see why we go to image 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.160
 and settings 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.309
 [Music] 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.309
 [Applause] 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.910
 tone and its authorization 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.910
 duration 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.920
 here we are going to saturation and we have the 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.890
 option if we go we click and go 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.860
 toward the left 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:28.830
 [Music] 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.800
 we achieved the effect we wanted 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.650
 if we go to the right they are accentuated more 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.120
 the colors of the background in this case 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.120
 let's leave it in black and white 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:45.380
 [Music] 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.300
 then this to return the image to the 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.500
 normality we press again on the 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.730
 image and selected 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.730
 [Music] 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.249
 well after this we realize 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.340
 between the image 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:02.540
 stay 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.180
 [Music] 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.120
 a color space we select them 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.450
 again and we repeat the step that 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:21.550
 we had done 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:21.550
 [Music] 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.890
 but in this case how we want that 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.450
 selection delete it the color we do not press 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.810
 select inverse but we leave it 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:35.229
 just like that and we go to image 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:38.229
 where is a saturation 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.229
 black and white 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:47.160
 ok right click to select 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:49.860
 and there would be our image 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.290
 almost perfect that you obviously 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.570
 with details with patience the edge what 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.060
 can leave more more to perfection 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.410
 so you do not notice that blue tone 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.210
 that you see the edge because you see the 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.820
 difference because I'm only 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:07.190
 showing the technique here is to achieve 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.190
 this effect is very good 

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:11.939
 at the same time when I 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:14.249
 select the person you can 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:16.469
 give them saturation saturation so that the 

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:19.260
 dress look more pink one color more 

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:22.399
 strong and the background in manzanillo 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.399
 [Applause] 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.740
 well that would be the tutorial of the day of 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.140
 today 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.390
 soon tomorrow maybe or last 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.100
 tomorrow a new one may be coming up 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.350
 tutorial also from photoshop so that 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:37.810
 let's keep learning all 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.150
 together because for those institutes to 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:42.550
 share the knowledge and good we 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.490
 we see possible to video this was cristian 

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.260
 in tutorials for you and see you in the 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:08:18.440
 next 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:08:18.440
