00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.460
 what we present with this innovation is a no painting electricity 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.429
 ethics or face a process of sogamoso itself in many areas with the 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.490
 elements of their functions in useless 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.990
 budget of this performance when I felt that one of the features 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.419
 of this painting 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.919
 is that that was the one that appeared with two accessible the national market exists 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.119
 international demand painting bactericide two oncenos two principles 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.280
 active the advantage in this case that the process can be known in full 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.210
 in our country the process surrounded is based on the substantial modification of 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.550
 inorganic prisons by including nuclei as a beautician 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.710
 these nuclei are very effective both unemployed that left their site agree 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.670
 gram-negative bacteria this paint can be applied in areas in which 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.910
 the elimination of bacteria the certificate such as the hospital and 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.910
 children's breakfast room 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.040
 Paint production is carried out through standard processes 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.740
 industrially used 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.880
 in our case we used a distance was high speed that allows the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.330
 production at laboratory scale 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.050
 the painting was tested according to the irÃ¡n norms for interior latex fulfilling 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.050
 with the requirements specified in it 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.840
 for example 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.840
 I can cover you 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.320
 viscosity of the naval sector 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.560
 density of liquid paint 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.470
 the distribution and morphology of the new york and vicious tasks 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.010
 inorganic its study formed by atomic force microscope and by 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.010
 others by electron microscopy the filis 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.550
 Bactericidal action in front of the goal will be positive and the 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.889
 negative 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:18.309
 the paintings have been eliminated on 99 with 8 percent of migrants 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.849
 the painting therefore fulfills the main objective 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.550
 which is to prevent the formation of bacteria colonies on all surfaces 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.069
 graffiti 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.489
 although at this stage it was developed on what is 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.689
 the active substance can be used in another type of bronze-colored paint 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.119
 Synthetic paints throughout the west 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:42.839
 finished the processing stage 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:44.949
 the producer estrada 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:49.029
 available for transfer to the industrial sector and later 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:49.329
 commercialization
