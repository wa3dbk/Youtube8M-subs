00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
this thing um so really I think all you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.210 
this thing um so really I think all you
do<00:01:28.729> is<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:30.329> snaps<00:01:30.659> them<00:01:30.930> out<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:32.040> are

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
do is just snaps them out they are

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.660 
do is just snaps them out they are
attached<00:01:32.780> but<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.840> think<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.409> how<00:01:34.530> to

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
attached but I think you just how to

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.429 
attached but I think you just how to
pull<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.970> there<00:01:36.630> goes<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> camera<00:01:37.259> but

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
pull it and there goes the camera but

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.289 
pull it and there goes the camera but
you<00:01:37.799> snap<00:01:38.159> whichever<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.700> want<00:01:38.850> out<00:01:39.090> and

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
you snap whichever you want out and

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.450 
you snap whichever you want out and
there<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.229> they<00:01:40.680> come<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.100> couple<00:01:41.220> of

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
in once you've got it in it doesn't

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.930 
in once you've got it in it doesn't
really<00:02:31.800> move<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.489> do<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.730> same
