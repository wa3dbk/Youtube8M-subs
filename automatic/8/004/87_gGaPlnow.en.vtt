00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
piston facing upwards there and we pick

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.360 
piston facing upwards there and we pick
out

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.530 

six<00:01:03.370> more<00:01:03.579> blocks<00:01:03.699> like<00:01:04.449> this<00:01:06.360> then<00:01:07.360> we're

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
six more blocks like this then we're

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.010 
six more blocks like this then we're
gonna<00:01:07.689> like<00:01:08.100> them<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:10.560> how<00:01:11.560> was<00:01:11.740> it

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
this comparator into subtraction mode

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.600 
this comparator into subtraction mode
then<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.360> come<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.250> place<00:01:38.250> we

then we come up like this place we
redstone<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:40.340> one<00:01:41.340> there<00:01:41.580> one<00:01:42.110> there<00:01:43.549> knock

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
redstone here one there one there knock

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.609 
redstone here one there one there knock
this<00:01:44.729> out<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.630> replace<00:01:45.810> three<00:01:46.439> blocks<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.890> top

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
this out and replace three blocks on top

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.889 
this out and replace three blocks on top
like<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.729> same<00:01:51.420> thing<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> other

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
like that do the same thing on the other

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.719 
like that do the same thing on the other
side<00:01:54.050> like<00:01:55.050> this<00:01:56.630> then<00:01:57.630> replace<00:01:58.110> out<00:01:58.319> to

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
side like this then replace out to

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:10.850 
side like this then replace out to
Firefox<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.450> all<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.229> string<00:02:09.110> now<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> put<00:02:10.619> in

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
Firefox and all the string now I put in

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.259 
Firefox and all the string now I put in
the<00:02:11.549> slime<00:02:12.030> blocks<00:02:16.489> while<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.700> thing<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.030> not

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
the slime blocks while the thing is not

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.340 
the slime blocks while the thing is not
moving<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:19.049> course<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:23.930> then<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:24.959> still<00:02:25.319> have

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
moving of course and then we still have

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.590 
moving of course and then we still have
to<00:02:25.500> do<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.830> frame<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.459> has<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.880> be<00:02:27.030> obsidian

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
to do the frame it has to be obsidian

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.259 
to do the frame it has to be obsidian
because<00:02:27.989> otherwise<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:29.220> slime<00:02:29.519> blocks<00:02:29.910> would

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
because otherwise the slime blocks would

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.170 
because otherwise the slime blocks would
like<00:02:30.540> try<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.019> move<00:02:31.380> those<00:02:31.620> blocks<00:02:32.180> which

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
like try to move those blocks which

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.780 
like try to move those blocks which
would<00:02:33.540> result<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.950> whole<00:02:35.100> thing<00:02:35.459> messing

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
would result in the whole thing messing

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.289 
would result in the whole thing messing
up<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.239> this<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.530> we<00:02:37.829> are<00:02:37.950> done<00:02:38.130> Oh<00:02:38.280> No<00:02:38.700> some
