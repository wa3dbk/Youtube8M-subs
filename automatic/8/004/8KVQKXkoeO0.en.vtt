this<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.709> actually<00:02:47.420> very<00:02:48.420> much<00:02:48.540> different

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
this is actually very much different

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.949 
this is actually very much different
than<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.860> black<00:02:50.819> version<00:02:51.060> because<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.780> black

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
than the black version because the black

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.440 
than the black version because the black
version<00:02:52.140> was<00:02:52.500> sort<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.920> matte<00:02:53.280> kind<00:02:54.269> of

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
version was sort of a matte kind of

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.170 
version was sort of a matte kind of
black<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:56.129> you<00:02:56.220> know<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.400> was<00:02:56.489> metal<00:02:56.940> with

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
black but you know it was metal with

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.360 
black but you know it was metal with
like<00:02:57.329> paint<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:58.110> there<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.470> wasn't<00:02:58.680> colossi<00:02:59.280> at

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
like paint on there it wasn't colossi at

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.940 
like paint on there it wasn't colossi at
all<00:02:59.549> this<00:03:00.239> one<00:03:00.540> though<00:03:00.810> it's<00:03:01.110> white<00:03:01.409> it<00:03:01.890> is

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
all this one though it's white it is

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.039 
all this one though it's white it is
glossy<00:03:02.489> as<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.879> can<00:03:03.030> see<00:03:03.180> as<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.390> reflection

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
glossy as you can see as a reflection

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.910 
glossy as you can see as a reflection
from<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.860> lights<00:03:05.099> here<00:03:06.140> it's<00:03:07.140> glossy<00:03:07.470> and

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
from the lights here it's glossy and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.789 
from the lights here it's glossy and
it's<00:03:08.849> very<00:03:09.060> nice<00:03:09.359> a<00:03:09.750> little<00:03:10.140> bit<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.349> quality

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
it's very nice a little bit of quality

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.740 
it's very nice a little bit of quality

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
80 millimeter fans there let's look at

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.819 
80 millimeter fans there let's look at
the<00:04:16.260> bottom<00:04:16.410> here<00:04:17.299> bottom<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.539> a<00:04:19.199> little<00:04:19.470> tiny

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
the bottom here bottom is a little tiny

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.180 
the bottom here bottom is a little tiny
little<00:04:20.070> mesh<00:04:21.380> filter<00:04:22.380> which<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.740> better<00:04:22.979> than

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
little mesh filter which is better than

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.950 
little mesh filter which is better than
nothing<00:04:23.370> right<00:04:24.320> plastic<00:04:25.320> feet<00:04:25.729> no<00:04:26.729> no<00:04:27.240> rubber

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
nothing right plastic feet no no rubber

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.589 
nothing right plastic feet no no rubber
and<00:04:28.229> no<00:04:28.380> additional<00:04:29.300> didn't<00:04:30.300> come<00:04:30.449> with

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
and no additional didn't come with

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.779 
and no additional didn't come with
anything<00:04:30.870> or<00:04:31.349> maybe<00:04:31.590> we<00:04:32.160> should<00:04:32.310> check<00:04:32.490> inside

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
anything or maybe we should check inside

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.570 
anything or maybe we should check inside
the<00:04:33.389> hardware<00:04:33.780> but<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.169> don't<00:04:34.860> think<00:04:35.190> it<00:04:35.340> comes

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
the hardware but I don't think it comes

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.340 
the hardware but I don't think it comes
with<00:04:35.880> anything

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
with anything

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.850 
with anything
to<00:04:37.220> make<00:04:37.370> that<00:04:37.520> rubberized<00:04:38.000> right<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:39.680> front

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
to make that rubberized right the front

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.760 
to make that rubberized right the front
here<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.730> believe<00:04:41.150> I<00:04:41.390> could<00:04:41.450> take<00:04:41.870> this<00:04:42.020> off

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.290 

right<00:04:45.770> taking<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.760> off

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
right taking it off

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.180 
right taking it off
gives<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.290> all<00:04:48.320> this<00:04:50.470> here<00:04:51.470> and<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.980> front

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
gives you all this here and the front

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.360 
gives you all this here and the front
does<00:04:52.940> look<00:04:53.180> like<00:04:53.330> it<00:04:53.510> has<00:04:53.540> sort<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.200> mesh<00:04:54.500> but

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
does look like it has sort of a mesh but

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.770 
does look like it has sort of a mesh but
it<00:04:55.460> would<00:04:55.580> look<00:04:55.760> like<00:04:55.910> it<00:04:56.150> would<00:04:56.300> be<00:04:56.510> very

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
it would look like it would be very

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.760 
it would look like it would be very
difficult<00:04:57.200> to<00:04:57.590> take<00:04:58.190> apart<00:04:58.520> or<00:04:59.060> clean<00:04:59.870> like<00:05:00.620> to

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
difficult to take apart or clean like to

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.430 
difficult to take apart or clean like to
take<00:05:00.950> this<00:05:01.160> whole<00:05:01.400> thing<00:05:01.430> off<00:05:01.790> and<00:05:01.970> clean

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
take this whole thing off and clean

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.740 
take this whole thing off and clean
right<00:05:03.440> and<00:05:03.650> then<00:05:03.830> we<00:05:04.250> have<00:05:04.300> holes<00:05:05.300> here<00:05:05.720> for

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
right and then we have holes here for

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.910 
right and then we have holes here for
120<00:05:06.470> millimeter<00:05:06.860> fan<00:05:07.160> just<00:05:08.060> one<00:05:08.330> fan<00:05:08.710> would<00:05:09.710> go

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
120 millimeter fan just one fan would go

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:19.920 
120 millimeter fan just one fan would go
there<00:05:12.700> let's<00:05:13.700> put<00:05:13.880> that<00:05:14.030> back<00:05:14.210> on<00:05:16.810> all<00:05:17.810> right

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
there let's put that back on all right

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.679 
there let's put that back on all right
so<00:05:20.930> let's<00:05:21.110> take<00:05:21.320> a<00:05:21.350> look<00:05:21.650> at

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:23.689 
so let's take a look at

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:31.779 
so let's take a look at
front<00:05:24.349> panel<00:05:24.889> or<00:05:25.099> the<00:05:25.159> side<00:05:25.729> panel<00:05:26.059> here<00:05:30.789> right

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
front panel or the side panel here right

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.469 
large cutout here although it could be

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:14.859 
large cutout here although it could be
or<00:06:13.459> could<00:06:13.639> have<00:06:13.789> been<00:06:13.969> maybe<00:06:14.329> a<00:06:14.479> little<00:06:14.749> bit

00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:14.869

or could have been maybe a little bit
larger<00:06:15.679> actually<00:06:16.669> no<00:06:17.479> it's<00:06:17.629> fine<00:06:17.869> because<00:06:18.110> if

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:18.379 
larger actually no it's fine because if

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.189 
larger actually no it's fine because if
they<00:06:18.529> have<00:06:18.739> this<00:06:18.889> little<00:06:19.219> Inlet<00:06:20.209> here<00:06:20.629> right
