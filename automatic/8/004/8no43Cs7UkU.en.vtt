00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.030
 released a new version of android 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:15.170
 for the galaxy s 4 and the htc one on 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.839
 actually it's about android 4.2.2 that 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.519
 is the one we all know but this one 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:23.300
 incorporates some new features 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:25.519
 and functions like for example a new 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.009
 moving wallpaper that is 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.590
 this one that we see on the screen 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:35.070
 then I will show you how to install it 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.470
 also incorporates improvements in the camera 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.050
 and a new boot animation to 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.739
 turn on the computer in this video 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.590
 tutorial we will see how to install these two 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.470
 characteristics in this case the fund 's 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.120
 screen and boot animation 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.019
 then in another video we will see how 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.019
 install the camera 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.890
 and remember that this tutorial is useful for 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.910
 all android terminals does not matter 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:07.580
 if it is a galaxy s2 like this 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.580
 a galaxy s3 or any other terminal 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.020
 for this talk the wallpaper is 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.020
 Very simple 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.759
 nothing else we must install this file 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.880
 I have already installed it, I will install it 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.880
 again 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.479
 we can back 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.010
 we press a few seconds on the 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.930
 screen 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.380
 but we are going to define fund of 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.590
 screen home screen backgrounds 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.590
 animated 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.880
 and we select the background 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.509
 it's really very simple without 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.509
 no complication 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.170
 to install the boot animation 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.740
 when turning on the equipment 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.050
 we must have a terminal with a 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.400
 Advanced travel if you do not know how 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.620
 I'll leave a video here 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.640
 on screen so they know how to install 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.640
 a record and advanced 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.120
 in downloading these two files and 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.120
 copy them until finished 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.409
 we must turn off the terminal 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.890
 and then we will enter the morrito 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:53.080
 pressing the key simultaneously 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.080
 on home and volunteer 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.340
 I have a record and in Spanish but if 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:30.219
 you have a record in English 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.060
 neither do the steps to follow are important 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:35.390
 the same 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.260
 I recommend that before doing this, 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.170
 a backup of your rum 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.200
 here on the screen I will leave a video about 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.310
 how to make a backpack if it is that 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.310
 They do not know how to do it 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.620
 We give you to install if from the 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.620
 memoirs 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.010
 choose if from internal sd memory 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.190
 and we select 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.730
 first this file 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.330
 is here from above 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.430
 we confirm 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.139
 then 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:41.069
 we give you again to choose if from the 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.069
 internal headquarters 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.490
 and we do the same with this second 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.490
 archive 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.480
 and it was down here 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.320
 we select and confirm 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.270
 we go back 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.060
 and we give him to restart the system 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.440
 as you can see the no animation of 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.780
 boot has been installed 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.670

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.330

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.580

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.830
