hey guys how's it going I'm going to be
doing<00:00:07.700> another<00:00:07.939> stretching<00:00:08.420> video<00:00:08.660> for<00:00:08.870> you

be doing my big holes I'm going to be
doing<00:00:11.959> my<00:00:12.379> little<00:00:12.559> baby<00:00:12.980> to<00:00:13.369> gauge<00:00:13.609> and<00:00:13.939> I'm

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:14.209 
doing my little baby to gauge and I'm

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:16.660 
doing my little baby to gauge and I'm
going<00:00:14.389> to<00:00:14.449> be<00:00:14.570> going<00:00:14.750> up<00:00:15.080> to<00:00:15.139> zero<00:00:15.889> gauge<00:00:16.160> can<00:00:16.640> I

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
going to be going up to zero gauge can I

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.740 
going to be going up to zero gauge can I
just<00:00:16.850> take<00:00:17.000> it<00:00:17.060> up<00:00:17.210> for<00:00:17.449> you

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
just take it up for you

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.150 
just take it up for you
and<00:00:19.570> there<00:00:20.570> we<00:00:20.630> go<00:00:20.750> so<00:00:21.320> here's<00:00:21.500> my<00:00:21.680> two<00:00:21.740> gauge

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
and there we go so here's my two gauge

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.570 
and there we go so here's my two gauge
and<00:00:22.430> here<00:00:23.150> is<00:00:23.270> my<00:00:23.480> zero<00:00:23.990> gauge<00:00:24.200> it<00:00:25.070> is<00:00:25.130> a<00:00:25.220> bit<00:00:25.490> of

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
and here is my zero gauge it is a bit of

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.160 
and here is my zero gauge it is a bit of
a<00:00:25.640> difference<00:00:25.970> six<00:00:26.480> millimeters<00:00:26.900> to<00:00:27.050> eight

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
a difference six millimeters to eight

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.260 
a difference six millimeters to eight
millimeters<00:00:27.350> I<00:00:27.800> have<00:00:28.340> done<00:00:28.550> it<00:00:28.640> before<00:00:28.760> so<00:00:28.940> I'm

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
millimeters I have done it before so I'm

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.240 
millimeters I have done it before so I'm
expecting<00:00:29.869> some<00:00:30.170> pain<00:00:30.440> anyway

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
expecting some pain anyway

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.010 
expecting some pain anyway
well<00:00:31.490> let's<00:00:31.699> hop<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:31.940> it<00:00:32.119> as<00:00:32.359> you<00:00:32.719> may<00:00:32.840> or<00:00:32.989> may

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
well let's hop to it as you may or may

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.450 
well let's hop to it as you may or may
not<00:00:33.199> be<00:00:33.350> able<00:00:33.500> to<00:00:33.590> tell<00:00:33.770> I've<00:00:34.010> just<00:00:34.250> come<00:00:34.399> out

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
not be able to tell I've just come out

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.860 
not be able to tell I've just come out
of<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:34.640> shower<00:00:34.820> having<00:00:35.449> a<00:00:35.510> shower<00:00:35.660> before

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
of the shower having a shower before

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.689 
of the shower having a shower before
stretching<00:00:36.289> is<00:00:36.530> a<00:00:36.559> really<00:00:36.770> good<00:00:36.890> idea<00:00:36.949> because

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
stretching is a really good idea because

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.380 
stretching is a really good idea because
the<00:00:38.600> heat<00:00:38.839> makes<00:00:39.379> it<00:00:39.530> a<00:00:39.620> lot<00:00:40.069> easier<00:00:40.550> for<00:00:40.850> you

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
the heat makes it a lot easier for you

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.119 
the heat makes it a lot easier for you
to<00:00:41.420> put<00:00:41.690> a<00:00:41.719> table<00:00:42.079> through<00:00:42.199> it<00:00:42.469> heats<00:00:42.800> up<00:00:42.949> your

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
to put a table through it heats up your

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.700 
to put a table through it heats up your
ear<00:00:43.280> just<00:00:43.789> softens<00:00:44.659> it<00:00:44.839> it's<00:00:45.289> just<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:45.530> lot

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
ear just softens it it's just a lot

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.229 
ear just softens it it's just a lot
better<00:00:45.859> than<00:00:46.280> going<00:00:46.429> straight<00:00:46.789> ahead<00:00:46.909> with<00:00:47.149> it

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
better than going straight ahead with it

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.090 
better than going straight ahead with it
anyways<00:00:47.719> well<00:00:48.229> let's<00:00:48.409> see<00:00:48.530> how<00:00:48.620> we<00:00:48.679> go<00:00:48.800> just

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
anyways well let's see how we go just

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.319 
anyways well let's see how we go just
before<00:00:49.249> I<00:00:49.399> go<00:00:49.519> ahead<00:00:49.579> and<00:00:49.699> stretch<00:00:49.999> up<00:00:50.179> I'm

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
before I go ahead and stretch up I'm

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.599 
before I go ahead and stretch up I'm
going<00:00:50.479> to<00:00:50.539> put<00:00:50.659> some<00:00:50.870> of<00:00:50.899> this<00:00:51.079> in<00:00:51.979> my<00:00:52.159> ear<00:00:52.370> this

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
going to put some of this in my ear this

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.759 
going to put some of this in my ear this
one<00:00:52.850> is<00:00:53.030> for<00:00:53.269> hygienic<00:00:53.929> ear<00:00:54.260> piercing

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
one is for hygienic ear piercing

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.579 
one is for hygienic ear piercing
aftercare<00:00:55.399> as<00:00:55.549> you<00:00:55.729> can<00:00:55.879> see<00:00:56.059> there<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:57.440> one<00:00:57.559> I

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
aftercare as you can see there the one I

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.770 
aftercare as you can see there the one I
used<00:00:57.799> in<00:00:57.920> my<00:00:57.979> other<00:00:58.190> video<00:00:58.519> which<00:00:59.510> I'll<00:00:59.659> put

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
used in my other video which I'll put

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.119 
used in my other video which I'll put
here<00:01:00.429> that<00:01:01.429> was<00:01:01.989> more<00:01:02.989> for<00:01:03.109> oral<00:01:03.469> but<00:01:03.829> it<00:01:04.040> was

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
here that was more for oral but it was

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.060 
here that was more for oral but it was
good<00:01:04.309> for<00:01:04.400> college<00:01:04.729> I<00:01:05.659> don't<00:01:06.619> really<00:01:06.740> know<00:01:06.890> why

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
good for college I don't really know why

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.640 
good for college I don't really know why
I<00:01:07.100> used<00:01:07.340> a<00:01:07.460> bit<00:01:07.580> anyways<00:01:07.880> okay<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:08.659> give<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:09.590> a

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
I used a bit anyways okay so give it a

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.070 
I used a bit anyways okay so give it a
bit<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.800> a<00:01:10.030> spray<00:01:11.030> actually<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:11.870> know<00:01:11.960> it

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
bit of a spray actually you know it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.330 
bit of a spray actually you know it
would<00:01:12.170> be<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.260> good<00:01:12.380> idea<00:01:12.500> for<00:01:12.680> taking<00:01:13.070> that<00:01:13.250> out

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
would be a good idea for taking that out

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.780 
would be a good idea for taking that out
first

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
first

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.640 
first
there<00:01:14.570> we<00:01:14.630> go<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:14.870> could<00:01:15.080> as<00:01:15.170> that<00:01:15.290> look<00:01:15.470> two

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
there we go I could as that look two

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.730 
there we go I could as that look two
holes<00:01:15.980> in<00:01:16.190> one<00:01:16.340> ear<00:01:16.670> all<00:01:17.120> right<00:01:17.240> here<00:01:17.420> we<00:01:17.480> go

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
holes in one ear all right here we go

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.090 
holes in one ear all right here we go
just<00:01:18.740> align<00:01:19.160> it<00:01:19.310> up<00:01:19.460> properly<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.830> three<00:01:21.830> two

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
just align it up properly and three two

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:33.490 
just align it up properly and three two
one<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.760> push<00:01:28.780> go<00:01:29.780> all<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.930> way<00:01:29.960> in<00:01:32.410> there<00:01:33.410> we

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
one and push go all the way in there we

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.280 
one and push go all the way in there we
go<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:34.660> I'm<00:01:35.660> just<00:01:35.720> going<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:35.990> leave<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.170> in

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
go and I'm just going to leave that in

00:01:36.290 --> 00:02:46.100 
go and I'm just going to leave that in
there<00:01:36.740> for<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.040> while<00:01:38.050> because<00:01:39.250> that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.890 

giving<00:02:46.830> my<00:02:46.950> ear<00:02:47.190> some<00:02:47.460> time<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.850> calm<00:02:48.030> down<00:02:48.060> as

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
giving my ear some time to calm down as

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.260 
giving my ear some time to calm down as
you<00:02:48.990> can<00:02:49.080> see<00:02:49.230> it's<00:02:49.350> pretty<00:02:49.500> red<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.970> reason

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
you can see it's pretty red the reason

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.080 
you can see it's pretty red the reason
for<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.990> that<00:02:52.050> up<00:02:52.980> here<00:02:53.460> it's<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.760> bit<00:02:53.940> more

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
for that is that up here it's a bit more

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.740 
for that is that up here it's a bit more
sensitive<00:02:54.540> than<00:02:54.810> down<00:02:55.050> in<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.890> actual<00:02:56.220> lobe

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
sensitive than down in the actual lobe

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.130 
sensitive than down in the actual lobe
it's<00:02:57.750> probably<00:02:58.260> going<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.500> actually<00:02:58.830> swell<00:02:59.220> up

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
it's probably going to actually swell up

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.520 
it's probably going to actually swell up
quite<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.170> fair<00:03:01.590> bit<00:03:01.950> but<00:03:03.140> I'm<00:03:04.140> going<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.410> go

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
quite a fair bit but I'm going to go

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.340 
quite a fair bit but I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.980> put<00:03:05.220> in<00:03:05.400> my<00:03:05.430> tunnel<00:03:06.090> now<00:03:06.290> let<00:03:07.290> me

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
ahead and put in my tunnel now let me

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.310 
ahead and put in my tunnel now let me
just<00:03:07.500> go<00:03:07.560> grab<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:09.090> go<00:03:09.240> let<00:03:09.870> me<00:03:09.960> just<00:03:10.110> take

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
just go grab it you go let me just take

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.500 
just go grab it you go let me just take
this<00:03:10.520> ring<00:03:11.520> off<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.700> way<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:11.910> do<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.209> is<00:03:12.270> I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
this ring off the way I do this is I

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.370 
this ring off the way I do this is I
just<00:03:12.720> align<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:14.610> back<00:03:14.790> bit<00:03:15.030> up<00:03:15.300> with<00:03:15.990> the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
just align the back bit up with the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.199 
just align the back bit up with the
front<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.800> just<00:03:17.459> kind<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.850> slide<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.180> through

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
front and just kind of slide it through

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.970 
front and just kind of slide it through
so<00:03:18.570> what<00:03:18.810> I'm<00:03:18.930> actually<00:03:19.050> going<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.380> do<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.590> give

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
so what I'm actually going to do is give

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.510 
so what I'm actually going to do is give
this<00:03:20.070> a<00:03:20.190> spray<00:03:20.400> as<00:03:20.520> well<00:03:20.930> here<00:03:21.930> we<00:03:21.990> go

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
this a spray as well here we go

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:34.699 
this a spray as well here we go
um<00:03:26.060> okay<00:03:27.060> al<00:03:30.530> rillettes<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.680> our<00:03:31.890> wheeze<00:03:33.709> to

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
um okay al rillettes of our wheeze to

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:42.760 
um okay al rillettes of our wheeze to
work<00:03:35.540> no<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.570> didn't<00:03:36.840> know

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.630 

so<00:03:43.400> this<00:03:43.550> is<00:03:43.730> what<00:03:43.910> can<00:03:44.090> happen<00:03:44.300> when<00:03:44.840> you<00:03:45.640> fail

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
so this is what can happen when you fail

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.380 
so this is what can happen when you fail
at<00:03:46.970> stretching<00:03:49.750> like<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.900> said<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:52.790> is<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.060> lot

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
at stretching like I said it is a lot

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.510 
at stretching like I said it is a lot
more<00:03:53.420> sensitive<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.590> can<00:03:55.210> fuck<00:03:56.210> up<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:58.280> I'm

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
more sensitive and it can fuck up so I'm

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.760 
more sensitive and it can fuck up so I'm
going<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.790> go<00:03:58.910> ahead<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.450> put<00:04:00.050> my<00:04:00.080> to<00:04:00.260> gauge

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
going to go ahead and put my to gauge

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.570 
going to go ahead and put my to gauge
back<00:04:01.040> in<00:04:01.220> there<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:02.020> I<00:04:03.020> may<00:04:03.290> even<00:04:03.320> go<00:04:04.280> ahead

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
back in there and I may even go ahead

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:14.410 
back in there and I may even go ahead
and<00:04:04.880> get<00:04:05.120> this<00:04:05.270> professionally<00:04:05.930> done<00:04:13.420> anyways

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
and get this professionally done anyways

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.890 
and get this professionally done anyways
let<00:04:15.290> me<00:04:15.350> just<00:04:15.530> go<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:16.330> clear<00:04:17.330> this<00:04:17.450> up<00:04:17.660> and

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
let me just go and clear this up and

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.409 
let me just go and clear this up and
I'll<00:04:18.290> be<00:04:18.380> back<00:04:18.500> in<00:04:18.770> two<00:04:19.280> seconds

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.200 

because<00:04:23.199> it's<00:04:23.379> swollen<00:04:23.590> up<00:04:23.919> a<00:04:24.009> bit<00:04:24.159> I've<00:04:25.090> gone

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.189 
ahead and stuck my to gauge tape it back
in<00:04:28.300> there<00:04:29.430> just<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.520> help<00:04:30.610> me<00:04:30.759> put<00:04:30.969> the<00:04:31.750> tunnel

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
though I have been a to gauge for at

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.589 
though I have been a to gauge for at
least<00:04:42.099> a<00:04:42.490> month<00:04:42.939> month<00:04:43.270> and<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.419> half

the<00:04:53.949> swelling<00:04:54.840> didn't<00:04:55.840> really<00:04:55.990> have<00:04:56.139> any

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
the swelling didn't really have any

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.100 
the swelling didn't really have any
effect<00:04:56.379> on<00:04:56.680> that<00:04:56.849> I'm<00:04:57.849> worried<00:04:58.539> about<00:04:58.629> the

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
effect on that I'm worried about the

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.159 
effect on that I'm worried about the
back<00:04:59.439> of<00:04:59.770> my<00:04:59.949> to<00:05:00.009> gauge<00:05:00.310> no<00:05:00.930> because<00:05:01.930> when<00:05:02.139> I

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
back of my to gauge no because when I

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.689 
back of my to gauge no because when I
first<00:05:02.529> got<00:05:02.770> it<00:05:03.009> stretched

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
first got it stretched

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.260 
first got it stretched
I<00:05:03.729> got<00:05:03.939> a<00:05:03.969> stretch<00:05:04.210> by<00:05:04.360> a<00:05:04.389> professional<00:05:04.900> and

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
I got a stretch by a professional and

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.409 
I got a stretch by a professional and
before<00:05:07.270> that<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.509> was<00:05:07.659> quite<00:05:08.050> swollen<00:05:09.120> and<00:05:10.120> the

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
before that it was quite swollen and the

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.480 
before that it was quite swollen and the
back<00:05:10.569> of<00:05:10.719> it<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:11.439> o-ring<00:05:11.919> on<00:05:12.069> the<00:05:12.189> back<00:05:12.310> was

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
back of it the o-ring on the back was

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.860 
back of it the o-ring on the back was
quite<00:05:12.849> hard<00:05:13.029> to<00:05:13.180> get<00:05:13.300> in<00:05:13.389> and<00:05:13.539> it<00:05:13.629> wouldn't

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
quite hard to get in and it wouldn't

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.269 
quite hard to get in and it wouldn't
stay<00:05:14.159> but<00:05:15.509> I'm<00:05:16.509> gonna<00:05:16.629> try<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:17.860> can<00:05:18.039> yeah
