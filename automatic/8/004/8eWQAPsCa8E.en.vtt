00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.720 
know i got quite a long time ago but
just<00:02:21.650> found<00:02:21.799> out<00:02:21.920> my<00:02:22.010> hard<00:02:22.190> drive<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:22.519> i<00:02:22.549> could

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
just found out my hard drive so i could

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.039 
just found out my hard drive so i could
do<00:02:22.819> a<00:02:22.849> commentary<00:02:23.299> over<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.660> i<00:02:23.750> think<00:02:23.810> it's

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
do a commentary over it i think it's

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.619 
do a commentary over it i think it's
like<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.200> really<00:02:24.410> quick<00:02:24.650> mob<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.220> then<00:02:25.519> i<00:02:25.580> go<00:02:25.760> 97

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
like a really quick mob and then i go 97

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.690 
like a really quick mob and then i go 97
