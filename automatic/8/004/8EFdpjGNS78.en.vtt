00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 welcome to the instructional films of small landscape elements 9 inquire at your 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.300
 questions about the construction and maintenance of landscape elements will show you anp land 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.350
 and pruning because the trees and shrubs remain beautiful and healthy and you get 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.210
 fits the rest of the environment as well as possible today we are going to use the flap 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.759
 enschede own mooring 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:20.089
 twitter they learn 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.900
 might have to make you forget 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.599
 The cut and shave is mainly used to separate one 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.849
 orchard or a vegetable garden and the thirty used by a bearing bush 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.050
 keep the cattle at bay and do not forget if the iron lady is not on the 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.070
 windows are open then you can plan between November and March or like one 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.760
 You can plant scribble when a global warming has calmed down the winter 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.300
 between November and March 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.510
 we need that 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.290
 tone and posts 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.230
 the hammer the saver 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.070
 We don't care about a divorce 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.270
 and digital 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.270
 where do we start from the 3 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.170
 and see the permanent 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.100
 further the serenade little bit exaggerated i think you t'adore 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.940
 dots turntables all misery 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.219
 take a permanent seat in the permanent I mean 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.039
 You see permanent so therefore mainly locally maintained 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.840
 briefly, but so we indirectly put more 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.380
 it is in the right place in the yard on or look valued 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.680
 cultural heritage is about to be the best 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.570
 for example, if it is on the forehead, it will be reused as if 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.350
 need the existing lines 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.250
 follow neighbors or another plantation 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.730
 but otherwise also wait a while 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.220
 colorful wants the plan 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.020
 And look at the solemn plant because the fire department if you don't get there right away 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.000
 start planting and you can plant remnants under one another temporarily 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.220
 hole in the ground in place two contender in make sure you get there is covered with the 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.220
 So the borers are protected against cancer 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.690
 the free online care long in advance they end up on the ground 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.880
 if you have it at the start of the session 3 do not fire two posts 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.250
 but you choose a Protestant 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.230
 he became a very long way it may have been handy started arsenal detached 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.099
 for instance 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.469
 it has been sport for me 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.749
 Please note that you are not the type of customer 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.539
 only the root system has to go into the ground 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.539
 divide the soil that you sharply over the roots 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.430
 it must be a dense own so painter about four struijk a couple 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.179
 meter 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:29.580
 the density of the hedge 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.870
 but I am opposed to being attractive as a breeding ground and shelter for birds 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.799
 insects and small mammals are also proven to be the book 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.269
 the hague therefore also for an excellent decision 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.639
 when I'm done planting the road 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.870
 Then go the excess soil to pressing with your feet all while doing so 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:52.119
 the customers stuck so that you stay nicely upright once the judge plants 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:54.280
 is you can immediately start pruning 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.170
 and that is not easy, I immediately have half or even two thirds of the plants 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.390
 do this because he has it better packaged and therefore you 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.820
 have a fuller duty 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.320
 but by being an attractive one 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.419
 for birds small mammals and insects 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.889
 prune at the same height all the way 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.529
 it provided sufficient water in the first two years after planting 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.689
 rather no weeks of chicken decided to be full than a sip every day for fun 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:32.769
 This states the adult cut and shave and the name says it all 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.029
 cut and shave must be pruned at least twice a year 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:38.739
 a media circus also met twice a year 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.009
 cut and shave 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:42.689
 that can also disappear more often 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.280
 Also make sure that you prune the members down when pruning downwards 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.259
 so that the sunlight also comes at the bottom of the right 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.699
 nb the first end with a goal 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.939
 the difference is that with the drag goalkeeper usually around 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.829
 lecce the label would look up at home on the internet where are they alone 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.699
 for the sonorous and the vegetable it is not an event or come on 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.209
 it's possible 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.039
 it's about the lawyer 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:17.980
 planting the swiss in addition, there appeared the organization 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.359
 we receive
