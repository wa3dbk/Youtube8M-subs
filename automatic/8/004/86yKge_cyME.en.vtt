 People who like to take videos at the same time are good 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.100
 Maybe 2 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.190

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:50.070
 [musics] 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:54.990
 After all this is this It entered this two mountain hill shop instruction manuals 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.920
 This is to the very inn to guy Me mayor of example 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.670
 tripod 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.400
 tripod 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:09.440

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.440
 is 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.660
 It is what a tripod and sound size and then a slider became a set 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.520
 It seems that the price will not fall even if it waits 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.880
 I even though I would like to one but it is was crossing the other to purchase one one Aku' 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.580
 First guess from the person's customer 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.890
 [applause] 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.480
 Wow 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.840

 That's great I 'm great 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.550
 Alex with the pan head already set 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:50.430
 If you please say a part of the foot to twist this look 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.040
 You see spikes, do you open a little 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.909

 Oops 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.680
 What to read the Kozuetaira-kun, your instructions 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.540
 Yes yes this is a stopper 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.310
 If you remove this 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.150
 Good car 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.069
 Yeah yeah 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:25.560
 Isn't it good anymore this is great 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:29.940
 When you spread the rainbow of nine Redder Let's when the spread so far 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:35.239
 The sense of stability will increase tremendously if you extend it to here 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:40.640
 I say this is perfect and this is hugely expanded and this is very much expanded 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:43.590
 This Naa'm laden Let's go to go I'm a 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.989
 Oh my God I think that great 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.989
 This is It is a bread stick of this tripod head 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:04:02.000
 It's a bread stick It looks like a grip on a motorcycle 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:05.170
 It is this after being filled in yes Yes this is the biggest three layers of this time 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.050
 No sipper 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.240
 This entered 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.240
 It is a slider that I put 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.380
 Now this 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.760
 I move things that have stopped moving, I see it is amazing 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.660
 What shall we come from? 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.889
 It is one I think would like to describe from this ah 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.479
 It's amazing 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:34.219
 A tripod, such as a helluva crap sound video say yet this I Te originally Neribe' eat 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:40.129
 I'm making a maker but 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:46.550
 It seems quite unusual for the tripod maker to put out the slider together 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:47.880
 Well, this Lebeck's set called Alex is so good on this tripod 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.520
 Place the slider 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:56.670
 That seems to be the case when it is designed from the beginning so that it can be used and entered 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.480
 It will be difficult when explaining 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.480
 Difficult 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.240
 Oh 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:09.230
 I can not explain this I can explain it for a moment 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:13.700

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:17.120
 Ha ha yeah- this review or not 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:20.569
 Or will be described in Fu say if you think the ministry a little 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:25.400
 This would be a little Kedomo I think that generally seen Well 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:29.979
 My brain area is not confident I can complete the review to the end 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.979
 First of all I do not know the temperature well 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.990
 me 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.740
 me 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:40.020
 me 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:42.050
 Yes I think from now on whether I should divide it for each part and explain 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:47.060
 First tripod 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.440

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.480
