00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:02.800
 hello everyone here is the night is really that now 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.040
 close to 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.270
 holiday period for those who drink 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.170
 The first edition of this and on the web we have villa moments when 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.139
 we visit another important box because this product that 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.579
 we really waited 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:21.589
 I extend a product of the family nights to the family in the sda ​​family 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.719
 the one with a lot of metal, however, that makes a bit of a discussion also because i 

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:29.389
 levels of radiation access bags issued by the phone are a little more 

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:32.750
 high compared to the average of the circulation products this period but 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.820
 despite that defect in regards to radiation I have to say that 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.500
 these are really excellent products the 66 and the son of 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.280
 very lucky e65 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.749
 the difference compared to the predecessor that has a camera 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:51.340
 3-megapixel e2 with autofocus the predecessor instead 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.930
 he only had two xd make-up sets and this phone is also hsdpa 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.740
 obviously like all those who never come disappointed period the rental period 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.110
 world of nights a owned gps i'm back onto a side and also an accelerometer those 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.070
 which allows is simply 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.230
 re change the screen orientation by folding the 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.790
 phone I think I have forgotten anything about the feces and breaks through the mind of this 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.790
 product there is nothing left but to open the ladder 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.829
 so here we are with beautiful packaging of the l66 we are looking at we open 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.359
 she has locked me on the phone from very beautiful materials those that 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:32.780
 and we see right now button camera buttons for 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.420
 and the sound volume here is the power button at the top of the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.179
 phone mister jef ker the headphone connection and then the 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.019
 here the first two locations in this case is a micron vsb airing the classic rimini 

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:51.150
 to the accustomed one these are the buttons for opening 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.260
 very well spaced keyboard wonderful racing keys 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.229
 beautiful 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.430
 and these are the main commands then on the metal back 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.289
 very elegant three. This is the 2 megapixel convert for autofocus 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.629
 the camera is not there and nothing to say at 66 really nice 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.320
 particular telephone opening of the 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.910
 the body where there is the drums dance sees the sim is stuck up here in the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.349
 particular for entry 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.090
 of the micro sd gecko you see housed with an insert 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.169
 lateral respect 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:31.139
 on the phone after what's also in the box inler rest of the 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.120
 pack the headset with me 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.979
 stereo 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:37.319
 p come with me 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.609
 the package with foreign pride is not particularly valuable guess what not 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.750
 this is a dedicated multimedia phone 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.240
 the charger with a very small roma supplied all mobile phone that 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.360
 I also had a little 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.610
 in the cable supplied and for connection to the lanyard computers e 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.760
 also this 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.229
 custody 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:01.389
 side so comfortable with the insertion of the phone we send rock instead 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.450
 on the telephone 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.629
 in its splendor you see this and the illuminated front keyboard 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.290
 I think it's very nice to see the details in the buttons 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.660
 that allow access 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.339
 okay details 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:19.170
 the fire function moti born for example I have among my shortcuts 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.270
 in writing for sms messages with the configurability of this show 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.840
 besides we keep an eye on the menu this is obviously not the main theme 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.030
 the accelerometer demonstration tunnel has therefore always been present 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.570
 re turning the phone there is the possibility of cyran this mar did 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.350
 of many green products to move president bellelli the whole read 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.210
 beautiful image for lecce to say that this fact can also be used 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.000
 that of the phone movement 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.070
 what to see 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.630
 close in incoming phone calls then to reject phone calls enough 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.129
 fold the phone 4 alone 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.160
 these are then 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.209
 some typical functions of 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.830
 there is also the most evolved version of the 60 series menu 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.030
 is a windows mail will be inserted in and this package of the 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.840
 in the version does not take communications you see also laciate of the 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.180
 quick call and I would like to make the other laugh though 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.270
 detail of this phone and this is the register l 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.400
 read call clock with alarm and color world that is is one thing 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.640
 vito a lecco happens sometimes to fail to push the button at the top of the 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.360
 it's a bit invasive, let's say 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.060
 the per button of the age of the address book, with the calendar with ver 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.380
 Current structuring interesting to note the fact that 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.790
 the list of new event entries has changed instead 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.000
 looks different than previous versions of being 60d on this 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.060
 however, unfortunately it does not have the most recent equipment of the e 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.220
 s60certkey save file manager file but not complete with we would like configuration 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.520
 for the l 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.389
 l wireless network 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.419
 these, therefore, will indicate the messages 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.120
 women with the possibility of Christmas sea receive e-mail 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.960
 few hypertension but also because there is also 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.259
 an even extra hug for exchange econoca camera 3 point 2 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.810
 megapixel outdoors performance a little less the interior let's say it doesn't have one 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.879
 very high quality 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:34.870
 there are many instead we say me there are many programs to be installed 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.870
 and I put away a man you can also find ascot manager 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.880
 inserted in the telecmc free of charge, this is also interesting 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.819
 mode the appearance of the wave phone the bull also used then 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:49.490
 he is married you are no longer seen just to be more 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.830
 we say simply connected to the touch of a phone 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.219
 jovanotti also to the media player and this is it 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:00.600
 trailer then I love to show the music player 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.030
 d 1066 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.249
 the classic music player 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:11.839
 entella be 60 obviously reads the metadata of the songs nn I love desenclos 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.859
 I have this is a song with a cover worth the provision 

00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:15.639
 cover of 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.189
 rally now luiss e 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:20.260
 terms of appear therefore elementary date of the song 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.840
 and it continues at the casola also sonare 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.660
 Well coming out - a pity that the indicator doesn't bark - I don't have it 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.780
 set test tubes 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.980
 I have yet to complete all of the neku phone's settings when it comes out with 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.699
 the end conversation key is the song but it is not 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.749
 a frontal view of the games even the maps are not in this moment 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:42.970
 connected re 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:48.140
 to the internet it must be said that the fix of this impressive satellite when 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.010
 you are connected 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:55.020
 to the buried rt within a few seconds you get the satellite fix 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.719
 let's see then 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:07:00.949
 the maximum perception of a site map costs 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:02.840
 is the center of monza where I was 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.960
 for a few days ago 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.180
 I didn't show you the fix now in real time simply because of the fact 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.800
 which would be much longer without the aid of the GPS 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.139
 assisted maps also 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:17.819
 in 3d version but this was something to which 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:20.219
 we were already pretty used to it 

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:21.960
 frog maps that obviously 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.060
 in this case the most recent version here on the law 66 is installed 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.270
 navigation is not included 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:35.199
 the navigator is the navigation system for the vella 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.090
 embedded midi 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.199
 you can see them but what to look for addresses 

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:42.590
 but not getting the navigation to the destination there is the famous walk 

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.690
 Gando between 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:49.950
 for functions that are offered to re-build the and even in 

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.430
 common with navigation system in my opinion discreet 

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.510
 lamma many prefer to install abruzzese sex in my opinion it is not then 

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:01.910
 so it seems this product here is therefore the 66 in all its splendor
