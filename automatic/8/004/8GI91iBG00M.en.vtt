research<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.539> they

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
research and they

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.780 
research and they
that<00:04:23.500> once<00:04:23.950> you<00:04:24.010> start<00:04:24.220> getting<00:04:24.310> into<00:04:24.520> those

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
sometimes give inaccurate readings so

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.960 
sometimes give inaccurate readings so
anyways<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:34.470> think<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.890> best<00:04:36.190> best<00:04:36.730> way<00:04:36.880> to

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
anyways I think the best best way to

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.550 
anyways I think the best best way to
really<00:04:37.210> track<00:04:37.570> is<00:04:37.780> just<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:38.290> know<00:04:38.380> look

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
really track is just you know look

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.520 
really track is just you know look
yourself<00:04:38.680> in<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.070> mirror<00:04:39.370> progress<00:04:40.030> pics

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
yourself in the mirror progress pics

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.250 
yourself in the mirror progress pics
when<00:04:41.530> he<00:04:41.650> checked<00:04:41.980> me<00:04:42.160> up<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:43.750> know<00:04:43.780> like

when he checked me up you know like

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.630 
when he checked me up you know like
right<00:04:44.440> when<00:04:44.590> I<00:04:44.620> saw<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.830> on<00:04:45.010> run<00:04:45.190> results<00:04:45.580> I

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
right when I saw the on run results I

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.550 
right when I saw the on run results I
kind<00:04:45.910> of<00:04:45.940> knew<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.180> was<00:04:46.390> already<00:04:46.570> off<00:04:46.810> because

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
kind of knew it was already off because

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.890 
kind of knew it was already off because
I<00:04:47.740> already<00:04:48.010> felt<00:04:48.250> like<00:04:48.340> I'm<00:04:48.760> looking<00:04:49.150> more

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
I already felt like I'm looking more

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
I already felt like I'm looking more
solid<00:04:50.530> you<00:04:50.830> know<00:04:51.430> my<00:04:51.580> abs<00:04:51.790> aren't<00:04:52.420> everything

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920

after<00:04:53.920> doing<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.280> hit<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.490> already<00:04:55.090> noticed<00:04:55.390> a

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
after doing the hit I already noticed a

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.440 
after doing the hit I already noticed a
difference<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:56.800> anyways<00:04:57.130> I<00:04:57.550> think<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.270> best

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
difference so anyways I think the best

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.530 
difference so anyways I think the best
way<00:04:58.660> to<00:04:58.690> really<00:04:59.080> track<00:04:59.440> your<00:04:59.920> progress<00:05:00.070> is<00:05:00.580> use

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
way to really track your progress is use

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.690 
way to really track your progress is use
the<00:05:01.750> mirror<00:05:01.990> guys<00:05:02.230> use<00:05:02.470> mirror<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:02.890> tape

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
the mirror guys use mirror and tape

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.660 
the mirror guys use mirror and tape
measure<00:05:03.940> so<00:05:04.930> my<00:05:05.200> arms<00:05:05.560> are<00:05:05.710> still<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:05.980> same<00:05:06.190> so

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
measure so my arms are still the same so

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.180 
measure so my arms are still the same so
I<00:05:07.180> haven't<00:05:07.780> lost<00:05:08.020> any<00:05:08.260> size<00:05:08.530> there<00:05:08.830> having
