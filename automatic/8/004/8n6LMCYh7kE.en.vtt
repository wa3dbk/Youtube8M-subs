work pretty good
I<00:00:52.160> had<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.309> wire<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.879> switch<00:00:54.120> down<00:00:54.329> here

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
I had the wire on a switch down here

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.360 
I had the wire on a switch down here
because<00:00:55.699> they<00:00:56.699> didn't<00:00:56.969> send<00:00:58.370> momentary

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
because they didn't send momentary

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.189 
because they didn't send momentary
switch<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.180> don't<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.539> hydraulic<00:01:00.870> back

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
works off hydraulic pressure but I got

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.800

tried to put a Celtic knot on and I

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.600 
tried to put a Celtic knot on and I
didn't<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.170> painted<00:01:43.500> over<00:01:43.740> looks

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
didn't like it so I painted over looks

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.639 
didn't like it so I painted over looks
like<00:01:44.759> crap

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
like crap

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.170 
like crap
but<00:01:46.649> there<00:01:46.799> was<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> huge<00:01:47.250> crack<00:01:47.520> right<00:01:47.790> answer

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
but there was a huge crack right answer

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.749 
but there was a huge crack right answer
here<00:01:49.220> that's<00:01:50.220> it

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
here that's it

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.260 
here that's it
and<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.780> solid<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.579> no<00:01:53.579> worked<00:01:53.759> out<00:01:53.909> okay

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.290
