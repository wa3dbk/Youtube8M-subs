00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.589
 group of police officers came to the presidency of the Dominican Republic with 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.909
 a promise and that promise was that he 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.569
 never 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.439
 I would seek reelection 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.819
 the president mejía 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:34.300
 he just broke that promise and wants to stay four years in power and 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.699
 that's why we want to talk with him, we travel to Santo Domingo what we 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.190
 we found are president of easy word 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.690
 who often say the first thing that comes to mind when they have critics 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.330
 even within your closest collaborators 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.980
 and in the neck whose vocabulary abounds with bad words 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.040
 Pedro 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.730
 true 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.399
 finally he mentioned 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.399
 the president of the Dominican Republic mouth and well 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.900
 falls very bad squares 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.960
 caracas he is a person 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.620
 a little bit jarring 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.970
 in relation to what he says and what they do is that the figure 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.290
 those in more 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.160
 the invalid 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.450
 last year 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.740
 that's why we wanted to meet with military personnel the first thing we noticed that 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.880
 circulate visibilize 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.600
 I also tell you what I think 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.520
 will take out in romeo mines 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.410
 Hipólito Mejía has a reputation for not getting along with journalists 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.010
 Arrived of no sex 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.910
 once others are detected 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.710
 bbk live cd 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.690
 and naturally we started the interview by asking him about his frequent 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.799
 clashes with the press the present telepresence that does not like the 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.270
 journalists who bother you I like but the only thing that journalists do not 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.640
 they have the right to say what I want or a mediocre president presented 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.770
 yesterday to right has decided what to say because I think that freedom 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.840
 you have called the Taliban the journalists yes 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.719
 you said that your opponents are 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.930
 let's go alone 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.710
 dinosaurs some 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.250
 is that the way to express a present republic but not I leave 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.160
 and expressing york are bought 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.970
 from the Dominican Republic is to say at least May 11 I think that there 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.889
 will keep operative 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.229
 in terms of law is successful and opened us to 1 percent otal iván a 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:23.629
 journalism I could not 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.310
 tap according to obama go if you liked it I understand that grammatical word 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:28.229
 wish 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:29.559
 that points to that 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:32.559
 there was a person who is still being treated 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.159
 the nonsense the least you should do as you 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.219
 one of the maximum 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.759
 it is not repetitive with so much abuse of the country 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.799
 in the united states and the countries of the european union for example 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.170
 it is common to hear criticism and even teasing 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.329
 of presidents and heads of government 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.349
 that is the norm 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.299
 but in Latin America and the Caribbean 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.010
 where the democracies are just consolidating and where the presidents 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.349
 they tend to accumulate a lot of power sometimes 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.160
 the critics of the presidents 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.179
 they can finish 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:02.399
 in jail 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:06.210
 relatively recently two journalists died a radio survey 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.240
 and people had to vote for president mejía expo for the devil 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:11.869
 in the end 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:13.249
 the devil 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:15.079
 won in that informal survey 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.499
 fourteen votes found 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.859
 After the radio program the two journalists ended up in jail 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:22.400
 for three days 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.919
 one of his journalists preparing mobile 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.070
 the posed 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.559
 after being official 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:30.189
 we learn nothing 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.649
 the devil won 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:33.379
 who gets them in jail 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.199
 I knew dry 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.459
 he immediately learned of that case 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.529
 Roman Díaz Ordaz 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:42.379
 pueyrredón rosero that the first not poor devil cody simpson driver did not have 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.519
 nothing to do with matters of the nation 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.509
 the eleven I sent him to release it is dangerous to criticize him then 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.489
 we're going to port madryn still here 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.589
 they are all alive 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:54.889
 but be careful 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.129
 the same brother of one of the journalists arrested eduardo lehm urine 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.009
 and did not want to criticize President Hipólito Mejía for arresting 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:06.179
 his very good hour brother here has nothing to do 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.599
 I get the impression of defending hipolito some I'm not defending 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.459
 because seat German with hipolito 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.909
 when there is not another one who is afraid that something happens to them for something or 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.269
 yesterday he had never had it 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.900
 you're not afraid that the norm did not either get the ticket it's a 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.069
 very noble man 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.899
 journalists are not the only ones who have had problems with officials 

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:32.259
 of the government and for freedom of expression 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.930
 the one that there is no money 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.289
 that's the town 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:36.909
 paco again 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.350
 so far this year the nelson artist of the hoya 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.710
 known for making controversial songs was sued for having 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.699
 gone on a television show 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:46.630
 Dress with 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.330
 the official uniform 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.129
 the demand Freemasonry justice 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.620
 with all the powers so much to the law 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.670
 we want to thank the jail 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.979
 of speakers and nothing has happened 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.620
 I meet very often 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.940
 some would think these Indians an attack on freedom of expression desire 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.480
 only an icon for hipolito mejía companies or freedom of expression 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.419
 it can not 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.270
 the laws but why do not you go by armed force do not allow it is without 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.520
 discussion 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.259
 all the workers 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.539
 military in tetera a joke on television or we do not propose armed 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.939
 the institutions do not relax our country 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.000
 three freedom of expression is presented to us 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 imagine of old trafford when aging is fun 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.210
 Hipólito Mejía has had confrontations not only with artists and 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.990
 journalists if not also 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.210
 with the president of venezuela hugo chávez they are accusing him 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.870
 to you and your government 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.089
 d 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.089
 to conspire to kill the president of venezuela
