there and the line over here and a
little<00:02:12.030> dot<00:02:12.180> there<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.709> gives<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:15.360> effect

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
little dot there that gives the effect

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.180 
little dot there that gives the effect
of<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.920> shine<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.640> shimmer<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.390> heart
