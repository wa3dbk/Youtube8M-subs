I<00:00:33.239> kind<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.350> like<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.530> dusting<00:00:35.010> technique

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
I kind of just like a dusting technique

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.310 
I kind of just like a dusting technique
I<00:00:35.880> think<00:00:36.149> that's<00:00:36.270> what<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:36.480> call<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.840> where

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
I think that's what they call it where

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.569 
I think that's what they call it where
you<00:00:37.380> sort<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.649> section<00:00:37.980> out<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> pieces<00:00:38.370> of

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
you sort of section out the pieces of

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.310 
you sort of section out the pieces of
hair<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:40.850> you<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.000> either<00:00:42.180> literally<00:00:42.870> twist

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
hair and you can either literally twist

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.650 
hair and you can either literally twist
your<00:00:43.530> hair<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.730> little<00:00:44.910> bits

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
your hair like this and the little bits

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.630 
your hair like this and the little bits
that<00:00:45.780> stick<00:00:45.840> out<00:00:46.140> will<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.469> they<00:00:47.399> should<00:00:47.610> be

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that stick out will be they should be

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.150 
that stick out will be they should be
just<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:48.090> ends<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:49.260> literally<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.680> get<00:00:50.039> my

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
just it ends and I literally just get my

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.319 
just it ends and I literally just get my
sisters<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:52.500> trim<00:00:52.860> off<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.430> ends<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
sisters and so trim off the ends of a

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.779 
sisters and so trim off the ends of a
sealer<00:00:54.590> now<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.770> side<00:00:55.920> basically<00:00:56.489> is

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
sealer now this side basically is

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.970 
sealer now this side basically is
already<00:00:57.239> done<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.649> could<00:00:58.800> tell

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
already done and then if you could tell

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.240 
already done and then if you could tell
the<00:00:59.039> difference<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.760> harder<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:01.250> don't

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the difference this is harder I don't

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.920 
the difference this is harder I don't
know<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.489> really<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.329> feed<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.809> then

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
know it's really I can feed it and then

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.420 
know it's really I can feed it and then
you<00:01:03.989> can't<00:01:04.229> feel<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.500> obviously<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.220> it's

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you can't feel it obviously but it's

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.109 
you can't feel it obviously but it's
very<00:01:05.700> smooth<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.240> decide<00:01:07.130> this<00:01:08.130> very<00:01:08.850> naughty

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
perpendicular to the damage because i

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.060 
perpendicular to the damage because i
think<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> cut<00:01:53.040> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.980 
think it's like you have to cut a
millimeter<00:01:53.640> from<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.240> say<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> spin

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
millimeter from it say this is a spin

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.340 
millimeter from it say this is a spin
and<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.350> damage<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.799> here<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.700> cuts<00:01:56.969> off<00:01:57.350> this

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
and the damage is here you cuts off this

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.380 
and the damage is here you cuts off this
way<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.460> completely<00:01:59.880> cut<00:02:00.240> it

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
way you have to completely cut it

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.990 
way you have to completely cut it
straight<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.520> that<00:02:02.520> should<00:02:02.700> eliminate

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
straight and that should eliminate

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.059 
straight and that should eliminate
completely<00:02:03.600> eliminate<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> damage<00:02:05.040> um<00:02:07.069> if

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
completely eliminate the damage um if

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.889 
completely eliminate the damage um if
you<00:02:08.310> haven't<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.789> difficulty<00:02:09.450> seeing<00:02:09.690> this

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
you haven't just difficulty seeing this

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.690 
you haven't just difficulty seeing this
in<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.110> end<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.709> hold<00:02:10.920> up<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.459> light

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
in the end you can hold up to the light

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.880 
in the end you can hold up to the light
you<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.720> work<00:02:12.900> through<00:02:13.110> sections

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
you have to work through sections

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.470 
you have to work through sections
