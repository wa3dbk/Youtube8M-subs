00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
using vs. to basically compare these two

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.230 
using vs. to basically compare these two
games<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.650> each<00:00:22.680> other<00:00:22.890> because<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.369> said<00:00:24.150> of

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
games with each other because I said of

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.269 
games with each other because I said of
course<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.510> isn't<00:00:24.630> out<00:00:24.840> yet<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.619> still<00:00:25.980> in

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
course it isn't out yet it's still in

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.429 
course it isn't out yet it's still in
early<00:00:26.550> access<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:27.090> sort<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.390> still<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> beta

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
early access it's sort of still a beta

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.290 
early access it's sort of still a beta
so<00:00:28.830> there's<00:00:29.189> obviously<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.119> less

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
so there's obviously going to be less

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.429 
so there's obviously going to be less
cares<00:00:30.599> there's<00:00:30.810> obviously<00:00:31.050> gonna<00:00:31.140> be<00:00:31.260> like

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
cares there's obviously gonna be like

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.120 
cares there's obviously gonna be like
less<00:00:31.710> tracks<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.880> we'll<00:00:33.120> try<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.420> focus<00:00:33.690> on

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
less tracks but we'll try to focus on

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.420 
less tracks but we'll try to focus on
some<00:00:35.130> sort<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.550> an<00:00:36.059> even<00:00:36.870> ground<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.410> try<00:00:38.399> to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
some sort of an even ground and try to

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.459 
some sort of an even ground and try to
talk<00:00:38.700> about<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.180> something<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.780> sounds

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
talk about that something like sounds

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.049 
talk about that something like sounds
and<00:00:40.710> graphics<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:42.290> also<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:44.190> know<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.670> just

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
and graphics and also you know just just

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
and graphics and also you know just just
the<00:00:45.120> gameplay<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> physics<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.739> way

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the gameplay and the physics and the way

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.470 
the gameplay and the physics and the way
everything<00:00:47.219> works<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> game<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.030> that's

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
everything works in the game so that's

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.340 
everything works in the game so that's
pretty<00:00:48.629> much<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> talk<00:00:49.200> about

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
pretty much what I going to talk about

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.160 
pretty much what I going to talk about
in<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.980> video<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.940> first<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.300> all<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.960> said

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
in this video so first of all as I said

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.920 
in this video so first of all as I said
I<00:00:52.949> said<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.820> course<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.210> still<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.750> early

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
I said of course is still in early

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.600 
I said of course is still in early
access<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:56.460> many

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
access so it's not going to have as many

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.849 
access so it's not going to have as many
things<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:57.000> gran<00:00:57.600> turismo<00:00:57.840> 6<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.230> also<00:00:58.410> not

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
going to be perfected even though i

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.330 
going to be perfected even though i
wouldn't<00:01:01.230> say<00:01:01.410> control<00:01:01.920> no<00:01:02.010> six<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.309> perfect

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340

care but driving behind the car like
this<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.340> really<00:02:50.820> really<00:02:51.120> bad<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.110> I

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
this is just really really bad and I

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.710 
this is just really really bad and I
don't<00:02:52.350> like<00:02:52.500> doing<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.580> just<00:02:53.670> awful<00:02:54.030> with

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
don't like doing it it's just awful with

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.970 
don't like doing it it's just awful with
the<00:02:54.840> movement<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.410> camera<00:02:55.560> look<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:55.920> just

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.380 
the movement of the camera look it just
looks<00:02:56.280> like<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.400> care<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.730> drifting<00:02:57.090> all<00:02:57.270> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
looks like the care is drifting all the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.520 
looks like the care is drifting all the
time<00:02:57.540> just<00:02:57.720> because<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.080> way<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> camera

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
time just because the way the camera

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.290 
time just because the way the camera
angle<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.760> just<00:02:59.940> don't<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.270> I

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
angle is and I just don't like that I

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.910 
angle is and I just don't like that I

rear<00:03:02.910> end<00:03:03.120> camera<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.540> way<00:03:03.660> it's<00:03:03.810> in

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
rear end camera the way it's in

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.560 
rear end camera the way it's in
graduation<00:03:04.350> 16<00:03:04.650> i<00:03:04.710> think<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:04.980> perfect<00:03:05.570> now

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
graduation 16 i think it's perfect now

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.840 
graduation 16 i think it's perfect now
handling<00:03:06.930> i<00:03:07.440> think<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> set<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:08.670> course

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
handling i think that a set of course

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.250 
handling i think that a set of course
our<00:03:08.970> has<00:03:09.120> handling<00:03:09.510> down<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> little<00:03:10.110> bit

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
our has handling down a little bit

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.870 
our has handling down a little bit
better<00:03:10.410> than<00:03:10.620> gran<00:03:10.890> turismo<00:03:11.130> 6<00:03:11.160> run<00:03:11.490> Turismo<00:03:11.730> 6

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
better than gran turismo 6 run Turismo 6

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.970 
better than gran turismo 6 run Turismo 6
has<00:03:12.150> loads<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.540> these<00:03:12.690> assists<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.320> even

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
has loads of these assists and even

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.560 
has loads of these assists and even
though<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:14.130> turn<00:03:14.520> them<00:03:14.700> off<00:03:14.790> or<00:03:14.970> whatever<00:03:15.150> and

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
though you turn them off or whatever and

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.810 
though you turn them off or whatever and
there's<00:03:16.200> still<00:03:16.920> like<00:03:17.070> these<00:03:17.250> like<00:03:17.490> hidden

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
there's still like these like hidden

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.390 
there's still like these like hidden
assists<00:03:18.210> that<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.450> guys<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.990> turn<00:03:19.140> off<00:03:19.400> which

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
assists that you guys can turn off which

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.710 
assists that you guys can turn off which
will<00:03:20.580> help<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.910> out<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.360> know<00:03:21.450> when<00:03:21.600> you're

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
will help you out you know when you're

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.940 
will help you out you know when you're
drifting<00:03:22.110> when<00:03:22.230> you're<00:03:22.350> driving<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.860> doing

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
drifting when you're driving and doing

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.010 
drifting when you're driving and doing
all<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.280> stuff<00:03:23.490> so<00:03:23.540> basically<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.720> don't

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
all that stuff so basically I don't

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.330 
all that stuff so basically I don't
really<00:03:25.320> know<00:03:25.500> how<00:03:25.680> this<00:03:25.710> is<00:03:25.860> or<00:03:26.190> how<00:03:26.280> to

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
really know how this is or how to

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.520 
really know how this is or how to
compare<00:03:26.610> with<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.720> know<00:03:27.810> using<00:03:28.050> a<00:03:28.230> steering

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
compare with a you know using a steering

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.990 
compare with a you know using a steering
wheel<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:28.680> I'm<00:03:28.950> guessing<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.400> set<00:03:29.550> of<00:03:29.640> course<00:03:29.790> is

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
wheel so I'm guessing a set of course is

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.520 
wheel so I'm guessing a set of course is
a<00:03:30.030> really<00:03:30.660> good<00:03:30.780> with<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.960> steering<00:03:31.230> wheel<00:03:31.260> but

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
a really good with a steering wheel but

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.930 
a really good with a steering wheel but
I'm<00:03:31.620> also<00:03:31.800> guessing<00:03:32.040> gran<00:03:32.310> turismo<00:03:32.550> 6<00:03:32.580> is

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
I'm also guessing gran turismo 6 is

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.430 
I'm also guessing gran turismo 6 is
really<00:03:33.180> good<00:03:33.270> with<00:03:33.300> steering<00:03:33.630> wheel<00:03:33.840> just

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
really good with steering wheel just

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.170 
really good with steering wheel just
because<00:03:34.740> it<00:03:35.130> is<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.610> know<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.730> little<00:03:35.910> bit<00:03:36.000> more

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
because it is you know a little bit more

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.660 
because it is you know a little bit more
accurate<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.750> don't<00:03:36.930> have<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.670> assists

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
accurate and you don't have the assists

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.100 
accurate and you don't have the assists
and<00:03:38.790> stuff<00:03:38.910> like<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.240> you<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.960> you'd

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
and stuff like that that you that you'd

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.380 
and stuff like that that you that you'd
do<00:03:40.320> with<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.190> controller<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:41.880> guess<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.360> is

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
do with a controller so I guess it is

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.870 
do with a controller so I guess it is
much<00:03:42.720> more<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:43.200> guess<00:03:43.620> pure<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.790> know

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
much more I guess pure and you know

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.490 
much more I guess pure and you know
playing<00:03:45.060> with<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.270> playing<00:03:45.810> with<00:03:46.020> a<00:03:46.110> wheel<00:03:46.260> is

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
playing with it playing with a wheel is

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.260 
playing with it playing with a wheel is
just<00:03:46.530> more<00:03:46.920> realistic<00:03:47.400> on<00:03:47.520> both<00:03:47.760> games<00:03:48.030> I'm

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
just more realistic on both games I'm

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.420 
just more realistic on both games I'm
guessing<00:03:49.050> but<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.560> did<00:03:49.740> play<00:03:49.920> with<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.070> wheel<00:03:50.250> on

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
guessing but I did play with a wheel on

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.760 
guessing but I did play with a wheel on
the<00:03:50.850> on<00:03:51.480> Gran<00:03:51.720> Turismo<00:03:51.840> 6<00:03:52.110> before<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.620> it's

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
the on Gran Turismo 6 before and it's

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.740 
the on Gran Turismo 6 before and it's
just<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.580> different<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.210> different<00:03:54.690> to

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
just it is different it is different to

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.440 
just it is different it is different to
playing<00:03:54.960> with<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.530> controller<00:03:55.710> and<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.790> does

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
playing with a controller and it does

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.420 
playing with a controller and it does
you<00:03:57.870> know<00:03:57.960> handle<00:03:58.290> like<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.470> like<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:58.980> simulator

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
you know handle like a like a simulator

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.940 
you know handle like a like a simulator
i<00:03:59.610> guess<00:03:59.820> i<00:04:00.030> can<00:04:00.270> say<00:04:00.420> that<00:04:00.800> driving<00:04:01.800> physics

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
i guess i can say that driving physics

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.170 
i guess i can say that driving physics
that<00:04:02.400> they're<00:04:02.850> both<00:04:03.120> very<00:04:03.450> very<00:04:03.840> very<00:04:04.530> close

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
that they're both very very very close

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.520 
that they're both very very very close
now<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.330> course<00:04:06.450> run<00:04:06.690> Turismo<00:04:06.930> 6<00:04:07.080> as<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.290> said

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
now of course run Turismo 6 as I said

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.890 
now of course run Turismo 6 as I said
has<00:04:07.710> it's<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.250> it's<00:04:08.970> little<00:04:09.270> assists<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.780> stuff

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
has it's a it's little assists and stuff

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.300 
has it's a it's little assists and stuff
like<00:04:10.020> that<00:04:10.080> so<00:04:10.380> it's<00:04:10.740> going<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.070> be<00:04:11.160> a<00:04:11.190> little

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
like that so it's going to be a little

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.650 
like that so it's going to be a little
bit<00:04:11.490> easier<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.880> drive<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.180> Gran<00:04:12.300> Turismo<00:04:12.390> 6

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
bit easier to drive in Gran Turismo 6

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.810 
bit easier to drive in Gran Turismo 6
and<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:12.960> is<00:04:13.050> in<00:04:13.200> a<00:04:13.260> set<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.500> core<00:04:13.650> sir<00:04:13.830> now<00:04:14.700> i'm

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
and it is in a set of core sir now i'm

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.060 
and it is in a set of core sir now i'm
talking<00:04:15.150> with<00:04:15.300> a<00:04:15.660> controller<00:04:16.530> you<00:04:16.950> know

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
talking with a controller you know

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.599 
talking with a controller you know
driving<00:04:17.480> and<00:04:18.480> that's<00:04:19.290> pretty<00:04:19.890> much<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.190> I

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
driving and that's pretty much it I

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.159 
driving and that's pretty much it I
don't<00:04:21.330> really<00:04:21.450> have<00:04:21.630> anything<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.989> say

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
don't really have anything to say

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.659 
don't really have anything to say
against<00:04:22.410> these<00:04:22.560> two<00:04:22.680> games<00:04:22.860> if<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.490> want<00:04:23.610> to

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
against these two games if you want to

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.830 
against these two games if you want to
buy<00:04:23.790> this<00:04:23.850> game<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.450> an<00:04:24.570> early

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
buy this game it is an early

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.370 
buy this game it is an early
access<00:04:25.139> as<00:04:25.290> I<00:04:25.410> said<00:04:25.620> previously<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:27.050> it<00:04:28.050> is

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
access as I said previously and it is

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.420 
access as I said previously and it is
cheaper<00:04:28.710> than<00:04:28.740> when<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.040> game<00:04:29.160> is<00:04:29.310> actually
