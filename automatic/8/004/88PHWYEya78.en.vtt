00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
hey guys Jaden from i jailbreak calm and

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.959 
hey guys Jaden from i jailbreak calm and
today<00:00:10.620> really<00:00:10.980> taking<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> look<00:00:11.490> at<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> cool

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
today really taking a look at a cool

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.089 
today really taking a look at a cool
little<00:00:12.179> trick<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.840> actually<00:00:13.469> combines<00:00:13.860> an

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
little trick that actually combines an

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.650 
little trick that actually combines an
app<00:00:14.280> that's<00:00:14.519> available<00:00:14.670> inside<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.509> app

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
app that's available inside the app

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.140 
app that's available inside the app
store<00:00:15.690> with<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> winterboard<00:00:17.279> theme<00:00:17.520> that

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
store with a winterboard theme that

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.689 
store with a winterboard theme that
allows<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.900> create<00:00:19.320> custom<00:00:20.100> lockscreen

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
allows you to create custom lockscreen

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.210 
allows you to create custom lockscreen
themes<00:00:21.230> so<00:00:22.230> there's<00:00:22.410> tons<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.740> lockscreen

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
themes so there's tons of lockscreen

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.519 
themes so there's tons of lockscreen
themes<00:00:23.460> available<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:24.119> cydia<00:00:24.359> but<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> only

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
themes available in cydia but the only

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.160 
themes available in cydia but the only
downside<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.070> there's<00:00:26.369> only<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:27.240> handful<00:00:27.779> or<00:00:27.960> so

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
downside is there's only a handful or so

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.080 
downside is there's only a handful or so
they're<00:00:28.380> actually<00:00:28.859> worth<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.400> installation

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
they're actually worth the installation

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.690 
they're actually worth the installation
and<00:00:30.330> because<00:00:31.320> lockscreen<00:00:31.859> themes<00:00:32.130> are<00:00:32.369> hard

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
and because lockscreen themes are hard

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.049 
and because lockscreen themes are hard
to<00:00:32.850> edit<00:00:33.000> if<00:00:33.390> you're<00:00:33.540> not<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> tech<00:00:34.200> savvy<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:35.130> lot

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
to edit if you're not a tech savvy a lot

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.400 
to edit if you're not a tech savvy a lot
of<00:00:36.149> times<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.540> turns<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> lot<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.050> people<00:00:37.230> off

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
need to install lockscreen clock I'd you

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399 
need to install lockscreen clock I'd you
are<00:01:20.610> necessarily<00:01:21.060> need<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.330> install<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.780> but

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
are necessarily need to install this but

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.929 
are necessarily need to install this but
it's<00:01:22.500> good<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:23.520> when<00:01:23.790> you're

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
it's good to have because when you're

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.399 
it's good to have because when you're
modifying<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> lock<00:01:24.659> screen<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> times

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
modifying the lock screen all the times

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.039 
modifying the lock screen all the times
the<00:01:25.590> default<00:01:25.950> clock<00:01:26.159> gets<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> way<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.810> if

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the default clock gets in the way so if

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.300 
the default clock gets in the way so if
you<00:01:28.080> want<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> default<00:01:28.680> clock<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.159> don't

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
you want have a default clock you don't

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.859 
you want have a default clock you don't
necessarily<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.909> install<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.689> as

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
necessarily have to install this but as

things<00:03:35.239> like<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:36.200> size<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.709> element<00:03:37.060> the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
things like the size of that element the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.580 
things like the size of that element the
color<00:03:38.389> so<00:03:39.970> that's<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.209> font<00:03:41.569> which<00:03:42.169> is<00:03:42.349> neat

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
color so that's the font which is neat

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.729 
color so that's the font which is neat
then<00:03:43.160> we<00:03:43.250> can<00:03:43.400> adjust<00:03:44.299> I<00:03:44.989> think<00:03:45.290> this<00:03:45.410> is<00:03:45.560> the

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
then we can adjust I think this is the

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.319 
then we can adjust I think this is the
uppercase<00:03:46.579> lowercase<00:03:46.790> default<00:03:48.970> then<00:03:49.970> we<00:03:50.120> got

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
uppercase lowercase default then we got

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.680 
uppercase lowercase default then we got
the<00:03:51.200> color<00:03:51.849> so<00:03:52.849> as<00:03:52.910> you<00:03:53.030> guys<00:03:53.090> can<00:03:53.269> see<00:03:53.329> there's

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
the color so as you guys can see there's

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.270 
the color so as you guys can see there's
a<00:03:53.750> whole<00:03:53.930> bunch<00:03:54.079> of<00:03:54.230> customization<00:03:54.889> options

little<00:05:10.250> trick<00:05:10.520> I<00:05:10.909> what's<00:05:11.630> kind<00:05:11.840> of<00:05:11.870> cool<00:05:11.930> about

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
little trick I what's kind of cool about

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.629 
little trick I what's kind of cool about
as<00:05:12.380> i<00:05:12.409> said<00:05:12.620> before<00:05:12.710> as<00:05:12.979> it<00:05:13.070> combines<00:05:13.220> an<00:05:13.490> app

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
as i said before as it combines an app

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.120 
as i said before as it combines an app
that's<00:05:13.760> actually<00:05:14.090> inside<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:14.389> app<00:05:14.599> store
