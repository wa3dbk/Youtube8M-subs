00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.140 

so<00:05:07.530> it's<00:05:07.650> not<00:05:07.740> even<00:05:07.830> focusing<00:05:08.370> sweetie<00:05:08.910> see

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
so it's not even focusing sweetie see

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:17.390 
so it's not even focusing sweetie see
anyway<00:05:09.480> but<00:05:11.300> now<00:05:12.300> it's<00:05:12.990> paired<00:05:15.830> so<00:05:16.830> for<00:05:17.160> one<00:05:17.310> to

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
anyway but now it's paired so for one to

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.150

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.760 

I<00:05:23.250> think<00:05:23.730> this<00:05:23.850> thing<00:05:24.090> can<00:05:24.360> take<00:05:27.230> up<00:05:28.230> to<00:05:28.500> three

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
I think this thing can take up to three

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.980 
I think this thing can take up to three
devices<00:05:28.950> at<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:29.670> same<00:05:29.700> time<00:05:30.150> so<00:05:30.570> you<00:05:30.660> could<00:05:30.810> do

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
devices at the same time so you could do

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.830 
devices at the same time so you could do
a<00:05:31.320> safety<00:05:32.070> here<00:05:32.430> that<00:05:32.610> standalone<00:05:33.090> GPS<00:05:33.360> you

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
a safety here that standalone GPS you

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.860 
a safety here that standalone GPS you
could<00:05:33.990> use<00:05:34.140> standalone<00:05:34.620> GPS<00:05:35.480> with<00:05:36.480> the<00:05:36.630> phone

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870

of<00:06:22.110> course<00:06:23.540> so<00:06:24.540> this<00:06:24.690> should<00:06:24.840> be<00:06:24.930> good<00:06:26.810> at

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
of course so this should be good at

of course so this should be good at
first<00:06:28.110> I<00:06:28.290> was<00:06:28.410> just<00:06:28.440> using<00:06:28.920> my<00:06:29.040> my<00:06:29.520> hip<00:06:29.970> bones

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
first I was just using my my hip bones

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.600 
first I was just using my my hip bones
sticking<00:06:30.840> them<00:06:31.020> in<00:06:31.310> my<00:06:32.310> helmet<00:06:32.870> but<00:06:33.870> now<00:06:34.020> I<00:06:34.610> got

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
sticking them in my helmet but now I got

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.640 
sticking them in my helmet but now I got
this<00:06:35.820> and<00:06:36.540> she<00:06:36.690> make<00:06:36.870> it

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
this and she make it

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.219 
this and she make it
a<00:06:37.680> comfortable<00:06:38.220> ride<00:06:38.400> and<00:06:40.550> easier<00:06:41.550> to<00:06:41.580> do

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:42.229 
a comfortable ride and easier to do

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:45.650 
a comfortable ride and easier to do
since<00:06:43.229> I<00:06:43.380> would<00:06:43.500> be<00:06:43.620> the<00:06:43.680> control<00:06:44.040> that<00:06:44.340> I<00:06:44.790> beta

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
since I would be the control that I beta

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.330 
since I would be the control that I beta
control<00:06:45.990> with<00:06:46.320> song<00:06:46.530> them<00:06:46.740> listening<00:06:47.039> to<00:06:47.100> and

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
control with song them listening to and

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.029 
control with song them listening to and
all<00:06:47.430> that<00:06:48.830> so<00:06:49.830> I<00:06:49.860> guess<00:06:50.070> is<00:06:50.250> now<00:06:50.430> to<00:06:50.490> try<00:06:51.120> to<00:06:52.039> set

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 
all that so I guess is now to try to set

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.639 
all that so I guess is now to try to set
this<00:06:53.160> whole<00:06:53.220> thing<00:06:53.400> up
