yeah<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:35.990> that'll<00:01:36.229> happen<00:01:36.319> tonight<00:01:36.710> as<00:01:36.860> well<00:01:39.909> I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
yeah so that'll happen tonight as well I

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.109 
yeah so that'll happen tonight as well I
wired<00:01:43.610> up<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.179> thing<00:01:44.450> for<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.640> switch<00:01:46.640> panel

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
wired up the thing for the switch panel

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.740 
wired up the thing for the switch panel
and<00:01:47.720> it's<00:01:48.549> five<00:01:49.549> of<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:49.970> switches<00:01:50.360> ended<00:01:50.659> up

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
and it's five of the switches ended up

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.719 
and it's five of the switches ended up
being<00:01:50.959> completely<00:01:51.470> fried<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.369> I'm<00:01:52.429> gonna<00:01:52.549> have

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
being completely fried so I'm gonna have

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.059 
being completely fried so I'm gonna have
to<00:01:53.020> redo<00:01:54.020> that

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
to redo that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.359 
to redo that
it's<00:01:55.369> these<00:01:55.549> five<00:01:55.819> right<00:01:56.030> here<00:01:57.500> I<00:01:57.530> must<00:01:58.220> have

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
it's these five right here I must have

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.100 
it's these five right here I must have
soldered<00:01:58.729> them<00:01:58.940> for<00:01:59.209> too<00:01:59.330> long<00:01:59.479> or<00:01:59.720> something

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
soldered them for too long or something

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.230 
soldered them for too long or something
and<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:01.039> fried<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.310> contacts<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.149> so

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
and it fried the contacts and so

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.699 
and it fried the contacts and so
basically<00:02:02.569> when<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.899> switch<00:02:03.110> is<00:02:03.140> off<00:02:03.440> it

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
basically when the switch is off it

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.650 
basically when the switch is off it
supplies<00:02:04.700> seven<00:02:05.090> volts<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:05.479> when<00:02:05.599> the

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
supplies seven volts and when the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.180 
supplies seven volts and when the
switches<00:02:05.899> on<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.289> supplies<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.800> full<00:02:06.950> 12

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
switches on it supplies the full 12

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.249 
switches on it supplies the full 12
volts<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:07.729> I<00:02:07.970> really<00:02:08.660> know<00:02:08.750> what's<00:02:08.929> going<00:02:09.140> on

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
volts so I really know what's going on

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.820 
volts so I really know what's going on

what's next
alright<00:05:29.700> guys<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:30.560> this<00:05:31.560> is<00:05:31.680> how<00:05:31.800> it<00:05:31.920> came<00:05:32.040> out

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
alright guys so this is how it came out

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.490 
alright guys so this is how it came out
all<00:05:33.240> done<00:05:35.420> as<00:05:36.420> you<00:05:36.810> may<00:05:36.930> noticed<00:05:37.320> I<00:05:37.440> like

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
all done as you may noticed I like

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.760 
all done as you may noticed I like
bonded<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.220> dash<00:05:38.400> and<00:05:38.610> stuff<00:05:38.820> like<00:05:38.970> that<00:05:39.210> and

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
bonded the dash and stuff like that and

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.930 
bonded the dash and stuff like that and
so<00:05:40.770> there's<00:05:40.950> a<00:05:41.040> couple<00:05:41.610> of<00:05:41.670> little

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
so there's a couple of little

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.510 
so there's a couple of little
imperfections<00:05:42.660> I<00:05:42.780> think<00:05:42.990> if<00:05:43.110> you<00:05:43.340> look<00:05:44.340> at<00:05:44.430> the

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
imperfections I think if you look at the

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.400 
imperfections I think if you look at the
reflections<00:05:45.030> on<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.270> light<00:05:45.420> like<00:05:45.660> up<00:05:45.870> here

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
reflections on the light like up here

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.890 
reflections on the light like up here
you<00:05:46.680> can<00:05:46.860> see<00:05:47.150> kind<00:05:48.150> of<00:05:48.240> like<00:05:48.300> a<00:05:48.419> little<00:05:48.600> Ridge

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
you can see kind of like a little Ridge

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.020 
you can see kind of like a little Ridge
and<00:05:49.680> see<00:05:49.980> if<00:05:50.070> we<00:05:50.160> can<00:05:50.280> find<00:05:50.460> it<00:05:50.640> there<00:05:50.820> it<00:05:50.850> is

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
and see if we can find it there it is

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.670 
and see if we can find it there it is
you<00:05:51.240> see<00:05:51.390> that<00:05:51.570> and<00:05:51.900> then<00:05:52.020> like<00:05:52.290> right<00:05:53.210> there

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
you see that and then like right there

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.560 
you see that and then like right there

I<00:06:53.250> she<00:06:53.580> can<00:06:53.729> barely<00:06:53.940> even<00:06:54.120> notice<00:06:54.540> those

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830

crappy<00:06:55.830> patches<00:06:56.310> that<00:06:56.520> we<00:06:56.610> did<00:06:57.199> so<00:06:58.199> yeah<00:06:58.680> we

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
crappy patches that we did so yeah we

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.620 
crappy patches that we did so yeah we
ended<00:06:58.889> up<00:06:59.250> not<00:06:59.430> patching<00:06:59.880> outside<00:07:00.240> so<00:07:00.510> I<00:07:00.570> think

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
ended up not patching outside so I think

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.060 
ended up not patching outside so I think
we're<00:07:00.900> just<00:07:01.020> gonna<00:07:01.139> put<00:07:01.410> like<00:07:01.440> a<00:07:01.560> floor<00:07:01.889> mat

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
we're just gonna put like a floor mat

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.250 
we're just gonna put like a floor mat
over<00:07:02.340> it<00:07:02.460> or<00:07:02.580> something<00:07:03.560> yeah<00:07:04.560> we<00:07:04.860> did<00:07:06.260> the

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:07.260 
over it or something yeah we did the

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.140 
over it or something yeah we did the
roof<00:07:07.500> too<00:07:09.020> so<00:07:10.020> it<00:07:10.440> looks<00:07:10.650> super<00:07:11.190> clean<00:07:11.340> got<00:07:12.120> a

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
roof too so it looks super clean got a

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.430 
roof too so it looks super clean got a
little<00:07:12.360> bit<00:07:12.449> of<00:07:12.510> overspray<00:07:12.810> on<00:07:12.960> the<00:07:13.080> window

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150 
but that should come off pretty easily

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.260
