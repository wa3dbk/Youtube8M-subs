00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.030
 but now we are in the first stage 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.630
 do not 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:24.080
 in the organizational part in the part the 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.540
 part of mentalization and the physical part 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.060
 and then the second part will come that the 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.240
 technical part the tactical part and the 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.700
 strategic part or me as I said 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.400
 previously I saw people very 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.309
 Hopeful is very excited and 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.440
 campus I saw it well I saw it in a state 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.470
 optimal with a great predisposition 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.660
 psychic and good and then the 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.190
 second part of the team's appearance 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.760
 as fast as possible compared to blas 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.510
 He said 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.449
 with Diego I spoke ten days ago with him 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.940
 it's fine, you do not have to press it, there's no 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.309
 than playing it, you should not leave it 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.690
 decide he already knows here what is what 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.000
 what the people of mouth want what the 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.159
 I want the coaching staff so that 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.380
 he has to decide in statements of 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.060
 Mauricio Macri president of mouth in 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.010
 eastern tip of referring to what 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.590
 player who is faced with a technician 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.030
 in search does not play anymore nothing I'm 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.070
 living a moment of such happiness 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.070
 that I can not be fixing what 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.570
 says Mauricio Mauricio and all the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.370
 people we are owners to say 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.820
 which it is what one is you do not want 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.729
 It causes me grace and as I do not want to be 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.050
 part of a piece of paper then I prefer 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.970
 change this topic and think about it 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.280
 everything very nice that awaits me in the 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.260
 future argentine players who want 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.020
 Boycott the technicians 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.170
 look if I tell you that in football 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.540
 it does not exist I'm responding to something 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.260
 older than the ball but this 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.180
 would lead to having this 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.220
 some opposition to what he said 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.540
 president and this everybody 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.430
 you know me well everyone knows with 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.560
 my career I think they were 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.270
 unfortunate the appreciations but 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.270
 I'm thinking of something else
