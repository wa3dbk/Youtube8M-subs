00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:18.750
 the fourth monica of voice with drawer e 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.930
 fifth in the bass like all the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:28.010
 professional accordions voices made a 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.010
 hand keyboard has been lowered 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.870
 the particularity that this is very agile 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.600
 accordion 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:48.030
 of course the typical stradella sound 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:53.750
 in addition to five registry cuts on 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:57.300
 various on various base registers from the museum 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.870
 to the nyon ban agreement 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.470
 bandoneón and classic of the tango 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.580
 then we start immediately with a master e 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.580
 I'll make you feel immediately 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.180
 extremely agile even with a cold hand 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:34.000
 to do beautiful things then 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:43.000
 bandoneòn here we go from the neo base call 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:56.410
 which is more closed then we have a notice 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:02:02.369
 nyon with a small voice then we have 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.369
 the bandone with a voice the museums 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.680
 then we go to the museums section 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:20.439
 then we have all the various registers 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:25.000
 then intermediate from the lower clarinet oboe 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:39.090
 we also have the flute 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:44.170
 nothing cool clarinet to say 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:47.739
 then it must also be said that he has 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.689
 a plant and in sennheiser for the 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:57.720
 so the upper part is for the voices 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:57.720
 amplified in the front 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:06.370
 quality microphone then naturally 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.859
 we have as peculiarity there 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.519
 of course we also show 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:15.430
 the interior for capital monica was 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.880
 very little accused by a person 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:26.289
 therefore the old sonata really is old 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:28.349
 very little to accompany a suitcase with 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.610
 trolley 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:35.229
 beautiful even that 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:40.479
 if we show it then one by one 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:43.260
 so it was perfect then to retry 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.849
 let's also show that these are 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.949
 enclosure which gives them series of 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:55.630
 dallapé therefore let see just what 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:05:00.060
 the state is a really used accordion 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.060
 very little in perfect condition 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:14.650
 let's hear a final train for 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:16.200
 show its agility in high notes 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.380
 low 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.380
 let's do this 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.250
 then
