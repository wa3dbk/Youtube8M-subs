attention as well to controlling your
speed<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.270> slopes<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:37.620> tend<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.920> go<00:00:38.129> too<00:00:38.190> fast

speed on slopes we tend to go too fast

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.180 
speed on slopes we tend to go too fast
when<00:00:38.969> going<00:00:39.329> downhill<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.079> too<00:00:40.710> slow<00:00:40.980> and

necessary apply the brakes a little when

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.510 
necessary apply the brakes a little when
going<00:00:51.480> uphill<00:00:52.100> accelerate<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> bit<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
going uphill accelerate a bit to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.000 
going uphill accelerate a bit to
maintain<00:00:53.850> your<00:00:53.969> speed<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.800> frequent<00:00:55.800> cause<00:00:55.980> of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
maintain your speed a frequent cause of

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.110 
maintain your speed a frequent cause of
failure<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.640> exams<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.329> inappropriate<00:00:58.260> speed

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
failure in exams is inappropriate speed

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.189 
failure in exams is inappropriate speed
inappropriate<00:01:00.120> speed<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.690> when<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.960> drive

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
inappropriate speed is when you drive

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.009 
inappropriate speed is when you drive
too<00:01:01.440> fast<00:01:01.710> depending<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> context<00:01:03.180> even

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
too fast depending on the context even

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.479 
too fast depending on the context even
if<00:01:04.170> you're<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.470> exceeding<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> limit

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
if you're not exceeding the limit

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.030 
if you're not exceeding the limit
example<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.510> an<00:01:07.080> area<00:01:07.439> where<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> speed<00:01:08.010> limit

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
example in an area where the speed limit

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.670 
example in an area where the speed limit
is<00:01:08.430> 50<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> road<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.930> covered<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.320> snow

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
is 50 but the road is covered with snow

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.359 
is 50 but the road is covered with snow
50<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.700> too<00:01:11.880> fast<00:01:12.560> this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.770> also<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.189> case

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
50 is too fast this is also the case

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.249 
50 is too fast this is also the case
when<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.729> pass<00:01:14.939> near<00:01:15.270> people<00:01:15.540> getting<00:01:15.990> out<00:01:16.110> of

maintain a sufficient safety margin if

keep<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:25.710> foot<00:01:25.920> over<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> brake<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.759> case

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
keep your foot over the brake in case

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.090 
keep your foot over the brake in case
you<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.540> brake<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.900> an<00:01:28.020> emergency<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you have to brake in an emergency the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.859 
you have to brake in an emergency the
best<00:01:29.310> thing<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.610> do<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.180> case<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.689> to

best thing to do in this case is to

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:31.550 
best thing to do in this case is to
change<00:01:31.140> lanes

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
change lanes

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.710 
change lanes
pay<00:01:31.979> attention<00:01:32.009> also<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.850> respect<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> speed

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
pay attention also to respect the speed

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.810 
pay attention also to respect the speed

lower than on the streets 15 in this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.890 
lower than on the streets 15 in this
case

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.230 

don't<00:01:41.530> forget<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.070> always<00:01:42.250> put<00:01:42.640> your<00:01:42.760> flasher

don't forget to always put your flasher

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.510 
don't forget to always put your flasher
and<00:01:43.390> do<00:01:43.480> your<00:01:43.660> verifications<00:01:44.530> mirrors<00:01:45.340> and

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
and do your verifications mirrors and

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.810 
and do your verifications mirrors and
blind<00:01:45.760> spots<00:01:46.120> before<00:01:46.870> changing<00:01:47.290> lanes<00:01:47.500> you

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
blind spots before changing lanes you

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.610 
blind spots before changing lanes you
cannot<00:01:48.820> change<00:01:49.060> lanes<00:01:49.480> on<00:01:49.660> a<00:01:49.690> solid<00:01:50.140> line<00:01:50.320> or

cannot change lanes on a solid line or

cannot change lanes on a solid line or
in<00:01:50.950> an<00:01:51.070> intersection<00:01:51.690> therefore<00:01:52.690> pay

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
in an intersection therefore pay

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.200 
in an intersection therefore pay
attention<00:01:53.830> when<00:01:54.010> approaching<00:01:54.340> intersections

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
attention when approaching intersections

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.480 
attention when approaching intersections
there<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:55.990> often<00:01:56.290> a<00:01:56.380> solid<00:01:56.710> line<00:01:56.890> right<00:01:57.130> before

there is often a solid line right before

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.330 
there is often a solid line right before
them<00:01:57.670> if<00:01:58.480> you<00:01:58.870> make<00:01:59.050> several<00:01:59.560> successive<00:02:00.130> lane

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
them if you make several successive lane
