holistic sense everything was fine for
the<00:00:18.420> landing<00:00:18.779> gear<00:00:19.310> nothing<00:00:20.310> was<00:00:20.490> too<00:00:20.730> bad<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the landing gear nothing was too bad and

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.679 
the landing gear nothing was too bad and
nothing<00:00:21.539> was<00:00:21.990> too<00:00:22.380> good<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:24.240> landing<00:00:24.539> gear

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
nothing was too good the landing gear

nothing was too good the landing gear
felt<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.109> he<00:00:25.470> was<00:00:25.619> walking<00:00:25.890> down<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.310> middle

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
of life's great valley just as he rolled

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.550 
of life's great valley just as he rolled
down<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> middle<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> runway<00:00:31.260> at<00:00:31.500> the

fact<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.520> landing<00:00:35.880> gear<00:00:36.030> had<00:00:36.210> learned<00:00:36.510> great

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
fact the landing gear had learned great

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.979 
fact the landing gear had learned great
many<00:00:37.620> things<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.820> far<00:00:39.180> as<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.420> learning<00:00:39.690> of

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
many things as far as the learning of

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.389 
many things as far as the learning of
landing<00:00:40.440> gears<00:00:40.680> goes<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.930> was<00:00:43.260> a

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
landing gears goes and so was a

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.910 
landing gears goes and so was a
sufficiently<00:00:44.399> useful<00:00:44.940> piece<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.120> hardware<00:00:45.920> he

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
sufficiently useful piece of hardware he

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.130 
sufficiently useful piece of hardware he
had<00:00:47.010> learned<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.489> raise<00:00:48.270> himself<00:00:48.570> into<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
had learned to raise himself into the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.439 
had learned to raise himself into the
wheel<00:00:49.350> well<00:00:49.649> shortly<00:00:50.219> after<00:00:50.579> takeoff<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
wheel well shortly after takeoff to

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.350 
wheel well shortly after takeoff to
reduce<00:00:51.780> drag<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.469> flight<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.360> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
reduce drag in flight and to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.240 
reduce drag in flight and to
subsequently<00:00:55.050> descend<00:00:55.649> again<00:00:55.770> when<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
subsequently descend again when the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.029 
subsequently descend again when the
plane<00:00:56.460> was<00:00:56.640> doing<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> same<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:58.440> facilitate<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
plane was doing the same to facilitate a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.270 
plane was doing the same to facilitate a
smooth<00:00:59.399> landing<00:00:59.640> for<00:01:00.120> everyone<00:01:00.390> involved

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
smooth landing for everyone involved

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.979 
smooth landing for everyone involved
he<00:01:02.280> learned<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> past<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> flight<00:01:03.329> time<00:01:03.629> alone

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
he learned to past the flight time alone

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.649 
he learned to past the flight time alone
in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> wheel<00:01:04.439> well<00:01:04.739> playing<00:01:05.390> variants<00:01:06.390> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
in the wheel well playing variants of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.880 
in the wheel well playing variants of
solitaire<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> withered<00:01:08.040> deck<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.460> cards

but<00:01:10.890> one<00:01:11.040> thing<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.549> landing<00:01:11.880> gear<00:01:12.060> had<00:01:12.210> not

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
but one thing the landing gear had not

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.190 
but one thing the landing gear had not
learned<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.909> to<00:01:14.909> find<00:01:15.180> contentment<00:01:15.810> in

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
learned was this to find contentment in

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.149 
learned was this to find contentment in
himself<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.280> his<00:01:17.340> role<00:01:18.530> for<00:01:19.530> some<00:01:19.710> reason
