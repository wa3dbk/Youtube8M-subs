like<00:01:14.000> down<00:01:14.180> like<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:14.600> everything<00:01:15.170> just<00:01:15.500> kind

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
like down like so everything just kind

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.109 
like down like so everything just kind
of<00:01:16.520> looks<00:01:17.110> flat<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.140> put<00:01:18.410> together<00:01:19.119> either

way it's fine

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.280

I added to it like I just kind of took
her<00:01:55.970> hair<00:01:56.380> put<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.500> all<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.920> front<00:01:58.220> and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
her hair put it all to the front and

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.390 
her hair put it all to the front and
just<00:01:58.670> kind<00:01:58.970> of<00:01:59.060> cut<00:01:59.570> along<00:01:59.990> her<00:02:00.200> eyes<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:00.950> like

just kind of cut along her eyes and like
a<00:02:01.610> frame<00:02:01.880> around<00:02:01.909> here<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:03.920> I<00:02:04.280> think

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.330 

you

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:29.460 

you

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:57.509 

you

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:03.550 

okay<00:02:58.519> so<00:03:00.370> what<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.400> have<00:03:01.970> concluded<00:03:02.870> its<00:03:03.349> that

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
okay so what I have concluded its that

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.360 
okay so what I have concluded its that
to<00:03:04.040> get<00:03:04.220> more<00:03:04.519> like<00:03:04.819> a<00:03:05.890> little<00:03:06.890> hair<00:03:07.069> is<00:03:07.220> fine

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
to get more like a little hair is fine

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.569 
to get more like a little hair is fine
if<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:08.360> have<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.629> more<00:03:08.870> normal<00:03:09.530> hair<00:03:10.190> looking

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
if you have a more normal hair looking

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.479 
if you have a more normal hair looking
look<00:03:10.760> like<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.120> do<00:03:11.299> my<00:03:12.170> layers<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:13.010> gives<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.340> more

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
look like I do my layers it gives a more

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.059 
look like I do my layers it gives a more
of<00:03:13.579> an<00:03:13.670> edgy<00:03:13.970> look<00:03:14.090> instead<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.709> like<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:15.739> seen

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
of an edgy look instead of like a seen

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.479 
of an edgy look instead of like a seen
look<00:03:16.329> if<00:03:17.329> I<00:03:17.599> had<00:03:17.750> layers<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.920> would<00:03:19.069> turn<00:03:19.430> out

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
look if I had layers it would turn out

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.670 
look if I had layers it would turn out
more<00:03:19.700> seeing<00:03:19.910> stuff<00:03:20.260> obviously<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:22.129> I<00:03:23.410> think<00:03:24.410> I

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
more seeing stuff obviously so I think I

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.170 
more seeing stuff obviously so I think I
just<00:03:24.859> kind<00:03:25.010> of<00:03:25.099> gives<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.340> more<00:03:25.459> options<00:03:25.670> like

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
just kind of gives you more options like

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
just kind of gives you more options like

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
you want to go bad you don't get layers

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.770 
you want to go bad you don't get layers
everyone<00:03:30.200> I've<00:03:30.379> seen<00:03:30.680> get<00:03:31.280> layers<00:03:31.690> when<00:03:32.690> you

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
everyone I've seen get layers when you

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.069 
everyone I've seen get layers when you
get<00:03:32.959> four<00:03:33.170> layers<00:03:33.379> just<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:35.269> us<00:03:35.450> for<00:03:35.660> like<00:03:35.900> a

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
get four layers just to us for like a

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.890 
get four layers just to us for like a
few<00:03:36.530> more<00:03:36.739> than<00:03:36.980> usual<00:03:37.910> oh<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:39.079> then<00:03:39.349> I<00:03:39.650> think

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
few more than usual oh and then I think

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.539 
few more than usual oh and then I think
what<00:03:41.900> also<00:03:42.260> really<00:03:42.560> helps<00:03:42.890> is<00:03:43.129> the<00:03:43.280> way<00:03:43.400> that

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
what also really helps is the way that

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.880 
what also really helps is the way that
you<00:03:43.670> do<00:03:43.790> your<00:03:43.910> makeup<00:03:44.120> like<00:03:44.780> if<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:45.049> want<00:03:45.230> with
