00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello, Hello, I want to talk about 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.340

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.840
 the right product as raw food eater and milk 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.790
 She is interesting because she syroedy but 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.950
 easy to prepare, I listed you 5 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.820
 the benefits of this product and generally the whole 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.039
 probable 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.180
 milk and it is necessary for those who go 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.119
 mood that is, who wants to give up 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.619
 from milks ordinary cows and cow 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.400
 milk, what is this main 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.980
 advantage 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.949
 which is very convenient to replace the milk exactly 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 these with erogenous dairy products 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.510
 Now we list the benefits later 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.219
 I'll tell you a little about how I cook 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.530
 from which of which seeds of nuts and in general 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.160
 some nuances about this product 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.149
 and so the first advantage is that she 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.100
 raw food 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.260
 and tasty then there is a lot of taste at all 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.680
 inferior cow milk if you are not 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.820
 did and think that touch tasty 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 maybe this 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.500
 milk vegetarian seeds on 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.510
 nuts i really she 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.420
 concentrated will and delicious because 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.280
 that the seeds and nuts soaked in them 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.590
 taste is changing the structure is changing they are not 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.840
 they just fill with water 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.299
 juicy get inside and when 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.600
 grind what was in the blender with water 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.280
 it turns out that they are like this juice 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.500
 give your water and really 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.540
 it turns out the milk is really delicious 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.330
 the second advantage is interesting 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.369
 tastes of thomas in lenovo cheese milk if 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.439
 conventional sheath only on cow 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.720
 milk principle is one the taste of metals and 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.579
 district and milk will have a taste and those 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.159
 products from which it is made 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.470
 different nuts of different seeds that is 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.320
 taste range so let's say palette she 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.110
 much richer and generally the third 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.200
 advantage in convenience in simplicity 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.590
 use is that it will always be 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.610
 you are fresh and you can 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.710
 lay low to buy yourself a big 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.560
 the amount of seeds or nuts in the dry 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.479
 they are stored for a very long time easily 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.369
 elementary without a fridge and doing 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.060
 myself even every day a fresh product 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.189
 have you not tied a barn 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.530
 the market they have a market in which 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.810
 many people buy go buy fresh 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.120
 natural milk fourth 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.280
 advantage is the price here for example if 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.000
 from seeds do minutes and many many 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.760
 sunflower seeds then she will be on 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.849
 order is cheaper than the usual gunner 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.480
 cow's milk is much cheaper 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.760
 I do not calculate to the penny well about 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.160
 I pretend that three times . 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.890
 if from other products tass model 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.750
 what product but can fit in like that 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.299
 that the price was not higher than normal 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.890
 regular cow's milk and fifth 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.340
 the advantage is also very good and 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.069
 especially valuable for moms is what it is 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.010
 milk is always free of infections that is 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.260
 guaranteed eye at shore before infection 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.959
 who may be in the thugs of the usual 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.790
 cow's milk in a regular pen 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.620
 Naturally recommended to boil 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.549
 because cows can bear 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.140
 some infections 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.380
 due to the fact that vaccinations do 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.510
 periodically usually milk jugs are decent 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.489
 do not milk a cow after the arrival that it is impossible 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.739
 You can then effect with milk and 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.959
 dishonest can donate and sell and 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.590
 Generally there are infections that are carried 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.400
 cows 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.220
 very small percentage of probability but 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.739
 there is this terrible infection some 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.000
 really seriously afraid and in this 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.549
 blog and accordingly those infections 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.440
 never be so given all that's 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.130
 these benefits, I think it's milk 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.799
 in general, all 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.040
 Milk Spit District is very cool 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:39.130
 competes with regular animal milk 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:46.510
 I mainly use three origins 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:48.430
 product is seeds and walnuts 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.250
 of which we have a lot in Ukraine and I 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.319
 it’s not worth two times cheaper 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.829
 than in Moscow than in other regions 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.870
 northern regions of Russia and more sesame 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.239
 I use a circle with us here, too, very 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.510
 quite cheap at half the price 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.049
 than ordinary nuts habitually seeds in 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.600
 they can be very easily soaked 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.159
 soak them for it for two hours they are quite 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.049
 well soak it up very much 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.799
 for example nuts are longer nuts are so fast 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.780
 will not be able to succeed preferably at night 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.539
 such a significant period soak a 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.880
 sunflower seeds at all elegantly wanted there for 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.310
 two hours did that is, outlined myself that 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.900
 today wants to cook made and for 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.289
 men in two hours you will do 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.990
 bakers 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.890
 they are very easily ground in heaven 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.260
 I will say is bad 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.840
 also very very important without solid 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.700
 I have a blender shell 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.050
 submersible that is, it is low-powered it is not 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.330
 super blender is not as it should 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.909
 to be because you know I am such a country 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.890
 the studio is not particularly a raw food cook rarely 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:55.930
 I prepare such things mainly for 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.280
 parents, that is, I have not yet 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.789
 there was a need for big because 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.250
 thanks to 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:03.219
 and for whom you select seeds simply 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.870
 super option for example sesame already 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:08.110
 harder grind because sesame 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.270
 small small seeds and longer need here 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.169
 such a thing to grind so that they 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.510
 turned into a homogeneous mass if 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:21.930
 stationary blender need to click on 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.930
 a button for you sea ​​in the sea yes ok 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.510
 then walnut than me personally the time 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.159
 that just there is a peel that is either with 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.300
 peel need to do and the taste is no longer so 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:36.070
 gentle will not so pleasant that well 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.590
 ok anyway delicious of course all 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.940
 I don't want to rip off the food if 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.100
 honestly spend some time on it 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.120
 tear off kazhu 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.500
 and the same with other almond nuts 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.330
 for example who does 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.820
 der peel something honest to me line 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.140
 after the girl at all somehow heavenly to 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.810
 a certain peel 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.970
 Now I will tell you how to grind 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.520
 Of course , not all water is added immediately. 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.300
 chat grind them into a homogeneous mass 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.070
 sour-shaped water a little add 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.720
 grind well and then 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.480
 already add all the rest of the water and 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.520
 mix this mass with water if you want 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.000
 is it possible not to bring to a homogeneous mass 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.220
 and to do so to 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.760
 teeth are formed which you sweat 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.500
 send through the sieve and throw the cake 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.350
 and because it will not be very good 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.940
 delicious i had thoughts to do this 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.340
 your cottage cheese mechanism or when else 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.410
 I tried it but honestly 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.600
 not impressive to taste because 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.670
 the main juices from it are already squeezed for 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.600
 taste great option you can add 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.160
 lemon juice 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.110
 or rather not at all I can not stop can 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.970
 just cut the lemon with these 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.720
 nuts grind from seasoning 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:48.390
 naturally all sorts and garlic who 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.810
 loves you can onions so you need to taste 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:54.480
 experiment and significantly 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:57.810
 enrich these tastes i don't mix much 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:01.290
 ingredients that is usually with his bono 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.560
 I go and prefer if I do it with 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:07.230
 raid milk or curd mass then not 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.910
 add fruit and just some 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.700
 naturally flavor enhancer can add 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:15.450
 but I don't like mixing the main two 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.409
 components but in general if you take 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.939
 mixing two 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:19.889
 subscribers then of course with berries with 

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:22.249
 anything to mix i hope you get it 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:25.800
 liked the video was something useful 

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:27.360
 I will be glad to ask questions 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.639
 I wish everyone a good comment 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.639
 Kiss all mood harmonies
