00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
the mountains down the sides of

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.349 
the mountains down the sides of
mountains<00:04:18.009> so<00:04:19.009> I'm<00:04:19.070> gonna<00:04:19.250> make<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.549> half<00:04:20.060> cab

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
mountains so I'm gonna make a half cab

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.150 
mountains so I'm gonna make a half cab
top<00:04:20.630> for<00:04:20.900> it<00:04:21.019> so<00:04:21.169> it<00:04:21.289> looks<00:04:21.530> like<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.739> regular

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
top for it so it looks like a regular

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.439
