00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
should look as a matter of fact and and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.660 
should look as a matter of fact and and
I'm<00:01:44.430> applying<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.270> even<00:01:45.659> today<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.710> work<00:01:47.399> with

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
that we were talking about wood and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.190 
that we were talking about wood and
those<00:01:54.920> rasps<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.549> they<00:01:56.759> made<00:01:57.030> worked<00:01:57.780> pretty

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
club the shape is so good that i'm happy

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.909 
club the shape is so good that i'm happy
that<00:03:26.400> i<00:03:26.430> can't<00:03:26.819> change<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.419> as<00:03:27.569> much<00:03:27.780> as<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:28.019> once

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
that i can't change it as much as I once

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.899 
that i can't change it as much as I once
did<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.699> it<00:03:30.389> works<00:03:30.659> better<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:32.040> when<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:32.489> had

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
did and it works better so when you had

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.729 
did and it works better so when you had
a<00:03:33.299> few<00:03:34.019> different<00:03:34.139> clubs<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:34.829> in<00:03:35.519> mind<00:03:36.739> where

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
a few different clubs in in mind where

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.860 
a few different clubs in in mind where
would<00:03:38.400> they<00:03:38.519> perform<00:03:38.970> differently<00:03:39.389> for<00:03:39.690> you

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
would they perform differently for you

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.649 
would they perform differently for you
or<00:03:40.109> would<00:03:40.530> they<00:03:41.010> perform<00:03:41.669> the<00:03:41.849> same<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.449> just

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
or would they perform the same it just

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.000 
or would they perform the same it just
depended<00:03:42.989> on<00:03:43.109> what<00:03:43.319> kind<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.590> swing<00:03:43.829> you<00:03:43.919> were

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
depended on what kind of swing you were

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.349 
depended on what kind of swing you were
putting<00:03:44.220> on<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.489> during<00:03:44.639> that<00:03:44.879> time<00:03:45.060> well<00:03:45.329> I

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
putting on it during that time well I

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.080 
putting on it during that time well I
think<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.919> shape<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.549> then<00:03:47.909> the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
think the the shape and then the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.170 
think the the shape and then the
performance<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.769> club<00:03:50.069> is<00:03:50.609> very

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
performance of the club is very

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.830 
performance of the club is very
important<00:03:51.870> than<00:03:52.669> to<00:03:53.669> get<00:03:53.909> to<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.479> technology

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
important than to get to that technology

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.309 
important than to get to that technology
is<00:03:55.729> something<00:03:56.729> that<00:03:56.879> is<00:03:57.090> very<00:03:57.180> very<00:03:57.479> important

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
is something that is very very important

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.069 
is something that is very very important
now<00:03:58.889> of<00:03:59.099> course<00:03:59.159> the<00:03:59.579> game<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.479> players<00:04:00.810> have

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
now of course the game the players have

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.800 
now of course the game the players have
changed<00:04:01.500> so<00:04:01.650> much<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:02.189> probably<00:04:03.060> somewhat

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
changed so much to probably somewhat

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.719 
changed so much to probably somewhat
obviously<00:04:04.439> in<00:04:04.620> terms<00:04:04.889> of<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.220> modern<00:04:05.519> player

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
obviously in terms of the modern player

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.759 
obviously in terms of the modern player
but<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.359> technology<00:04:06.720> has<00:04:07.169> also<00:04:07.290> changed

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
but the technology has also changed

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.349 
but the technology has also changed
somewhat<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.489> way<00:04:08.609> that<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:08.909> players<00:04:09.120> play

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
somewhat the way that the players play

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.270 
somewhat the way that the players play
the<00:04:09.540> game<00:04:09.689> we're<00:04:10.169> about<00:04:10.259> to<00:04:10.500> be<00:04:10.680> we're<00:04:10.919> here<00:04:11.129> at

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
the game we're about to be we're here at

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.610 
the game we're about to be we're here at
your<00:04:11.939> tournament<00:04:12.329> you're<00:04:13.019> probably<00:04:13.290> seeing

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
your tournament you're probably seeing

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.929 
your tournament you're probably seeing
players<00:04:13.889> play<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.400> golf<00:04:14.579> course<00:04:14.759> a<00:04:14.909> lot

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
players play the golf course a lot

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.420 
players play the golf course a lot
differently<00:04:15.449> than<00:04:15.720> they<00:04:15.870> did<00:04:16.039> 10<00:04:17.039> 15<00:04:17.190> years

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
differently than they did 10 15 years

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.849 
differently than they did 10 15 years
ago<00:04:17.699> well<00:04:18.180> one<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.900> things<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.349> is<00:04:19.500> so

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
ago well one of the things that is so

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.820 
ago well one of the things that is so
important<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.639> that<00:04:20.700> they<00:04:21.150> can<00:04:21.510> play<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.650> way

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
important is that they can play the way

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.510 
important is that they can play the way
they<00:04:22.860> have<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.610> play<00:04:23.849> to<00:04:23.880> do<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.570> too

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
they have to play to do it too

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.930 
they have to play to do it too
justice<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.690> play<00:04:27.199> the<00:04:27.410> golf<00:04:27.620> course<00:04:27.940> into

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
justice and to play the golf course into

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.629 
justice and to play the golf course into
the<00:04:29.180> right<00:04:29.389> position<00:04:30.340> something<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.430> was

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
the right position something I was

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.839 
the right position something I was
talking<00:04:32.060> about<00:04:32.150> with<00:04:33.080> Augusta<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:34.009> getting

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
talking about with Augusta and getting

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:36.670 
talking about with Augusta and getting
the<00:04:34.970> ball<00:04:35.150> in<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.449> right<00:04:35.750> position<00:04:36.319> to<00:04:36.500> make

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
the ball in the right position to make

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.830 
the ball in the right position to make
the<00:04:36.710> shots<00:04:37.099> into<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.669> green<00:04:37.909> and<00:04:38.539> when<00:04:38.720> you

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
the shots into the green and when you

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.510 
the shots into the green and when you
set<00:04:39.139> that<00:04:39.319> up<00:04:39.379> as<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.889> think<00:04:40.190> of<00:04:40.370> the

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
set that up as you think of the

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.149 
set that up as you think of the
evolution<00:04:41.090> here<00:04:41.780> at<00:04:42.139> Bay<00:04:42.379> Hill<00:04:42.409> do<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:42.919> think

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.159 
evolution here at Bay Hill do you think

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.219 
evolution here at Bay Hill do you think
about<00:04:43.250> that<00:04:43.550> as<00:04:43.729> well<00:04:43.909> about<00:04:44.300> trying<00:04:45.050> to

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
about that as well about trying to

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.899 
about that as well about trying to
challenge<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.830> players<00:04:46.099> to<00:04:46.340> not<00:04:46.430> only<00:04:46.639> think

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:46.909 
challenge the players to not only think

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:48.999 
challenge the players to not only think
about<00:04:47.090> raring<00:04:48.020> back<00:04:48.139> and<00:04:48.199> hitting<00:04:48.530> it<00:04:48.710> as<00:04:48.800> far

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
about raring back and hitting it as far

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:50.379 
about raring back and hitting it as far
as<00:04:49.129> they<00:04:49.250> can<00:04:49.310> but<00:04:49.699> to<00:04:49.849> make<00:04:50.000> them<00:04:50.180> really

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
as they can but to make them really

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.960 
as they can but to make them really
think<00:04:50.780> on<00:04:50.930> every<00:04:51.259> on<00:04:51.440> every<00:04:51.919> shot<00:04:52.159> that's<00:04:52.699> what

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
think on every on every shot that's what

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.180 
think on every on every shot that's what
we<00:04:53.150> do<00:04:53.360> that's<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:54.080> way<00:04:54.259> the<00:04:54.470> golf<00:04:54.710> course<00:04:54.949> is

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
we do that's the way the golf course is

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.520 
we do that's the way the golf course is
set<00:04:55.400> up<00:04:55.580> so<00:04:55.789> that's<00:04:56.690> really<00:04:57.080> one<00:04:57.379> of<00:04:57.409> the

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
set up so that's really one of the

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.529 
set up so that's really one of the
reasons<00:04:57.860> I<00:04:57.949> think<00:04:57.979> obviously<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:59.330> golf

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
reasons I think obviously the golf

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.659 
reasons I think obviously the golf
course<00:04:59.810> the<00:05:00.139> conditions<00:05:00.590> and<00:05:00.800> then<00:05:00.919> you<00:05:01.130> it's

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
course the conditions and then you it's

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.670 
course the conditions and then you it's
got<00:05:01.909> to<00:05:02.060> be<00:05:02.210> an<00:05:02.419> honor<00:05:02.659> and<00:05:02.930> make<00:05:03.530> you<00:05:03.650> feel

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
got to be an honor and make you feel

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.320 
got to be an honor and make you feel
good<00:05:04.009> when<00:05:04.220> all<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.580> players<00:05:04.789> want<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.180> come

you'll<00:05:29.060> be<00:05:29.120> interested<00:05:29.479> but<00:05:29.750> just<00:05:30.319> from<00:05:30.380> a

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
you'll be interested but just from a

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.589 
you'll be interested but just from a
design<00:05:30.860> philosophy<00:05:31.490> too<00:05:31.669> though<00:05:31.880> because<00:05:32.030> you

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
design philosophy too though because you

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.330 
design philosophy too though because you
hold<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:32.870> tournament<00:05:33.259> here<00:05:33.500> a<00:05:33.620> week<00:05:34.099> out<00:05:34.280> of

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
hold the tournament here a week out of

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.420 
hold the tournament here a week out of
the<00:05:34.460> year<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:35.030> then<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.360> other<00:05:35.389> 51<00:05:36.050> weeks<00:05:36.430> the

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
the year and then the other 51 weeks the

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.920 
the year and then the other 51 weeks the
membership<00:05:37.880> has<00:05:38.060> to<00:05:38.240> play<00:05:38.389> the<00:05:38.509> golf<00:05:38.719> course

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
membership has to play the golf course

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.719 
membership has to play the golf course
so<00:05:39.199> it's<00:05:39.409> it's<00:05:39.620> a<00:05:39.710> delicate<00:05:40.069> balance<00:05:40.099> isn't<00:05:40.520> it
