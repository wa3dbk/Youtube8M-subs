00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.030
 welcome to the video tutorials me 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.240
 We continue with our website 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:19.490
 we were creating our plugin 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:23.000
 to upload the posts of a blog and 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.750
 We were finishing our plugin 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.679
 we were in that good apparently not 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:34.780
 we get nothing but we can see by 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.780
 example what happens 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.580
 on our website at least at the level of 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.270
 console already loads each of us 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.490
 posts that we want to come out now nothing 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.310
 most needed to filter information 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.559
 can only show those that 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.630
 we really want those who leave in 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.489
 our section then we stay 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.790
 here we remember that we are using 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:04.120
 the point function that Jason to get 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:08.380
 the data of a rss and partial power or 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:12.490
 We are doing each post based on the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.370
 go to point and point between ok and good each 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.470
 object is returned in this variable between 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.010
 that we are here nothing else showing in 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.960
 console still we are missing then 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.490
 obviously build our structure 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.229
 html then let's let's continue 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.369
 what we have to do first 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:36.130
 obviously it is to start filling in the html 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.060
 to later join everything we are going to 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.690
 use the our variable link to 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.710
 create the text of 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.670
 of our link in general then here 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.250
 let's say I want / remember 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.510
 I go in and it's the whole object and we want the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.120
 url then here in link 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.180
 and link point 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.270
 and then here he tells me it's a fix 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.240
 then if not bad memory we need 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.790
 the element 2 as it is an arrangement 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.670
 we administer item 2 and then that 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.540
 property we need the network next to 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.730
 cher ref is there we have the network h 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.730
 we complete the structure of our 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.060
 html let's put a blank target 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.330
 to open the post on a page or in 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.690
 this case in a tab 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.640
 additional we have the link then 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.250
 let's go with the title it 's much easier 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.920
 nothing else we want for example in this 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.160
 case what I want to do is use an h 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.160
 3 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.750
 so that nothing else looks like a 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.060
 text but access a title and like 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.220
 it's center and point and let's see 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.490
 the title we can get the same from 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.190
 link but here is a tarot 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:04.750
 point I bring point 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:07.590
 pesos here is ready we have already 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.519
 our title 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.519
 I've seen 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.780
 Now let's get our picture 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:23.640
 same here we look first let's go to 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.960
 create the text of our html 0s hahaha 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.390
 let's close it 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.810
 A) Yes 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.890
 here we have to put between point 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.709
 let's see here and media then this and 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.280
 then a url then let's put it 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.280
 half 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.260
 mail.ru yes 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.890
 finally today we have the link the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.069
 title in the image now we must put together 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.760
 we are all going to put you in content 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.860
 one more assignment 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.390
 let's say we want the link 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.269
 first because we want all the 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.269
 box is click that speaks for 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.790
 say it more let's start creating 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:17.790
 our layer with holding we are going to 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.790
 put a class why 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.120
 Well, we can not put one on it knowing that 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.199
 it's a plugin then we need to put 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.139
 a class not so that if there are more 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.670
 because they also have the same name 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.270
 class 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.010
 and then all that is missing is to append all 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.340
 our other content that would be the 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.860
 title after we want the image and 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:48.229
 then we want to close 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:50.949
 our layer and our link that started 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.949
 here 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.970
 ready and nothing is missing then add 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.000
 this to the element that is being called 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.980
 then let's tell him that the element 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.900
 remember an element is a variable that 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.020
 is taking this that would be the element 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.740
 that we are referencing in this 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:14.140
 function that would be to post ok 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.560
 html point 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.380
 content 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.740
 let's save it and let's try it 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.750
 so 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.690
 we load our screen 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.380
 and as you can see, the 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.380
 content 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.310
 this 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.940
 the image the title and if we are going to see 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.270
 We will explain this 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.910
 it already takes us to our post now nothing 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.300
 It would be a matter of fixing a couple of things 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.880
 in html as for example that is not 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.210
 overflow as in this example you have to 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.940
 do the same thing that we did here in this 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.530
 in our first section we are going to give you 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.780
 style so that it is not for example the 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.420
 default color or the image looks 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.760
 so small or maybe give it a little 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.480
 more structure and style so that 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.030
 do not look so ugly 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.180
 but good that we will already do it in 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:17.420
 the next in the next session by 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.000
 what if they want to try and want 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.660
 extract some other data and put them 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.070
 good and I leave them to your consideration 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.900
 finished our first plugin already 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.460
 we can do so much on this site in 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.930
 our tutorial as in any other 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.750
 site that we are going to do where 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.050
 we need 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.180
 by giving this content that does not 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.960
 we could have generated or not 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.150
 in a much easier way simply 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.730
 referencing the call of our 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:49.090
 function with the address where it is 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.260
 our our jason then I hope 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.650
 that you liked this tutorial 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:57.630
 Any doubt do not hesitate to tell me in 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.630
