now if you understand your notes and you
understand<00:05:56.110> your<00:05:56.290> rhythms<00:05:56.680> and<00:05:57.010> you<00:05:57.190> will<00:05:57.340> do

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
understand your rhythms and you will do

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.490 
understand your rhythms and you will do
that<00:05:57.670> by<00:05:57.850> it<00:05:57.910> you<00:05:58.090> will<00:05:58.900> know<00:05:59.050> that<00:05:59.080> by

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
that by it you will know that by

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.110 
that by it you will know that by
completing<00:05:59.890> the<00:06:00.070> note<00:06:00.250> identification

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
completing the note identification

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.700 
completing the note identification
worksheet<00:06:01.510> and<00:06:01.720> working<00:06:02.380> through<00:06:02.590> these

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
worksheet and working through these

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.250 
worksheet and working through these
rhythm<00:06:03.100> studies<00:06:03.520> then<00:06:03.970> you<00:06:04.090> can<00:06:04.270> play<00:06:04.510> your

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
rhythm studies then you can play your

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.710 
rhythm studies then you can play your
first<00:06:05.470> reading<00:06:05.770> study<00:06:06.250> the<00:06:07.120> reading<00:06:07.300> studies

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
first reading study the reading studies

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.660 
first reading study the reading studies
put<00:06:07.930> together<00:06:08.080> all<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.650> rhythms<00:06:08.830> and<00:06:09.280> all<00:06:09.520> the

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
put together all the rhythms and all the

counts<00:06:24.550> I<00:06:24.970> also<00:06:25.390> have<00:06:25.600> some<00:06:25.810> chord<00:06:26.110> symbols<00:06:26.590> up

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
counts I also have some chord symbols up

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.560 
counts I also have some chord symbols up
here<00:06:26.980> these<00:06:27.430> are<00:06:27.610> the<00:06:27.640> symbols<00:06:27.910> that<00:06:28.180> the<00:06:28.300> band

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570

is using to play the music on the

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.820 
is using to play the music on the
backing<00:06:30.760> track<00:06:31.060> so<00:06:31.360> you<00:06:31.780> have<00:06:31.990> the<00:06:32.200> CD<00:06:32.620> that

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
backing track so you have the CD that

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.410 
backing track so you have the CD that
goes<00:06:32.980> along<00:06:33.160> with<00:06:33.340> these<00:06:33.610> reading<00:06:34.000> studies

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:34.420 
goes along with these reading studies

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.030 
goes along with these reading studies
hopefully<00:06:35.170> that'll<00:06:35.380> make<00:06:35.560> it<00:06:35.680> a<00:06:35.740> little<00:06:35.920> more

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
hopefully that'll make it a little more

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.950 
hopefully that'll make it a little more
interesting<00:06:36.640> and<00:06:36.790> sound<00:06:37.240> kind<00:06:37.450> of<00:06:37.540> cool<00:06:37.690> to
