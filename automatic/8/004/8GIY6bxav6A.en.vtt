 download everything compress this 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.030
 folder to weigh less but still 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.460
 it's going to take you because they are two gigabytes 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.759
 as four des I bought compressed then 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.100

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.180
 let's go to the phone and see the step that 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.530
 we have to do on the phone 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.600
 well once on the phone as you see 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.210
 I installed this and therefore lollipop 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.610
 I will teach in me that 5 is the s5 os 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.710
 I'm going to show that I already have the 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.800
 lollipop we will not do each 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.440
 device and my version is 5 points 0.2 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:47.730
 and as you see the model model is the smn 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:50.940
 901 times that is the plus the s5 plus 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.190
 ok let's go to the compilation number 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.120
 as if you have not seen what I 've done 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.400

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.910
 compilation number we are going to press 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.200
 several times until we open this 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.020
 little sign that is coming out to me 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.019
 down 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.759
 if this sign does not come out, it's going 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.069
 enable developer options 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.750
 within 100 the developer we are going to 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.170
 enter and we will check that they are 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.170
 active 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.770
 this native 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.230
 we are going to click on the debug usb 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.090
 that we have the green purification the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.290
 see what is going to make our 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.310
 device can connect the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.310
 computer to update 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.040
 and the mobile process is simply 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.260
 this 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.030
 well after doing the steps that 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.390
 we did on the mobile and previously on 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.280
 the computer we will turn off the phone 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.909
 we wait for it to go out of everything and 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.430

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.560

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.849
 three at a time we keep it until 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.970
 we get a screen that puts mode 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.180
 download or download and it will put up 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.549

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.250
 reset we give the button above the 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.819
 volume up and well let's follow the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.530
 phone and we 're going to open the odin the 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.300
 odin is a program that installs 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.100
 updates 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.120
 official how is this is a 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.180
 official authorization from samsung 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.959
 we're going to right click and execute 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.959
 as administrator 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.790
 and the sun is going to open this interface what 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.870
 we are going to do is to click on paper 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.870
 on top of apple 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.730
 and select let's look for the file 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.709
 that we had on the desk 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.659
 we select the downloaded file as 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.989
 previously on the desk that in this 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.989
 case 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.200
 in this case that I do not have in 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.129
 downloads 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.129
 a big fault 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.800
 While we give open 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.810
 the process of opening that is going to take 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.840
 A bit of fact I can even put you 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.370
 someone who does not answer the program and does not 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.430
 you are going to have no problem since 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.080
 the file is going to load perfectly 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.690
 you have to realize that you have 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.150
 have to have active f reset time and the 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.240
 self reviews then you have to have the 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.889
 two assets 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.590
 none of the other boxes checked 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:38.170
 only auto review and frs time 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.500
 okay now while this is loading let's go 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.140
 to force the video 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.940
 and well as you see we have been charged and 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.000
 this ticket will be marked with this 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.590
 file that to me the process of loading me 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.590
 it took me some 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.520
 three minutes depends on your 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.430
 computer will load safe once 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.940
 loaded with the boxes marked auto 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.940
 review and in first time no box 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.620
 marked only those two we connect the 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.630
 phone that was in download mode we 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.850
 we take out of the new download and it's going to 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.620
 appear here below and from com in 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.780
 any of the boxes the 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.789
 device that a name that you do not go to 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.160
 recognize but it's your device in 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.800
 a color as well as yellow or blue in a 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.770
 of these boxes once it disappears 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.530
 you are going to give to be for that and to you 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.810
 I said you have to connect the usb path to 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.030
 computer that connects jce for that 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.710
 we installed the guides before 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.449
 is that that is the program protects from 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:41.449
 before connects jce 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:43.759
 via usb and you give start 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.559
 well she says that the process failed 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:49.789
 because I do not connect my phone 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:52.950
 but it's going to start processing and going to 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.470
 start a green bar here 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.120
 and a green bar is going to put on 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.610
 go adding up has the mobile too 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.100
 until in this little picture above you 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.990
 put peace in green you must not disconnect 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.180

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.010
 completely update will download 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.040
 the new updates and with this 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:15.510
 process will not lose any files the 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:19.190
 phone will have the lollipop version and 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:21.200
 with all its functionalities 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.790
 it is important that you let the update 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.640
 the phone if you are going to be so 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.260
 about three minutes or more to restart is 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.200
 the phone just as this 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.900
 is acquiring certain values and good 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.340
