00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:04.730 
so this is our this was the stage demo

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.490 
so this is our this was the stage demo
location<00:00:05.180> actually<00:00:05.540> this<00:00:05.600> is<00:00:05.750> you<00:00:06.110> recognize

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 
location actually this is you recognize

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.589 
location actually this is you recognize
the<00:00:06.620> pipeline<00:00:07.040> one<00:00:08.029> of<00:00:08.120> the<00:00:08.179> things<00:00:08.330> that's

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
the pipeline one of the things that's

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:10.240 
the pipeline one of the things that's
great<00:00:08.809> about<00:00:08.930> it<00:00:09.320> you<00:00:09.680> know<00:00:09.769> having<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.070> open

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
great about it you know having the open

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.350 
great about it you know having the open
world<00:00:10.370> approach<00:00:10.730> is<00:00:10.910> that<00:00:10.940> if<00:00:11.120> the<00:00:11.179> player

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
world approach is that if the player

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.700 
world approach is that if the player
managed<00:00:11.780> to<00:00:11.870> get<00:00:11.960> to<00:00:12.080> this<00:00:12.170> location<00:00:12.410> in<00:00:12.650> the

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
managed to get to this location in the

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.140 
managed to get to this location in the
real<00:00:12.889> world<00:00:13.160> you<00:00:13.639> know<00:00:13.730> he<00:00:13.820> can<00:00:13.940> do<00:00:14.030> things

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
real world you know he can do things

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.999 
real world you know he can do things
like<00:00:14.330> take<00:00:14.570> the<00:00:14.719> amount<00:00:15.230> of<00:00:15.290> grenade<00:00:15.590> launcher

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:16.009 
like take the amount of grenade launcher

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:17.859 
like take the amount of grenade launcher
and<00:00:16.129> basically<00:00:16.939> you<00:00:17.150> know<00:00:17.269> start<00:00:17.720> peppering

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
and basically you know start peppering

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.870 
and basically you know start peppering
the<00:00:18.140> location<00:00:18.739> with<00:00:18.970> with<00:00:19.970> rounds<00:00:20.329> from<00:00:20.449> that

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
the location with with rounds from that

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.849 
the location with with rounds from that
so<00:00:22.880> it<00:00:23.659> means<00:00:24.199> that<00:00:24.349> there's<00:00:24.619> a<00:00:24.679> lot<00:00:24.829> of

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
so it means that there's a lot of

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.620 
so it means that there's a lot of
different<00:00:25.220> sort<00:00:25.789> of<00:00:25.849> planning<00:00:26.149> an<00:00:26.359> approach

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
different sort of planning an approach

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.239 
different sort of planning an approach
you<00:00:27.199> know<00:00:27.289> approaches<00:00:27.919> that<00:00:27.979> the<00:00:28.069> player<00:00:28.220> can

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:28.249 
you know approaches that the player can

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.870 
you know approaches that the player can
take<00:00:28.669> if<00:00:29.479> he<00:00:29.630> wants<00:00:29.899> to<00:00:29.989> be<00:00:30.079> extremely

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
take if he wants to be extremely

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.669 
take if he wants to be extremely
tactical<00:00:31.880> or<00:00:32.119> if<00:00:32.210> he<00:00:32.300> wants<00:00:32.480> to<00:00:32.540> snipe<00:00:32.870> then

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:33.679 
tactical or if he wants to snipe then

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.200 
tactical or if he wants to snipe then
he's<00:00:33.949> going<00:00:34.070> to<00:00:34.129> start<00:00:34.370> planning<00:00:34.760> is<00:00:34.910> you<00:00:35.120> know

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
he's going to start planning is you know

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.759 
he's going to start planning is you know
how<00:00:35.329> he<00:00:35.390> goes<00:00:35.660> about<00:00:35.690> hitting<00:00:36.199> locations<00:00:36.620> like

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
how he goes about hitting locations like

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:43.180 
how he goes about hitting locations like
this<00:00:37.010> is<00:00:37.100> accordingly<00:00:37.489> using<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:38.420> map<00:00:42.190> so

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
this is accordingly using the map so

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.680 
this is accordingly using the map so
usually<00:00:43.399> following<00:00:43.969> the<00:00:44.059> road<00:00:44.179> systems<00:00:44.570> are

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
usually following the road systems are

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.579 
usually following the road systems are
following<00:00:44.960> some<00:00:45.170> of<00:00:45.260> these<00:00:45.320> kind<00:00:45.559> of

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
following some of these kind of

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.139 
following some of these kind of
shortcuts<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:46.249> different<00:00:46.760> gullies<00:00:47.120> and

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
shortcuts and different gullies and

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.729 
shortcuts and different gullies and
things<00:00:47.390> he<00:00:47.510> can<00:00:47.660> he<00:00:47.839> can<00:00:47.870> come<00:00:48.170> to<00:00:48.320> locations

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
things he can he can come to locations

00:00:48.739 --> 00:01:00.840 
things he can he can come to locations
like<00:00:48.890> this

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.750

really<00:02:20.930> hard<00:02:21.050> doing<00:02:21.560> good<00:02:21.920> animal<00:02:22.310> AI<00:02:22.460> so<00:02:22.790> we

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
really hard doing good animal AI so we

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.920 
really hard doing good animal AI so we
didn't<00:02:23.090> want<00:02:23.210> to<00:02:23.300> compromise<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.810> by<00:02:23.870> doing

at stake now in kind of the African
setting<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.450> know<00:02:32.570> it's<00:02:32.750> something<00:02:33.020> we<00:02:33.110> can

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
setting you know it's something we can

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.660 
setting you know it's something we can
investigate<00:02:33.590> kind<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:33.980> down<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.310> road<00:02:34.490> in

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
investigate kind of down the road in

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.620 
investigate kind of down the road in
terms<00:02:34.850> of<00:02:34.970> whether<00:02:35.120> we<00:02:35.270> want<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.480> start

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
terms of whether we want to start

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.220 
terms of whether we want to start
introducing<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:37.010> know<00:02:37.130> hyenas<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.230> actual

introducing you know hyenas and actual
jackals

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.950 

something<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:46.730> was<00:02:46.850> shown<00:02:46.970> we<00:02:47.450> tried<00:02:47.900> to

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
something that was shown we tried to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.570 
something that was shown we tried to
showcases<00:02:48.440> well<00:02:48.650> in<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.060> in<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:51.250> stage<00:02:52.250> demo

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
showcases well in the in the stage demo

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.300 
showcases well in the in the stage demo
was<00:02:52.730> kind<00:02:52.910> of<00:02:52.940> being<00:02:53.120> able<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.450> use<00:02:53.510> your

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
was kind of being able to use your

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.830 
was kind of being able to use your
monocular<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.490> do<00:02:55.610> kind<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.030> basic<00:02:56.390> planning

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
monocular to do kind of basic planning

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.470 
monocular to do kind of basic planning
so<00:02:57.710> try<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.610> get<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:58.940> slightly<00:02:59.300> better

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
so try to get to a slightly better

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.750 
so try to get to a slightly better
location<00:03:00.080> like<00:03:00.620> if<00:03:00.740> I<00:03:00.890> if<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.220> spot<00:03:01.550> that

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
location like if I if I spot that

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.170 
location like if I if I spot that
vehicle<00:03:02.560> pull<00:03:03.560> up<00:03:03.680> my<00:03:03.800> map<00:03:04.040> I'm<00:03:04.790> actually<00:03:04.940> just

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
vehicle pull up my map I'm actually just

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.430 
vehicle pull up my map I'm actually just
pushing<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.900> pulling<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.290> trigger

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
pushing the pulling the trigger

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.020 
pushing the pulling the trigger
essentially<00:03:06.980> like<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.190> would<00:03:07.340> on<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.490> gun<00:03:07.670> sore

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
essentially like I would on a gun sore
