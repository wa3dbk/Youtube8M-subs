00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.800
 SAM BENEDICT: Welcome to SBCU, we will discuss Roubaix 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.890
 And why is it smoother means faster. 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.080
 This bike is for those who want to play big 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.900
 Want to ride long distances, but at the same time pursue excellent performance 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.990
 Want to pursue fun 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.240
 It is also prepared by the knight who is super fast. 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.690
 Roubaix's cycling experience is the smoothest of all our cars. 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.110
 This is important because after the ride is over, 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:29.990
 You will hope that you are still energetic 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.259
 If you have a good car, of course you will want a good experience. 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.680
 We can get this experience from the three characteristics of Roubaix. 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.925
 The first is the geometric angle 

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:38.950
 Roubaix is ​​unique at this point, and if you look at a few key places, 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.940
 We will find that our head tube is higher than normal. 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.840
 We will find that our head tube is higher than normal. 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 It is approximately 20 to 30 mm taller than conventional road head tubes. 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.030
 It is about 20 to 30 mm higher than a conventional road head tube 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.630
 This will make your posture slightly straighter when you ride. 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.780
 Slow down some of the pressure on the back caused by long-distance riding 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.760
 Slow down some of the pressure on the back caused by long-distance riding 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.360
 Even if you are at the end of the ride, you will feel energetic. 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.860
 The five-way of the car is slightly lower than that of a regular bicycle. 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.290
 The five-way of the car is slightly lower than that of a regular bicycle. 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.160
 This will make you confident when riding. 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.120
 Let you feel good during long-term use. 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.360
 Then there is the rear fork, which is longer than the traditional road bike. 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.450
 It is longer than on a traditional road bike. 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.840
 This will make you feel more comfortable and more stable when riding long distances. 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.530
 It is more stable when riding long distances. 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.100
 The second feature that makes this car smoother 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.910
 Is its frame structure 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.080
 Head tube and front fork, 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.350
 This is a very important handover point. 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.289
 You will feel the vibration of many roads in this place. 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:24.260
 You will feel the vibration of many roads in this place. 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.190
 We have a specific size head tube and fork on this car. 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.690
 We have a specific size head tube and fork on this car. 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.920
 In the small one, the diameter of the bearing will be smaller. 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.390
 So when I ride, I don’t feel so bumpy and rough. 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.810
 And the bigger ones - for the higher, heavier riders 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.210
 Will use larger bearings 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.660
 Will use larger bearings 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.229
 So there will be some hard work for those knights, 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.960
 So we have prepared for the knights of different sizes. 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.530
 Different specifications of the frame 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.650
 And also in the structure of the rear of the car 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.670
 You can also get very good smoothness from it. 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.580
 You can also get very good smoothness from it. 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.430
 It can move up and down, 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.070
 Absorb the bumps and shocks caused by the road surface. 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.130
 Absorb the bumps and shocks caused by the road surface. 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.060
 It is important that when you combine the upper tube, the sitting tube and the upper fork 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.080
 They will work together to make the frame more smooth 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.470
 So this is a comfortable one, 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.870
 And a great riding experience 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.580
 The last feature is the Zertz shock absorber. 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.230
 You can see the Zertz shock absorber on both the upper fork and the front fork. 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.790
 You can see the Zertz shock absorber on both the upper fork and the front fork. 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.420
 Its role is to absorb vibration 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.880
 Vibrations are often transmitted from the road through the tires. 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.940
 Finally on the hands and hips 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.060
 In the long run 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.670
 It will make you exhausted. 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.400
 You won't notice the vibration in the first few minutes 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.720
 But after riding on the road for a long time, 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.670
 This will make you tired and tired 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.720
 And this is the result we don't want. 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.740
 Therefore, Zertz shock absorbers absorb shock. 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.610
 Keep you from the bumps and make you energetic all day long. 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.020
 And don't forget, Roubaix is ​​also very fast. 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.990
 This bicycle is the king of cobblestone roads. 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.180
 It has won the Paris-Roubaix competition many times. 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.360
 At the same time, its speed is also very fast 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.850
 As good as its comfort 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.100
 Let's take a look at the three parts that make this car fast. 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.190
 Let's take a look at the three parts that make this car fast. 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.380
 First: It is extremely light. 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.570
 The S-Works-grade frame weighs only 925 grams, which allows the car to climb uphill. 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.960
 Super lightweight 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.760
 Look at the structural design of the car, 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.560
 This is the highest level we can achieve. 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.329
 The carbon fiber structure of FACT IS, 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.480
 Upper tube, head tube, lower tube, three in one 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.360
 Integrated five-way and rear fork, and seat tube 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.870
 These can be produced independently 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.770
 What do you think is more important? 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.980
 Where do you need to be more rigid? 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.210
 Where do you need to be more flexible? 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.480
 The last part is the rear fork of the car. 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.220
 We want to change them. 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.130
 They are straighter than the previous version 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.710
 The spacing is wider, so it is more triangular. 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.430
 This will make you feel very hard in the back. 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.800
 As soon as you step on it, it will move forward immediately. 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.710
 But still very smooth 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.579
 Then let's take a look at some of my favorite parts of Roubaix. 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.290
 Then let's take a look at some of my favorite parts of Roubaix. 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.020
 The first is a gear ratio. 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.460
 This car, long-distance riding, playing big, long uphill, 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.840
 There is a suitable gear ratio in the car. 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.490
 This is a simple and practical chainring: 50/34,, 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.970
 There are enough gears to get the speed you want at the sprint, 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.810
 A reasonably low gear ratio can take you to those high slopes. 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.330
 A reasonably low gear ratio can take you to those high slopes. 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.660
 The second part is the C-GR seatpost that is mounted on some cars. 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.190
 Extremely clever design, giving you 18 mm smoothness. 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.930
 Extremely clever design, giving you 18 mm smoothness. 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.190
 It allows you to move up and down, 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.100
 Stay comfortable and look cool. 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.960
 Finally, the part that is connected to C-GR, 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.300
 Ergonomic cushion. 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.620
 Ladies and gentlemen, sitting on the cushion for a day, you need to let the blood flow to where it needs to flow. 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.130
 You need to let the blood flow to where it needs to flow. 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.570
 We want everything to work and run the same in the future. 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.260
 Ergonomic cushions keep you happy. 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.190
 This is Roubaix. 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.220
 If you want to ride long distances, want to play big, 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.909
 I want to enjoy the fun of cycling and still perform well. 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:52.159
 This car is built for you.
