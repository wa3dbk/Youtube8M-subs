00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Welcome to L-E on the 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.899
 autoshow 2013 we have for you again 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.179
 our famous notorious tops and 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.349
 flops ready for how often praised 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.700
 but also be neat on the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.240
 get a mouthful but that makes us 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.130
 Nothing 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.920
 we are used to that makes us even 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.439
 a little fun actually is the top 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.970
 but the fair of the porsche one can do so 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.810
 that would be too easy here we are here 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.050
 Because of this, America is driving away in America 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.189
 says if the fair here cadillac 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.510
 escalade in the xl version at the end of the 70s 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.030
 I had a nursery in the years 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.640
 Baden had twelve square meters 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.559
 the surface of this car is bigger 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.480
 Imagine that , I can 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.100
 pure and still my seven children the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.510
 I do not have it yet but you know 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.879
 yes never 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.489
 v8 under the hood huge trunk 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.860
 this is a flagship and the cool one 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.469
 that is also possible in germany 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.360
 not in the really big xl version though 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.180
 a bit shorter and it is always enough 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.640
 still for about 28 suitcases or one 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.409
 elephants on the back of the trailer a lot 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.630
 fun with the still afloat from auto 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.080
 So I generally think the nismo 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.290
 row of nissan really cool when you turn 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.140
 a gt r or 370z is applied 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.409
 but this nissan juke-r is here with it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.000
 220 hp and a rear spoiler and this 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.159
 generally chubby look 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.100
 that goes to the edelgard shopping on 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.650
 weekend this is great but for me 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.829
 here in this optic the flop of 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.979
 autoshow 2013 but I'm just watching 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.579
 fan has this car after all but how 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.110
 they also see this hiding it 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.979
 Highlight of the fair in Los Angeles 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.140
 This year is natural for me 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.310
 monique na good in truth it is the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.600
 coupe version of jaguar s-type that the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.729
 backpack yes just the golden steering wheel 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.590
 won and the coupe looks at least 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.140
 just as pretty and is still a lot 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.090
 stronger than in the r-version with 550 ps 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.329
 in four seconds from zero to one hundred 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.950
 but where we are currently at 100 is 200,000 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.530
 You are at least as fast as the euro 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.530
 but monique i still buy 1 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.730
 my flop the fair here in los angeles 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.650
 is the final edition of the sls of amr 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.480
 that was formerly called amg but now 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.940
 more for everything has to go out because this 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.860
 is the discontinued model that will be 350 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.580
 once built with a bonnet 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.230
 karbon 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.569
 but below that everything is the same 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.000
 couple of optical beauty surgery though 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.050
 nothing that is really spectacular 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.519
 I prefer to wait for the comeback 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.910
 edition 2016 this is my job 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:40.239
 this fair is the mercedes gl a45 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.560
 amg still as a study clear of the series in it 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.890
 will look a little different 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.530
 not quite as noticeable but 360 ps 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.790
 under the hood four -wheel drive there goes 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.049
 Alright, what am I happy 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.290
 animal substances that experience the food 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.209
 can for me is the mini of the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.549
 absolute flop of this fair what is it 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.870
 new about nothing for me he sees 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.040
 just like the other two 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.489
 vehicles the other two 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.250
 Generations 1 and 2 ventured since 2001 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.019
 mini nothing new i admit is inside 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.359
 a little bit different but that too 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.989
 is for me too little means flop 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.989
 of the day
