00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.540
 I still remember that horrible event 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.030
 It was March 20, 2004 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.060
 the last days of winter and the first days of spring 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.519
 I was at home doing zaping for video game download pages 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.319
 when suddenly I found one that I had never tried 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.720
 it was called summits 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.230
 after one hour of downloading 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.050
 finally he could install 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.480
 after doing it, play game and it did not work 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.480
 I felt very disappointed because I had already had illusions 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.640
 I uninstalled it and it was still fragile on the internet 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.650
 although I could not remove the club three from the head 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.780
 so senator has passed away and if the mall to buy 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.530
 almost to the match entry 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.130
 selling video games in a small store 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.240
 I asked him if he had 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.520
 and he assisted me with the head 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.520
 the game I noticed that in the box puts a prisoner 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.410
 he is still behind the boxes and no images of the game were coming 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.960
 description although I did not care 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.120
 I paid the man and I went to my house with 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 really want to try it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.350
 It was weird because Cuba 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.660
 the installation alone 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.660
 the videogame slides 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.790
 I opened the access 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.360
 although it was also weird because like galicia icons at the head of a goat 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.360
 black and how 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.170
 same and continued 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.170
 another one by víctor zwenger 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.710
 and the game options 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.180
 I was three days in a row without stopping 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.120
 I loved this game 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.460
 after 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.260
 so the motorcycle option blinked and betis 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.170
 three partners appeared to me 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.050
 humphries the resurrection of evil 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.480
 3 65 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.480
 I knew that the game was still in the 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.200
 to the dark side of Mars was in fire color and under the title could 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.070
 the resurrection of evil 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.809
 I chose new game and eat 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.809
 I liked this game a lot more than the previous one 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.389
 asked that the terminals 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.209
 It was March 27 and I had finished 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.309
 teresita spaces resurrection of the 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.309
 what I gave jersey 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.339
 in Jerez Edition 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:37.339
 just a black background 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.129
 I could not leave him 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:48.139
 I had no choice but to put new games and choose the only level 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.479
 of difficulty that there was 15 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.749
 the game started exactly like him 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.789
 although when you get more and there were no people 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:00.389
 the mutilated bodies where the characters of the q3 were 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.479
 original 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.439
 just the triple what I think 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.659
 they were not liked because I had become accustomed to the images of 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:13.619
 3the resurrection of the sea 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.729
 so it works 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.289
 one thing is short 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.289
 the game but when I came back I gave them paused 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.199
 A shiver ran down my spine 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.239
 I was alone at home it is impossible 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.679
 so nobody would have come to cause me the game 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:30.809
 josefa hussain 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.479
 it came in front of a wall 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.519
 Bullying 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.519
 because when you are in hell 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.049
 the message on the wall was erased and appeared 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.459
 I said do not worry if you succeed 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.459
 this nightmare 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.299
 frustrated when you are 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.299
 in the hallway of my house the sound of a vase 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.239
 just appeared on the wall of the q3 the phrase 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.129
 a few weeks values ​​went down by the way what are you waiting for 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:02.729
 continue playing 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:06.899
 I was completely closed there was something from the video game that was 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:08.749
 controlled from the real world 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.629
 I did not know what to do, it was ten in the morning 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.990
 after 5 hours without finding demons a thousand people 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.099
 I realized that I was going on circuits 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.269
 but I found a ventilation duct that reached the last 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.340
 original congress level hell 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.580
 in hell there were two caves each with different options to commit suicide or 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.300
 face meal cyberdem with a flashlight 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.670
 if he managed to defeat the giant montse liberalia for all eternity but if 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.680
 I lost that thing they would kill me my soul would stay in hell 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.940
 if I chose the option of committing suicide that thing would not kill me and it would be 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.330
 released but when dying in real life I would go to hell 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.069
 I wisely chose the option of sitting for cybercrime 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.460
 when entering the battle the cyber of montecito 50 points of AIDS in the first 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.180
 I already saw him was going to die 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.230
 just when the pillar of monroy was going to kill the game it froze but I 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.000
 I could move around the stage while everything 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.009
 the rest was frozen 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.389
 then a light appeared 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.460
 Blanca was an angel with the face of a beautiful girl 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.360
 that angel told me 'you are not worthy of evil you are worthy of good 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.880
 he gave me a huge box in which they were all absolutely 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:24.430
 the weapons of the game if with infinite ammunition nimes souls 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:29.539
 The best thing about those weapons is that they were silver and you never had to 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:30.610
 recharge 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.160
 that angel went away in another flash of light and just when he did everything he 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.249
 thawed 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:39.759
 using all the weapons I managed to beat the cyber lerma 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.680
 After this a portal was opened on the wall of the game while at my 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.719
 fourth the mozart Figaro was absorbed by the portal at the same time as a 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.959
 creature that was in my house was absorbed by the portal of my room 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.120
 at that time the game was removed are 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.760
 When I looked at the time I was puzzled to see that it was the same time 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.999
 had started 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:03.559
 the game box was no longer the same now instead of putting bosses edit edition 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:04.960
 special victims 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.169
 the next day 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.230
 It was already the first day of class after the fort of the week and I had to go 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:11.529
 to my institute 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:15.599
 When I arrived to my class the teacher introduced us to a new student 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.849
 It was called Angelo, it just happened to happen that it was exactly the same face 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.729
 the angel that appeared kun 3g de sevilla 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.770
 we started dating and after a while we became boyfriends 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:31.699
 that's how angelic things represented a good part, that's why people do not 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.009
 face your price take out
