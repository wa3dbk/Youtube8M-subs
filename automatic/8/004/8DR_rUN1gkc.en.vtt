our<00:02:06.960> position<00:02:07.500> units<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.069> degrees<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
our position units to degrees and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.260 
our position units to degrees and
command<00:02:09.270> one<00:02:09.869> revolution<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.619> motor<00:02:10.830> or

command one revolution of the motor or

360 degrees

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.870 
360 degrees
we<00:02:13.740> could<00:02:13.890> then<00:02:13.920> measure<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.490> distance

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
we could then measure the distance

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.650 
we could then measure the distance
traveled<00:02:15.390> which<00:02:15.960> is<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.530> lead<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.950> screw

if you have a gear ratio don't forget to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.430 
if you have a gear ratio don't forget to
take<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:20.970> into<00:02:21.240> account<00:02:21.270> as<00:02:21.840> part<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.290> the

take that into account as part of the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.160 
take that into account as part of the
distance<00:02:22.800> commanded<00:02:23.490> we<00:02:24.450> entered<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.780> value

could change our position velocity and
