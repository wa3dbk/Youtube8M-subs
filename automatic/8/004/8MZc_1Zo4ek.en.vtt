hello and welcome to another one my
videos<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.830> as<00:00:04.950> you<00:00:05.130> can<00:00:05.250> see<00:00:05.310> in<00:00:05.549> this<00:00:05.670> video

videos and as you can see in this video

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.450 
videos and as you can see in this video
I<00:00:06.240> have<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.629> engine<00:00:06.960> out<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.230> bake<00:00:07.470> so<00:00:08.429> I

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
I have the engine out of the bake so I

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.540 
I have the engine out of the bake so I
have<00:00:08.880> one<00:00:09.269> frame<00:00:09.750> without<00:00:10.170> an<00:00:10.290> engine<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.860> one

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
have one frame without an engine and one

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.480 
have one frame without an engine and one
engine<00:00:12.210> without<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> frame<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:13.070> these<00:00:14.070> CX

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
engine without a frame on these CX

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.820 
engine without a frame on these CX
engines<00:00:15.150> are<00:00:15.360> easy<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.289> get<00:00:16.470> out<00:00:16.590> because

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
engines are easy to get out because

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.349 
engines are easy to get out because
they're<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> stressed<00:00:17.340> member<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.150> bike

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
they're a stressed member of the bike

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.779 
they're a stressed member of the bike
and<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.470> frame<00:00:19.770> there<00:00:20.250> see<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
and of the frame there see it's just a

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.320 
and of the frame there see it's just a
matter<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.090> unborn<00:00:21.650> yets<00:00:22.650> screws<00:00:23.160> or<00:00:23.699> bolts<00:00:24.060> I

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
matter of unborn yets screws or bolts I

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
matter of unborn yets screws or bolts I
should<00:00:24.510> see<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.960> then<00:00:25.080> literally

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
should see it and then literally

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.740 
should see it and then literally
dropping<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.769> out<00:00:25.920> onto<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.369> pallet<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:26.970> then

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
dropping it out onto a pallet and then

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.070 
dropping it out onto a pallet and then
getting<00:00:28.250> yourself<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.580> your<00:00:30.090> better<00:00:30.390> half<00:00:30.660> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
getting yourself and your better half to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.569 
getting yourself and your better half to
come<00:00:31.230> along<00:00:31.470> carry<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.279> put<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.460> onto

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
come along carry it up and put it onto

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.020 
come along carry it up and put it onto
this<00:00:32.790> very<00:00:33.450> fetching<00:00:33.719> workbench<00:00:34.380> here<00:00:35.030> so

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
this very fetching workbench here so

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.200 
this very fetching workbench here so
yeah<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:37.620> that's<00:00:37.739> all<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.219> when<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.850> I'm

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
yeah so that's all out when it's out I'm

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.510 
yeah so that's all out when it's out I'm
going<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.200> look<00:00:40.469> over<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
going to have a look over all the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.220 
going to have a look over all the
governs<00:00:42.059> now<00:00:42.379> in<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.710> CX<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.640> world<00:00:45.480> there's<00:00:46.110> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
governs now in the CX in world there's a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.440 
governs now in the CX in world there's a
there's<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> procedure<00:00:47.489> called<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.090> triple

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
there's a procedure called a triple

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.450 
there's a procedure called a triple
bypass<00:00:48.629> which<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.350> basically<00:00:49.800> change<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
bypass which is basically change in the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.630 
bypass which is basically change in the
mechanical<00:00:50.610> water<00:00:51.149> seal<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> pump<00:00:52.020> in

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
mechanical water seal in the pump in

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.799 
mechanical water seal in the pump in
looking<00:00:53.640> at<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> steered<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.270> change<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
looking at the steered a change in the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.130 
looking at the steered a change in the
steer<00:00:55.110> de<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.500> also<00:00:55.920> changing<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.430> cam<00:00:56.670> chin

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
steer de and also changing the cam chin

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.990 
steer de and also changing the cam chin
I'm<00:00:58.140> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.920> definitely<00:00:59.100> change<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.730> water

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
I'm going to definitely change the water

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.150 
I'm going to definitely change the water
seal<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.989> how<00:01:01.079> old<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.890> just

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
seal because of how old it is it's just

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.889 
seal because of how old it is it's just
when<00:01:02.609> I'm<00:01:02.730> here<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.059> might<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.329> well<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
when I'm here I might as well do it

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.620 
when I'm here I might as well do it
because<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.350> an<00:01:04.439> easy<00:01:04.589> job<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.939> steer<00:01:06.240> de<00:01:06.450> I

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
because it's an easy job the steer de I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.880 
because it's an easy job the steer de I
know<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.990> fine<00:01:07.320> because<00:01:07.530> I've<00:01:07.740> already

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
know is fine because I've already

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.710 
know is fine because I've already
checked<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> resistances<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.479> when

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
checked the resistances of it but when

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.030 
checked the resistances of it but when
I'm<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> might<00:01:10.260> as<00:01:10.320> well<00:01:10.439> tear<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> back

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
I'm here I might as well tear the back

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.649 
I'm here I might as well tear the back

however<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.369> know<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> lot<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.180> garages<00:01:39.600> just

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
however I know a lot of garages just

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.109 
however I know a lot of garages just
didn't<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.650> because<00:01:40.860> well<00:01:41.520> they<00:01:41.909> either

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
didn't do it because well they either

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.760 
didn't do it because well they either
forgot<00:01:42.600> or<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.990> couldn't<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.439> bothered<00:01:43.619> to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
put the stamps on the engine to see it's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.319 
put the stamps on the engine to see it's
been<00:01:45.810> modified<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:46.920> pretty<00:01:47.159> sure<00:01:47.310> by<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
been modified but I'm pretty sure by the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.100 
been modified but I'm pretty sure by the
sound<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.960> how<00:01:49.140> many<00:01:49.290> miles<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.770> done<00:01:50.040> and

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
sound of it how many miles it's done and

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.480 
sound of it how many miles it's done and
because<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.290> actually<00:01:52.439> being<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.280> its

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
because it's actually being in in its

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.100 
because it's actually being in in its
life<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.939> get<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> cam<00:01:54.329> belt<00:01:54.540> doing<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.990> this

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
life to get the cam belt doing that this

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.569 
life to get the cam belt doing that this
modification<00:01:55.680> would<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.890> been<00:01:56.009> done<00:01:56.310> but

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
modification would have been done but

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.580 
modification would have been done but
when<00:01:57.119> I've<00:01:57.240> got<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.450> all<00:01:57.600> organized<00:01:58.049> a<00:02:00.590> balloon

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
when I've got it all organized a balloon

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.899 
when I've got it all organized a balloon
with<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.770> engine<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.280> also<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
with the engine and also just the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.819 
with the engine and also just the
general<00:02:03.360> maintenance<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.380> things<00:02:04.649> just

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
general maintenance and things just

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.620 
general maintenance and things just
before<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.460> put<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.119> engine<00:02:06.450> because

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
before I put it in the engine because

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.660 
before I put it in the engine because
put<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> engine<00:02:07.649> put<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> frame

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
put in the engine put it in the frame

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.160 
put in the engine put it in the frame
because<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.330> lot<00:02:09.479> easier<00:02:09.629> working<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.080> an

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
because it's a lot easier working on an

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.080 
because it's a lot easier working on an
engine<00:02:10.500> when<00:02:10.590> it's<00:02:10.739> on<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.220> bench<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.819> this

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
engine when it's on the bench like this

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.809 
engine when it's on the bench like this
another<00:02:13.780> thing<00:02:14.050> I'm<00:02:14.170> gonna<00:02:14.319> do<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.620> or<00:02:15.160> my<00:02:15.520> doom

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
another thing I'm gonna do is or my doom

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.580 
another thing I'm gonna do is or my doom
to<00:02:16.000> be<00:02:16.150> written<00:02:16.300> is<00:02:16.510> take<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.410> feed<00:02:18.130> off<00:02:18.459> this

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
to be written is take a feed off this

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.410 
to be written is take a feed off this
sender<00:02:20.590> unit<00:02:20.740> for<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.130> oil<00:02:21.280> pressure<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.240> beer

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
sender unit for the oil pressure so beer

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.620 
sender unit for the oil pressure so beer
see<00:02:22.569> what<00:02:22.690> I'll<00:02:22.810> do<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.400> all<00:02:24.550> MPT<00:02:25.360> one

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
see what I'll do is this is all MPT one

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.400 
see what I'll do is this is all MPT one
e<00:02:25.660> eighth<00:02:25.870> fittings<00:02:26.410> it's<00:02:27.370> busy<00:02:27.760> put<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.270> MPT<00:02:29.110> T

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
e eighth fittings it's busy put a MPT T

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.680 
e eighth fittings it's busy put a MPT T
on<00:02:29.560> here<00:02:29.800> put<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.489> sender<00:02:30.819> unit<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.180> one<00:02:31.360> side

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
on here put the sender unit on one side

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.330 
on here put the sender unit on one side
and<00:02:31.900> then<00:02:32.020> take<00:02:32.230> Hillary<00:02:32.650> off<00:02:32.920> up<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.160> a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
and then take Hillary off up to a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.010 
and then take Hillary off up to a
mechanical<00:02:33.910> pressure<00:02:34.180> gauge<00:02:34.510> which<00:02:34.810> I'm

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
mechanical pressure gauge which I'm

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.840 
mechanical pressure gauge which I'm
planning<00:02:35.530> on<00:02:35.650> mountain<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.430> radiant

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
planning on mountain to the radiant

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.790 
planning on mountain to the radiant
amounts<00:02:37.239> cause<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.110> rubberized<00:02:38.410> I'm

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
amounts cause the rubberized I'm

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.229 
amounts cause the rubberized I'm
thinking<00:02:39.100> that'll<00:02:39.250> take<00:02:39.459> some<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.730> vibration

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
thinking that'll take some the vibration

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.570 
thinking that'll take some the vibration
of<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.480> gauge<00:02:40.690> but<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:41.830> I<00:02:42.130> think<00:02:42.250> would<00:02:42.459> be<00:02:42.550> a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
of the gauge but just I think would be a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.630 
of the gauge but just I think would be a
nice<00:02:42.790> little<00:02:42.970> touch<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.660> like<00:02:43.840> me<00:02:44.020> ages<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.860> it

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
nice little touch I like me ages and it

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.640 
nice little touch I like me ages and it
also<00:02:45.820> be<00:02:46.150> just<00:02:46.360> something<00:02:47.080> there<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.470> watch

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
also be just something there to watch

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.830 
also be just something there to watch
what<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.190> oil<00:02:48.310> pressures<00:02:48.790> doing<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.480> the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
what the oil pressures doing in the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.050 
what the oil pressures doing in the
bikes<00:02:50.050> or<00:02:50.500> yeah<00:02:51.010> that's<00:02:51.310> another<00:02:51.550> thing<00:02:51.670> that

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
bikes or yeah that's another thing that

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.729 
bikes or yeah that's another thing that
I'm<00:02:52.120> going<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.360> be<00:02:52.450> doing<00:02:52.690> or<00:02:53.050> hopefully<00:02:53.590> doing

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
I'm going to be doing or hopefully doing

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.830 
I'm going to be doing or hopefully doing
I<00:02:54.040> still<00:02:54.489> haven't<00:02:54.700> decided<00:02:54.970> whether<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.570> want

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
I still haven't decided whether I want

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.250 
I still haven't decided whether I want
to<00:02:55.930> or<00:02:55.989> not

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
to or not

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.050 
to or not
so<00:02:56.680> yeah<00:02:57.040> that's<00:02:57.280> why<00:02:57.430> I'm<00:02:57.519> humming<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:57.910> hard

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
so yeah that's why I'm humming and hard

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.390 
so yeah that's why I'm humming and hard

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
got to do the thermostat in here because

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.710 
got to do the thermostat in here because
the<00:03:26.829> thermostat<00:03:27.190> is<00:03:27.549> taught<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:27.970> Bullard<00:03:28.570> old

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
the thermostat is taught the Bullard old

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.600 
the thermostat is taught the Bullard old
guess<00:03:29.019> because<00:03:29.230> it's<00:03:29.470> it's<00:03:29.950> all<00:03:30.100> yucky<00:03:30.370> in

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
guess because it's it's all yucky in

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.759 
guess because it's it's all yucky in
there<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.120> them<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:31.690> varnished<00:03:32.110> up<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:32.500> I

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
there and them and varnished up so I

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.350 
there and them and varnished up so I
don't<00:03:32.980> think<00:03:33.070> that's<00:03:33.190> ever<00:03:33.370> gonna<00:03:33.579> work<00:03:33.790> might

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
don't think that's ever gonna work might

them<00:05:07.400> all<00:05:07.520> sort<00:05:07.820> of<00:05:07.940> being<00:05:08.150> whether<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.479> do<00:05:08.599> it

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
them all sort of being whether to do it

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.320 
them all sort of being whether to do it
from<00:05:08.810> end<00:05:09.050> conversion<00:05:09.620> to<00:05:09.710> this<00:05:10.000> I'm<00:05:11.000> getting

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
from end conversion to this I'm getting

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.600 
from end conversion to this I'm getting
some<00:05:11.479> upside<00:05:11.990> down<00:05:12.259> Superbike<00:05:12.860> Forks<00:05:13.370> and

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
some upside down Superbike Forks and

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.089 
some upside down Superbike Forks and
actually<00:05:13.910> putting<00:05:14.120> them<00:05:14.300> on<00:05:14.620> full<00:05:15.620> front<00:05:15.889> end

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
actually putting them on full front end

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.159 
actually putting them on full front end
so<00:05:16.310> I'm<00:05:16.430> want<00:05:16.639> to<00:05:16.669> try<00:05:16.940> and<00:05:17.060> find<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.930> wheels

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
so I'm want to try and find the wheels

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.800 
so I'm want to try and find the wheels
the<00:05:18.590> brakes<00:05:19.009> the<00:05:19.310> forks<00:05:19.789> the<00:05:20.210> triple<00:05:20.539> trees

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
the brakes the forks the triple trees

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.930 
the brakes the forks the triple trees
everything<00:05:21.349> and<00:05:21.740> then<00:05:22.099> basically<00:05:22.610> doing<00:05:22.789> the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
everything and then basically doing the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.879 
everything and then basically doing the
modifications<00:05:23.240> that<00:05:23.810> are<00:05:23.930> needed<00:05:24.349> which<00:05:24.650> is

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
modifications that are needed which is

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.909 
modifications that are needed which is
basically<00:05:25.520> replacing<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.360> stem<00:05:26.930> which<00:05:27.620> is<00:05:27.650> on

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
basically replacing the stem which is on

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.760 
basically replacing the stem which is on
that<00:05:28.099> triple<00:05:28.460> tree<00:05:28.699> there<00:05:28.970> and<00:05:29.620> Transplant<00:05:30.620> it

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
that triple tree there and Transplant it

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.129 
that triple tree there and Transplant it
into<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.430> Superbike<00:05:31.940> frame<00:05:32.330> triple<00:05:32.900> trees

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
into the Superbike frame triple trees

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.240 
into the Superbike frame triple trees
and<00:05:33.940> then<00:05:34.940> we<00:05:35.900> should<00:05:36.139> have<00:05:36.260> a<00:05:36.320> nice<00:05:36.650> handling

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
and then we should have a nice handling

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.529 
and then we should have a nice handling
bike<00:05:37.460> I<00:05:37.610> don't<00:05:37.849> know<00:05:37.909> whether<00:05:38.030> we<00:05:38.150> want<00:05:38.389> to<00:05:38.449> do

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
bike I don't know whether we want to do

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:38.980 
bike I don't know whether we want to do
that

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
that

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.409 
that
am<00:05:39.139> i<00:05:39.440> could<00:05:39.740> just<00:05:40.130> refurbish<00:05:40.789> these<00:05:40.970> forks

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
am i could just refurbish these forks

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.060 
am i could just refurbish these forks
and<00:05:41.510> put<00:05:41.690> some<00:05:41.840> progressive<00:05:42.289> springs<00:05:42.740> in<00:05:42.979> it

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
and put some progressive springs in it

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.010 
and put some progressive springs in it
but<00:05:43.820> after<00:05:44.180> I've<00:05:44.270> got<00:05:44.449> the<00:05:44.539> progressive

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
but after I've got the progressive

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.379 
but after I've got the progressive
Springs<00:05:45.500> all<00:05:45.860> the<00:05:46.010> seals<00:05:46.310> and<00:05:46.699> everything<00:05:47.210> I'm

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
Springs all the seals and everything I'm

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.010 
Springs all the seals and everything I'm
basically<00:05:48.139> already<00:05:48.349> 60%<00:05:49.310> there<00:05:49.699> well<00:05:50.360> 60%

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
basically already 60% there well 60%

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.439 
basically already 60% there well 60%
there<00:05:51.289> getting<00:05:52.130> a<00:05:52.190> full<00:05:52.430> Superbike<00:05:52.970> front<00:05:53.240> end

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
there getting a full Superbike front end

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.279 
there getting a full Superbike front end
so<00:05:53.780> it's<00:05:53.930> can't<00:05:54.139> just<00:05:54.409> win<00:05:54.650> that<00:05:54.949> up<00:05:55.449> and<00:05:56.449> other

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
so it's can't just win that up and other

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.249 
so it's can't just win that up and other
than<00:05:57.470> that<00:05:57.880> that's<00:05:58.880> what<00:05:59.060> I<00:05:59.090> need<00:05:59.270> to<00:05:59.360> do<00:05:59.509> now
