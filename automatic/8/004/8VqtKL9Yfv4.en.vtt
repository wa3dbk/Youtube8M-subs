straightening iron it's by a tsunami now

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.060 
straightening iron it's by a tsunami now
you<00:00:49.449> guys<00:00:49.719> know<00:00:49.780> we've<00:00:50.230> been<00:00:50.260> blowing<00:00:50.890> out<00:00:51.039> the

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
you guys know we've been blowing out the

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.420 
you guys know we've been blowing out the
arrojo<00:00:51.699> straightening<00:00:52.239> iron<00:00:52.530> tsunami<00:00:53.530> is<00:00:53.920> the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
arrojo straightening iron tsunami is the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.369 
arrojo straightening iron tsunami is the
company<00:00:54.910> that<00:00:55.090> created<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.840> arrojo

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
company that created the arrojo

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.599 
company that created the arrojo
straightening<00:00:56.920> iron<00:00:57.219> and<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:58.390> iron<00:00:59.609> very

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
straightening iron and this iron very

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.170 
straightening iron and this iron very
similar<00:01:01.180> with<00:01:01.780> a<00:01:01.840> smaller<00:01:02.410> footprint<00:01:03.039> we<00:01:03.879> like

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
similar with a smaller footprint we like

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.139 
similar with a smaller footprint we like
it<00:01:04.479> it's<00:01:04.930> a<00:01:05.080> little<00:01:05.379> different<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:06.149> here's

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
it it's a little different and here's

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.080 
it it's a little different and here's
why<00:01:07.800> what<00:01:08.800> you<00:01:08.950> have<00:01:09.160> are<00:01:09.460> two<00:01:09.820> independent

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
why what you have are two independent

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.139 
why what you have are two independent
heat<00:01:10.570> sensors<00:01:11.020> again<00:01:11.470> these<00:01:12.100> sensors<00:01:12.700> pick<00:01:13.000> up

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
heat sensors again these sensors pick up

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.639 
heat sensors again these sensors pick up
the<00:01:13.300> heat<00:01:13.509> and<00:01:13.690> they<00:01:13.869> make<00:01:14.080> sure<00:01:14.380> that

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
the heat and they make sure that

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.469 
the heat and they make sure that
whatever<00:01:14.830> temperature<00:01:15.220> you<00:01:15.520> set<00:01:15.729> that

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
whatever temperature you set that

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.249 
whatever temperature you set that
temperature<00:01:17.050> is<00:01:17.170> constant<00:01:17.410> on<00:01:17.830> both<00:01:18.429> sides

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
temperature is constant on both sides

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.380 
temperature is constant on both sides
that's<00:01:20.259> really<00:01:21.190> important<00:01:21.700> so<00:01:21.849> one<00:01:22.030> side<00:01:22.270> is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
that's really important so one side is

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.449 
that's really important so one side is
not<00:01:22.539> getting<00:01:22.720> too<00:01:22.990> hot<00:01:23.319> while<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.069> other<00:01:24.220> gets

00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:24.459 
not getting too hot while the other gets

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:25.949 
not getting too hot while the other gets
too<00:01:24.729> cool<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.300> you<00:01:25.390> don't<00:01:25.569> have<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.780> do

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:25.959 
too cool so you don't have to do

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.249 
too cool so you don't have to do
multiple<00:01:26.259> passes<00:01:27.160> on<00:01:27.310> your<00:01:27.940> hair<00:01:28.259> this

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
multiple passes on your hair this

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.740 
multiple passes on your hair this
temperature<00:01:30.009> settings<00:01:30.399> work<00:01:31.030> all<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.539> way<00:01:31.569> up

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
temperature settings work all the way up

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.020 
temperature settings work all the way up
to<00:01:31.780> 450<00:01:32.739> degrees<00:01:32.770> so<00:01:33.340> if<00:01:33.429> you're<00:01:33.550> working<00:01:33.759> with

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
need to get that high temperature up

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.800 
need to get that high temperature up
there<00:01:38.250> perfect<00:01:39.250> we<00:01:39.970> love<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.450> 1-inch
