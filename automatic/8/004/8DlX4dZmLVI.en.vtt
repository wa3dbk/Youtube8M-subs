00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.579
 clear vegetables if haiti that are so 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.100
 healthy they are but it is that 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.890
 they live so much that 7 their diet makes them 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.290
 so long-lived but investigating a little 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.299
 I will tell you that the Japanese and we do not 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.250
 we are so different they also have 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.460
 a varied diet and eat something more than 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.450
 pork 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.729
 eat veal in fact a normal menu in 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.670
 Japanese house not in the restaurant 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.950
 but at home every day they have a soup 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.630
 it can be a miso soup has a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.890
 salads and also has a dish 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.050
 as very normal to have meat or 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.819
 fish I have for example here a 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.509
 very usual dish of Japanese cuisine 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:33.119
 homemade is called cacho don has rice 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.900
 little egg that they cast as raw 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.450
 like a soy sauce sauce 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.830
 man is fine is a little dish that has 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.800
 a little bit of everything has carbohydrates

 sushi that's fine with me and that 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.360
 they take it but especially in the 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.640
 restaurant who at home are like 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.590
