this white car release tell it on camera
but<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.430> does<00:03:35.579> have<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.820> on<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.030> lie<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.959> looks

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
but it does have it on the lie so looks

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.840 
but it does have it on the lie so looks
very<00:03:37.440> very<00:03:37.530> nice<00:03:37.739> there<00:03:38.010> although<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.700> can

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850

here<00:03:46.739> which<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.370> kind<00:03:47.579> of<00:03:47.610> messy<00:03:47.790> actually

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
here which is kind of messy actually

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.840 
here which is kind of messy actually
looks<00:03:48.420> kind<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.870> bit<00:03:49.049> messy<00:03:49.350> there<00:03:49.560> but<00:03:50.130> yeah

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
looks kind of a bit messy there but yeah

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.160 
looks kind of a bit messy there but yeah

and you do have this nice big grill
under<00:03:52.320> that<00:03:52.410> which<00:03:52.530> looks<00:03:52.650> very<00:03:52.920> nice<00:03:53.070> has<00:03:53.610> a

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
under that which looks very nice has a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.100 
under that which looks very nice has a
nice<00:03:53.880> texture<00:03:54.329> filter<00:03:54.660> as<00:03:54.780> well<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.049> that's

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
nice texture filter as well so that's

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.750 
nice texture filter as well so that's
very<00:03:55.320> cool<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:55.769> obviously<00:03:56.250> got<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.640> two

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
very cool and obviously got the two

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.250 
very cool and obviously got the two
exhausts<00:03:57.239> underneath<00:03:57.720> there<00:03:57.900> as<00:03:57.959> well<00:03:58.110> and

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
exhausts underneath there as well and

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.990 
exhausts underneath there as well and
the<00:03:58.380> number<00:03:59.100> plate<00:03:59.280> which<00:03:59.430> looks<00:03:59.610> very<00:03:59.670> close

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
the number plate which looks very close

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.569 
the number plate which looks very close
well<00:04:00.350> an<00:04:01.350> engine<00:04:01.680> cover<00:04:01.890> as<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.340> can<00:04:02.459> see

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
well an engine cover as you can see

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.210 
well an engine cover as you can see
looks<00:04:03.150> very<00:04:03.390> cool<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.780> does<00:04:04.200> open<00:04:04.470> up<00:04:04.560> pretty

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
looks very cool and does open up pretty

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.630 
looks very cool and does open up pretty
cool

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
cool

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.539 
cool
and<00:04:06.079> it<00:04:07.079> comes<00:04:07.230> up<00:04:07.350> about<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.709> far<00:04:07.950> but<00:04:08.489> it

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
and it comes up about that far but it

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.280 
and it comes up about that far but it
does<00:04:08.880> come<00:04:09.090> up<00:04:09.120> higher<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.660> mean<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:09.930> can<00:04:10.140> go

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
does come up higher I mean you can go

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.410 
does come up higher I mean you can go
further<00:04:10.530> but<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:11.130> suppose<00:04:11.430> that's<00:04:11.579> about<00:04:11.880> as

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
further but I suppose that's about as

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.910 
further but I suppose that's about as
far<00:04:12.660> as<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:12.870> can<00:04:12.959> go<00:04:13.109> without<00:04:13.320> for<00:04:13.590> snip

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
far as you can go without for snip

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.400 
far as you can go without for snip
because<00:04:14.160> if<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.400> force<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:15.570> could<00:04:15.989> go<00:04:16.140> out

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
because if you force it it could go out

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.990 
because if you force it it could go out
right<00:04:16.680> angle<00:04:17.070> but<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.280> wouldn't<00:04:17.579> do<00:04:17.669> that<00:04:17.700> if<00:04:17.850> I

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
right angle but I wouldn't do that if I

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.460 
right angle but I wouldn't do that if I
was<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.150> because<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:18.840> did<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.079> once<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.350> it

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
was you because I did that once and it

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.840 
was you because I did that once and it
sounded<00:04:19.709> like<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:19.859> broke<00:04:20.250> something

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
sounded like it broke something

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.300 
sounded like it broke something
so<00:04:21.180> a1<00:04:21.419> going<00:04:21.780> any<00:04:21.900> further<00:04:22.109> than<00:04:22.349> this<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:23.099> if

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
so a1 going any further than this so if

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.370 
so a1 going any further than this so if
it<00:04:23.430> starts<00:04:23.729> getting<00:04:24.599> a<00:04:24.630> bit<00:04:24.780> stiffer<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.260> would

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
it starts getting a bit stiffer I would

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.400 
it starts getting a bit stiffer I would
stop<00:04:25.620> because<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.919> could

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
stop because it could

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.830 
stop because it could
so<00:04:27.010> that's<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.730> pass<00:04:27.940> off<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.270> can<00:04:28.450> go<00:04:28.570> without

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
so that's a pass off I can go without

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.450 
so that's a pass off I can go without

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
being forced so it's pretty pretty

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.300 
being forced so it's pretty pretty
decent<00:04:30.850> that's<00:04:31.540> pretty<00:04:31.810> good<00:04:32.010> take<00:04:33.010> a<00:04:33.040> look<00:04:33.250> at
