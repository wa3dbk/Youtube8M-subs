bit<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.330> overhead<00:01:13.549> now<00:01:14.549> when<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.790> install<00:01:15.119> CGI

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
bit of overhead now when you install CGI

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.719 
bit of overhead now when you install CGI
you<00:01:15.930> still<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.530> behavior<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.580> well

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
you still get this behavior but as well

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.640

multiple requests performance is then

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.450
