00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
quit my paper route so what did it

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.290 
quit my paper route so what did it
doesn't<00:00:23.279> matter<00:00:23.460> half<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.910> time<00:00:24.060> he<00:00:24.150> just

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
doesn't matter half the time he just

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.470 
doesn't matter half the time he just
ends<00:00:24.539> up<00:00:24.600> playing<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.990> box

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480

paper postulating the existence of a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.980 
paper postulating the existence of a
subatomic<00:01:31.550> particle<00:01:31.970> called<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.899> Higgs

subatomic particle called the Higgs

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.919 
subatomic particle called the Higgs
boson<00:01:33.470> now<00:01:34.060> initially<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.420> paper<00:01:35.660> was

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
boson now initially the paper was

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.469 
boson now initially the paper was
rejected<00:01:36.560> but<00:01:36.890> recently<00:01:37.490> he<00:01:37.910> was<00:01:38.060> proven

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
rejected but recently he was proven

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.630 
rejected but recently he was proven
right<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:39.020> now<00:01:39.380> he's<00:01:39.619> on<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.800> fast<00:01:40.069> track<00:01:40.280> to

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
right and now he's on the fast track to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.999 
right and now he's on the fast track to
win<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.759> Nobel<00:01:41.119> Prize<00:01:41.410> yeah<00:01:42.410> that's<00:01:42.860> basically

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
win a Nobel Prize yeah that's basically

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.279 
win a Nobel Prize yeah that's basically
what<00:01:43.459> I<00:01:43.490> said<00:01:43.759> yeah<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:46.220> point<00:01:46.610> is<00:01:46.970> Higgs<00:01:47.959> is

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
what I said yeah the point is Higgs is

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.350 
what I said yeah the point is Higgs is
being<00:01:48.500> celebrated<00:01:48.800> for<00:01:49.250> work<00:01:49.580> he<00:01:49.759> did<00:01:49.940> fifty

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
being celebrated for work he did fifty

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.090 
being celebrated for work he did fifty
years<00:01:50.600> ago<00:01:50.959> so<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.380> got<00:01:51.709> me<00:01:51.890> thinking

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
years ago so that got me thinking

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.430 
years ago so that got me thinking
perhaps<00:01:52.940> I've<00:01:53.330> already<00:01:53.750> hit<00:01:53.990> upon<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.410> idea

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
perhaps I've already hit upon the idea

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.520 
perhaps I've already hit upon the idea
that<00:01:55.009> will<00:01:55.160> win<00:01:55.310> me<00:01:55.490> my<00:01:55.700> Nobel<00:01:56.060> Prize<00:01:56.420> I<00:01:56.899> didn't

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
that will win me my Nobel Prize I didn't

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.169 
that will win me my Nobel Prize I didn't
know<00:01:57.590> they<00:01:57.740> gave<00:01:57.950> Nobel<00:01:58.369> prizes<00:01:58.759> for<00:01:58.910> making

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
know they gave Nobel prizes for making

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.539 
know they gave Nobel prizes for making
boom<00:01:59.390> boom<00:01:59.569> into<00:01:59.840> potty

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.609 

you<00:02:03.539> really<00:02:03.780> think<00:02:04.020> there's<00:02:04.170> some<00:02:04.350> kind<00:02:04.530> of

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
you really think there's some kind of

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.190 
you really think there's some kind of
scientific<00:02:05.250> discovery<00:02:05.789> in<00:02:05.969> here<00:02:06.210> well<00:02:06.719> this

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
scientific discovery in here well this

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.960 
scientific discovery in here well this
box<00:02:07.409> only<00:02:07.619> covers<00:02:08.009> my<00:02:08.160> work<00:02:08.310> through<00:02:08.550> nursery

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
box only covers my work through nursery

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.669 
box only covers my work through nursery
school<00:02:09.269> there's<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> good<00:02:09.959> deal<00:02:10.080> more<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.379> come

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
school there's a good deal more to come

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.070 
school there's a good deal more to come
I<00:02:10.979> didn't<00:02:11.550> really<00:02:11.849> hit<00:02:12.090> my<00:02:12.239> academic<00:02:12.750> stride

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
I didn't really hit my academic stride

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.199 
I didn't really hit my academic stride
until<00:02:13.769> I<00:02:13.800> cut<00:02:14.069> out<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.310> time<00:02:14.550> suck<00:02:14.910> known<00:02:15.090> as

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
until I cut out that time suck known as

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.470 
until I cut out that time suck known as
playing<00:02:15.450> outdoors<00:02:17.180> they're<00:02:18.180> gonna<00:02:18.269> spend

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
playing outdoors they're gonna spend

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.119 
playing outdoors they're gonna spend
