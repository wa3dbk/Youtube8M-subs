how to make a reductive lynal print demo
-<00:00:08.090> okay<00:00:09.090> here's<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.570> design<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:10.110> I'm<00:00:10.230> going

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
- okay here's the design that I'm going

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.839 
- okay here's the design that I'm going
to<00:00:10.469> make<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.070> can<00:00:11.219> see<00:00:11.370> I'm<00:00:11.460> going<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.730> use

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
to make and you can see I'm going to use

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.789 
to make and you can see I'm going to use
about<00:00:11.940> three<00:00:12.330> or<00:00:12.420> four<00:00:12.660> colors<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.559> first

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
about three or four colors and the first

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.490 
about three or four colors and the first
thing<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.040> want<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> do<00:00:14.549> now<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.780> trace<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
thing I want to do now is to trace the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.160 
thing I want to do now is to trace the
outline<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.160> design<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.900> don't<00:00:19.050> need

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
outline of the design and you don't need

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.660 
outline of the design and you don't need
to<00:00:19.289> color<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.710> just<00:00:20.010> get<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.279> simple

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
to color it in just get the simple

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.880 
to color it in just get the simple
outline<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.900> different<00:00:22.380> shapes<00:00:22.650> and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
outline of the different shapes and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.609 
outline of the different shapes and
sections<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.750> I'm<00:00:24.750> going<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.050> transfer<00:00:25.500> this

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
sections and I'm going to transfer this

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.620 
sections and I'm going to transfer this
onto<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.130> line<00:00:26.490> Oleum<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.480> I'm

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
onto the line Oleum and to do that I'm

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.169 
onto the line Oleum and to do that I'm
going<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> use<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.080> 6b<00:00:28.769> pencil<00:00:29.010> or<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.550> 2b<00:00:29.970> would

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
going to use a 6b pencil or a 2b would

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.299 
going to use a 6b pencil or a 2b would
even<00:00:30.420> work<00:00:30.570> too<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.109> I'm<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.769> cover<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
even work too and I'm going to cover the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.970 
even work too and I'm going to cover the
one<00:00:32.820> side<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.960> then<00:00:34.590> I'm<00:00:34.710> going<00:00:34.890> to

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
one side like this and then I'm going to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.420 
one side like this and then I'm going to
lie<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.489> pencil<00:00:36.239> side<00:00:36.540> face<00:00:37.410> down<00:00:37.739> onto<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
lie this pencil side face down onto the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.110 
lie this pencil side face down onto the
line<00:00:38.640> oh<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:40.160> then<00:00:41.160> I'm<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.550> trace<00:00:41.879> over

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
line oh and then I'm going to trace over

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.670 
line oh and then I'm going to trace over
the<00:00:42.270> line<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.930> some<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> lead

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the line so that some of the lead

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.619 
the line so that some of the lead
transfers<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.200> linoleum<00:00:47.270> you<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.420> see

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
transfers on to the linoleum you can see

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.029 
transfers on to the linoleum you can see
when<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:48.930> finished<00:00:49.289> it'll<00:00:49.440> kind<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.829> look

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
when it's finished it'll kind of look

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.959 
when it's finished it'll kind of look
something<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.399> this

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
something like this

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.299 
something like this
and<00:00:51.570> what<00:00:51.989> I'll<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.289> then<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> next<00:00:53.100> phase

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and what I'll do then for the next phase

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.720 
and what I'll do then for the next phase
is<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.600> I'll<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:55.530> outline<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.160> with<00:00:56.309> marker

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
is and I'll just outline it with marker

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.599 
is and I'll just outline it with marker
so<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:56.969> as<00:00:57.270> I'm<00:00:57.539> washing<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.430> will<00:00:59.430> not

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
so that as I'm washing it I will not

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.170 
so that as I'm washing it I will not
lose<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.149> design<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.760> what<00:01:02.760> I'll<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:02.969> now<00:01:03.149> is

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
lose the design and what I'll do now is

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.030 
lose the design and what I'll do now is
just<00:01:03.539> carve<00:01:03.780> out<00:01:03.930> all<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.290> sections<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.860> I

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
just carve out all the sections that I

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.160 
just carve out all the sections that I
want<00:01:05.400> white<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.090> from<00:01:06.330> my<00:01:06.479> design<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.840> had

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
want white and from my design I had

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:42.139 
want white and from my design I had
quite<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> bit<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.490> will<00:01:08.610> take<00:01:08.760> some<00:01:08.939> time

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.359 

so<00:01:43.149> all<00:01:43.359> this<00:01:43.509> gray<00:01:43.810> area<00:01:44.259> you<00:01:44.289> see<00:01:44.709> is<00:01:45.039> going

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
so all this gray area you see is going

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.339 
so all this gray area you see is going
to<00:01:45.700> be<00:01:45.849> white<00:01:46.209> because<00:01:46.479> it's<00:01:46.780> not<00:01:46.959> making

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349 
to be white because it's not making

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:50.219 
to be white because it's not making
contact<00:01:47.920> with<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.159> ink<00:01:48.549> or<00:01:48.849> my<00:01:49.149> paper<00:01:49.539> hence

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
contact with the ink or my paper hence

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.219 
contact with the ink or my paper hence
the<00:01:50.500> title<00:01:50.709> reductive<00:01:51.429> print<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:52.030> I<00:01:52.899> got<00:01:53.079> my

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
the title reductive print and I got my

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.130 
the title reductive print and I got my
first<00:01:53.469> layer<00:01:53.799> of<00:01:53.829> color<00:01:54.280> here<00:01:54.759> and<00:01:55.270> I'm<00:01:55.989> just

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
first layer of color here and I'm just

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.940 
first layer of color here and I'm just
going<00:01:56.289> to<00:01:56.409> lie<00:01:56.739> it<00:01:56.799> down<00:01:57.069> onto<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.209> paper

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
going to lie it down onto the paper

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.639 
going to lie it down onto the paper
gently<00:01:59.950> press<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.959> turn<00:02:01.959> it<00:02:02.079> over<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:02.439> I'm

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
gently press and turn it over and I'm

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.589 
gently press and turn it over and I'm
going<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:02.950> rub<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.640> like<00:02:03.969> this<00:02:04.209> and<00:02:04.420> make<00:02:04.569> sure

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
going to rub it like this and make sure

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.119 
going to rub it like this and make sure
I<00:02:04.780> get<00:02:04.899> all<00:02:05.170> around<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.530> corners<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:05.950> edges

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.129 
I get all around the corners and edges

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:10.740 
I get all around the corners and edges
and<00:02:06.969> feel<00:02:07.719> free<00:02:08.019> to<00:02:08.049> use<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.560> ruler<00:02:09.269> as<00:02:10.269> a<00:02:10.329> brayer

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
and feel free to use a ruler as a brayer

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.710 
and feel free to use a ruler as a brayer
just<00:02:11.319> to<00:02:11.530> make<00:02:11.680> sure<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.129> you<00:02:12.310> push<00:02:12.579> the<00:02:13.180> ink

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
just to make sure that you push the ink

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.550 
just to make sure that you push the ink
onto<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.560> paper<00:02:14.650> well<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.519> I<00:02:15.670> peel<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.120> off

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
onto the paper well and I peel it off

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.780 
onto the paper well and I peel it off
and<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.590> can<00:02:17.829> see<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.129> looks<00:02:18.340> something<00:02:18.609> like

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
and you can see it looks something like

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.370 
and you can see it looks something like
this<00:02:19.359> and<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:20.769> will<00:02:20.950> work<00:02:21.129> about<00:02:21.870> 4-5<00:02:22.870> prints

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
this and this will work about 4-5 prints

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.470 
this and this will work about 4-5 prints
and<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.799> course<00:02:24.040> with<00:02:24.220> each<00:02:24.430> additional<00:02:25.150> print

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
and of course with each additional print

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.879 
and of course with each additional print
that<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.690> make<00:02:26.049> you<00:02:26.319> should<00:02:26.590> rethink

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:26.889 
that you make you should rethink
