Dragon Ball he kicked so much ass he

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.030 
Dragon Ball he kicked so much ass he
like<00:01:23.340> killed<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.850> many<00:01:23.880> people<00:01:24.590> like<00:01:25.590> villains

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
like killed so many people like villains

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.950 
like killed so many people like villains
and<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.880> Z<00:01:27.119> he<00:01:27.270> didn't<00:01:27.540> actually<00:01:27.689> really

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and like and Z he didn't actually really

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.999 
and like and Z he didn't actually really
do<00:01:28.200> much<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:30.079> was<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.290> actually<00:01:31.590> kind

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
do much of that was just actually kind

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.890 
do much of that was just actually kind
of<00:01:32.040> good<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.280> guess<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:32.939> other<00:01:33.329> people<00:01:33.780> will

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
of good I guess to see other people will

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.109 
of good I guess to see other people will
defeat<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.350> villains<00:01:34.650> instead<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.790> GT

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
defeat the villains instead but in GT

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.399 
defeat the villains instead but in GT
you<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.360> he<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:36.659> one<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.990> beat<00:01:37.140> everything

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you know he was one to beat everything

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.810 
you know he was one to beat everything
that<00:01:37.710> was<00:01:37.799> kind<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.100> dragon<00:01:38.430> ball<00:01:38.549> over

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that was kind of like dragon ball over

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.539 
that was kind of like dragon ball over
again<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.299> anyway<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.680> funny<00:01:40.920> fact<00:01:41.220> um

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
again but anyway just a funny fact um

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.539 
again but anyway just a funny fact um
that<00:01:42.450> Goku<00:01:43.110> actually<00:01:43.740> didn't<00:01:44.009> kill<00:01:44.189> many<00:01:44.430> of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
that Goku actually didn't kill many of

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.429 
that Goku actually didn't kill many of
the<00:01:44.640> villains<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.689> anyway<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.140> looks<00:01:46.320> like

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the villains but anyway it looks like

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.700

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.469 
this would you know that I have in the
package<00:01:52.890> isn't<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> best<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.759> condition

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
package isn't the best like condition

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.420 
package isn't the best like condition
actually<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.439> very<00:01:55.470> old<00:01:55.829> figure<00:01:56.189> I've<00:01:56.310> had

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430

actually it's a very old figure I've had
it<00:01:56.549> themselves<00:01:56.670> like<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> kid<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.170> kind<00:01:58.469> of

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
it themselves like a kid so it's kind of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.139 
it themselves like a kid so it's kind of
shitty<00:01:58.710> condition<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.430> might<00:01:59.700> as<00:01:59.790> well<00:01:59.939> just

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149
