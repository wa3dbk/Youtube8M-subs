00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.730
 and what's up everybody talks to them mark mex 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.559
 and some guys then welcome to a 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.299
 new tricks and secrets this time 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.339
 on the magma map that actually 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.440
 I should call lava because lava is 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.850
 that is outside the volcano and magma what 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.220
 which is inside the volcano so good 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.560
 to leave us with nonsense, we're going to 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.260
 start with the first trick that is here 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.150
 on the flag of c 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.450
 we run and there is a car that justly 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.700
 we went up on him not down and 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.040
 we jump to this little place and it 's a 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.200
 place super super super strategic 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.180
 Super defensive enemies never 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.150
 they will expect that we are there is that a 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.129
 boy then we went with another 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.739
 let's say jump that basically is to try 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.449
 these rocks and we put them on top of this 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.430
 small truck we see that if we 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.629
 We try to climb from below because no 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.550
 we can so the only way 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.430
 basically surround climbing on the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.860
 rocks and jump to the truck that this we 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.570
 will provide a super complete vision 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.030
 from this part of the map the enemies that 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.680
 they will also imagine what they are 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.300
 there and good as a curious fact if we 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.210
 we approach these rocks too much we are going to 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.150
 die charred like that with guys now 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.190
 people with another let's say secret and it's 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.409
 basically because people never missing 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.210
 that is going to be put here in this window to 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.729
 change because good is a place where 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.070
 It has a lot of visibility in the middle of 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.810
 map so good then this ideal place 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.340
 of the campers on this map so 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.799
 good how can we fight this 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.650
 basically if we come from the flag of 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.990
 to the first thing you can destroy this truck 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.660
 and we got on the little bicycle 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.820
 that is out there and well let's notice that the 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.770
 bullets do not bounce off the truck but they 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.600
 they're going to go straight and we can kill 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.730
 the champions that are in there the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.490
 it's really a super super place 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.360
 strategic but good here we are in 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.910
 middle of the map 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.520
 and well we jump we can go to that 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.650
 as a kind of barrier or a small 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.160
 barandal out there and good from 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.790
 here we can kill the champions 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.230
 basically to those who are 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.300
 shoot the campers are in the 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.040
 unfortunately we can not 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.470
 come back so it's best to put in the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.000
 tactical insertion and if at all a shield 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.070
 behind us so they do not kill us 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.050
 back and see guys now for 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.209
 locate it we are in the fertilizer flag 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.550
 close and it's basically going away with a lot 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.860
 careful around here we jump that little 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.510
 to that little green that is out there 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.070
 we fall and we see that we do not stay 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.440
 lava previously there was a glitch that 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.690
 if we stay in the lava in this place 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.310
 say that the map was started and we 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.930
 it appeared below the map but as 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.310
 we can see it's not like that so good 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.230
 guys this basically all for 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.150
 comment vote the video I'm brand in 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.959
 mex and see you in the next video 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.959
 goodbye
