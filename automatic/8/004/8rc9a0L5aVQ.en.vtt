00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
what is this I think the drones are here

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.439 
what is this I think the drones are here
I<00:00:20.720> agree<00:00:21.720> certainly<00:00:22.230> at<00:00:22.320> CES<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:23.160> the

I agree certainly at CES this is the

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.200 
I agree certainly at CES this is the
unique<00:00:24.449> h<00:00:24.779> 9<00:00:25.140> 20<00:00:25.650> which<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> professional<00:00:27.060> or

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
unique h 9 20 which is a professional or

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.450 
unique h 9 20 which is a professional or
commercial<00:00:27.689> grade<00:00:27.900> drone<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.859> see<00:00:29.099> it's<00:00:29.279> got

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
commercial grade drone you see it's got

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.669 
commercial grade drone you see it's got
six<00:00:29.760> rotors<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> event<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.439> one

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
six rotors so in the event that one

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.680 
six rotors so in the event that one
rotor<00:00:31.890> fails<00:00:32.279> your<00:00:32.730> camera<00:00:33.090> will<00:00:33.239> still<00:00:33.480> come

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
rotor fails your camera will still come

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.760 
rotor fails your camera will still come
home<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.829> has<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.510> ground<00:00:36.510> station<00:00:36.780> yeah<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.680> you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
home it has a ground station yeah if you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.830 
home it has a ground station yeah if you
will<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:37.980> has<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> digital<00:00:39.030> video<00:00:39.120> link<00:00:39.540> so

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
will that has a digital video link so

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.220 
will that has a digital video link so
that<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.540> digital<00:00:42.540> video<00:00:42.809> on

that you can see the digital video on

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.290 
that you can see the digital video on
your<00:00:43.500> screen<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.280> not<00:00:44.430> analog<00:00:45.180> video

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
your screen so it's not analog video

your screen so it's not analog video
it's<00:00:45.570> actually<00:00:45.809> digital<00:00:46.230> video<00:00:46.469> which<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.920> a

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
it's actually digital video which is a

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.619 
it's actually digital video which is a
point<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.340> difference<00:00:47.460> with<00:00:47.850> many<00:00:48.450> other

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
point of difference with many other

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.950 
point of difference with many other
products<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> market<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.660> drone<00:00:51.660> also

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
products in the market the drone also

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.990 
products in the market the drone also
comes<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.500> gimbal<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> gimbal<00:00:53.670> for

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
comes with a gimbal this is a gimbal for

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.139 
comes with a gimbal this is a gimbal for
a<00:00:54.030> sony<00:00:54.270> 4k<00:00:55.170> camera<00:00:55.739> there<00:00:56.550> are<00:00:56.640> other<00:00:56.730> gimbals

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
a sony 4k camera there are other gimbals

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.410 
a sony 4k camera there are other gimbals
available<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> h<00:00:58.710> 9<00:00:58.949> 20<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.820> got<00:01:00.149> some

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
available for the h 9 20 it's got some

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
available for the h 9 20 it's got some
unique<00:01:00.660> features<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.379> its<00:01:01.530> dual<00:01:01.770> operator

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
unique features one is its dual operator

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.640 
unique features one is its dual operator
so<00:01:02.670> someone<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.480> fly<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> drone<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> same

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
so someone can fly the drone at the same

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.530 
so someone can fly the drone at the same
time<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> cameraman<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> DP<00:01:06.299> is

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
time that the cameraman of the DP is

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.960 
time that the cameraman of the DP is
actually<00:01:07.409> controlling<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.220> shot<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
actually controlling the shot this is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.370 
actually controlling the shot this is
very<00:01:09.420> very<00:01:09.479> important<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.960> think<00:01:10.140> that's<00:01:10.260> got

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
very very important I think that's got

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.200 
very very important I think that's got
an<00:01:10.470> important<00:01:10.890> yeah<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.040> try<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.580> multitask

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
an important yeah I try to multitask

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.730 
an important yeah I try to multitask
when<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.570> trying<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> get<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> good<00:01:13.170> shot<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
keep this thing up in the air that would

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.539 
keep this thing up in the air that would
be<00:01:15.390> kind<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.600> hard<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.860> said<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.400> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
be kind of hard so now you said this is

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.800 
be kind of hard so now you said this is
like<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> commercial<00:01:18.270> drone<00:01:18.450> what<00:01:18.630> kind<00:01:18.780> of

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
like a commercial drone what kind of

cinematographers<00:01:27.150> we're<00:01:27.360> also<00:01:27.479> seeing<00:01:27.780> other

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
cinematographers we're also seeing other

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.960 
cinematographers we're also seeing other
companies<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.250> specialize<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.820> the

commercial<00:01:30.360> market<00:01:30.720> buying<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> drone<00:01:31.890> so

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
commercial market buying the drone so

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.740 
commercial market buying the drone so
they<00:01:32.549> might<00:01:32.729> take<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.390> they<00:01:33.450> might<00:01:33.630> add

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
they might take this and they might add

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.230 
they might take this and they might add
a<00:01:33.780> sensor<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.409> example<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.340> agriculture<00:01:36.030> or

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
a sensor for example for agriculture or

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.030 
a sensor for example for agriculture or
they<00:01:36.420> might<00:01:36.600> take<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.110> at<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> thermal<00:01:37.680> sensor

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
they might take it at a thermal sensor

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.460 
they might take it at a thermal sensor
for<00:01:38.310> security<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.320> something<00:01:40.320> for
