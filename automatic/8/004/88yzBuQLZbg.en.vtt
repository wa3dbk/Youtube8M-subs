00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.400
 then did 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.810
 Amsterdam finished third in the lead with the perpetrator 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.810
 how is that not so the turn 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.230
 President of the system will focus on 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.090
 I'm curious 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.700
 former record complete a few years 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.200
 when and when not we have with him never 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.050
 won 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.559
 Act normal 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.500
 the nineteenth 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.280
 remain true than expected 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.740
 therefore be deleted at bemmel 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.620
 expected to have a few people for that 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.220
 where they went over the years 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.820
 I got him himself afterwards 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.390
 we want to show that 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.260
 the performance has come with footballer the rules are there 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.320
 but at the same time, of course, it is also a very beautiful stage to display 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.730
 that a woman has a strong woman during a maintenance with the beautiful 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.130
 women are daily life 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.140
 it is a too low interest rate 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.090
 it was however 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.410
 I stand saying it myself is the good example we were helping to get the penalty 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.400
 promote that year by 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.670
 valencia 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.370
 i would never have a set janssens the opponent is there you shouldn't go 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.830
 but such things would 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.300
 an internetter 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.440
 it goes too far for me 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.660
 I see them they died quickly in the field on the field 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.280
 they climb and we cannot do that in one go, we will not do that 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.119
 if you look at the games to the success of the world cup final 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.740
 then of course that is going to point enormously in a good way through the markets dim 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.049
 and dnb 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.349
 that is perhaps what is lacking in the club competition was also in the 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.469
 bundesliga it now stands still and that the country was a big blow to the old model 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:16.609
 an extra op 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.959
 and I think that we as the fc twente should play a role in that in order to 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.790
 club football also good to bring attention and so the players that 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:25.999
 FC Twente footballs good to get attention 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:28.999
 in the section 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.849
 now in libya 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.689
 almost never look further ahead 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.539
 he showed 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:53.199
 but there is an explanation to come out of that 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:57.219
 of both soccer players on the podium 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:01.519
 weird part of one of a gigantic spectacle and that moment 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.719
 tonight she's there 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.549
 in the spotlight what a moment your life is thinking of being hit by 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.909
 nature violence it is all going in the right direction
