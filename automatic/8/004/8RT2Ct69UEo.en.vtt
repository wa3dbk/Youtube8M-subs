of product on there I finally realized

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.789 
of product on there I finally realized
it's<00:01:56.909> because<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.600> stays<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.350> well<00:01:58.590> I

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it's because it stays on so well I

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
it's because it stays on so well I

really had to make a point of washing
thoroughly<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.290> get<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.590> off<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.549> order<00:02:02.729> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
light reflective so that means that it's

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.740
