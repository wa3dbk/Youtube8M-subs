we'll<00:03:48.209> pour<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.510> juices<00:03:48.900> on<00:03:49.080> top<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.770> then

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
we'll pour the juices on top and then

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.170 
we'll pour the juices on top and then
we're<00:03:50.130> going<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.280> tamp<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.760> down<00:03:50.820> with<00:03:51.150> our

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
we're going to tamp it down with our

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:00.550 
we're going to tamp it down with our
hand

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.520 

all<00:04:01.560> right<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.890> cabbage<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.519> in<00:04:06.500> goes<00:04:07.500> the

all right the cabbage is in goes the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:14.780 
all right the cabbage is in goes the
juice<00:04:12.680> next<00:04:13.680> we're<00:04:13.920> going<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.220> even<00:04:14.550> out<00:04:14.640> our

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
juice next we're going to even out our

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.430 
juice next we're going to even out our
cabbage<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:16.130> tamp<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.250> down<00:04:18.200> you<00:04:19.200> want<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
cabbage and tamp it down you want the

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:43.800 
cabbage and tamp it down you want the
juices<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.040> cover<00:04:20.489> all<00:04:21.480> of<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:22.230> cabbage

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.360 

now<00:04:44.810> you<00:04:44.870> want<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.199> leave<00:04:45.349> at<00:04:45.590> least<00:04:45.949> four

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
now you want to leave at least four

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.820 
now you want to leave at least four
inches<00:04:46.580> of<00:04:47.030> clearance<00:04:47.389> here<00:04:47.960> because<00:04:48.620> once

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
inches of clearance here because once

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.129 
inches of clearance here because once
the<00:04:49.009> fermentation<00:04:49.370> process<00:04:49.699> starts<00:04:50.569> you<00:04:50.990> will

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
the fermentation process starts you will

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.850 
the fermentation process starts you will
have<00:04:51.380> some<00:04:51.590> juices<00:04:51.979> bubbling<00:04:52.220> up<00:04:53.680> you'll<00:04:54.680> need

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
have some juices bubbling up you'll need

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.450 
have some juices bubbling up you'll need
to<00:04:55.190> food<00:04:55.639> grade<00:04:55.970> plastic<00:04:56.210> bags<00:04:57.009> the<00:04:58.009> first<00:04:58.280> one

to food grade plastic bags the first one

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.159 
to food grade plastic bags the first one
will<00:04:58.580> cover<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:59.090> kraut<00:04:59.389> and<00:04:59.630> act<00:04:59.960> as<00:05:00.139> a

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
will cover the kraut and act as a

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.129 
will cover the kraut and act as a
barrier<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.910> second<00:05:02.330> one<00:05:02.479> we're<00:05:02.810> going<00:05:02.960> to

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
barrier the second one we're going to

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.740 
barrier the second one we're going to
fill<00:05:03.349> with<00:05:03.500> water<00:05:03.819> actually<00:05:04.819> three<00:05:05.419> to<00:05:05.539> four
