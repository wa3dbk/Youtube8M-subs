maybe<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:59.270> month<00:01:00.270> ago<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.129> was

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
maybe a month ago so that was that was

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.680 
maybe a month ago so that was that was
really<00:01:02.489> cool<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> huge<00:01:03.210> milestone

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
really cool that was a huge milestone

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.530 
really cool that was a huge milestone
for<00:01:03.719> us<00:01:04.159> you<00:01:05.159> know<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.580> started<00:01:05.970> doing

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
for us you know when we started doing

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.320 
for us you know when we started doing
this<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.170> think<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.130> back<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.310> 2012<00:01:09.210> it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
this I think it was back in 2012 it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.380 
this I think it was back in 2012 it
wasn't<00:01:09.600> super<00:01:10.200> long<00:01:10.470> though<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.920> don't<00:01:11.159> think

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
wasn't super long though I don't think

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.780 
wasn't super long though I don't think
we<00:01:12.390> would<00:01:12.630> even<00:01:13.290> imagine<00:01:13.530> making<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.250> many<00:01:14.400> as

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
we would even imagine making as many as

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.070 
we would even imagine making as many as
we<00:01:15.030> as<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:17.729> sell<00:01:18.299> out<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.960> was

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
we as we have and to sell out it was

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.740 
we as we have and to sell out it was
just<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.530> tremendous<00:01:19.740> goal<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.390> hit<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
just a tremendous goal that we hit and

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.100

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
these mutants that we've been doing the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.359 
these mutants that we've been doing the
music<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.619> mutant<00:01:25.890> support<00:01:26.250> has<00:01:26.340> been

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
really refinished it it just seems to

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.010 
really refinished it it just seems to
match<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:42.039> blade<00:04:42.280> so<00:04:42.520> well<00:04:42.729> but<00:04:43.659> might<00:04:43.840> it

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
match the blade so well but might it

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.659 
match the blade so well but might it
might<00:04:44.139> have<00:04:44.289> just<00:04:44.409> been<00:04:44.530> left<00:04:44.710> stock<00:04:45.069> honestly

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.200 
might have just been left stock honestly
I'm<00:04:45.759> not<00:04:45.909> I'm<00:04:46.120> not<00:04:46.270> 100%<00:04:46.599> sure<00:04:46.930> but<00:04:48.120> but<00:04:49.120> it

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
I'm not I'm not 100% sure but but it

just<00:04:49.360> kind<00:04:49.689> of<00:04:49.750> goes<00:04:49.870> together<00:04:50.080> real<00:04:50.409> nice<00:04:50.650> and

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
just kind of goes together real nice and

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.209 
just kind of goes together real nice and
I<00:04:52.330> think<00:04:53.319> the<00:04:53.439> thing<00:04:53.590> that<00:04:53.740> people<00:04:53.949> really

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:54.219

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
I think it's titanium because the finish

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.339 
I think it's titanium because the finish
matches<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.080> blade<00:05:05.319> a<00:05:05.349> lot<00:05:05.669> really<00:05:06.669> well

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
matches the blade a lot really well

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.800 
matches the blade a lot really well
pretty<00:05:08.349> much<00:05:08.469> the<00:05:08.590> exact<00:05:08.830> same<00:05:08.860> so<00:05:09.509> he<00:05:10.509> gave<00:05:10.689> it

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
pretty much the exact same so he gave it

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.279 
pretty much the exact same so he gave it
a<00:05:10.900> custom<00:05:11.490> pocket<00:05:12.490> clip<00:05:12.639> and<00:05:13.240> I<00:05:13.779> didn't<00:05:14.050> carry

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
a custom pocket clip and I didn't carry

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.200 
a custom pocket clip and I didn't carry
it<00:05:14.379> a<00:05:14.469> lot<00:05:14.650> but<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:14.919> did<00:05:15.159> put<00:05:15.550> in<00:05:15.669> my<00:05:15.759> pocket<00:05:15.909> in

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
it a lot but I did put in my pocket in

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.420 
it a lot but I did put in my pocket in
it<00:05:16.300> does<00:05:16.840> hold<00:05:17.080> pretty<00:05:17.259> well<00:05:17.500> it's<00:05:18.310> pretty

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
it does hold pretty well it's pretty

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.350 
it does hold pretty well it's pretty
comfortable<00:05:21.599> brushed<00:05:22.710> finish<00:05:23.740> he<00:05:23.889> must<00:05:24.099> have

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
comfortable brushed finish he must have

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.719 
comfortable brushed finish he must have
sanded<00:05:25.360> down<00:05:25.389> the<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:26.770> flats<00:05:27.069> a<00:05:27.279> little<00:05:27.520> bit

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
sanded down the the flats a little bit

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.959 
sanded down the the flats a little bit
because<00:05:28.509> it<00:05:28.659> has<00:05:28.779> like<00:05:29.050> this<00:05:29.229> brushed<00:05:29.969> finish

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
because it has like this brushed finish

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:32.909 
because it has like this brushed finish
to<00:05:31.180> it<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:31.449> then<00:05:31.539> he<00:05:31.629> anodized<00:05:32.080> it<00:05:32.349> a<00:05:32.500> very

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
to it and then he anodized it a very

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.709 
to it and then he anodized it a very
very<00:05:33.219> consistent<00:05:35.099> bluish<00:05:36.099> purple<00:05:36.719> looks

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719 
very consistent bluish purple looks

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.159 
very consistent bluish purple looks
really<00:05:38.050> good<00:05:38.259> I<00:05:38.500> really<00:05:39.460> like<00:05:39.639> the<00:05:40.020> finish<00:05:41.020> a

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
really good I really like the finish a

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.920 
really good I really like the finish a
lot<00:05:43.949> it's<00:05:44.949> it's<00:05:45.250> hard<00:05:46.029> to<00:05:46.180> really<00:05:46.479> fully

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
lot it's it's hard to really fully

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.439 
lot it's it's hard to really fully

the best light to give you an accurate

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.920 
the best light to give you an accurate
color<00:05:56.560> but<00:05:57.520> but<00:05:58.089> it's<00:05:58.240> really<00:05:58.419> cool

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
color but but it's really cool

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.600 
color but but it's really cool
very<00:05:59.469> consistent<00:05:59.860> too<00:06:00.250> and<00:06:02.189> when<00:06:03.189> I<00:06:03.250> first<00:06:03.460> got

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
very consistent too and when I first got

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.339 
very consistent too and when I first got
it<00:06:03.759> the<00:06:03.849> action<00:06:04.150> was<00:06:04.300> a<00:06:04.330> little<00:06:04.629> bit<00:06:04.750> a<00:06:04.960> little

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
it the action was a little bit a little

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:06.839 
it the action was a little bit a little
bit<00:06:05.439> tight<00:06:05.650> sometimes<00:06:05.919> makers<00:06:06.430> send<00:06:06.639> it<00:06:06.729> like

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
bit tight sometimes makers send it like

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.209 
bit tight sometimes makers send it like
that<00:06:07.060> just<00:06:07.319> so<00:06:08.319> it<00:06:08.500> has<00:06:08.650> a<00:06:08.680> little<00:06:08.830> bit<00:06:08.979> of<00:06:09.039> room

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
that just so it has a little bit of room

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.010 
that just so it has a little bit of room
for<00:06:09.250> break-in<00:06:09.759> but<00:06:09.939> I<00:06:10.120> flipped<00:06:10.689> it<00:06:10.810> a<00:06:10.870> little

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
for break-in but I flipped it a little

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.800 
for break-in but I flipped it a little
bit<00:06:11.199> now<00:06:11.409> it's<00:06:11.589> just<00:06:12.120> real<00:06:13.120> flipping<00:06:13.659> real

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
bit now it's just real flipping real

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.920 
bit now it's just real flipping real
smooth<00:06:14.169> and<00:06:14.469> and<00:06:15.279> you<00:06:16.060> notice<00:06:16.360> it's<00:06:16.539> maybe

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
smooth and and you notice it's maybe

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.839 
smooth and and you notice it's maybe
just<00:06:17.139> a<00:06:17.409> hair<00:06:17.620> lighter<00:06:17.949> than<00:06:18.159> the<00:06:18.279> stock<00:06:18.490> model

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
just a hair lighter than the stock model

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:21.149 
just a hair lighter than the stock model
because<00:06:19.120> of<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:19.330> middle<00:06:19.900> work<00:06:20.020> but<00:06:20.860> overall

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159 
because of the middle work but overall

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.279 
because of the middle work but overall
it<00:06:21.610> funk<00:06:21.939> it<00:06:22.089> performs<00:06:22.629> just<00:06:22.719> like<00:06:22.960> a<00:06:22.990> stock

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
it funk it performs just like a stock

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.329 
it funk it performs just like a stock
alpha<00:06:23.740> beasts<00:06:24.069> so<00:06:24.819> this<00:06:25.449> one's<00:06:26.129> going<00:06:27.129> to<00:06:27.159> the
