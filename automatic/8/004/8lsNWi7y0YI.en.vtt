that and I think that he's he's kind of

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.770 
that and I think that he's he's kind of
like<00:01:18.960> opening<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.540> possibility<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.630> there

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
like opening to the possibility of there

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.060 
like opening to the possibility of there
being<00:01:21.810> something<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> future<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:22.950> him

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and Angela yeah so I don't think he has

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.740 
and Angela yeah so I don't think he has
any<00:01:25.350> before<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.830> feel<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.420> he<00:01:27.420> owes<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
any before but I feel like he owes it to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.179 
any before but I feel like he owes it to
Emma<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.530> there's<00:01:28.740> something<00:01:28.950> there
