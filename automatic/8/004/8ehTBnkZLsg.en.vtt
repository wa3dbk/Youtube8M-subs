00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.269
 hello this holiday season is 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.380
 conducive to the wonderful surprise the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.210
 video that I want to share 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.240
 today with you to two goals 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:22.800
 first introduce yourself to a very pretty 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.019
 vintage tug and secondly you 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.230
 ask a question 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.449
 do you know this boat indeed the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.200
 only thing I can tell you from this 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.020
 boat is that this a priori a 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.469
 tug since I discover snags 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.140
 here I do not necessarily recognize the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.410
 cabin 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.899
 I understand that it was manufactured and 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.710
 or in any case marketed by the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.460
 stable establishments that this boat to 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:01.579
 a hardware like inks here 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.339
 present the water gains where the beats 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:10.890
 entirely in brass so that's when 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.930
 even a 13 old kit and on which he 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.710
 there is no indication except 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:22.140
 stable you will notice that the castle 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.950
 functional lights voice so the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.689
 deck lights here now fires 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:35.570
 red port road tribe schedules the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.570
 bridge and Fenoyl projectors 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.509
 the hull is entirely built in 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.509
 edge of the nicknames safe and painted at the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.270
 hand 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.820
 the interior finish is really very 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:59.119
 clean and very original i will you 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:59.119
 present particular the rudder part 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.179
 who herself her parts of the leaves 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.150
 then the boat is empty I myself 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.120
 even having to choose which machine 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:20.670
 put in and so look at you have 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:24.660
 here a brain with a pulley system 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:30.120
 pretty real return pulley here the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.680
 cable not that on the front discreetly 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.110
 to get here 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.640
 the pulley itself set on the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.950
 rudder good tennis we'll change it a 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.120
 other time with here the referrals of 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.860
 cables sent it's still a 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.930
 super neat work 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.810
 the interior is also very neat 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.489
 you have for that contact with the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.290
 superstructure here see if I the 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.350
 raise it's a because the little ones 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.670
 just right here on the left that's me 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.650
 allow with a battery that I have 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.440
 hidden in the front when I put the 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.859
 superstructure it lights up 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.410
 here I have a second take 4.28 which me 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.170
 will undoubtedly help fuel the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.160
 radio when I install all the biniou 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:17.000
 because in fact I can feed everything 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:19.320
 the system with only one to asshole so here 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.820
 the boat is empty it is stolen you the 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.450
 see fringed on chords it was 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.560
 asbestos-lined he is painted he did 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.670
 never worked or any trace 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:34.560
 of oil while I find that the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:37.040
 fireplace was cut I think 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.040
 it was for 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:53.000
 insert the whistle the boat measures 1 m 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:58.069
 30 long and 27 cm wide 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.019
 I will put a back part 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.310
 there you have a second ellis game 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:07.790
 died for the moment so here are the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.790
 pitfalls of always 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.260
 that's okay listen if you know how to tell me 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.669
 what is this boat I will be delighted to 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.139
 can baptize him in his original name 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:24.560
 is in the memory of those who were 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.560
 made at the time goodbye friends
