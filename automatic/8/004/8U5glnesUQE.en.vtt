00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 and I that we are here that mission believe and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.060
 we will bring is the new champion who 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.650
 called aznar and this champion here what 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:15.740
 I'm seeing it's like a big cuckoo milestone 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:18.090
 this champion is a top 9 as is the 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.090
 character itself although it has also 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.350
 another major form that we will see now then 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.870
 in the skills and 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.460
 let's see the animations and those 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.460
 little things no control 1 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.350
 control 2 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.960
 control 3 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.600
 good 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.650
 and that's the laugh come on let's go to that 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.750
 ability to be dances and support 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.600
 worth this champion has two ways the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.120
 mini forms in the form 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.630
 I am the small one and the big one as it says 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.520
 here and the small way has as we see 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.460
 here in the passive wanted this movement 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.560
 Extra 280 of range and 30% speed of 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.280
 attack those statistics are increasing 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.620
 through the level and in the big way 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.770
 has magical resistance augmented life 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.090
 and increased physics life regeneration 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:44.140
 increased and going to base attacks has 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.860
 it has increased the good increase 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.210
 passive also tells us that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.760
 the external bug generates fury when 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.680
 good rage when when in 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.590
 combat when it goes out of combat for being 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.170
 low and when it reaches the maximum 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.340
 we can use a skill to make it 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.860
 transform or transform 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.770
 automatically to the several seconds 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.770
 let's see it let's transform the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.770
 Marines 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.450
 there we use the following skill 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.450
 and it becomes the underbite 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.819
 well let's go to the skills of 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.290
 from this little one and we have the coca is 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.750
 basically a boomerang throw 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.879
 that when it hits something it separates a 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.950
 little bit later and go back 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:36.269
 back if you take the boomerang it reduces a 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.940
 cooling here you have it at 60% what 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.170
 you have and as you can see there is a line that 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.940
 is where the boomerang goes 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.530
 Once you get no simple and easy the w the w 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.580
 basically it's a passive and it says that 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.170
 every third attack 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.170
 does additional damage 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.489
 it also gives movement that decays during 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.230
 three seconds worth what the movement is 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.230
 basically thanks to the ultimate 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.400
 here we see the brands 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.430
 there are 12 I think the one that also applies the 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.480
 mark yes there you have seen it explode 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.190
 important that you can apply the brand 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.140
 in more than one note worth 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.350
 not like 20 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.030
 It is also important to scale up 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.810
 the third blow that is finished to one 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.850
 as for the only thing that we go with what 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.250
 next that is the e 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.450
 jump a location earning 20 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.110
 cent of attack speed during 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.320
 three seconds allotted to one 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.570
 unit will jump on it and fly to another 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.870
 time as if it were more or less the jump 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:50.319
 of sin and now is that of harm 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.500
 and slows down a bit where it has fallen 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.490
 ok that is to say the damage I can not do such 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.480
 that here like this 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.610
 You see that the damage 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.269
 and can be used to go through walls 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.150
 walls in an easy way there you see it 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:10.250
 important that if you jump to the side 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.540
 you will not be able to jump backwards as 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.700
 example you can do with the fish 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.600
 let's check it we jump and as 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.600
 we see although clicking does not obey and 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.350
 jump literally further forward 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.910
 here we see it without sitting on anything 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.710
 and an important fact is that we can 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.150
 jump on Allied subjects 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.910
 there is the time 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.670
 the small end has no ultimate 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.120
 valdÃ©s and let's see the skills of 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.969
 bigger is going to transform 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.459
 automatically if a time passes 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:47.179
 and here we have the cun that crashes 

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:49.720
 against the first thing that sees the w that is a 

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:53.710
 done and the 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:58.000
 it's a stomp here you see what 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:01.180
 has done the q that does that damage and slows down 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.870
 no no says control in chalk w1 with 25 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.120
 seconds and then if you are very close to me 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.110
 is a filmmaker and if not then 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.420
 they simply get hurt 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.780
 well here it's going to transform again 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.500
 much bigger and we're going to see the last one 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.670
 it does not seem to be no 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.620
 everything there has the push that occurs in 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.470
 a wall instead of just being 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.830
 pushed and slowed down not 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.860
 they are slowed down because they would receive more damage 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.350
 50% more damage and would be studied 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.240
 ok now let's see it here we are going to 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.540
 see how the last one pushed you against the 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.540
 wall 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.229
 go like a kid and another little thing that 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.970
 I wanted to mention is that it hurts 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.729
 regarding the maximum life of one's own 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.210
 narwhal in the w is maximum life of the 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.220
 enemy 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.220
 let's see how it will look 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.949
 if it runs differently with the son ones 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.750
 when I know the truth 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:26.370
 do not 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:28.260
 let's see how he dies and I do not know anything weird 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.750
 one thing is that I do not like this 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.669
 champion is that you can not choose when 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.820
 strips the ultimate as for example if 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:39.360
 they go to simply when you take x time 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.860
 hitting when you load that and you're 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.919
 you transform automatically when 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.169
 the top arrives you can not choose 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:48.150
 save it for when you want 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:50.639
 tank or when you focus on to have 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.169
 more life or whatever you can not put 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.360
 I hope you liked your favorite life 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:58.350
 help a lot anything to 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:02.690
 robock imation crane and nothing see you 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.690
 prompt gentlemen to now
