00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 and hello to all friends with you simple and 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.280
 today I will show you another mechanism in 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.290
 the game nk rf on the book of tires this mechanism 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.920
 suited to the name and 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.560
 distributor and dining room so let's 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.199
 let's start shooting this video I don’t know 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.369
 what time i try to take it off taverns 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.580
 or 7 or 8 times u need all the time what 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.619
 prevents all this from going out to 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.820
 normal apologize for strangers 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.950
 sounds if not so well here we are 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.250
 get kai out of that room here 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.440
 we have a bartender with a chest and so 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.590
 further historians are different and here we see 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.809
 here are two tables 1 historians if 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.090
 will restore this block then we will have 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.780
 here is pork then blocks dreams we break 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.180
 then we will have a cow so let's 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.510
 and strictly on pork 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.030
 so let's wait a little 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.250
 video here and our pork fell we can 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.070
 disassemble and all that 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.369
 next let's test the cow block 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.640
 broke and now we wait we wait we wait 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:16.850
 waiting here have tumbled Dashnaks 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.799
 a lot of skin and meat that is very cool 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.850
 here is this thing the mechanism itself can 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:28.979
 give out more and chicken can give out 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.439
 gold feathers and stuff like that i'm not 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.659
 I know about wool but you can 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.060
 try so let 's get down to 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.229
 I myself am building this mechanism 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.390
 he is very cool and one more want you 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.329
 show this one because he 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.490
 really very cool by the way 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.930
 on a simple card that is not on 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.250
 the endless world of an hour here about loading 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.960
 go small here is a very cool set 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.469
 I like him very much because here 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:04.040
 mountains and big forests and does not mean cave 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.550
 like they do not have a simple course as well 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.880
 here 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.120
 here is no method fell but for a start we 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.910
 digging a hole deep enough for 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.700
 order to make our own building 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.770
 have we make a small room can 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.080
 room height 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.480
 absolutely any blocks on here 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.390
 put a table well, if you do not want can 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.890
 just put nothing further 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:37.770
 block absolutely any and now let's 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:39.330
 get out of here and here behind this block 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.900
 but a table for so much 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.580
 here we are on top of one block test then 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.120
 here we set glass 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.030
 and here we are already closing it that is 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.010
 raise 2 blocks like this here we 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.770
 Already, too, can from the closing absolutely 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:02.010
 we don’t need it anymore 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:05.430
 nameplate they're ok i'm 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.840
 already frightened and raising already gives everything 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:13.830
 signs up from here to here 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:20.430
 a small room like this 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:24.209
 so did not want to break it so further this 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.190
 here and here is the start further here 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.790
 absolutely any fat content from the fire 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:34.500
 there will be pigs as these ran out 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:38.720
 uporoty pig went went there so 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.720
 we throw pigs blue 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.940
 a lot of pigs do not need to throw 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.370
 because the device will be very strong 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.810
 lag I want to say in my experience 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.940
 so the volume of the pig I do not need it 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:58.340
 then it will just come out and it will not 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:02.560
 very epic look like that further 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:08.750
 here we can and we quarrel here 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.209
 back to test our mechanism here 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.600
 we go in our room 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:17.330
 break the blog and there falls and gravel on 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.940
 our stronger and here is our meat 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.590
