00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello me go our file with you 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.230
 polish and my dragon friend blood today 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.910
 we will discuss certain workout text 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.380
 roulettes and this is to teach you friends 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.020
 feel the tension in the larger of 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.940
 the bedrooms of whom there is a whim system created 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.590
 so that you can retrain 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.449
 motor patterns and guide 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.910
 voltage where it is necessary because 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.130
 now you send the load to where 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.109
 your body wants the body to always look and be 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.050
 less resistance the case is always looking 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.969
 flying Putin tank b we try to do 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.649
 absolutely the opposite we do 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.690
 as difficult as possible 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.700
 affective maximum we direct 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.450
 load where we need it 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.500
 case in nursing 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.120
 so when we are today 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.550
 train nursing I'll show you how 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.649
 make the most important movements jump off were 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.020
 demonstrate we will show you very 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.059
 slowly and specifically so the first thing 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.250
 need to make people serve bertelli on 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.440
 the shoulders should flatten the shoulder blades 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.920
 tense press tense need to strain 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:11.340
 pectoralis not move only strain we 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.280
 we reduce the shoulder blades to stretch you 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.280
 need to keep tension in them there 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:32.369
 straining it really so easy 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:37.009
 Now a little about 2 on my hands when 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:40.110
 Take care of your back hybrid Badawi on his hands 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.119
 we try to teach his brain and only or 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.090
 nervous system strain the pectoral in 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:55.439
 the first place 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:57.740
 and the first movement on the way back is 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:04.579
 bloom shoulders 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:08.129
 pull back shoulder strains infants 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:11.539
 together the first movement of the union 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.539
 we lower shoulders 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.010
 on enough trying to do the first 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.129
 the movement of shoulder removal they are born 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.530
 elbows why if i leave my shoulders 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:27.030
 bred forward and return the elbow 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.659
 look here my shoulder is taken 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.569
 load 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:33.989
 if i pulled off my shoulders and then released the whole 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.970
 the load went to the chest stock because of this 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.730
 many people have big problems with the press 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.790
 they keep these periods trying to teach 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:51.299
 you harass you first then give up 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:54.000
 move and raise home don't go 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.139
 the program you know that we are watching this 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.109
 part of the market jimmy 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.730
 we lower raise our boats this is not 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:07.440
 movement of the face tension biceps 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:09.870
 will give you no need if I train 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.000
 nursing we need this your task 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.720
 strain working muscles and give them all 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.480
 load 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:22.919
 these trainings need about 60 percent 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:25.019
 from your working weights we start with 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:28.079
 the very bottom and use the teacher this this 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.319
 muscle contraction main program 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:39.590
 calculated population I sometimes do by 6 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:42.900
 weeks depends on how 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.299
 motive pattern and how much time 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.790
 It takes you to learn the exercise 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:51.150
 the more often you repeat the easier it will be 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.590
 for you to do it once a week for yourself 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.879
 remain possible to operate 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.180
 March 23 a week for the program 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.949
 motor patterns will be a problem 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.780
 if pumping less stress on the muscles on 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.790
 much more muscle contractions 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.680
 just with how stress to memorize 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.659
 motor patterns treshki nervous 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.750
 system and brain so you can perform 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.790
 pattern and don't even think about it 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.709
 the results will start coming cat bank 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.709
 training recognizing the primary system 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.599
