00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and make sure it's fat32 if it says fat

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.610 
and make sure it's fat32 if it says fat
and<00:00:47.309> default<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.210> bracket<00:00:48.660> make<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> fat32

and default in bracket make a fat32

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.670 
and default in bracket make a fat32
yourself<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:51.600> restore<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.500> default

just format it okay so it's done
formatting<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.830> now<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:05.220> will<00:01:05.369> need<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.670> open

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
formatting and now we will need to open

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.460 
formatting and now we will need to open
mini<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.810> partition<00:01:07.320> wizard<00:01:09.290> let's<00:01:10.290> go<00:01:10.380> ahead

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
mini to partition wizard let's go ahead

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.630 
mini to partition wizard let's go ahead
and<00:01:10.680> close<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.250> let's<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:12.240> try<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.510> open<00:01:13.640> ok

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
making this is a 4 GB memory card so I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.690 
making this is a 4 GB memory card so I
am<00:01:36.360> making<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.930> 1<00:01:37.259> GB<00:01:39.079> partition<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.700> my

am making a 1 GB partition for my

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.109 
am making a 1 GB partition for my
installation<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> rest<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.939> 2.6<00:01:44.939> 8

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.020 
installation and the rest of the 2.6 8
GB<00:01:45.479> will<00:01:45.720> before<00:01:46.140> my<00:01:46.320> fat32<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.549> let's<00:01:47.729> make<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
GB will before my fat32 so let's make a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.830 
GB will before my fat32 so let's make a
primary<00:01:48.979> fat32<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.640> um<00:01:51.259> let's<00:01:52.259> make<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.590> to

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
primary fat32 and um let's make it to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.050 
primary fat32 and um let's make it to
2.68<00:01:54.840> let's<00:01:55.320> decrease<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.280> size<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:57.079> 2.68

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
2.68 let's decrease the size to 2.68

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.920 
2.68 let's decrease the size to 2.68
like<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.630> okay<00:02:02.329> click<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> second

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
like so and okay click on the second

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.419 
like so and okay click on the second
partition<00:02:04.229> create<00:02:05.030> yes<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.649> just<00:02:07.649> make<00:02:08.310> a

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
partition create yes and just make a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.350 
partition create yes and just make a
primary<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.709> extension<00:02:10.709> for

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
primary and extension for

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.950 
primary and extension for
recommended<00:02:12.020> but<00:02:12.620> extension<00:02:13.190> 3<00:02:13.700> also<00:02:14.600> works

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
recommended but extension 3 also works

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.440 
recommended but extension 3 also works
fine<00:02:15.140> extension<00:02:15.740> 2<00:02:15.890> never<00:02:16.160> tried<00:02:16.520> it<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:17.240> let's

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
fine extension 2 never tried it so let's

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.640 
fine extension 2 never tried it so let's
go<00:02:17.930> with<00:02:18.080> exchanging<00:02:18.680> 4<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.360> ok<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.720> now

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
go with exchanging 4 and ok and now

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.140 
go with exchanging 4 and ok and now
let's<00:02:21.760> apply<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:23.060> yes<00:02:24.730> it's<00:02:25.730> going<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:25.940> take

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
let's apply this yes it's going to take

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.210 
let's apply this yes it's going to take
a<00:02:26.360> couple<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.750> minutes<00:02:26.960> because<00:02:27.710> creating<00:02:28.070> new

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
a couple of minutes because creating new

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.810 
a couple of minutes because creating new
partitions<00:02:28.790> takes<00:02:29.360> time<00:02:29.720> so<00:02:30.710> let's<00:02:31.310> wait<00:02:31.610> for

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
partitions takes time so let's wait for

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.680 
partitions takes time so let's wait for
it<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.180> we'll<00:02:32.510> be<00:02:32.600> done<00:02:32.780> in<00:02:32.840> no<00:02:33.200> time<00:02:33.230> now<00:02:37.690> make

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
it and we'll be done in no time now make

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.390 
it and we'll be done in no time now make
sure<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:39.020> don't<00:02:39.230> cancel<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:39.860> if<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:40.160> gets

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
sure you don't cancel it if it gets

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.750 
sure you don't cancel it if it gets
stuck<00:02:41.000> anywhere<00:02:41.480> do<00:02:41.959> not<00:02:42.200> cancel<00:02:42.860> or<00:02:43.280> just

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
stuck anywhere do not cancel or just

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.870 
stuck anywhere do not cancel or just
power<00:02:44.420> off<00:02:44.630> your<00:02:44.810> laptop<00:02:45.440> or<00:02:45.980> take<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.580> memory

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
power off your laptop or take the memory

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.160 
power off your laptop or take the memory
card<00:02:46.910> out<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.240> your<00:02:47.540> laptop<00:02:47.930> or<00:02:48.050> something

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
card out of your laptop or something

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.490 
card out of your laptop or something
because<00:02:49.160> that<00:02:49.459> will<00:02:49.820> corrupt<00:02:50.510> your<00:02:51.110> memory

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
because that will corrupt your memory

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.930 
because that will corrupt your memory
card<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:51.890> eventually<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.520> will<00:02:52.670> end<00:02:52.850> up

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
card and eventually you will end up

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.770 
card and eventually you will end up
losing<00:02:53.270> it

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
losing it

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:01.210 
losing it
so<00:02:55.510> do<00:02:56.510> not<00:02:56.630> do<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:56.959> thank<00:02:57.709> you<00:02:57.770> and<00:03:00.220> it's

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.339 
much it that's the way how you partition
your<00:03:30.560> memory<00:03:31.099> card<00:03:31.550> for<00:03:32.480> use<00:03:32.690> with<00:03:32.989> data<00:03:33.230> on

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
your memory card for use with data on

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.339 
your memory card for use with data on
extension<00:03:34.099> realms<00:03:34.700> or<00:03:34.819> native<00:03:35.330> SD<00:03:35.750> Rome's
