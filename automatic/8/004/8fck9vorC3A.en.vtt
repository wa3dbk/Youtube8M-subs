show you what has been changed

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.950

texture-wise<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.680> blocks<00:00:19.920> so

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
texture-wise and in the blocks so

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.349 
texture-wise and in the blocks so
essentially<00:00:21.960> they've<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:23.150> changed<00:00:24.150> two

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
essentially they've just changed two

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.009 
essentially they've just changed two
blocks<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:25.109> bricks<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:27.300> cobblestone<00:00:27.810> I

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
blocks the bricks and the cobblestone I

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.060 
blocks the bricks and the cobblestone I
think<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.859> lot<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.250> people<00:00:29.340> say<00:00:29.699> they<00:00:30.060> made

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
think a lot of people say they made

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.620 
think a lot of people say they made
cobblestone<00:00:32.070> darker<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.790> think<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.149> they<00:00:33.329> made

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
cobblestone darker I think it they made

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.260 
cobblestone darker I think it they made
of<00:00:33.809> them<00:00:33.930> might<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.590> made<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> lighter<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.550> it

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
of them might have made a lighter and it

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.709 
of them might have made a lighter and it
looks<00:00:36.420> definitely<00:00:36.899> lighter<00:00:37.110> than<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:38.040> I'm

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
looks definitely lighter than it was I'm

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.440 
looks definitely lighter than it was I'm
and<00:00:39.719> kind<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.620> from<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> distance<00:00:41.700> kinda<00:00:42.239> looks

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
and kind of from a distance kinda looks

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.440 
and kind of from a distance kinda looks
like<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.960> little<00:00:43.829> bit<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.370> rocket<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.030> they

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
like a little bit of rocket as they

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.209 
like a little bit of rocket as they
usually<00:00:45.660> did<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.289> they<00:00:46.680> definitely<00:00:46.920> did

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
usually did but they definitely did

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.709 
usually did but they definitely did
light<00:00:47.430> now<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.640> can't<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.329> they've

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
light now I can't see that they've

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.279 
light now I can't see that they've
darkened<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:50.059> what<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.329> brick<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.260> brick

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
darkened it and what the brick the brick

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.189 
darkened it and what the brick the brick
SIA<00:00:52.800> they<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:54.270> think<00:00:54.570> they've<00:00:54.960> been

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
SIA they have I think they've been

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.020 
SIA they have I think they've been
darkened<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.739> there<00:00:56.370> seems<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.850> more

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
darkened and there seems to be more

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.889 
darkened and there seems to be more
pixels<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.920> grit<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.879> between<00:01:00.210> seems<00:01:00.780> to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
pixels and the grit in between seems to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.460 
pixels and the grit in between seems to
be<00:01:01.020> pink<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:02.000> dark<00:01:03.000> grayish<00:01:03.629> pink<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.170> don't

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
be pink and dark grayish pink I don't

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.109 
be pink and dark grayish pink I don't
know<00:01:04.530> why<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:06.170> that's<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.700> don't<00:01:08.700> know<00:01:08.790> I

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
know why but that's a don't know I

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.420 
know why but that's a don't know I
couldn't<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:09.930> why<00:01:10.770> they<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> change

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
couldn't see why they have to change

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.219 
couldn't see why they have to change
that<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> cobblestone<00:01:12.570> was<00:01:12.810> kind<00:01:13.110> of

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
that one but the cobblestone was kind of

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.330 
that one but the cobblestone was kind of
I<00:01:13.409> didn't<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.090> also<00:01:16.340> they

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
I didn't really like it and also they

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.969 
I didn't really like it and also they
have<00:01:19.159> mossy<00:01:20.159> cobblestone<00:01:20.520> how<00:01:20.880> they<00:01:21.740> now<00:01:22.740> as

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
have mossy cobblestone how they now as

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.590 
have mossy cobblestone how they now as
you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.250> that's<00:01:23.939> what<00:01:24.119> originally

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
you can see that's what originally

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.179 
you can see that's what originally
looked<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.259> see<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.619> black<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
looked like you can see the black the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.950 
looked like you can see the black the
dark<00:01:26.369> bits<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.970> between<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.689> Green<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
dark bits in between the Green and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.050 
dark bits in between the Green and
that's<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:28.950> originally<00:01:29.490> look<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:29.970> they

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that's what originally look like so they

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.289 
that's what originally look like so they
didn't<00:01:30.299> actually<00:01:30.450> change<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.610> Kabul<00:01:32.610> our<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
didn't actually change the Kabul our the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.719 
didn't actually change the Kabul our the
mossy<00:01:33.810> cobblestone<00:01:34.259> they<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.220> changed<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
mossy cobblestone they just changed the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.609 
mossy cobblestone they just changed the
cobblestone<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> definitely<00:01:37.079> did<00:01:37.439> you

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
cobblestone so it it definitely did you

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.800 
cobblestone so it it definitely did you
can<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:37.920> Derek<00:01:38.340> very<00:01:38.909> very<00:01:39.180> dark<00:01:39.390> patches
