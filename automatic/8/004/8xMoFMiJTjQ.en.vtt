medium or coarse one at the end I

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.410 
medium or coarse one at the end I
usually<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.100> eye<00:01:05.129> area<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.300> a

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
usually do the eye area and that's a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.750

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
little bit thinner skin there so I use a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.810 
little bit thinner skin there so I use a
fine<00:01:09.380> finer<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.500> medium<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.159> there<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
fine finer a medium one there and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.510 
fine finer a medium one there and
decrease<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> section<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.900> little<00:01:12.930> bit<00:01:13.520> it's

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
decrease the section a little bit it's

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.440 
decrease the section a little bit it's
got<00:01:14.870> diamonds<00:01:16.070> in<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> wand<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.330> it

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
got diamonds in the wand and then it

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.510 
got diamonds in the wand and then it
also<00:01:18.600> has<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.140> suction<00:01:19.590> component<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.310> you're

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
also has the suction component so you're

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.330 
also has the suction component so you're
kind<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.940> braiding<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:22.290> top<00:01:22.500> layer<00:01:22.740> skin<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
kind of braiding the top layer skin and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.920 
kind of braiding the top layer skin and
then<00:01:23.430> you're<00:01:23.580> sucking<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.120> dead<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.780> dead

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
then you're sucking up the dead the dead

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.899 
then you're sucking up the dead the dead
skin<00:01:25.290> cells<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:26.130> they're<00:01:26.340> not<00:01:26.490> happy<00:01:26.880> with
