00:00:01.742 --> 00:00:05.843
 So it is with great pride that we present 

00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:08.979
 At the camp show, opening with a golden key. 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.073
 Vanessa da Mata and Ben Harper. 

00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:23.790
 Sound, sound, sound, sound. 

00:00:27.886 --> 00:00:30.075
 One two Three go. 

00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:53.617
 That's it, there's no way, it's "Good Luck". 

00:00:53.918 --> 00:01:02.931
 I do not know what to say, it's just words and what I feel will not change. 

00:01:02.984 --> 00:01:10.918
 Everything you want to give me, it's too much, it's heavy, there's no peace. 

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:19.966
 Everything you want from me, unreal, expectations, disloyal. 

00:01:20.028 --> 00:02:06.871
 Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling. 

00:02:06.072 --> 00:02:09.462
 - Falling, falling, falling. - Come on, come on. Falling. 

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:22.071
 Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling. 

00:02:22.072 --> 00:02:30.792
 - For face, for face, for. - Falling, falling, falling. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.453
 - For man, go to, stop. - Falling, falling, falling. 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:50.717
 Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling. 

00:02:50.018 --> 00:03:04.221
 Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling. 

00:03:04.344 --> 00:03:27.812
 Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling. 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.355
 FOR! FOR! LEAVES! LEAVES!
