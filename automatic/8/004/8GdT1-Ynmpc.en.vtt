hello everyone this is a quick tutorial

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.030 
hello everyone this is a quick tutorial
on<00:00:02.520> how<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:03.060> use<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.629> new<00:00:03.810> skin<00:00:04.170> modifier<00:00:04.350> tool

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
on how to use the new skin modifier tool

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.789 
on how to use the new skin modifier tool
which<00:00:05.310> was<00:00:05.430> made<00:00:05.670> by<00:00:05.700> Nicholas<00:00:06.359> Bishop<00:00:06.799> so

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
which was made by Nicholas Bishop so

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.589 
which was made by Nicholas Bishop so
let's<00:00:08.040> get<00:00:08.189> right<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.580> we're<00:00:09.360> going<00:00:09.510> to

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
let's get right to it we're going to

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.370 
let's get right to it we're going to
want<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.960> delete<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.410> main<00:00:10.559> cube<00:00:10.860> here<00:00:12.380> shift

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
want to delete the main cube here shift

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.070 
want to delete the main cube here shift
a<00:00:13.559> add<00:00:13.920> mesh<00:00:14.280> plane

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
a add mesh plane

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.960 
a add mesh plane
well<00:00:16.080> then<00:00:16.260> gonna<00:00:16.440> subdivide<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.130> cube<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
well then gonna subdivide the cube the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.439 
well then gonna subdivide the cube the
plane<00:00:18.740> W<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.010> we're<00:00:20.789> gonna<00:00:20.880> want<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> make<00:00:21.330> it

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
plane W and we're gonna want to make it

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.670 
plane W and we're gonna want to make it
like<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> plus<00:00:21.900> sign<00:00:21.930> shape<00:00:22.410> we're<00:00:22.560> gonna

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
like a plus sign shape we're gonna

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.890 
like a plus sign shape we're gonna
delete<00:00:22.920> these<00:00:23.130> vertices<00:00:23.519> here<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.029> we're

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
delete these vertices here and we're

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.250 
delete these vertices here and we're
gonna<00:00:24.960> add<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.439> mirror<00:00:25.710> modifier<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:27.080> then<00:00:28.080> we

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
gonna add a mirror modifier and then we

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.890 
gonna add a mirror modifier and then we
will<00:00:28.410> add<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.920> skin<00:00:29.490> modifier<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.150> there<00:00:30.810> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
will add the skin modifier and there you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.200 
will add the skin modifier and there you
go<00:00:31.109> as<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:31.980> see<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.430> generates<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:33.000> mesh

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
go as you can see it generates a mesh

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.020 
go as you can see it generates a mesh
around<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.660> vertices<00:00:34.399> it's<00:00:35.399> similar<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.850> how

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
around the vertices it's similar to how

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.260 
around the vertices it's similar to how
these<00:00:36.540> spheres<00:00:36.840> work<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.649> guess<00:00:38.059> to<00:00:39.059> make<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
these spheres work I guess to make it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.610 
these spheres work I guess to make it
look<00:00:39.390> more<00:00:39.420> organic<00:00:39.960> we're<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.320> gonna<00:00:40.410> add<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
look more organic we're just gonna add a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.180 
look more organic we're just gonna add a
subsurf<00:00:41.250> modifier<00:00:41.600> there<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:42.690> go<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.190> that's

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
subsurf modifier there we go and that's

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.660 
subsurf modifier there we go and that's
about<00:00:44.399> it

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
about it

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.330 
about it
now<00:00:45.629> we're<00:00:45.780> gonna<00:00:45.890> wave<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:46.980> where<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.250> is

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
now we're gonna wave this where it is

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.639 
now we're gonna wave this where it is
that<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.090> select<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.450> root<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.960> vertex

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that you have to select a root a vertex

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.049 
that you have to select a root a vertex
root<00:00:49.950> from<00:00:50.219> which<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.610> whole<00:00:50.760> mesh<00:00:50.940> is

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
root from which the whole mesh is

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.119 
root from which the whole mesh is
generated<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.980> hip

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
generated from this is like the hip

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.549 
generated from this is like the hip
joint<00:00:53.399> main<00:00:53.940> pivot<00:00:54.809> point<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.260> your<00:00:55.379> whole

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
joint main pivot point of your whole

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.740 
joint main pivot point of your whole
mesh<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.520> we're<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.699> gonna<00:00:56.910> set<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
mesh so we're just gonna set this as the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.250 
mesh so we're just gonna set this as the
hip<00:00:57.989> point<00:00:58.289> root<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.910> that's<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.079> now<00:01:01.199> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
hip point root and that's it and now you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.720 
hip point root and that's it and now you
can<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.530> start<00:01:01.710> extruding<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.399> do<00:01:02.550> whatever

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
can just start extruding and do whatever

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.820 
can just start extruding and do whatever
you<00:01:02.910> want<00:01:03.030> I'm<00:01:03.420> doing<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.780> very<00:01:03.930> simple<00:01:04.260> next

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you want I'm doing a very simple next

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.980 
you want I'm doing a very simple next
don't<00:01:05.119> resume<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.420> I'm<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.600> making<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.869> very

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
don't resume so I'm just making a very

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.050 
don't resume so I'm just making a very
simple<00:01:07.409> silhouette<00:01:07.950> bird<00:01:08.700> silhouette<00:01:11.060> what

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
simple silhouette bird silhouette what

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.140 
simple silhouette bird silhouette what
you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.570> also<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.920> there's<00:01:14.700> branch

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
you can do also is that there's branch

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.300 
you can do also is that there's branch
smoothing<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> tighten<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.530> it's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
smoothing this is to tighten it up it's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.130 
smoothing this is to tighten it up it's
also<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> vertex<00:01:18.030> or<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.420> usually<00:01:19.110> a

also to the vertex or not usually a
stick<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.619> 0<00:01:19.939> but<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.390> know<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.080> find<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
stick to 0 but you know if you find a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
use for one symmetry axis works the same

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.710 
use for one symmetry axis works the same
way<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.130> mirror<00:01:26.430> modifier<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.630> the

reasons<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.350> project<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.860> go<00:01:32.009> wrong

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
reasons as the project can go wrong

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.690 
reasons as the project can go wrong
there<00:01:33.180> are<00:01:33.270> smooth<00:01:33.570> shading<00:01:34.020> down<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.439> and

there are smooth shading down here and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.469 
there are smooth shading down here and

too useful mark Lewis option you select

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.219 
too useful mark Lewis option you select
the<00:01:41.909> vertex<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.329> has<00:01:42.420> branches<00:01:42.840> coming<00:01:43.079> off

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the vertex that has branches coming off

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.139 
the vertex that has branches coming off
of<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.890> will<00:01:44.009> form<00:01:44.220> flaps<00:01:44.549> between<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
of it and it will form flaps between the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.230 
of it and it will form flaps between the
other<00:01:45.920> vertices<00:01:46.920> coming<00:01:47.369> out<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.670> however

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
other vertices coming out of it however

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.090 
other vertices coming out of it however
if<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.780> extrude<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.229> will<00:01:49.350> not<00:01:49.470> form<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.920> flat

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
if you extrude it will not form a flat

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.460 
if you extrude it will not form a flat
between<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:51.420> too<00:01:51.689> useful<00:01:51.930> since<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
between that not too useful since you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.080 
between that not too useful since you
can<00:01:52.649> vertically<00:01:53.130> scale<00:01:53.430> things<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
can vertically scale things but the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.020 
can vertically scale things but the
option<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.450> there<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.200> want<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.969> undo<00:01:56.969> this

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
option is there if you want to undo this

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.060 
option is there if you want to undo this
changes<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.110> elect<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> vertex<00:01:58.740> would

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
changes you just elect the vertex would

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.340 
changes you just elect the vertex would
you<00:01:59.280> click<00:01:59.759> mark<00:02:00.000> loose<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.329> before<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.899> then

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
you click mark loose on before and then

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.740 
you click mark loose on before and then
just<00:02:01.590> click<00:02:01.829> clear<00:02:02.310> loose

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.070 

now<00:02:08.320> one<00:02:08.710> thing<00:02:08.740> you<00:02:09.100> also<00:02:09.250> can<00:02:09.670> do<00:02:09.880> is<00:02:10.090> scaling

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
now one thing you also can do is scaling

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.890 
now one thing you also can do is scaling
so<00:02:11.860> I'm<00:02:12.160> just<00:02:12.280> gonna<00:02:12.430> click<00:02:13.140> ctrl<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.410> on

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
so I'm just gonna click ctrl a on

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.070 
so I'm just gonna click ctrl a on
someone

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
someone

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.940 
someone
yes<00:02:17.830> ctrl<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.570> I'll<00:02:19.570> just<00:02:19.900> drag<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.710> there<00:02:20.860> you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
yes ctrl a I'll just drag and there you

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.880 
yes ctrl a I'll just drag and there you
go<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.900> that's<00:02:22.900> basically<00:02:23.470> how<00:02:23.650> you're<00:02:23.830> gonna

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
go and that's basically how you're gonna

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.740 
go and that's basically how you're gonna
be<00:02:24.070> using<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.400> tool<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.850> lot<00:02:25.120> you're<00:02:25.480> gonna<00:02:25.570> be

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
be using this tool a lot you're gonna be

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.930 
be using this tool a lot you're gonna be
extruding<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:26.530> scaling<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.520> you<00:02:27.610> can<00:02:27.760> create

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
extruding and scaling and you can create

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.310 
extruding and scaling and you can create
very<00:02:28.180> good<00:02:28.360> organic<00:02:28.690> shapes<00:02:28.900> I'm<00:02:29.140> going<00:02:29.260> to

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
very good organic shapes I'm going to

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:38.720 
very good organic shapes I'm going to
create<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.650> wings<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.190> bird<00:02:30.340> right<00:02:30.520> now

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.140 

there<00:02:39.730> we<00:02:39.820> go

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
there we go

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.730 
there we go
it<00:02:40.240> doesn't<00:02:40.510> look<00:02:40.570> like<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.780> wing<00:02:41.020> yet<00:02:41.260> but

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
it doesn't look like a wing yet but

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.110 
it doesn't look like a wing yet but
we're<00:02:42.130> gonna<00:02:42.220> I'm<00:02:42.640> gonna<00:02:42.790> show<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.000> how<00:02:43.090> to

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
we're gonna I'm gonna show you how to

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.199 
we're gonna I'm gonna show you how to
just<00:02:43.959> how<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.320> make<00:02:44.440> them<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:45.459> click<00:02:45.730> ctrl<00:02:46.090> a

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
just how to make them you click ctrl a

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.490 
just how to make them you click ctrl a
again<00:02:47.700> we're<00:02:48.700> gonna<00:02:48.850> scale<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.300> up<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.900> then

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
again we're gonna scale that up and then

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.310 
again we're gonna scale that up and then
we're<00:02:50.620> gonna<00:02:50.709> could<00:02:50.920> control<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.550> X<00:02:52.270> this<00:02:52.959> is<00:02:53.110> to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
we're gonna could control a X this is to

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.720 
we're gonna could control a X this is to
make<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:54.540> vertically<00:02:55.540> flat<00:02:55.900> but<00:02:56.770> or<00:02:56.950> Y<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.610> make

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
make it vertically flat but or Y to make

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.060 
make it vertically flat but or Y to make
it<00:02:57.910> horizontally<00:02:58.570> flat<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.020> this<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.740> the<00:02:59.950> way

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
it horizontally flat and this is the way

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.270 
it horizontally flat and this is the way
it<00:03:00.160> works<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.840> now<00:03:01.840> we<00:03:01.900> have<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.140> decent<00:03:02.920> wing

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
it works and now we have a decent wing

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.520 
it works and now we have a decent wing
shape<00:03:03.520> at<00:03:03.970> least<00:03:04.180> for<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:04.330> silhouette<00:03:04.660> and

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.780 

that's<00:03:08.530> basically<00:03:09.160> how<00:03:09.280> you're<00:03:09.520> going<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.700> be

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
that's basically how you're going to be

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:18.580 
that's basically how you're going to be
modeling<00:03:10.450> with<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:11.050> skin<00:03:11.410> modifier

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.680 

something<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.400> will<00:03:19.580> likely<00:03:20.120> occur<00:03:20.480> when

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
something that will likely occur when

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.600 
something that will likely occur when
you're<00:03:20.840> experimenting<00:03:21.440> with<00:03:21.560> this<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.950> that

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
you're experimenting with this is that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.760 
you're experimenting with this is that
if<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.120> exclude<00:03:23.660> from<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:24.170> same<00:03:24.470> vertex

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
if you exclude from the same vertex

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.270 
if you exclude from the same vertex
point<00:03:26.080> multiple<00:03:27.080> times<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.620> will<00:03:27.740> not<00:03:27.920> be

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
point multiple times you will not be

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.070 
point multiple times you will not be
able<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.459> get<00:03:28.550> a<00:03:28.580> perfect<00:03:28.970> natural<00:03:29.750> good

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
able to get a perfect natural good

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.559 
able to get a perfect natural good
topology<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.709> will<00:03:30.800> just<00:03:31.010> click<00:03:31.370> so<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.330> avoid

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
topology it will just click so to avoid

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.030 
topology it will just click so to avoid
that<00:03:32.780> just<00:03:32.840> make<00:03:33.170> sure<00:03:33.319> very<00:03:33.530> good<00:03:33.830> enough

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
that just make sure very good enough

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.339 
that just make sure very good enough
distance<00:03:34.250> from<00:03:34.490> each<00:03:34.670> other

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.740 

now<00:03:40.349> that<00:03:40.530> we<00:03:40.650> have<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.760> base<00:03:41.910> mesh<00:03:42.209> done<00:03:42.480> and

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
now that we have the base mesh done and

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.140 
now that we have the base mesh done and
people<00:03:42.870> satisfied<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> bit<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:44.670> then<00:03:45.000> we'll

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
people satisfied a bit so then we'll

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.630 
people satisfied a bit so then we'll
start<00:03:45.470> actually<00:03:46.470> applying<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.370> we're<00:03:47.550> going

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
start actually applying the we're going

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.430 
start actually applying the we're going
to<00:03:47.730> apply<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:47.970> mirror<00:03:48.330> modifier<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.900> we're

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
to apply the mirror modifier and we're

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.559 
to apply the mirror modifier and we're
going<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.620> create<00:03:49.739> an<00:03:49.860> armature<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:51.420> is

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
going to create an armature and this is

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.680 
going to create an armature and this is
already<00:03:51.959> rigged<00:03:52.260> if<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:53.250> go<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.700> if<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.390> apply

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
already rigged if you go to if you apply

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.949 
already rigged if you go to if you apply
this<00:03:54.750> can<00:03:54.989> modify<00:03:55.200> again<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:56.720> let's<00:03:57.720> just<00:03:57.840> go

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
this can modify again and let's just go

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.860 
this can modify again and let's just go
to<00:03:58.019> move<00:03:58.230> Shane<00:03:58.349> quickly<00:03:58.650> apply<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.870> then

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
to move Shane quickly apply it and then

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.830 
to move Shane quickly apply it and then
go<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.080> pose<00:04:01.410> mode<00:04:01.709> on<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.340> armature<00:04:02.840> you'll

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
go to pose mode on the armature you'll

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.180 
go to pose mode on the armature you'll
see<00:04:04.080> it<00:04:04.200> works<00:04:04.440> pretty<00:04:04.920> well

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
see it works pretty well

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.630 
see it works pretty well
however<00:04:06.799> errors<00:04:07.799> have<00:04:08.040> been<00:04:08.190> known<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.340> happen

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
however errors have been known to happen

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.520 
however errors have been known to happen
so<00:04:09.480> I'm<00:04:09.629> just<00:04:09.750> gonna<00:04:09.870> show<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.140> quick<00:04:10.290> fix

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
so I'm just gonna show you a quick fix

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.710 
so I'm just gonna show you a quick fix
for<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.860> just<00:04:11.579> go<00:04:11.700> back<00:04:11.880> to<00:04:11.910> mesh<00:04:12.239> remove

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
for that just go back to mesh remove

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.890 
for that just go back to mesh remove
this<00:04:12.900> armature<00:04:13.380> modifier

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
this armature modifier

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.449 
this armature modifier
why<00:04:15.900> would<00:04:16.109> your<00:04:16.229> mesh<00:04:16.380> selected<00:04:17.100> select<00:04:17.370> the

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
why would your mesh selected select the

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.750 
why would your mesh selected select the
armature<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.079> then<00:04:19.079> just<00:04:19.290> apply<00:04:19.760> automatic

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
armature and then just apply automatic

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.650 
armature and then just apply automatic
weights<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:23.190> there<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.430> go<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:24.630> should

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
weights and there you go and it should

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.110 
weights and there you go and it should
work<00:04:25.169> just<00:04:25.560> fine<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:26.130> mean<00:04:26.250> in<00:04:26.460> every<00:04:26.700> case<00:04:26.880> at

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
work just fine I mean in every case at

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.100 
work just fine I mean in every case at
every<00:04:27.810> test<00:04:28.020> I've<00:04:28.200> done<00:04:28.410> it's<00:04:28.950> worked<00:04:29.250> 100%

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.990 

and<00:04:34.110> there<00:04:34.380> you<00:04:34.470> go<00:04:34.590> you<00:04:34.889> have<00:04:34.919> a<00:04:35.310> rigged<00:04:35.729> mesh

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
and there you go you have a rigged mesh

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.830 
and there you go you have a rigged mesh
and<00:04:36.710> now<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.770> can<00:04:38.070> go<00:04:38.669> ahead<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:39.060> edit<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.600> as

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
and now you can go ahead and edit it as

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.800 
and now you can go ahead and edit it as
much<00:04:40.260> as<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.500> like<00:04:40.910> this<00:04:41.910> is<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.090> great<00:04:42.630> tool

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
much as you like this is a great tool

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.210 
much as you like this is a great tool
for<00:04:42.840> prototyping<00:04:43.500> I've<00:04:43.740> been<00:04:43.860> using<00:04:44.010> I've

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
for prototyping I've been using I've

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.670 
for prototyping I've been using I've
been<00:04:44.430> using<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.760> for<00:04:44.789> us<00:04:45.060> so<00:04:45.389> like<00:04:45.720> 3d<00:04:46.289> concept

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
been using it for us so like 3d concept

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.740 
been using it for us so like 3d concept
art<00:04:46.889> of<00:04:47.100> sketching<00:04:47.520> seeing<00:04:47.820> how<00:04:48.150> certain

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
art of sketching seeing how certain

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.379 
art of sketching seeing how certain
things<00:04:48.960> work<00:04:49.229> and<00:04:49.560> 3d<00:04:50.310> or<00:04:50.460> not<00:04:50.669> it's<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.120> great

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
things work and 3d or not it's a great

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.170 
things work and 3d or not it's a great
tool<00:04:51.630> and<00:04:52.310> something<00:04:53.310> else<00:04:53.430> you<00:04:53.580> can<00:04:53.700> do<00:04:53.820> if

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
tool and something else you can do if

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.940 
tool and something else you can do if
you're<00:04:54.720> interested<00:04:54.930> in<00:04:55.200> trying<00:04:55.349> it<00:04:55.500> out<00:04:55.620> is

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
you're interested in trying it out is

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.480 
you're interested in trying it out is
also<00:04:56.880> sculpting<00:04:57.539> and<00:04:57.750> this<00:04:58.590> is<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.740> base<00:04:59.070> base

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
also sculpting and this is a base base

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.930 
also sculpting and this is a base base
mesh<00:04:59.789> tool<00:05:00.060> it'll<00:05:01.050> also<00:05:01.289> be<00:05:01.950> what<00:05:02.789> the

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
mesh tool it'll also be what the

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.730 
mesh tool it'll also be what the
topology<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.510> created<00:05:03.870> it's<00:05:04.080> perfectly

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
topology is created it's perfectly

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.000 
topology is created it's perfectly
suitable<00:05:05.070> for<00:05:05.490> sculpting<00:05:06.620> so<00:05:07.620> that's

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
suitable for sculpting so that's

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.190 
suitable for sculpting so that's
basically<00:05:08.639> it<00:05:08.849> that's<00:05:09.210> how<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:09.450> use<00:05:09.599> the<00:05:09.750> skin

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
basically it that's how to use the skin

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.740 
basically it that's how to use the skin
modifier<00:05:10.380> -<00:05:10.889> it's<00:05:11.400> a<00:05:11.520> very<00:05:12.030> flexible<00:05:12.570> tool

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
modifier - it's a very flexible tool

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.040 
modifier - it's a very flexible tool
it's<00:05:13.050> a<00:05:13.410> very<00:05:14.010> quick<00:05:14.250> tool<00:05:14.539> I've<00:05:15.539> been

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
it's a very quick tool I've been

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.860 
it's a very quick tool I've been
creating<00:05:16.320> I've<00:05:17.099> been<00:05:17.700> using<00:05:17.940> this<00:05:18.300> tool<00:05:18.570> since

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
creating I've been using this tool since

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.800 
creating I've been using this tool since
it<00:05:19.020> came<00:05:19.200> out<00:05:19.320> in<00:05:19.580> 2.56

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
it came out in 2.56

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.620 
it came out in 2.56
I<00:05:21.810> think<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:23.160> updates<00:05:23.760> that<00:05:24.150> have<00:05:24.270> been<00:05:24.419> made

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
I think the updates that have been made

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.400 
I think the updates that have been made
really<00:05:25.349> make<00:05:25.950> them<00:05:26.130> are<00:05:26.220> stronger<00:05:26.700> -<00:05:27.410> there

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
really make them are stronger - there

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.490 
really make them are stronger - there
will<00:05:28.500> not<00:05:28.650> be<00:05:28.680> updates<00:05:29.220> until<00:05:29.930> 2.64<00:05:30.990> this<00:05:31.320> is

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
will not be updates until 2.64 this is

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.089 
will not be updates until 2.64 this is
the<00:05:31.740> version<00:05:32.160> that<00:05:32.370> was<00:05:32.580> sent<00:05:33.030> to<00:05:33.860> for<00:05:34.860> code

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
the version that was sent to for code

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.180 
the version that was sent to for code
review<00:05:35.490> so<00:05:36.389> until<00:05:36.900> 2.64<00:05:37.680> into<00:05:37.889> this<00:05:37.979> there

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
review so until 2.64 into this there

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.100 
review so until 2.64 into this there
would<00:05:38.250> not<00:05:38.370> be<00:05:38.430> any<00:05:38.700> new<00:05:38.910> features<00:05:39.120> but<00:05:39.720> as<00:05:39.930> it

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
would not be any new features but as it

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.589 
would not be any new features but as it
is<00:05:40.229> it's<00:05:40.500> a<00:05:40.590> solid<00:05:41.039> tool<00:05:41.310> give<00:05:42.030> it<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.180> go<00:05:42.360> and

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
is it's a solid tool give it a go and

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.360 
is it's a solid tool give it a go and
I'm<00:05:42.990> looking<00:05:43.260> forward<00:05:43.590> to<00:05:43.710> seeing<00:05:43.919> what<00:05:44.250> you

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
I'm looking forward to seeing what you

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.180 
I'm looking forward to seeing what you
create<00:05:44.700> from<00:05:45.030> this
