 Let's start preparing our hair. 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.620
 in three parts 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.079
 you will separate the fringe part or the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.750
 the front you want to leave behind 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.969
 covering your face is a fuse to do 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.949
 the francine that will involve the tuft and 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.870
 below contraction of the pet 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.269
 I'll start going backwards 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.899
 start with the pet so I'll get it here 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:09.850
 back where I want my 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.850
 and separating tuft will here 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.930
 This is going to be the part that I'm going to do. 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.260
 pet that it will get outlook 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.650
 So let's start putting it behind 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.610
 I will not work and I'll start I 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.010
 I'll get 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.200
 and you there for it to return to using this 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.750
 brush to put the use to dry the 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.280
 hair is usually many people 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.619
 like to see with that fine comb 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.150
 also it works the same state but as 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.009
 I do not have any set at home, I 'll 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.400
 cross with brush then it will start 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:00.080
 This year I'll pick up from here to 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.119

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.570
 little chery back take care of the good 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.570

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.660

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.659
 hey you in desfiamos according to the 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.129
 volume that you want to back here as 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.450
 more bulky 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:42.890
 but in that case you have to do it then 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.890
