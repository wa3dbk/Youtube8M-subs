00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.230
 you feel it on the smoke of the floor you are one 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.230
 stuff that makes you fly 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.750
 we are faced with a special bread it is 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.900
 a bread around which we are 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.140
 working for years and we will continue to 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.390
 while working on it from da da da da 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.090
 right from our fort knox 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.040
 this is the most precious thing that that 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.350
 this is my yeast in my restaurant 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.719
 mother we carry around with us 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.809
 us for six years but who had been there 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.329
 given by a lady from anacapri who 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.930
 he had been carrying it for 30 years and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.570
 we started working by kneading 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.520
 with flour and then we saw that 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.890
 the more we went towards the quality of the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.610
 flour plus sourdough reacted well 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.859
 and precisely the quality of the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.329
 of light and we have then 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.030
 traced of organic flours 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.129
 no doubt lighter than the alt 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.670
 I would say more expensive than high and but the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.100
 result is fantastic meanwhile no one 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.799
 waste because this is old bread 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.229
 that I know for a few days and that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.250
 could carry on for 15 days 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.619
 like baby feeling many things to hear 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.080
 very quality but I won't tell you then 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.420
 the use of old bread then make us 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.490
 bread soups or baby food 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.820
 tomato with this bread here you feel 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.770
 this is the quality gap 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.360
 mother yeast that we carry with us 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.549
 of days that instead of the flour if there 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.100
 take a close-up, you can see it right there 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.369
 a different color a grain 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.979
 different cia is a me throwing flour 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.600
 organic of ancient grains this 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.180
 we have it are the shapes we have 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.899
 done last night at 9 we made them 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.790
 levitate throughout the night as a rule 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.890
 at 9 and a half we put them in the oven is 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.620
 this 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.350
 exit feel again cause the exit of 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.440
 this morning he figured out how long 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.800
 we said it lasts allow noise 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.020
 Tuscan noise is a great tour a 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.690
 to infinity I obviously bring it to me 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.760
 I keep it for 15-20 days 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.130
 in the face not cloth and gradually gradually 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.800
 at the end after 15 days maybe it 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.910
 pass a moment in the toaster but more 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.819
 for the throat that moreover the thing the 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.270
 Incredible question of the series is good 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.980
 eat food that is good because it's enough 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.989
 with this story you can eat 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.150
 food that doesn't hurt 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.250
 This is a big trick that I do n't miss 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.220
 I am interested in eating that food 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.950
 it's good and you don't have to be palates here 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.380
 refined enough to realize it 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.110
 really put it in your mouth 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.900
 unfortunately with the 00 flour that's why 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.530
 you have also tried to do it but that 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.800
 We have tried the least expensive flour and the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:08.000
 mother immediately reacts but behaves 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:11.000
 there immediately gives you the signal every 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.829
 the mother should be washed so you say yes 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.480
 it must be washed when it has too many hours not 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.730
 this is the case, but we can see it 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.340
 just a hint see more points 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.079
 dark load when this dark 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.900
 it becomes excessive we are doing it 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:30.019
 striped given we are in a hot water and 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.299
 the curiamola whitens moily we start again 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.220
 just then we said it's more expensive 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.680
 the flour, however, actually in the end yes 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.769
 normal hard there is no waste okay not 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.450
 only every time this to me 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.940
 it happens and I don't think it happens on high 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.800
 I feel like eating a 00 flour 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.410
 how to say a little 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.900
 clear is the blow also happens to me 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.460
 eating pizzas then at this me 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.700
 it's a little nervous because it's one 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.590
 feeling uncomfortable in short here is the 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.500
 this bread nor can I really eat 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.250
 the whole form anything with anything a 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.250
 fantastic wonderful
