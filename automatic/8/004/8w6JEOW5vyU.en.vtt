from<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> dead<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.590> what<00:01:01.680> you're<00:01:01.770> saying

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
from the dead is that what you're saying

from the dead is that what you're saying
I<00:01:02.100> think<00:01:02.340> if<00:01:02.460> any<00:01:02.609> collagen<00:01:03.059> he<00:01:03.120> came<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.510> it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
I think if any collagen he came out it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.729 
I think if any collagen he came out it
would<00:01:03.780> kind<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.019> bring<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.260> back<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> dead

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
would kind of bring it back to the dead

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.640 
would kind of bring it back to the dead
