00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello my dear today 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.300
 I invite you and gray but somehow 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.719
 it turns out that I love gray I consider it 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.590
 elegant and constantly buying some 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.449
 things and here I go I shop Pyaterochka 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.390
 I see this nondescript 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.070
 box peered inside then this 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.130
 vase but I'm naturally next on the shelf 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.000
 I saw baskets 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.250
 I chose this for some reason I don’t have 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.430
 not one basket in the house I decided that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.300
 need to somehow fix this situation 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.700
 now I put an orange glue here for 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.600
 that my videos don't seem so 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.160
 completely black and white and now I'll show you where 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.410
 useful things this is such a glue and 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.789
 xylen I have almost all used 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.090
 wonderful thing can you clearly 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.460
 say and you can glue any any 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:13.159
 surface he knead in the hands and for 10 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.159
 minutes turns a very hard plastic 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.409
 I will definitely buy myself because 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.570
 household 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.479
 he is simply indispensable and another purchase 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.280
 this is such a sticky clasp for 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.229
 party 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.740
 I have not tried them yet 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.840
 soon make a permutation 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.090
 but you know i love these things and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.900
 I try to somehow apply them hang 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.320
 what kind 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.410
 decorative elements and see how everything 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.400
 it will look written here that 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.520
 you can even 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.530
 you quivering wallpaper and they then not 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.360
 leave no trace if all this 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.800
 remove see now show you 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.900
 some cosmetics 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.050
 something lately i'm quite 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.780
 got cold to her I go to the store and draws 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.200
 it seems I had it I don't want 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.290
 shorter mischievous aunt and as you can see I 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.170
 learned to light candles really 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.350
 don't burn mood rises but 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.330
 still please yourself and so those did not have 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.480
 they are inexpensive 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.920
 but I liked them because 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.110
 there is 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.260
 I bought a great shade for the sake of 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.200
 that he is neither gray nor brown 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.950
 some very noble husband color 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.320
 turned out 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.620
 and I like that they are not very 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.590
 pigmented ie in the eyes they are 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.100
 look great just for a new day 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.370
 kia 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.880
 These are the three shades I use at all 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.600
 here a solid shimmer is something like that 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.110
 warm 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.170
 till brown i don't like that 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.020
 black i use for liner and 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.950
 letting them down this way now 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.130
 always tell me my boxes with 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.050
 Cosmetics have wet wipes 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.709
 it is them that I use to 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.870
 wet the brush because if just 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.769
 moisten with water then it becomes too 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.650
 wet and and when you touch wet 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:29.090
 wipes appear so light easy 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.810
 the humidity that we just need to sing 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.040
 I 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.830
 no nor slightly typed plus yet 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.440
 that the shadows are then not at all 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:47.760
 showered and after this video 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.050
 less thin and possible 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.959
 make a smooth transition 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:56.430
 I really like doing this 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:59.580
 on makeup if i want to do myself 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.230
 some brighter makeup i use 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.720
 I bought my liner 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.590
 thing and it seemed our surprise because 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.049
 that when I started to wash my makeup in the evening 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.010
 it turned out that it is water resistant color 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:19.769
 she is not black but dark dark lilac 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.479
 and lilac so dark 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.590
 noble and 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:29.100
 just for my eyes the most time 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:32.010
 here also the elements went only I don't know 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.729
 frankly speaking than washing it off very much 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.160
 poorly removed by micelles 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.510
 waters of any means to remove 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.590
 eye makeup 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.919
 even a waterproof remover 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.460
 makeup on is washed off with difficulty but on 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:54.419
 very beautiful eyes 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:58.590
 now show some varnishes this varnishes 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:02.330
 I beat here about this, I immediately a little bit 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.960
 I swear it requires a lot of layers 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.220
 what shade 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.410
 now I will not find what nightmare is the first 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.310
 since I was not prepared for the video and the number 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.060
 that 15 but the dream 15 looks beautiful on 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.150
 nails 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:23.990
 but too long to do it manicure 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:28.740
 Right here I do not like such lags 224 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.750
 beautiful very good color and number one hundred 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.150
 sixty 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.150
 they are kept on my nails somewhere day 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.599
 three but on my nails any marks 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:43.680
 Dmitri hold on so I too already 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.599
 did not cling and one more varnish will show 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.210
 which I honestly do not really 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:51.930
 liked the layer by mall 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.659
 I'm talking about el corazon sensational likes 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:58.800
 my eyes lit up and I immediately 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:06:01.409
 bought but what you look like on my nails 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.530
 absolutely not like it but it is purely mine 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:08.280
 I do not like such a subjective opinion 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:11.280
 such effects on the nails somehow looks like 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.300
 it's not very expensive let's say so I love 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.919
 so that everything is smooth 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.680
 In short, these are my feelings 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:23.250
 plus if applied 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.789
 just immediately on the nails without any 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.849
 a layer of something or a foundation or another 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:35.060
 Lakota remove it from the nails almost 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:38.760
 impossible i mean i don't like this thing and 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:41.190
 quarreled in general, and once again went 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:46.310
 such a booze relying about here 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:50.150
 this cream is our planeta organica 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:53.039
 natural rejuvenating face cream 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.310
 I decided to return to 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:58.930
 natural cosmetics again read 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:02.830
 about paraben silicones think 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:06.729
 1 is closer to nature but I like this one 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:09.330
 cream at all it doesn’t absorb i'm not 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:13.470
 I can even use it on my feet and 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:16.800
 so, with grief, I bought cream again 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:20.229
 loreal and happy and this one i unfortunately 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.740
 threw it because on no part 

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:27.699
 bodies honestly are not suitable for 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:30.610
 I want to praise me very much 

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:31.570
 such shampoo bought it for 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.470
 experiment 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:37.030
 Such bowls very tasty smells 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.300
 local sweets 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:44.250
 fine washes his head here not 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:47.229
 no sls any harmful substances and 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:50.680
 the most interesting is that it is very economical 

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:54.910
 I was honestly surprised sold 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:59.490
 he is in a chain of stores or and for and such 

00:07:54.910 --> 00:08:02.380
 a bottle of such a jar is worth 136 rubles 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.220
 this shampoo I can do to everyone 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.250

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:09.639
