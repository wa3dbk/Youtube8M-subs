mounted<00:01:55.149> in<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.780> car<00:01:56.610> or<00:01:57.610> in<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:57.819> van<00:01:58.860> and

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:08.830 

I've<00:02:03.069> got

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.610 

various<00:02:09.840> programs<00:02:10.380> installed<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:12.620> but

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
various programs installed on it but

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.080 
various programs installed on it but
probably<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.100> one<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.280> use<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.610> most<00:02:17.060> would<00:02:18.060> be

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
probably the one I use the most would be

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:28.160 
probably the one I use the most would be
cheaper<00:02:18.900> dick<00:02:25.700> it's<00:02:26.700> velcroed<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.990> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
cheaper dick it's velcroed to the to the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.100 
cheaper dick it's velcroed to the to the
stand<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.820> can<00:02:30.030> pull<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.360> out<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.690> just<00:02:30.720> use

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
stand so I can pull it out and just use

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.470 
stand so I can pull it out and just use
it<00:02:31.290> at<00:02:31.680> home<00:02:32.090> I've<00:02:33.090> got<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:35.090> adapter<00:02:36.090> for<00:02:36.330> it

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
it at home I've got the adapter for it

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.110 
it at home I've got the adapter for it
so<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.320> can<00:02:37.620> charge<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.190> car<00:02:38.490> I

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.560 

guess<00:02:42.120> that's<00:02:42.330> really<00:02:42.540> about<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.080> about<00:02:43.200> that

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
guess that's really about it about that

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.960 
guess that's really about it about that
you<00:02:45.570> know<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:46.080> basically<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:47.220> little

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
you know it's basically a little

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.020 
you know it's basically a little
computer<00:02:51.050> I'm<00:02:52.050> running<00:02:52.470> some<00:02:53.040> booty<00:02:53.460> Linux<00:02:53.850> on

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
computer I'm running some booty Linux on

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:05.360 
computer I'm running some booty Linux on
it<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:55.590> netbook<00:02:56.460> remix<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:01.170> then<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:03.110> said<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
it the netbook remix and then I said the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.080 
it the netbook remix and then I said the
mountain<00:03:05.730> doubles<00:03:06.660> as<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:07.640> very<00:03:08.640> good<00:03:08.850> mount

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
mountain doubles as a very good mount

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.900 
mountain doubles as a very good mount
for<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:11.420> handheld<00:03:12.420> radio<00:03:12.780> especially

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
for the handheld radio especially

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.120 
for the handheld radio especially
especially<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.030> Kenwood<00:03:15.420> because<00:03:15.750> it

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
especially the Kenwood because it

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.940 
especially the Kenwood because it
actually<00:03:17.360> it's<00:03:18.360> bail<00:03:18.690> clip<00:03:18.959> that's<00:03:19.320> perfect

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
actually it's bail clip that's perfect

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.160 
actually it's bail clip that's perfect
down<00:03:20.520> into<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.970> there's<00:03:24.330> no<00:03:24.630> possibility

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
down into it so there's no possibility

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.110 
down into it so there's no possibility
let's<00:03:25.650> don't<00:03:25.920> fall<00:03:26.160> off<00:03:27.980> only<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.310> only<00:03:29.520> main

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
let's don't fall off only the only main

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.820 
let's don't fall off only the only main
drawback<00:03:30.930> till<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:31.860> is<00:03:32.100> I<00:03:32.390> can't<00:03:33.390> really

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
drawback till to that is I can't really

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.340 
drawback till to that is I can't really
open<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.280> laptop<00:03:35.459> while<00:03:36.209> I've<00:03:36.300> got<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.750> radio
