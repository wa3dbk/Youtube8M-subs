that's<00:02:51.520> why<00:02:51.640> I'm<00:02:51.730> choosing<00:02:51.880> black<00:02:52.300> because<00:02:52.720> I

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
that's why I'm choosing black because I

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.230 
that's why I'm choosing black because I
got<00:02:53.920> kind<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.310> gray<00:02:54.520> background<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.210> I

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
got kind of a gray background and I

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.300 
got kind of a gray background and I
still<00:02:55.540> wanted<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.900> stand<00:02:56.170> out<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.130> black

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
still wanted to stand out so the black

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.950 
still wanted to stand out so the black
will<00:02:57.550> work<00:02:57.820> well<00:02:58.090> with<00:02:58.270> it<00:02:58.300> with<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.690> white

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
will work well with it with the white

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.420 
will work well with it with the white
background<00:02:59.170> because<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.800> background<00:03:00.220> is

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
background because the background is

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.420 
background because the background is
actually<00:03:00.640> voice<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.560> advertisement<00:03:03.220> side

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
actually voice on the advertisement side

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.820
