feel like I'm fitting in but sometimes

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.810 
feel like I'm fitting in but sometimes
they<00:03:12.050> don't<00:03:12.230> have<00:03:12.560> this<00:03:12.860> product<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:13.430> what

they don't have this product so what

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.940 
they don't have this product so what

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
took me longer like I would have gotten

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.130 
took me longer like I would have gotten
this<00:03:16.130> product<00:03:16.550> maybe<00:03:16.730> three<00:03:17.000> months<00:03:17.150> ago<00:03:17.480> but

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
this product maybe three months ago but

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.600 
this product maybe three months ago but
I<00:03:18.380> couldn't<00:03:18.890> find<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.550> so<00:03:20.830> that's<00:03:21.830> another

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
I couldn't find it so that's another

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.080 
I couldn't find it so that's another
concern<00:03:23.360> of<00:03:23.570> mine<00:03:23.810> um<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:25.190> that<00:03:25.790> goes<00:03:25.940> along

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
concern of mine um and that goes along

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.030 
concern of mine um and that goes along
with<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.420> price<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.050> prices<00:03:27.800> weren't

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
with the price to the prices weren't

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.310 
with the price to the prices weren't
marked<00:03:28.459> on<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:29.090> hard<00:03:29.270> candy<00:03:29.450> section<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.290> I

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
marked on the hard candy section so I

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.650 
marked on the hard candy section so I
really<00:03:30.739> don't<00:03:30.860> didn't<00:03:31.760> know<00:03:31.880> how<00:03:32.180> much<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.570> was

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
really don't didn't know how much it was

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.330 
really don't didn't know how much it was
when<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:32.870> was<00:03:33.020> buying<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.500> but<00:03:33.650> i'm<00:03:33.770> pretty<00:03:33.980> sure

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
when I was buying it but i'm pretty sure

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.540 
when I was buying it but i'm pretty sure
it's<00:03:34.670> about<00:03:34.880> seven<00:03:35.300> or<00:03:35.390> eight<00:03:35.540> dollars<00:03:35.900> um<00:03:36.550> and

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.670 
it's about seven or eight dollars um and
then<00:03:37.970> my<00:03:38.090> third<00:03:38.120> thing<00:03:38.750> that<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:39.140> would<00:03:39.200> say<00:03:39.380> is

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
then my third thing that I would say is

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.220 
then my third thing that I would say is
because<00:03:40.430> um<00:03:42.100> my<00:03:43.100> fur<00:03:43.550> my<00:03:43.820> third<00:03:44.030> con<00:03:44.360> it<00:03:44.750> would

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
because um my fur my third con it would

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.470 
because um my fur my third con it would
have<00:03:45.380> to<00:03:45.500> be<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.680> color<00:03:45.940> selection<00:03:46.940> there<00:03:47.330> are

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
appeal um but you know I didn't really

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.110 
appeal um but you know I didn't really
see<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.340> like<00:04:01.489> an<00:04:01.640> in-between<00:04:02.239> for<00:04:02.570> maybe<00:04:02.810> some

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
see it like an in-between for maybe some

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.350 
see it like an in-between for maybe some
who<00:04:03.390> is<00:04:03.780> like<00:04:04.560> latino<00:04:05.190> or<00:04:05.459> Mexican<00:04:06.120> um<00:04:07.370> or<00:04:08.370> even

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
who is like latino or Mexican um or even

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.289 
who is like latino or Mexican um or even
like<00:04:09.569> my<00:04:09.810> my<00:04:10.590> best<00:04:10.799> friends<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.940> know<00:04:11.970> full

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
like my my best friends you know full

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.630 
like my my best friends you know full
Japanese<00:04:12.810> so<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:13.319> didn't<00:04:13.739> really<00:04:13.799> see<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.220> color

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
Japanese so I didn't really see a color

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.780 
Japanese so I didn't really see a color
for<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.299> so<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.659> color<00:04:15.930> range<00:04:16.260> is<00:04:16.560> not<00:04:17.310> the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
for that so the color range is not the

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.530 
for that so the color range is not the
best<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.840> if<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.229> do<00:04:20.130> go<00:04:20.430> go<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.910> walmart<00:04:21.419> I

best so if you do go go to walmart I

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.420 
best so if you do go go to walmart I
definitely<00:04:21.959> would<00:04:22.320> examine<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.889> colors<00:04:23.220> or

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
definitely would examine the colors or

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.790 
definitely would examine the colors or
even<00:04:23.729> check<00:04:23.910> out<00:04:24.090> other<00:04:24.270> reviews<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.960> maybe
