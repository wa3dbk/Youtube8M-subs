00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
going to do that to all the rest of

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.940 
going to do that to all the rest of
these<00:01:44.149> bite-size<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.509> there<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:45.719> go<00:01:45.920> those<00:01:46.920> are

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
these bite-size so there we go those are
