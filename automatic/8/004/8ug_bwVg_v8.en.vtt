this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.810> an<00:00:00.900> instructional<00:00:01.380> tutorial<00:00:01.860> for

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
this is an instructional tutorial for

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.940 
this is an instructional tutorial for
the<00:00:02.100> Taj<00:00:02.280> Mahal<00:00:02.990> now<00:00:03.990> we're<00:00:04.529> going<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.770> create

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
the Taj Mahal now we're going to create

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.829 
the Taj Mahal now we're going to create
by<00:00:05.490> adding<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.940> texture<00:00:06.330> that's<00:00:06.450> going<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.690> be

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
by adding the texture that's going to be

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.620 
by adding the texture that's going to be
the<00:00:07.319> Taj<00:00:07.529> Mahal<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.970> reflection<00:00:09.450> in<00:00:09.540> the

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
the Taj Mahal and the reflection in the

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.499 
the Taj Mahal and the reflection in the
water<00:00:09.750> as<00:00:09.990> well<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:11.030> go<00:00:12.030> ahead<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.179> add<00:00:12.330> some

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
water as well so go ahead and add some

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.609 
water as well so go ahead and add some
blue<00:00:13.280> and<00:00:14.280> we're<00:00:14.549> going<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.700> put<00:00:15.289> black<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:16.470> top

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
blue and we're going to put black on top

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.279 
blue and we're going to put black on top
of<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.270> so<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.300> when<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.660> remove<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
of that so that when you remove it the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.580 
of that so that when you remove it the
highlights<00:00:19.710> will<00:00:19.890> be<00:00:20.039> blue<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:21.260> it'll<00:00:22.260> s<00:00:22.410> will

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
highlights will be blue but it'll s will

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.179 
highlights will be blue but it'll s will
leave<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.769> rocky<00:00:23.039> texture<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:24.980> okay<00:00:25.980> I'm

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
leave a rocky texture to it okay I'm

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.980 
leave a rocky texture to it okay I'm
just<00:00:26.279> gonna<00:00:26.430> use<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> magazine<00:00:27.119> sheet<00:00:27.330> there<00:00:27.869> up

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
just gonna use a magazine sheet there up

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.740 
just gonna use a magazine sheet there up
a<00:00:28.109> piece<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.320> that

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.490 

and<00:00:32.349> just<00:00:32.529> remove<00:00:32.860> pieces<00:00:33.700> and<00:00:33.850> parts<00:00:34.030> of<00:00:34.210> it

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and just remove pieces and parts of it

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.260 
and just remove pieces and parts of it
and<00:00:35.500> see<00:00:35.680> you<00:00:35.770> the<00:00:36.160> more<00:00:36.340> you<00:00:36.400> go<00:00:36.640> over<00:00:36.730> it<00:00:36.970> the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
and see you the more you go over it the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.990 
and see you the more you go over it the
rocky<00:00:37.540> or<00:00:37.750> it'll<00:00:38.020> get<00:00:40.290> nice<00:00:41.610> all<00:00:42.610> right<00:00:42.760> let's

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
rocky or it'll get nice all right let's

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000 
rocky or it'll get nice all right let's
help<00:00:43.120> it<00:00:43.270> dry<00:00:43.420> so<00:00:44.350> what<00:00:44.559> I'm<00:00:44.650> going<00:00:44.739> to<00:00:44.830> use

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
help it dry so what I'm going to use

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.010 
help it dry so what I'm going to use
needs<00:00:45.880> a<00:00:46.000> little<00:00:46.120> bit<00:00:46.270> of<00:00:46.330> clear<00:00:46.540> coat<00:00:46.720> and<00:00:46.960> the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
needs a little bit of clear coat and the

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.650 
needs a little bit of clear coat and the
lighter<00:00:47.790> and<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:50.320> heat<00:00:50.559> will<00:00:50.890> help<00:00:51.790> this<00:00:52.059> dry

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
lighter and the heat will help this dry

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.640 
lighter and the heat will help this dry
quicker

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.100 

okay<00:00:56.130> once<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.850> dry<00:00:57.060> and<00:00:57.420> put<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.750> stencil

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
okay once it's dry and put your stencil

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.090 
okay once it's dry and put your stencil
on<00:00:58.200> top<00:00:58.380> of<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.620> and<00:01:00.320> i<00:01:01.320> believe<00:01:01.830> i'm<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:02.040> to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
on top of it and i believe i'm going to

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.940 
on top of it and i believe i'm going to
create<00:01:02.190> two<00:01:02.430> planets<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.740> i'm<00:01:04.740> going<00:01:04.860> to

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:04.950 
create two planets here so i'm going to

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.230 
create two planets here so i'm going to
use<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.100> little<00:01:05.309> bit<00:01:05.370> of<00:01:05.430> green<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.940> upper

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
use a little bit of green in the upper

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.110 
use a little bit of green in the upper
left<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.250> maybe<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.340> little<00:01:08.490> bit<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.760> blue<00:01:08.880> here

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
left and maybe a little bit of blue here

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.560 
left and maybe a little bit of blue here
on<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.300> bottom<00:01:09.420> right<00:01:11.180> now<00:01:12.180> i'm<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
on the bottom right now i'm going to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.030 
on the bottom right now i'm going to
create<00:01:12.690> two<00:01:12.990> different<00:01:13.020> sectors<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:13.860> these

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
create two different sectors for these

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.760 
create two different sectors for these
planets<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:16.020> know<00:01:16.050> two<00:01:16.170> different<00:01:16.590> planets

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
planets you know two different planets

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.120 
planets you know two different planets
two<00:01:17.130> different<00:01:17.490> textures<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:19.680> could<00:01:19.860> you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
two different textures you could you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.710 
two different textures you could you
could<00:01:20.250> make<00:01:20.490> them<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.940> same<00:01:21.090> texture<00:01:21.510> but<00:01:21.690> I

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
could make them the same texture but I

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.470 
could make them the same texture but I
think<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.110> looks<00:01:22.260> better<00:01:22.350> if<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.120> mix<00:01:24.120> it<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.300> a

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
think it looks better if you mix it up a

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.720 
think it looks better if you mix it up a
little<00:01:24.510> bit<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.440> add<00:01:25.680> white<00:01:26.130> comes<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
little bit and add white comes up of the

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.560 
little bit and add white comes up of the
Moon<00:01:26.940> and<00:01:27.150> black<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:28.020> couple<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.440> green<00:01:29.570> with

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
Moon and black a couple of green with

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.570 
Moon and black a couple of green with
the<00:01:30.660> green<00:01:30.900> leave<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> same<00:01:31.890> technique<00:01:32.400> that

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
the green leave the same technique that

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.670 
the green leave the same technique that
we<00:01:32.670> use<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> bottom<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.320> create<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
we use on the bottom as to create a

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.980 
we use on the bottom as to create a
slowly<00:01:35.660> rocky<00:01:36.660> terrain<00:01:38.300> lots<00:01:39.300> going<00:01:39.510> on<00:01:39.750> there

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
slowly rocky terrain lots going on there

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.180 
slowly rocky terrain lots going on there
now<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:41.190> plan<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.600> say<00:01:42.600> where<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.869> use<00:01:43.050> our<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
now we plan it say where we use our to

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.719 
now we plan it say where we use our to
create<00:01:44.460> or<00:01:44.490> water<00:01:44.960> look<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.410> heat<00:01:46.729> I'm

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
create or water look like the heat I'm

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.310 
create or water look like the heat I'm
just<00:01:47.790> going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> smear<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.390> colors<00:01:48.869> back<00:01:49.110> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
just going to smear the colors back and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.640 
just going to smear the colors back and
forth

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.830 

no<00:01:53.650> like<00:01:53.800> a<00:01:53.830> Mars<00:01:54.190> looking<00:01:54.640> better

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
no like a Mars looking better

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.810 
no like a Mars looking better

important especially if you're going for
like<00:02:00.289> that<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.740> 3d<00:02:01.310> look<00:02:01.340> very<00:02:01.909> realistic<00:02:02.240> look

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
like that a 3d look very realistic look

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.459 
like that a 3d look very realistic look
can<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:04.939> put<00:02:05.179> your<00:02:05.299> stencils<00:02:05.750> on<00:02:05.869> top<00:02:06.079> is<00:02:06.259> very

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
can you put your stencils on top is very

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.830 
can you put your stencils on top is very
important<00:02:06.859> that<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.039> get<00:02:07.189> to<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:07.750> some<00:02:08.750> of

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
important that you get to this some of

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.690
