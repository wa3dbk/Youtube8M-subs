00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 There is a new one for the audience today 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.480
 Video probably wanted from me 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.960
 This video is relatively short so schonmal 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.929
 in advance me I have not 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.150
 say I would always say me 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.880
 would say we are definitely 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.960
 start now in the video my bag 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.060
 is this here 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.070
 and that is from laura and I have 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.289
 now for a year and yes exactly 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.420
 First, I have my mobile phone 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.010
 I think everybody has his cell phone in it and it 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.120
 Just this cellphone here and I wanted 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.710
 you did I imagine something and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.210
 Although it is the UK and the New York 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.090
 times and I have that in times 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.550
 my bag so tight and then I can 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.379
 just keep taking my phone out like this and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.000
 so wants to fall down time and will 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.340
 also not stolen and I think so 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.390
 that's really why I have them 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.870
 Mobile phone would always be the link where I am 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:06.240
 bought it is now an infobox 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:08.010
 and then I still have it off 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.479
 That's why I can not london you then 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.250
 do the link in the infobox 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.409
 as with the other things where I know 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.460
 where I have then through the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.840
 number the infobox 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.820
 Anyway, it's just one 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.540
 wallet and I have that now 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.140
 London 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.420
 I already have that for a year now 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.520
 then I have something normal and here 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.350

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.759
 this is in such a shell and that was 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.200
 a bit warmer but now 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.680
 I just have my block 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.329

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.579
 then I just have a teaser myself 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.200
 think it's really pretty and so why 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.119
 Just then I just have golden 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.670

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.069

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.929
 so I have one two three four five 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.860
 piece and that is mine in any case 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.280
 favorite and that is cabaret yes think 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:23.440
 I'll have it here now 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:29.260
 with and a bonbon it is empty then one 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:32.110
 kassebaum an umbrella so because in 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.900
 so last time so rainy weather so 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.230
 with me , I was just like that 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.610
 in my umbrella then one 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.510
 flashlight i do not know though 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.700
 somehow I always have one 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.160
 Flashlight duration I do not know 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.980
 bit pointless but have no idea 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.830
 then I have some good ones in it 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.250
 yes that was it already I have not 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.510
 so much stuff in my bag 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.709
 yes, but I think so too 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.019
 Quite alright that I am not like that anymore 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.630
 So, from the inside she has a lot of stuff 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.980
 Now look like that and everyone is already 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.049
 pretty much a mess 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.560
 so I'm a happy because 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.600
 not too much in it now , that's why 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.880
 it is now synonymous just such a short video 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.880
 become and I just do not understand 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.739
 whatever becks or corn tobacco videos 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.340
 Just go ten minutes anyway 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.930
 can 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.239
 I understand that just received 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.160
 be as short as I know ever me 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.250
 not what is still around the products 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.959
 should go or what you can then in the 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.940
 handbag what some still hold in the 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.790
 Handbag I think must be blatant 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.560
 but yes, how to get there ten minutes 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.000
 I can manage so much but it 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.549
 would be just as silly if somehow 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.019
 I would do any of those things 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.459
 I usually do not have to do that 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.709
 That's why I thought I'm doing it 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.500
 just that kind of stuff 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.180
 in my pocket is in it and yes exactly 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.620
 all the video I would 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.540
 very over a dam to the top 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.170
 and then I would wait until the next one 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.170
 bye bye
