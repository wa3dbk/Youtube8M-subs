00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:11.099
 Hello everyone, as in the previous video 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:16.980
 we began the struggle for external purity 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:19.760
 the engine a little and it will continue even 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.760
 there is one nuance 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:30.750
 it happens this ride and the front cover 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.940
 engine you throws oil in 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:39.000
 features when there are still them 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.980
 forced fan on the pump oil 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.489
 inflates soup front cover 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.719
 over the front cover with time 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.719
 thinks of dust it all mixes and 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:55.949
 turns into a thick mud cake 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.170
 oily first signs from whence can 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.059
 flow 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:06.860
 leak oil this 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.860
 pacifier bolts 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.690
 we pinch them driver 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.860
 Washers are all but there is one 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.650
 feature oil is leaking so 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:28.350
 that's how we see here 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:31.640
 they sit on sealant so if u 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.640
 you now have such a problem 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.200
 Replace the bolts on the sealant abundantly 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.009
 lubricates twist gently to 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.259
 sealant stayed round giving 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:56.060
 dry up and here is the state of the motor 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:59.970
 we see again if ok 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.670
 front crankshaft oil seal 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.860
 if ok pulley as i was showing in 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:14.690
 previous videos and of course we sit down 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.690
 on sealant our chain tensioner 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.730
 gasket is not neatly lubricated 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.730
 sealant sit on sealant 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.460
 Well here's how we see the front cover with us 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.840
 I didn’t wipe her I didn’t wipe her 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.840
 the engine went over a hundred thousand
