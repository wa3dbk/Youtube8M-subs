00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
there was a possibility but I needed to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.149 
there was a possibility but I needed to
observe<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.650> action

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.230 
can you explain yes shadow powers are
passed<00:01:18.869> down<00:01:19.020> each<00:01:19.380> generation<00:01:19.920> now<00:01:20.909> it's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
passed down each generation now it's

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.359 
passed down each generation now it's
thought<00:01:21.540> although<00:01:22.350> we're<00:01:22.500> not<00:01:22.530> entirely<00:01:23.009> sure

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
thought although we're not entirely sure

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.730 
thought although we're not entirely sure
about<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> most<00:01:24.900> powerful<00:01:25.170> shadow

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740

manifestations appear in people who are
born<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.110> day<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.530> full<00:01:28.770> solar<00:01:29.070> eclipse

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
born on the day of a full solar eclipse

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.109 
born on the day of a full solar eclipse
hmm<00:01:31.790> tell<00:01:32.790> me<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.270> feel<00:01:33.479> anything<00:01:34.009> huh

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
so I thought that perhaps they'd spur

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:53.740 
so I thought that perhaps they'd spur
your<00:01:39.600> shadow<00:01:39.930> into<00:01:40.259> action<00:01:40.740> sorry<00:01:41.579> No

really only appeared by accident the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.800 
really only appeared by accident the
last<00:01:58.620> time<00:01:59.220> I<00:01:59.550> have<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> bad<00:02:00.180> feeling<00:02:00.210> we'll

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
to be careful but at least now I know

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.949 
to be careful but at least now I know
one<00:03:24.540> thing<00:03:25.519> no<00:03:26.519> single<00:03:27.000> person<00:03:27.180> alone<00:03:27.660> could

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
one thing no single person alone could

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.280 
one thing no single person alone could

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
assumptions but I think she's working

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.069 
assumptions but I think she's working
with<00:03:34.799> someone<00:03:35.220> big<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.880> what<00:03:36.090> will<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.420> do<00:03:36.660> if

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
with someone big so what will you do if

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.979 
with someone big so what will you do if
she's<00:03:37.349> in<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.650> city<00:03:37.920> it's<00:03:38.190> dangerous<00:03:38.819> yes<00:03:39.329> but

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
she's in the city it's dangerous yes but

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.870 
she's in the city it's dangerous yes but

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
this is something I have to do alone it

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.850 
this is something I have to do alone it
