00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.889
 the construction system with concrete blocks has as component 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.789
 fundamental quality 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.230
 since if they do not comply with the regulations in force the final construction 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.589
 they would suffer from insurmountable defects 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.139
 a block of quality requires a resistance of quad allusion that 

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:27.439
 pretend to give 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.679
 a dimensional uniformity red its axes 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.899
 and an adequate curing process that ensures the complete hydration of the 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.790
 cement contained in the mind 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.080
 this is only achieved with quality industrial equipment 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.010
 with technical characteristics that allow to adequately control all 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.500
 the variables involved in the manufacturing process 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.560
 We must address different aspects and the manufacture of a quality batch 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.970
 the careful selection of the aggregates 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.150
 and a correct granulometric curve are essential to achieve the necessary 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.400
 final resistance of the blockade 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.710
 these aggregates 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.200
 to beat dosed in the correct proportion 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.120
 for it 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.040
 it is advisable to dosage by volume volume by weight 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.460
 to minimize the variations that may arise from the absorption of water 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.930
 by the aggregates 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.540
 the different aggregates 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.010
 together with the cement the additives and the water and kneading are introduced inside 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.180
 From the market 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.670
 the type of mixer the sequence with which the different 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.240
 elements and the delicate process 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.620
 are fundamental to get a mix as great as appropriate 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.810
 with low humidity percentage 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.869
 for this the wrestlers include humidity sensors 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.700
 active ku by microwave 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.210
 what ensures accuracy 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.240
 from the central unit the hunger 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.799
 finished the mixing cycle the resulting shepherd is unloaded to the tape 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:54.740
 feeders 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.010
 the team from Murcia 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.869
 Potato food with equipment as it requires it 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.320
 before the drawer is positioned on the mold 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.890
 a molding plate 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.319
 the lower part of the same is attached 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.319
 to hold the mixture they enter 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:15.309
 the feeder drawer moves over the mountain for dinner 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:18.309
 stirring the mixture to include within 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.899
 as soon as you remove drawer feeder 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:27.359
 the compression head begins to descend pressing on the lie 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.760
 At the same time the vibrator version is increased to allow the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.760
 total pre-mix accommodation within the forest 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.009
 the silver with the producers and molded 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:39.979
 it says outside the team 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.509
 and this decade so the tower lift 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:47.139
 the plate loading and unloading system once the loading is completed 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:47.829
 ship's 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.319
 it moves to one side and is located by a corridor to continue 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.319
 with the process 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.159
 a forklift 2 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.469
 the cid the full rack 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:04.929
 and leads him to a room 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:06.589
 when the load is completed 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.589
 it closes hermetically to take advantage of the heat generated 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.099
 the set 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.859
 the cement and if it starts the curing process by means of water spray 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:16.899
 high pressure 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:18.659
 in the form of mist 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:19.870
 eventually 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.579
 assisted by a heater 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.589
 if environmental conditions so require 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:26.539
 when the process is complete 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:27.809
 the room opens 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:28.859
 in the denying car 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.969
 begins to remove them scratched the cured products 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.079
 The opponents 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.219
 the other end of the loading and unloading system 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:37.210
 with a tower 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.340
 of descent remove the plates is already sent back to the molded equipment 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.069
 on his way back 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.410
 a product separator moves blogs 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.629
 already cured 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.629
 and moves it to a stowage conveyor 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:56.639
 the plates 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.289
 already without products pass through a blade scrapers 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:03.529
 that removes the remains of concrete is 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:05.209
 enter a high 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.749
 that prior to a seat of protection the return store of plates of the 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.100
 equipment to be reused 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.379
 restarting the process 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.719
 the cured blocks 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:19.779
 they are sorted on the conveyor 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.689
 in which they were deposited 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:23.960
 and enter the palletized equipment 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.759
