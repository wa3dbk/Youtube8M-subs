alright as you can see I've done some
adjustments<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.740> my<00:00:04.859> original<00:00:05.190> initial

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
adjustments to my original initial

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.789 
adjustments to my original initial
design<00:00:06.150> well<00:00:06.569> besides<00:00:06.899> spray<00:00:07.379> painting<00:00:07.620> it

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
design well besides spray painting it

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.759 
design well besides spray painting it
black<00:00:07.980> if<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:09.120> remember<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:10.019> was<00:00:10.110> originally

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
black if you remember it was originally

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.640 
black if you remember it was originally
to<00:00:10.950> pieces<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.870> what<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.900> did<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.380> glued<00:00:13.620> the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
to pieces and what I did is I glued the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.220 
to pieces and what I did is I glued the
front<00:00:14.040> in<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.219> back<00:00:14.509> to<00:00:15.509> make<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.780> one<00:00:15.929> piece

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
front in the back to make it one piece

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.800 
front in the back to make it one piece
and<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.730> see<00:00:17.850> how<00:00:17.970> well<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.180> would<00:00:18.390> take<00:00:18.600> a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
and just to see how well it would take a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.170 
and just to see how well it would take a
paint<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.890> spray<00:00:20.189> paint<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.670> one<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.090> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
paint I spray paint it one of the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.210 
paint I spray paint it one of the
problems<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.810> found<00:00:22.109> really<00:00:22.350> quickly<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:22.980> this

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
problems I found really quickly is this

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.330 
problems I found really quickly is this
stuff<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.779> extremely<00:00:24.779> porous<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.130> just

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
stuff is extremely porous and it just

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.849 
stuff is extremely porous and it just
sucks<00:00:26.699> up<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.630> spray<00:00:27.960> paint<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.410> had<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.710> check

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
sucks up the spray paint I had to check

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.580 
sucks up the spray paint I had to check
the<00:00:28.980> forums<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.240> common<00:00:31.230> problem<00:00:31.470> but

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
the forums and it's a common problem but

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.770 
the forums and it's a common problem but
there<00:00:31.920> are<00:00:32.189> ways<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.700> sealing<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.360> using<00:00:33.750> a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
there are ways of sealing it using a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.360 
there are ways of sealing it using a
different<00:00:34.290> products<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:34.980> I'm<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.280> go

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
different products so I'm going to go

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.680 
different products so I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.550> test<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> next

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
ahead and test that on the next

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.619 
ahead and test that on the next
prototype<00:00:37.020> which<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.850> printing<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.329> its

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
prototype which is printing and on its

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.540 
prototype which is printing and on its
way<00:00:39.989> as<00:00:40.230> we're<00:00:40.559> steam<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.280> wanted<00:00:41.489> to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
way as we're steam but I just wanted to

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.360 
way as we're steam but I just wanted to
show<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.930> actually<00:00:42.930> how<00:00:42.960> well<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.800> new

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
show you actually how well this new

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.779 
show you actually how well this new
design<00:00:44.670> works<00:00:44.940> anyways<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:46.039> now<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> clip-on

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
design works anyways it's now a clip-on

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.360 
design works anyways it's now a clip-on
design<00:00:48.210> instead<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.719> two-piece<00:00:49.370> basically

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
design instead of a two-piece basically

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.350 
design instead of a two-piece basically
the<00:00:50.520> problem<00:00:50.820> i<00:00:50.879> was<00:00:50.940> having<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:53.360> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the problem i was having is that the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.119 
the problem i was having is that the
clips<00:00:54.719> we're<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.590> too<00:00:55.800> small

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
clips we're just going to be too small

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.860 
clips we're just going to be too small
and<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.789> resolution<00:00:57.360> wasn't<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.809> be

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and the resolution wasn't going to be

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.180 
and the resolution wasn't going to be
fine<00:00:58.079> enough<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> really<00:00:58.590> make<00:00:58.859> something

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
fine enough to really make something

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.900 
fine enough to really make something
that<00:01:00.149> well<00:01:00.449> engineered<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.559> 3d<00:01:01.980> printing<00:01:02.010> so

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
that well engineered for 3d printing so

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.160 
that well engineered for 3d printing so
this<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.149> when<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> came<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
this is when I came up with the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.550 
this is when I came up with the
two-piece<00:01:04.530> design<00:01:05.060> but<00:01:06.200> let<00:01:07.200> me<00:01:07.229> go<00:01:07.380> ahead<00:01:07.439> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
two-piece design but let me go ahead and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.450 
two-piece design but let me go ahead and
show<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.830> how<00:01:07.920> well<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:09.150> works<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.220> just

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
show you how well that works so you just

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.300 
show you how well that works so you just
put<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.880> bottom<00:01:12.840> snap<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.470> snap<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
put this bottom snap and snap in and the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.490 
put this bottom snap and snap in and the
tops<00:01:14.869> snap<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.830> easy<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.759> see<00:01:18.500> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
tops snap that easy you can see the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.070 
tops snap that easy you can see the
bottoms<00:01:20.869> top<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.140> aside<00:01:23.720> prep<00:01:24.720> that's

that's one of the bigger problems I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.859 
that's one of the bigger problems I
finding<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.790> phone<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.329> getting<00:01:33.750> that

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
finding what this phone is getting that

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.999 
finding what this phone is getting that
top<00:01:34.170> button<00:01:34.200> pressed<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:36.950> volume<00:01:37.950> rocker

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
top button pressed the volume rocker

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.390

free and clear camera button free and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.030 
free and clear camera button free and
clear<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.810> works<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.920> can

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
clear and it just works and as you can

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.840 
clear and it just works and as you can
see<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.869> very<00:01:46.140> sturdy<00:01:49.579> so<00:01:50.579> that's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
see it's on there very sturdy so that's

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.679 
see it's on there very sturdy so that's
the<00:01:51.090> current<00:01:51.689> prototype<00:01:52.560> right<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:54.509> I

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
the current prototype right here and I

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.899 
the current prototype right here and I
think<00:01:54.899> black<00:01:55.200> looks<00:01:55.500> really<00:01:55.860> good<00:01:56.100> nice

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
think black looks really good nice

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.899 
think black looks really good nice
contrast<00:01:57.540> with<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.780> blue<00:01:58.460> it's<00:01:59.460> kind<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> hard

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
contrast with the blue it's kind of hard

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.200 
contrast with the blue it's kind of hard
to<00:01:59.969> see<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.659> there<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.110> some<00:02:01.969> day<00:02:02.969> light

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
to see but there is some day light

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.719 
to see but there is some day light
shining<00:02:03.990> through<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.340> made<00:02:05.579> some

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
shining through here so I made some

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.290 
shining through here so I made some
modifications<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.600> fitment<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.290> back

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
modifications to the fitment on the back

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.119 
modifications to the fitment on the back
so<00:02:09.300> we'll<00:02:09.810> see<00:02:09.989> how<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.170> works<00:02:10.319> on<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> next

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
so we'll see how that works on the next

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.750 
so we'll see how that works on the next
and<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.670> said<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.970> next<00:02:12.120> product

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
and like I said the next product

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.940 
and like I said the next product
this<00:02:12.879> printing<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.659> on<00:02:14.019> his<00:02:14.200> way<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.379> me<00:02:14.739> it

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
this printing and on his way to me it

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.589 
this printing and on his way to me it
should<00:02:15.129> be<00:02:15.159> here<00:02:15.280> what<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.760> end<00:02:15.909> a<00:02:15.970> week<00:02:16.360> or

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
should be here what the end a week or

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.800 
should be here what the end a week or
two<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.620> if<00:02:18.459> everything<00:02:18.700> fits<00:02:19.090> then<00:02:19.540> what<00:02:19.720> I'm

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
two and if everything fits then what I'm

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.860 
two and if everything fits then what I'm
going<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.049> do<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.530> actually<00:02:21.280> give<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:22.209> couple<00:02:22.659> of

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
going to do is actually give a couple of

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.220 
going to do is actually give a couple of
these<00:02:22.989> out<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:24.150> make<00:02:25.150> sure<00:02:25.180> because<00:02:25.900> I've<00:02:26.049> got

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
these out and make sure because I've got

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.670 
these out and make sure because I've got
the<00:02:26.409> t-mobile<00:02:27.010> version<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.569> I'm<00:02:29.230> going<00:02:29.470> to

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
the t-mobile version of it I'm going to

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.350 
the t-mobile version of it I'm going to
give<00:02:30.670> two<00:02:31.569> of<00:02:31.599> my<00:02:32.349> way<00:02:32.500> one<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.670> verizon<00:02:34.329> users

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
give two of my way one to verizon users

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.280 
give two of my way one to verizon users
and<00:02:34.840> one<00:02:35.110> for<00:02:35.319> AT&amp;T<00:02:35.980> users<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.790> know<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:37.989> there

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
and one for AT&amp;T users I know that there

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.020 
and one for AT&amp;T users I know that there
should<00:02:38.680> be<00:02:38.859> no<00:02:39.010> physical<00:02:39.459> differences

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
should be no physical differences

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.199 
should be no physical differences
between<00:02:40.359> the<00:02:41.140> three<00:02:41.650> handsets<00:02:42.189> but<00:02:43.030> the

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
between the three handsets but the

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.220 
between the three handsets but the
verizon<00:02:44.019> has<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.379> inductive<00:02:45.329> charging<00:02:46.329> so<00:02:47.109> it

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
verizon has the inductive charging so it

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.869 
verizon has the inductive charging so it
might<00:02:47.470> be<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.680> little<00:02:47.859> bit<00:02:48.069> thicker<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.579> don't

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
might be a little bit thicker I don't

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.399 
might be a little bit thicker I don't
know<00:02:49.090> but<00:02:49.359> it's<00:02:49.510> one<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.780> those<00:02:49.870> things<00:02:49.930> I'd

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
know but it's one of those things I'd

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.330 
know but it's one of those things I'd
rather<00:02:50.639> test<00:02:51.639> first<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.709> also<00:02:53.709> giving<00:02:54.129> away<00:02:54.310> a

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
rather test first and also giving away a

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.530 
rather test first and also giving away a
couple<00:02:54.519> of<00:02:54.700> cases<00:02:54.909> could<00:02:55.180> be<00:02:55.239> good

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
couple of cases could be good

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.080 
couple of cases could be good
advertising<00:02:56.049> if<00:02:56.349> i<00:02:56.470> want<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.739> sell<00:02:56.920> these<00:02:57.090> so

advertising if i want to sell these so

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.800 
advertising if i want to sell these so
let's<00:02:58.959> look<00:02:59.230> at<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.620> 2.0<00:03:00.609> version<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:01.329> my

let's look at the 2.0 version of my

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:09.160 
let's look at the 2.0 version of my
design<00:03:02.170> case
