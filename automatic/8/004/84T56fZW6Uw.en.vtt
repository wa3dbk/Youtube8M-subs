little<00:01:59.369> bit<00:01:59.490> careful<00:01:59.939> because<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.329> seem<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.600> be

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
little bit careful because I seem to be

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.219 
little bit careful because I seem to be
doing<00:02:00.780> probably<00:02:01.439> too<00:02:01.950> much<00:02:02.520> damage<00:02:03.229> because

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
he's down to roughly around 55% of his

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.699 
he's down to roughly around 55% of his
health<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.069> I'm<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.119> gonna<00:02:09.270> start<00:02:09.709> chopping

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
back in and then you've got the aggro

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.110 
back in and then you've got the aggro
and<00:03:02.460> you<00:03:02.520> start<00:03:02.730> panicking<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.270> god<00:03:05.120> running

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
so things now are a little bit awkward

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.380 
so things now are a little bit awkward
because<00:03:12.810> my<00:03:13.230> pet<00:03:13.820> didn't<00:03:14.820> manage<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.180> grab<00:03:15.360> a

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
maybe take off some of the aggro which

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.390 
maybe take off some of the aggro which
it<00:04:09.480> didn't<00:04:09.960> so<00:04:10.620> I'm<00:04:10.770> now<00:04:10.980> getting<00:04:11.310> the

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
it didn't so I'm now getting the

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.890 

that<00:04:20.530> was<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:20.980> tricky<00:04:21.430> one<00:04:21.579> that<00:04:21.910> nearly<00:04:22.330> got

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
that was the tricky one that nearly got

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.200 
that was the tricky one that nearly got
really<00:04:23.740> really<00:04:24.070> awkward<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:24.670> was<00:04:24.820> actually

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
really really awkward that was actually

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.930 
really really awkward that was actually
a<00:04:25.240> one<00:04:25.510> shot<00:04:25.930> which<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.830> was<00:04:26.980> rather<00:04:27.220> happy<00:04:27.730> with

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
a one shot which I was rather happy with

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.990 
a one shot which I was rather happy with
but<00:04:28.510> my<00:04:28.840> goodness<00:04:29.350> I<00:04:29.680> made<00:04:29.980> hard<00:04:30.340> work<00:04:30.610> of<00:04:30.850> that

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
but my goodness I made hard work of that

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.060 
but my goodness I made hard work of that
achievement<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.690> again<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.260> felt<00:04:32.620> rather

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
achievement and again it felt rather

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.920 
achievement and again it felt rather
satisfying<00:04:33.880> because<00:04:34.150> it's<00:04:34.450> something<00:04:34.660> that

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
satisfying because it's something that

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.530 
satisfying because it's something that
could<00:04:35.320> have<00:04:35.470> gone<00:04:35.590> wrong<00:04:36.370> so<00:04:37.120> there<00:04:37.270> we<00:04:37.360> go

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
could have gone wrong so there we go

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.409 
could have gone wrong so there we go
the<00:04:38.230> empowered<00:04:38.889> spiritualist<00:04:39.790> if<00:04:39.910> I<00:04:40.000> can<00:04:40.150> find
