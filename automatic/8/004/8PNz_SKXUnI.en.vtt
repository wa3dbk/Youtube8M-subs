00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.089 
about my new book through my eyes well
my<00:00:12.480> philosophy<00:00:12.660> since<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.469> was<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.620> little<00:00:13.950> boy

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
my philosophy since I was a little boy

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.919 
my philosophy since I was a little boy
it's<00:00:14.370> hard<00:00:14.580> work<00:00:14.820> beats<00:00:15.059> talent<00:00:15.210> when<00:00:15.570> talent

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
it's hard work beats talent when talent

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.720 
it's hard work beats talent when talent
oh<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.139> work<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.410> hard<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.890> think<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> biggest

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
oh and work is hard I think the biggest

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.269 
oh and work is hard I think the biggest
example<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.390> how<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> go<00:00:19.050> about<00:00:19.080> living<00:00:20.070> every

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
example is how I go about living every

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.880 
example is how I go about living every
day<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.730> honestly<00:00:21.150> practicing<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.320> when

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
day and honestly practicing and when

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.320 
day and honestly practicing and when
people<00:00:23.039> say<00:00:23.279> why<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.609> practice<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.119> hard

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
people say why do you practice so hard

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.240

or I messed up the call in the huddle
and<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.450> called<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.470> why<00:01:13.650> this

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and I called this and this is why this

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.980 
and I called this and this is why this
play<00:01:13.979> happened<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> rest<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.840> like

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
play happened and just the rest of like

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
play happened and just the rest of like
that<00:01:16.229> that's<00:01:16.439> pretty<00:01:16.590> goofy<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.340> really

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
that that's pretty goofy and it's really

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.730 
that that's pretty goofy and it's really
funny<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.600> look<00:01:18.780> back<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.229> think<00:01:19.409> about

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
funny to to look back and think about

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.370 
funny to to look back and think about
when<00:01:20.640> my<00:01:20.820> dad<00:01:21.060> has<00:01:21.240> had<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.420> huge<00:01:21.630> impact<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.259> my

when my dad has had a huge impact on my
life<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.490> because<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.820> what<00:01:24.270> he's<00:01:24.450> told

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659

me

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
me

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.700 
me
but<00:01:26.220> because<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> example<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.420> he<00:01:27.600> was<00:01:27.840> in

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
but because the example that he was in

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.710 
but because the example that he was in
front<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.250> me<00:01:29.369> every<00:01:29.640> day<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.299> know<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.540> wasn't
