 links in the information box 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.619
 I wake up at eight o'clock and 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.779
 fourth 8 and 20 and although it costs me 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.339
 lot detach the covers me 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.169
 awareness that everything to get out of the 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.169
 bed because if not I do not arrive to class 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.300
 I leave that for the clothes of the night 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.800
 previous so as not to have to lose 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.440
 time to start that I put all the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.440
 mornings I pick up my clothes and go to get dressed 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.010
 once dressed she lifted the blind and 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.269
 He opened the window so that he turned a little 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.269
 the room and the bed 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.040
 and while this idea, I'm going to 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.040
 Makeup 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.160
 a life that is one-sided and very simple 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.480
 I almost did not waste time on it first thing 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.060
 What I do is pick up my hair and 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.800
 pulling away from the face and apply to me 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.810
 what these are from bottega verde de 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.810
 light shade of moon on the fabric 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.360
 They are highly recommended I recommend 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.550
 very much 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.780
 then he applied a little blush of a 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.780
 little bit of color to the face 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.780
 and we passed our eyes I select a shadow 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.520
 clear and below the eyebrow under the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.450
 eyebrow arch applied it to me 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.450
 illuminate the look 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.010
 then with a copper-colored shadow 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.390
 I frame the eye socket to give more 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.390
 depth to the look 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.050
 and finally as a shade a color 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.899
 green finally to end the 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.990
 shadows because I apply it just flush 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.090
 tabs to make them more numerous than 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.130
 it's a visual effect that makes our 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.500
 line of tabs look bigger is 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.030
 like a checkerboard blur and a little 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.030
 the eyelashes to lift 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.640
 and so if last of all you 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.640
 applied the mascara 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.250
 and this is the end result something very 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.250
 simple very natural 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.470
 then I make the bed with his asset and he goes 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.470
 to do but good is necessary 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.970
 and like all kitchens 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.209
 it's my particular milestone 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.760
 and that 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.420
 elbows me sing these boots one 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.420
 better sab 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.170
 and have breakfast like I do not have much time 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.410
 breakfast something very base with a cup of 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.010
 milk with something accompanying then step 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.010
 to brush my teeth 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.930
 for rocks 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.319
 and throw me colony 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.980
 and finally I take my coat this is from 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.970

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.970
 warm 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.250
 the look of that day was something very, very 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.000
 simple to go to school 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.000
 as you can see 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.709
 like my backpack 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.390
 and it's ready to go, I hope that 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.180
