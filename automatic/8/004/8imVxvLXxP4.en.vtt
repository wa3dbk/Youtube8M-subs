that you can go into the code and here
and<00:06:05.930> they<00:06:06.050> are<00:06:06.080> edit<00:06:06.470> a<00:06:06.530> couple<00:06:06.830> things<00:06:06.980> that

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
and they are edit a couple things that

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.870 
and they are edit a couple things that
you<00:06:07.430> might<00:06:07.580> know<00:06:07.900> like<00:06:08.900> um<00:06:09.230> like<00:06:12.640> these<00:06:13.640> things

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
you might know like um like these things

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.210 
you might know like um like these things
obviously<00:06:14.420> need<00:06:14.690> division<00:06:15.470> in<00:06:15.560> the<00:06:15.680> page<00:06:15.920> and

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
obviously need division in the page and

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.490 
obviously need division in the page and
this<00:06:16.340> is<00:06:16.490> what<00:06:16.670> causes<00:06:16.850> little<00:06:17.390> spaces<00:06:18.140> in

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
this is what causes little spaces in

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.890 
this is what causes little spaces in
here<00:06:18.850> so<00:06:19.850> you<00:06:19.910> could<00:06:20.180> if<00:06:20.330> you<00:06:20.360> need<00:06:20.600> some<00:06:20.810> extra

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
here so you could if you need some extra

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.360 
here so you could if you need some extra
space<00:06:21.230> you<00:06:21.440> could<00:06:21.530> add<00:06:21.710> those<00:06:21.980> in<00:06:22.160> there

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
space you could add those in there

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.430 
space you could add those in there
whatever<00:06:23.210> most<00:06:23.780> of<00:06:23.870> you<00:06:23.960> gonna<00:06:24.110> be<00:06:24.200> able<00:06:24.260> to<00:06:24.380> do

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
whatever most of you gonna be able to do

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.510 
whatever most of you gonna be able to do
from<00:06:24.650> design<00:06:24.980> there<00:06:26.260> all<00:06:27.260> right<00:06:27.410> uh<00:06:27.590> paiva

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
from design there all right uh paiva

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.390 
from design there all right uh paiva
cons<00:06:28.760> okay<00:06:29.180> uh<00:06:29.800> one<00:06:30.800> of<00:06:30.890> the<00:06:30.950> coolest<00:06:31.160> little
