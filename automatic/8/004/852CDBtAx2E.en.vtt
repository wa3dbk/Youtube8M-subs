00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.890
 It is a navigation to 

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:10.950
 see Lars Name Entry Collection Blog 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.950
 I know that code 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:21.380
 re 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:24.320
 3 wings of Nichinichi in the old man was over over over over Suites keyboard bothering everyone in the 400'm quite another this 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.950
 Is the 4th morning cd 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:32.350
 Everybody's fashionable club An-Marika tea 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.350
 Would not you say married woman's hairdo is kind of riding 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.510
 Had 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:47.550
 It cuffs beating of guitar three Island to introduce 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:50.550
 Thank you wish to you I'm not confident it can successfully explained Datte hole when I saved the food 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.980
 Gave me 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.170
 It is very embarrassing to be told such a thing 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.020
 So what should I explain 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.620
 Oh my, I'm going to take something else 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:10.410
 I have already made many songs What is that question now 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:17.250
 I because it important to was Yeah certainly but it is not wrong 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:21.230
 In about But Well also code a little code is what makes the atmosphere of the music 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.500
 It can be said that a woman is also a lump because the ministers piled up 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:29.530
 For example, suppose that there is a piece of painting 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:34.330
 Although the paintings are we drawn a person facing here in Manmen sense 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:37.690
 Once you have a very, very horrible feeling in the background is very dark forest 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.320
 I feel like I see it in the wisdom enter 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:45.280
 It feels like something really amazing 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:49.380
 It became too are people of strong forcibly Omg smile 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:55.500
 It seems that you feel something more than that absolutely 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:58.979
 I what I would do is the difference if there is something a little absolute Yeah I think you pounding 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.420
 I've been very excited to think 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.900
 The face turns red just a little while ahead 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.100
 It is a dark forest 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.420
 Let's enter 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.100
 It was thought that still do not eat my apples to the lever's 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.500
 Well it's different 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:24.580
 I'm sorry what's different 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:26.490
 8 people you have fun and the music to its be integrated in the melody is likened to the code 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:33.180
 I can do it 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:35.300
 The code is also very important in making music as the background is important in determining the overall atmosphere in paintings 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.770
 It is very important 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.280
 It's something that determines the atmosphere like a background of the picture code, such as 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:47.209
 Hey 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:49.310
 I have a variety of types of code in to yes, but basically stable and unstable of sound 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:54.220
 It can be divided into types 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.220
 It's a little difficult, and stability is tonic 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.360
 The stability is said to be dominant ok Hato Minako 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.520
 Hmm 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.660
 Music is creating an atmosphere like this tonic and dominant jigsaw puzzle 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.490
 I 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.569
 The puzzle 6 chord progression and say you and to everyone was coral such as the ring's like a puzzle 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.030
 combination 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.640
 I will make the background of the picture 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:23.879
 Is it that the say chord progression 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:27.030
 But But when likened to the sound I say Saki-chan questionnaire 4 Te' wonder if feels the 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:30.300
 The simplest example is a presentation 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:36.610
 It is a stand up seat and is highly advanced 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:40.300
 Sea j 7 it made me fourth place but this is to the Sonics dominant 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:46.210
 It is a puzzle of the most basic atmosphere combined with 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:47.450
 I'm not sit certainly calm After replacing the sound of the portrait of deceased person and a search operation 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.750
 Hmm 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.750
 Yup 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.920
 Puzzles I have that so I'm able to another to be the puzzle piece is there is all kinds 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.310
 The 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:08.080
 Did you mean also to some of stabilizing such unusual 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:09.880
 Taking also hit Toka little only unstable Toka very unstable Toka very, very judgment 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.890
 Even take 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.300
 that 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:21.390
 I'm getting very uneasy 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:23.850
 I wonder if it was really good for me I wonder if it helps me and everyone 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.930
 I have two rice 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.930
 Baby's and everybody 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.560
 I am very good at me 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.020
 Ah ah ah ah
