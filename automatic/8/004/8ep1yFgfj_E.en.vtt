think what the marketplace is telling us

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.870 
think what the marketplace is telling us
now<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.370> whether<00:02:36.950> Fed<00:02:37.950> chief<00:02:38.190> Bernanke

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
now is that whether Fed chief Bernanke

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.570 
now is that whether Fed chief Bernanke
