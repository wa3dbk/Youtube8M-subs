account in my channel for years now and

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.750 
account in my channel for years now and
I<00:04:40.750> don't<00:04:41.650> know<00:04:41.800> just<00:04:42.100> one<00:04:42.310> day<00:04:42.430> I<00:04:42.460> just<00:04:42.520> decided

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
I don't know just one day I just decided

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.030 
I don't know just one day I just decided
that<00:04:43.540> I<00:04:43.720> wanted<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.110> start<00:04:44.290> making<00:04:44.650> videos<00:04:44.680> on

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
that I wanted to start making videos on

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:57.690 
that I wanted to start making videos on
my<00:04:45.190> own<00:04:45.310> so<00:04:46.270> I<00:04:46.300> guess<00:04:46.570> how<00:04:46.690> you<00:04:46.750> hold<00:04:47.200> it

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.510 

here<00:04:58.330> we<00:04:58.450> go<00:05:01.890> mpeg-4<00:05:02.890> I<00:05:03.100> guess<00:05:03.280> that's<00:05:03.460> the

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
here we go mpeg-4 I guess that's the

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.910 
here we go mpeg-4 I guess that's the
format<00:05:03.970> it<00:05:04.090> recording<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:05.710> thing's

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
format it recording and this thing's

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.050 
format it recording and this thing's
thin<00:05:06.510> it's<00:05:07.510> really<00:05:07.750> like<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:08.850> hope<00:05:09.850> I<00:05:10.000> don't

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
thin it's really like to hope I don't

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.650 
thin it's really like to hope I don't
drop<00:05:10.330> it<00:05:10.420> but<00:05:10.930> yeah<00:05:11.110> it's<00:05:11.290> pretty<00:05:11.440> cool<00:05:11.740> i<00:05:12.660> like
