and<00:01:57.780> honestly<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.770> you're<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> PC<00:01:59.430> gamer<00:01:59.670> and

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
and honestly if you're a PC gamer and

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.319 
and honestly if you're a PC gamer and
you<00:02:01.229> know<00:02:01.350> every<00:02:02.159> game<00:02:02.369> now<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.939> starting<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
you know every game now is starting to

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.149 
you know every game now is starting to
have<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> Linux<00:02:03.960> variation<00:02:04.500> why<00:02:04.770> wouldn't<00:02:05.070> you

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
have a Linux variation why wouldn't you

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.389 
have a Linux variation why wouldn't you
switch<00:02:05.399> Linux<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.810> my<00:02:07.170> opinion<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.039> lot<00:02:08.250> of

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
switch Linux in my opinion and a lot of

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.119 
switch Linux in my opinion and a lot of
other<00:02:09.179> people<00:02:09.720> I've<00:02:10.050> been<00:02:10.200> able<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.470> replicate

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
other people I've been able to replicate

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.910 
other people I've been able to replicate
it<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.530> all<00:02:13.530> these

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
it is that on all these

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.800 
it is that on all these
games<00:02:14.160> are<00:02:14.400> running<00:02:14.730> better<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:15.060> linux<00:02:15.390> i<00:02:15.599> get

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
games are running better on linux i get

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.050 
games are running better on linux i get
a<00:02:15.840> better<00:02:16.050> frame<00:02:16.440> rate<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.860> Team<00:02:17.640> Fortress<00:02:17.670> 2

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
a better frame rate in Team Fortress 2

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.870 
a better frame rate in Team Fortress 2
in<00:02:18.510> Linux<00:02:19.200> than<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.620> do<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.800> windows<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.489> that's

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
in Linux than I do in windows and that's

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.809 
in Linux than I do in windows and that's
what<00:02:21.030> max<00:02:21.209> settings<00:02:21.560> now<00:02:22.560> granite<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.400> the

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
what max settings now granite is the

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.850 
what max settings now granite is the
difference<00:02:24.150> between<00:02:24.180> OpenGL<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.140> DirectX

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
difference between OpenGL and DirectX

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.860 
difference between OpenGL and DirectX
but<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.520> don't<00:02:26.849> know<00:02:26.940> even<00:02:27.420> really<00:02:27.660> know<00:02:27.780> if

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
but I don't know even really know if

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.630 
but I don't know even really know if
there<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.140> comparison<00:02:29.130> there<00:02:29.600> anyway<00:02:30.600> uh<00:02:31.640> I

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
there is comparison there anyway uh I

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.979 
there is comparison there anyway uh I
believe<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.970> was<00:02:33.030> Chris<00:02:33.239> Pirillo<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.810> pretty

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
believe it was Chris Pirillo that pretty

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.960 
believe it was Chris Pirillo that pretty
much<00:02:34.170> said<00:02:34.440> if<00:02:34.800> you're<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.069> PC<00:02:35.459> gamer<00:02:35.640> what

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
much said if you're a PC gamer what

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.449 
much said if you're a PC gamer what
doesn't<00:02:36.330> matter<00:02:36.510> what<00:02:37.380> operating<00:02:38.040> system

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
doesn't matter what operating system

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.890 
doesn't matter what operating system
you're<00:02:38.819> on<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:41.239> anyway<00:02:42.239> I'm<00:02:42.510> gonna<00:02:42.660> try<00:02:42.840> to

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
you're on so anyway I'm gonna try to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.610 
you're on so anyway I'm gonna try to
show<00:02:43.170> footage<00:02:43.950> here<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:45.950> playing<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.190> but<00:02:47.580> I

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
show footage here of playing it but I

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.229 
show footage here of playing it but I
don't<00:02:49.620> know<00:02:49.800> how<00:02:50.040> well<00:02:50.250> that'll<00:02:50.519> work<00:02:50.670> because

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
don't know how well that'll work because

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.170 
don't know how well that'll work because
the<00:02:51.420> game<00:02:51.569> itself<00:02:51.720> runs<00:02:52.140> fine<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.220> from<00:02:54.000> my

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
the game itself runs fine and from my

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.020 
the game itself runs fine and from my
point<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.480> view<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.810> will<00:02:54.930> run<00:02:55.110> fine<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:56.030> the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
point of view it will run fine is the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.360 
point of view it will run fine is the
recording<00:02:57.569> software<00:02:57.840> for<00:02:58.709> linux<00:02:58.739> isn't<00:02:59.250> that

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
recording software for linux isn't that

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.600 
recording software for linux isn't that
great<00:02:59.549> and<00:03:00.380> I<00:03:01.380> don't<00:03:01.830> know<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.190> it'll<00:03:02.370> capture

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
great and I don't know if it'll capture

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.940 
great and I don't know if it'll capture
well<00:03:02.970> enough<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:03.989> i'm<00:03:04.200> just<00:03:04.230> going<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.530> load<00:03:04.739> up

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
well enough so i'm just going to load up

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.860 
well enough so i'm just going to load up
a<00:03:05.100> game<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.760> doesn't<00:03:06.120> i'm<00:03:06.299> not<00:03:06.510> going<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.720> look

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
a game it doesn't i'm not going to look

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.050 
a game it doesn't i'm not going to look
for<00:03:07.110> network<00:03:08.040> or<00:03:08.220> anything<00:03:08.489> like<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.670> and

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
for network or anything like that and

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.520 
for network or anything like that and
god<00:03:09.750> this<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:10.049> incredibly<00:03:10.470> loud<00:03:11.630> but<00:03:12.630> for<00:03:13.350> you

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
god this is incredibly loud but for you

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.280 
god this is incredibly loud but for you
i<00:03:13.560> have<00:03:13.950> no<00:03:14.100> idea<00:03:14.220> how<00:03:14.549> this<00:03:14.730> looks<00:03:15.000> for<00:03:15.989> me<00:03:16.170> it

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
i have no idea how this looks for me it

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.410 
i have no idea how this looks for me it
looks<00:03:16.470> seamless<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:19.730> i'm<00:03:20.730> out<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.060> x<00:03:21.180> zone

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
looks seamless and i'm out of the x zone

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:32.240 
looks seamless and i'm out of the x zone
i<00:03:21.480> guess<00:03:22.190> hey<00:03:23.780> but<00:03:24.780> i<00:03:25.459> don't<00:03:26.459> know<00:03:27.920> it's

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.090 

and<00:03:33.250> again<00:03:34.000> this<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.330> based<00:03:34.540> off<00:03:34.750> of<00:03:34.810> the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
and again this is based off of the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.100 
and again this is based off of the
half-life<00:03:36.100> engine<00:03:36.490> and<00:03:36.640> not<00:03:36.850> anything<00:03:37.840> in

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
half-life engine and not anything in

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.070 
half-life engine and not anything in
particular<00:03:38.940> like<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.360> source<00:03:40.600> engine<00:03:40.810> or

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
particular like the source engine or

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.170 
particular like the source engine or
anything<00:03:41.350> so<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:41.650> is<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:41.860> fairly<00:03:42.340> old<00:03:42.640> game

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.420 

okay<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:47.110> I<00:03:47.140> just<00:03:47.320> wanted<00:03:47.590> some<00:03:47.800> footage<00:03:48.160> there

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
okay so I just wanted some footage there

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.050 
okay so I just wanted some footage there
to<00:03:48.790> show<00:03:49.000> off<00:03:49.270> how<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.750> actually<00:03:50.020> runs<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:51.060> if

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
to show off how it actually runs and if

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.790 
to show off how it actually runs and if
it<00:03:52.270> looks<00:03:52.600> choppy<00:03:52.990> because<00:03:53.440> I'm<00:03:53.650> probably

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
it looks choppy because I'm probably

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.070 
it looks choppy because I'm probably
just<00:03:53.920> going<00:03:54.130> to<00:03:54.220> upload<00:03:54.459> this<00:03:54.700> as<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.120> but<00:03:55.959> if

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
just going to upload this as is but if

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.440 
just going to upload this as is but if
it<00:03:56.140> looks<00:03:56.380> choppy<00:03:56.650> it's<00:03:57.070> really<00:03:57.340> not<00:03:57.459> because

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
it looks choppy it's really not because

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.290 
it looks choppy it's really not because
it's<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.470> recording<00:04:00.340> software<00:04:00.520> it's<00:04:00.850> not<00:04:01.030> the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
it's the recording software it's not the

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.600 
it's the recording software it's not the
game<00:04:01.480> itself<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:02.500> game<00:04:02.620> itself<00:04:02.860> runs<00:04:03.100> smooth

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
game itself the game itself runs smooth

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.260 
game itself the game itself runs smooth
I<00:04:04.980> don't<00:04:05.980> know<00:04:06.070> smooth<00:04:06.489> is<00:04:06.700> very<00:04:06.970> smooth

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
I don't know smooth is very smooth

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.360 
I don't know smooth is very smooth
objects<00:04:08.340> ball<00:04:09.340> bearings<00:04:10.830> but<00:04:11.830> yeah<00:04:11.950> also

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
objects ball bearings but yeah also

much I think everything has linux now
even<00:04:30.669> gen<00:04:30.970> 2<00:04:31.180> which<00:04:32.310> that's<00:04:33.310> actually<00:04:33.760> scary

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
even gen 2 which that's actually scary
