over on the crease I sketch out half of
a<00:00:52.710> thin

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.000 

cut<00:00:58.340> it<00:00:58.490> out<00:00:58.660> line<00:00:59.660> it<00:00:59.840> up<00:00:59.960> with<00:01:00.380> the<00:01:00.560> edge<00:01:00.740> of

cut out and save it for later at the
seam<00:01:07.010> allowance<00:01:07.550> to<00:01:08.240> make<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.720> pattern<00:01:09.200> cut

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
seam allowance to make the pattern cut

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.550 
seam allowance to make the pattern cut
it<00:01:10.100> out<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.610> we<00:01:11.420> made<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.810> pattern<00:01:12.230> a<00:01:12.410> little

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
it out and we made the pattern a little

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.620 
it out and we made the pattern a little
larger<00:01:13.100> than<00:01:13.130> needed<00:01:13.640> because<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:14.150> is<00:01:14.270> always

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
larger than needed because it is always

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.230 
larger than needed because it is always
easier<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.110> size<00:01:15.410> a<00:01:15.680> garment<00:01:16.100> down<00:01:16.310> than<00:01:16.940> it<00:01:17.060> is

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
easier to size a garment down than it is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.420 
easier to size a garment down than it is
to<00:01:17.540> try<00:01:17.690> to<00:01:17.750> size<00:01:18.080> it<00:01:18.290> up<00:01:18.380> take<00:01:18.980> your<00:01:19.160> fabric

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
to try to size it up take your fabric

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.430 
to try to size it up take your fabric
and<00:01:19.850> figure<00:01:20.180> out<00:01:20.210> which<00:01:20.570> way<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.990> stretches

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
and figure out which way it stretches

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.380 
and figure out which way it stretches
better<00:01:21.680> because<00:01:22.370> I<00:01:22.490> want<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.790> stretchy<00:01:23.060> side

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
better because I want the stretchy side

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.290 
better because I want the stretchy side
to<00:01:23.750> go<00:01:23.870> across<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.650> docks<00:01:24.920> tips<00:01:25.310> place<00:01:26.090> the
