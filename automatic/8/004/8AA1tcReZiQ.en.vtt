00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.290
 I am very glad to see you today on my 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.240
 channel i keep shooting video about sae 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.960
 I have a few perfumes 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.130
 vials but also divide them into 2 videos 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.220
 today's video will be only two 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.260
 flavor but next in the second video about 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.939
 there will be several perfumes 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.010
 flakonchikov but they belong to one 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.570
 brand but if you are interested in such 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.460
 topic then keep looking and so in 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.309
 Today's video, I will talk about two 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.540
 flavors and these flavors are divided for 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.000
 me on two poles 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.790
 I like one ramat I use it with 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.850
 pleasure and the second flavor is not for me 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.680
 I liked them very rarely 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.340
 I use I can say that almost 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.469
 I don't use it 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.230
 aroma that did not suit me 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.039
 fragrance that is not mine 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.840
 a continuation 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.460
 and even practically i don't like it 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.500
 the aroma from bulgari i think that everything 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.659
 know perfectly well that bulgaria is one of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.729
 the most famous one of the oldest and 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.460
 millions of homes but he also does 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.810
 and beautiful perfumery called glad 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.930
 maybe mine alex kiz is the sequel 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.229
 chain of flavors but jasmina but 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.030
 exquise didn't become water for me 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.430
 delightful not exquisite water though 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 it is exactly the same as stated 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.350
 delicious gourmet 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.900
 seductive and bright 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.060
 water is the main note of this fragrance 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.500
 of course is jasmine and here 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.880
 Jasmine very ordinary and I 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.909
 grandiflora and here also 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.380
 there is an interesting jasmine sambac 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.090
 and it is all intertwined with such a cocktail 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.939
 tartness with warm white tea 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:00.060
 but the very first notes of the initial notes are 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:04.770
 tart this is a bitter almond and just 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.170
 still such bitter citrus too 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.660
 notes washed and here is this whole cocktail 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.590
 intertwined with flower arrangement 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.569
 jasmine 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.510
 and give probably this one just the same 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.510
 exquisite sophistication and delight 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.519
 but in last place and and completes the whole 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.640
 this composition woody notes they 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.879
 heat is also not tartness and 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.720
 Of course, where is the good flavor without 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:34.709
 white musk he's warm enough he's 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.900
 lends a sophisticated flavor like this and 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.629
 declared and just the same lies 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.730
 close enough to the body but for me this 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.970
 the water did not become refined not 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.299
 delicious dim 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.660
 don't plume you are my favorite scent only 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.670
 because he is just bitter to me 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.099
 I can't even apply it to him 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.470
 in other words I can not say that he does not 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.879
 floral yes there is revealed beautiful 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.250
 with him after a while but on 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:06.629
 throughout the time of disclosure 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.060
 the aroma i feel the astrology pamela i 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.069
 feel the tartness of almond that me 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.819
 very confused for me this scent 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:18.510
 simply 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:22.079
 bitter he has to gently find such here 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.660
 flower background well it's all the same 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:28.920
 like something about enveloped some 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.930
 bitterness some hard woody 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.349
 notes but unfortunately for me 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:39.510
 probably it is too saturated too 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:41.880
 bitter too not my flavor 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.049
 if you like these flavors if you 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.299
 love almonds in the beginning if you like 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:51.079
 citrus some compositions started 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.889
 flavor if you like it to be 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:58.560
 warmly bitterly bitterly then probably 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.750
 this fragrance is for you for me in all 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.639
 this composition is the place to be only 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.480
 look what a terrific bottle 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:09.419
 vials me feeling like he's made a form 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.340
 I do not know the female figure always bulgari 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.930
 they have beautiful lids and 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.180
 of course this exquisite bow he 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.609
 also adds some such 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.680
 piquancy is very beautiful flacon very 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.230
 exquisite such a direction to me 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.970
 madly like the bottle itself 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.800
 Unfortunately, the fragrance is not mine but a bottle 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.860
 i think for a while it's just mine 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.630
 the dressing table but now it will go 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.470
 about the aroma which I really like 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.510
 fragrance which is mine 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.940
 a suggestion aroma which is me now 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.830
 blocks 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:50.330
 now just strangling me with his 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.200
 by her sexy temptation 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.780
 Yu.i. 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.520
 This is the aroma of such a beaker from 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.310
 store rive gosh which as far as i 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.350
 I remember rubles or 100 I have this scent 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.390
 which is called white musk and 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.440
 it is this white musk I consider 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:08.150
 absolutely greta on the site read about 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.580
 the fact that there are some flowers to lie 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:15.260
 lie lie italy jasmine but honestly i 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:17.690
 and someone else good I have not read 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.970
 feels no flower but this is such 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.280
 give one hundred percent white musk 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.760
 of course it is synthesized if you donâ€™t 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.650
 you know that mu taste is the secretion of glands 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.950
 certain animals to attract 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.790
 of the opposite sex and of course 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:38.390
 it is these animal secretions for 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.370
 to make one white out of them 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.700
 musk that we love so much 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.600
 it costs a fortune but all that is possible 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.060
 synthesize 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.810
 placed here and called just the same 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.210
 white musk 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.900
 this aroma is warm this aroma 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.420
 enveloping this fragrance is very 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:00.590
 seductive and very sexy it 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.740
 the scent of pure linen is the scent of pure 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:08.110
 the body is the scent of a girl in a white dress 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:11.090
 maybe it's even a fragrance in moments 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.250
 sexual tension at the moment 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.840
 sexual arousal because 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.590
 it is white musk just the same 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.480
 are those components which 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:24.350
 attracts the opposite sex because 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:28.310
 that the idea of it so that part of the 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:31.190
 the component that extracts from itself 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:34.370
 animals for attraction take a look 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.500
 I like her white musk madly 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.840
 they like other scent when he 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.410
 cheat when he stays on the body it is very 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.780
 very nice it is very alluring and can 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.150
