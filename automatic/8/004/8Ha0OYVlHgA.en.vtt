00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
all right this is the third 7.3 meter

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.059 
all right this is the third 7.3 meter
that<00:00:03.090> we've<00:00:03.419> gotten<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.080> week<00:00:04.350> and

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
that we've gotten in this week and

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.710 
that we've gotten in this week and
they've<00:00:05.190> all<00:00:05.400> had<00:00:05.430> coolant<00:00:06.120> leaks<00:00:06.330> at<00:00:06.600> the

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
they've all had coolant leaks at the

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.410 
they've all had coolant leaks at the
thermostat<00:00:07.259> housing<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.980> they<00:00:08.580> also<00:00:08.760> all<00:00:09.120> had

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
thermostat housing and they also all had

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.350 
thermostat housing and they also all had
new<00:00:09.719> aftermarket<00:00:10.290> water<00:00:10.769> pumps<00:00:11.160> on<00:00:11.309> him<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:12.269> I

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
new aftermarket water pumps on him so I

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.470 
new aftermarket water pumps on him so I
figured<00:00:13.250> the<00:00:14.250> aftermarket<00:00:14.940> ones<00:00:15.240> aren't

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
figured the aftermarket ones aren't

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.900 
figured the aftermarket ones aren't
sealing<00:00:15.900> very<00:00:16.109> very<00:00:16.529> well<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:17.100> want<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.760> show

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
sealing very very well I want to show

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.000 
sealing very very well I want to show
you<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.090> couple<00:00:18.359> things<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.779> look<00:00:18.930> for<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
you a couple things to look for and a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.740 
you a couple things to look for and a
difference<00:00:20.460> why<00:00:20.880> we're<00:00:21.150> having<00:00:21.270> issues<00:00:21.539> with

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
difference why we're having issues with

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.380 
difference why we're having issues with
them<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:23.220> first<00:00:23.609> thing<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.789> want<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.000> do<00:00:24.180> is

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
them so first thing we want to do is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.689 
them so first thing we want to do is
verify<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.109> leak<00:00:25.350> usually<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.430> see<00:00:26.670> it

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
verify the leak usually you see it

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.040 
verify the leak usually you see it
around<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> base<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.510> thermostat

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
around the base of the thermostat

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.990 
around the base of the thermostat
housing<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:29.099> sometimes<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.670> want<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.910> look

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
housing and sometimes you want to look

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.429 
housing and sometimes you want to look
close<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.510> they<00:00:30.630> could<00:00:30.660> be<00:00:30.960> coming<00:00:31.230> out<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
close to they could be coming out of the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.910 
close to they could be coming out of the
back<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:33.079> thermostat<00:00:34.079> housing<00:00:34.230> area<00:00:34.680> and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
back of the thermostat housing area and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.130 
back of the thermostat housing area and
going<00:00:35.219> around<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:36.239> back<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> front<00:00:36.899> cover

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
going around the back of the front cover

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.080 
going around the back of the front cover
and<00:00:37.829> making<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.190> look<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.640> might<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.910> that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
and making it look like it might be that

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.690 
and making it look like it might be that
so<00:00:39.600> inspect<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.620> really<00:00:41.010> close<00:00:41.280> around<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
so inspect it really close around the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.299 
so inspect it really close around the
hose<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.719> imple<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.469> where<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.800> thermostat

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
hose can imple and where the thermostat

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.690 
hose can imple and where the thermostat
housing<00:00:44.489> meets<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> water<00:00:45.239> pump<00:00:45.539> next

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
housing meets the water pump next

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.750 
housing meets the water pump next
inspect<00:00:47.700> your<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:49.020> thermostat<00:00:49.530> housing<00:00:49.760> and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
inspect your the thermostat housing and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180 
inspect your the thermostat housing and
check<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.149> see<00:00:51.210> if<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.480> warped<00:00:51.980> make<00:00:52.980> sure

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
check and see if it's warped make sure

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.740 
check and see if it's warped make sure
you've<00:00:53.370> got<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.699> good<00:00:54.059> flat<00:00:54.780> surface<00:00:55.410> at<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> time

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
you've got a good flat surface at a time

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.540 
you've got a good flat surface at a time
where<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.809> seals<00:00:58.079> there<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.039> make<00:00:59.250> sure<00:00:59.399> that

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
where it seals there and make sure that

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.240 
where it seals there and make sure that
it's<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.789> too<00:01:00.059> pitted<00:01:00.480> or<00:01:00.629> rusted<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:02.070> one

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
it's not too pitted or rusted this one

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.479 
it's not too pitted or rusted this one
looks<00:01:02.430> pretty<00:01:02.609> good<00:01:03.860> okay<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
looks pretty good okay here we have the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.550 
looks pretty good okay here we have the
two<00:01:05.790> thermostats<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.229> market

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
two thermostats so you have to market

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.810 
two thermostats so you have to market
one<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.100> was<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.700> was

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
one here that was in there that was

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.090 
one here that was in there that was
leaking<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.960> design<00:01:10.439> was<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.890> an<00:01:10.979> o-ring

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
leaking this design was just an o-ring

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.230 
leaking this design was just an o-ring
on<00:01:11.430> top

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
on top

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.120 
on top
and<00:01:13.720> then<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:14.049> other<00:01:14.200> one<00:01:14.409> here's<00:01:14.650> a<00:01:14.710> Ford

and then the other one here's a Ford

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.890 
and then the other one here's a Ford
where<00:01:15.820> you<00:01:15.909> see<00:01:16.060> it<00:01:16.150> actually<00:01:16.210> has<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.479> seal

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
where you see it actually has a seal

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.170 
where you see it actually has a seal
that<00:01:17.710> encompasses<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.369> whole<00:01:18.400> thermostat

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
that encompasses the whole thermostat

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.000 
that encompasses the whole thermostat
and<00:01:19.390> goes<00:01:19.540> all<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.690> way<00:01:19.750> around<00:01:19.900> it<00:01:20.290> I<00:01:20.530> have<00:01:20.950> a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
and goes all the way around it I have a

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.859 
and goes all the way around it I have a
lot<00:01:21.220> better<00:01:21.400> luck<00:01:21.550> with<00:01:22.119> the<00:01:22.300> genuine<00:01:22.630> whining

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
lot better luck with the genuine whining

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.020 
lot better luck with the genuine whining
like<00:01:22.990> this<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.369> I'm<00:01:24.430> going<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.580> go<00:01:24.700> ahead<00:01:24.880> and

like this so I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.780 
like this so I'm going to go ahead and
put<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.300> thermostat<00:01:25.840> in<00:01:26.310> clean<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:27.430> all<00:01:27.580> off

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
put the thermostat in clean it all off

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.290 
put the thermostat in clean it all off
and<00:01:28.119> verify<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:29.140> leaks<00:01:29.950> taken<00:01:30.610> care<00:01:30.790> of<00:01:30.820> okay

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
and verify that leaks taken care of okay

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.630 
and verify that leaks taken care of okay
we've<00:01:31.690> got<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.050> new<00:01:32.200> genuine<00:01:32.710> thermostat<00:01:33.460> in

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
we've got the new genuine thermostat in

we've got the new genuine thermostat in
there<00:01:33.820> row<00:01:34.810> tested<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.500> got<00:01:36.040> it<00:01:36.190> hot<00:01:36.399> no<00:01:36.970> more

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
there row tested it got it hot no more

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.840 
there row tested it got it hot no more
leaks<00:01:37.479> so<00:01:38.409> it<00:01:38.530> all<00:01:38.619> seems<00:01:38.920> pretty<00:01:39.220> good

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
leaks so it all seems pretty good

with<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:43.899> better<00:01:44.259> style<00:01:44.619> seal<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.679> can

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
with a better style seal here you can

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.090 
with a better style seal here you can
see<00:01:47.950> it's<00:01:48.100> holding<00:01:48.429> pressure<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:50.649> all<00:01:50.800> good

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.980 
see it's holding pressure it's all good
it's<00:01:51.280> been<00:01:51.399> on<00:01:51.490> there<00:01:51.700> for<00:01:51.850> about<00:01:52.090> 10-15

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
it's been on there for about 10-15

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.040 
it's been on there for about 10-15
minutes<00:01:54.360> what<00:01:55.360> another<00:01:55.539> thing<00:01:55.630> I<00:01:55.810> want<00:01:55.990> to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
minutes what another thing I want to

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.810 
minutes what another thing I want to
just<00:01:56.170> mention<00:01:56.350> whenever<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.190> have<00:01:57.340> coolant

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
just mention whenever you have coolant

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.999 
just mention whenever you have coolant
leaks<00:01:58.030> make<00:01:58.810> sure<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.170> you<00:01:59.350> pressure<00:01:59.679> check

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
leaks make sure that you pressure check

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.570 
leaks make sure that you pressure check
it<00:02:00.220> hot<00:02:00.700> and<00:02:00.970> cold<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:01.810> also<00:02:02.770> maybe<00:02:02.979> running

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
it hot and cold and also maybe running

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.510 
it hot and cold and also maybe running
and<00:02:03.789> just<00:02:04.659> stagnant<00:02:04.990> because<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.710> lot<00:02:06.220> of<00:02:06.340> times

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
and just stagnant because a lot of times

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.219 
and just stagnant because a lot of times
depending<00:02:06.820> on<00:02:06.909> where<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.240> leak<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:08.050> may

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
depending on where the leak is it may

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.630 
depending on where the leak is it may
show<00:02:08.440> up<00:02:08.560> when<00:02:08.679> it's<00:02:08.739> hot<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.220> may<00:02:09.340> show<00:02:09.550> up

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
show up when it's hot and may show up

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.460 
show up when it's hot and may show up
when<00:02:09.820> something's<00:02:10.119> circulating<00:02:10.780> or<00:02:11.230> what

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
when something's circulating or what

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.740 
when something's circulating or what
something's<00:02:11.739> moving<00:02:12.209> sometimes<00:02:13.209> when<00:02:13.630> it's

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
something's moving sometimes when it's

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.440 
something's moving sometimes when it's
cold<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.739> just<00:02:14.800> depends<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.580> rubber<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.269> it

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
cold it just depends is it rubber is it

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.449 
cold it just depends is it rubber is it
the<00:02:16.540> metal<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.320> a<00:02:17.380> crack<00:02:17.709> is<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.190> crack

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
the metal is it a crack is it a crack

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.789 
the metal is it a crack is it a crack
that's<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:18.820> between<00:02:19.180> two<00:02:19.420> surface<00:02:20.350> areas<00:02:20.650> that

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
that's in between two surface areas that

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.770 
that's in between two surface areas that
expand<00:02:21.250> when<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.579> gets<00:02:21.730> hot<00:02:21.910> or<00:02:22.150> separate<00:02:22.630> when

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
expand when it gets hot or separate when

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.210 
expand when it gets hot or separate when
it<00:02:22.900> gets<00:02:23.019> hot<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:23.860> whenever<00:02:24.070> you're<00:02:24.190> looking

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
it gets hot so whenever you're looking

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.250 
it gets hot so whenever you're looking
for<00:02:24.549> a<00:02:24.579> coolant<00:02:24.880> leak<00:02:24.940> make<00:02:25.690> sure<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.989> check

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
for a coolant leak make sure you check

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.210 
for a coolant leak make sure you check
it<00:02:26.470> running<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.370> also<00:02:28.329> hot<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.440> cold<00:02:29.920> if<00:02:30.190> you

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
it running and also hot and cold if you

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.030 
it running and also hot and cold if you
can't<00:02:30.489> find<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:32.200> only<00:02:32.350> other<00:02:32.530> point<00:02:32.769> I<00:02:32.920> can

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
can't find it the only other point I can

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.590 
can't find it the only other point I can
give<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.310> is<00:02:33.489> before<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:34.000> ever<00:02:34.120> do<00:02:34.360> anything

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
give you is before I ever do anything

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.170 
give you is before I ever do anything
before<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.260> open<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.620> cap<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.250> contaminate<00:02:37.150> a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
before I open a cap and contaminate a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.530 
before I open a cap and contaminate a
whole<00:02:37.390> area<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:38.049> will<00:02:38.500> just<00:02:39.190> first<00:02:39.820> thing<00:02:40.150> do<00:02:40.360> is

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
whole area I will just first thing do is

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.270 
whole area I will just first thing do is
a<00:02:40.570> visual<00:02:41.110> inspection<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.769> try<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.010> look

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
a visual inspection to try to look

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.310 
a visual inspection to try to look
because<00:02:42.820> if<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.120> go<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.299> you<00:02:43.540> pull<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.750> cap<00:02:44.049> off

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
because if you go and you pull a cap off

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.770 
because if you go and you pull a cap off
and<00:02:44.620> get<00:02:45.220> coolant<00:02:45.730> contamination<00:02:46.360> all<00:02:46.510> over

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
and get coolant contamination all over

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.020 
and get coolant contamination all over
from<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.170> pressure<00:02:47.440> leaking<00:02:47.920> out<00:02:48.070> now<00:02:48.790> we're

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
from the pressure leaking out now we're

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.840 
from the pressure leaking out now we're
not<00:02:49.120> able<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.510> do<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.690> proper<00:02:50.290> diagnosis<00:02:51.130> so

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
not able to do a proper diagnosis so

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.120 
not able to do a proper diagnosis so
always<00:02:52.239> first<00:02:52.570> thing<00:02:52.840> visual<00:02:53.470> inspection

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
always first thing visual inspection

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.900 
always first thing visual inspection
then<00:02:54.730> go<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.000> check<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.329> out

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
then go and check it out

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.030 
then go and check it out
so<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.630> should<00:02:57.750> work<00:02:57.810> out<00:02:58.170> for<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.530> thank

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
so this should work out for you thank

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.160 
so this should work out for you thank
you
