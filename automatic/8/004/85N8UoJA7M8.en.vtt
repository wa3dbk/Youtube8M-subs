today it's Walmart board vs. real board
what<00:00:09.150> are<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.360> differences<00:00:10.099> why<00:00:11.099> does<00:00:11.280> it

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
what are the differences why does it

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.839 
what are the differences why does it
matter<00:00:12.110> where<00:00:13.110> are<00:00:13.380> we

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
matter where are we

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.720 
matter where are we
those<00:00:14.849> are<00:00:15.000> all<00:00:15.120> good<00:00:15.330> questions<00:00:16.160> well<00:00:17.160> for

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
those are all good questions well for

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.029 
those are all good questions well for
starters<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.750> Walmart<00:00:19.230> boards<00:00:19.560> trucks<00:00:19.859> are

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
starters the Walmart boards trucks are

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.450 
starters the Walmart boards trucks are
plastic<00:00:21.080> plastic<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.439> not<00:00:22.470> really<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
plastic plastic is not really like the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.870 
plastic plastic is not really like the
greatest<00:00:23.939> like<00:00:24.410> grinding<00:00:25.410> combination<00:00:26.310> let's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
greatest like grinding combination let's

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.460 
greatest like grinding combination let's
just<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.359> honest<00:00:27.750> like<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.109> you're<00:00:28.260> going<00:00:28.380> to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
just be honest like if you're going to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.839 
just be honest like if you're going to
grind<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.160> you're<00:00:29.369> probably<00:00:29.519> going<00:00:29.789> to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
grind on this you're probably going to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.519 
grind on this you're probably going to
do<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.179> grind<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> break<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
do one grind and it's going to break and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.180 
do one grind and it's going to break and
fall<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.920> pieces<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:33.239> next<00:00:33.270> difference<00:00:33.840> is

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
fall to pieces the next difference is

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.040 
fall to pieces the next difference is
this<00:00:35.190> board<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.700> support<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.300> very<00:00:36.690> large

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
this board can support a very large

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.110 
this board can support a very large
amount<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.530> weight<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.040> take<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> whole<00:00:38.640> lot<00:00:38.670> of

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
amount of weight and take a whole lot of

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.900 
amount of weight and take a whole lot of
beating<00:00:39.710> this<00:00:40.710> board<00:00:41.070> you're<00:00:41.280> supposed<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.760> be

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
beating this board you're supposed to be

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.880 
beating this board you're supposed to be
under<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> hundred<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.840> ten<00:00:43.050> pounds<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.770> it

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
under a hundred and ten pounds and it

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.310 
under a hundred and ten pounds and it
doesn't<00:00:44.190> take<00:00:44.370> much<00:00:44.610> beating<00:00:44.940> at<00:00:45.180> all<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.629> fact

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
doesn't take much beating at all in fact

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.840 
doesn't take much beating at all in fact
a<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.770> bit<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.010> beating<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.610> going

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
a little bit of beating and it's going

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.689 
a little bit of beating and it's going
to<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.059> beaten<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:51.030> wheels<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.750> thing

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
to be beaten the wheels on this thing

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.209 
to be beaten the wheels on this thing
well<00:00:54.890> they<00:00:55.890> don't<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.160> roll<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.680> just

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
well they don't really roll so just just

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.400 
well they don't really roll so just just
start<00:00:59.550> there<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.449> really<00:01:00.629> roll<00:01:00.989> very<00:01:01.230> well

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
start there and it really roll very well

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.380 
start there and it really roll very well
it's<00:01:02.129> kind<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.370> hard<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.670> say<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
it's kind of hard to say if it's the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.910 
it's kind of hard to say if it's the
wheels<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> bearings<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.559> think<00:01:04.799> it's

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
wheels or the bearings but I think it's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.530 
wheels or the bearings but I think it's
probably<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.309> combination<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> wheel<00:01:06.270> bear

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
probably a combination of the wheel bear

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.899 
probably a combination of the wheel bear
yeah

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
yeah

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.910 
yeah
the<00:01:09.510> other<00:01:09.630> thing<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.229> when<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.470> stand<00:01:10.740> on

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the other thing is like when I stand on

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.429 
the other thing is like when I stand on
this<00:01:11.070> Walmart<00:01:11.340> board<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.970> don't<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
this Walmart board I don't know if you

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.120 
this Walmart board I don't know if you
can<00:01:13.590> see<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
can see that but it is like it is

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.399 
can see that but it is like it is
definitely<00:01:17.130> bending<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.810> think<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.259> what

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
definitely bending so I think that what

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.230 
definitely bending so I think that what
we<00:01:19.619> should<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.130> we'll<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.700> kickflip

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
we should do is we'll do like a kickflip

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.690 
we should do is we'll do like a kickflip
on<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> Walmart<00:01:21.840> board<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.220> kickflip<00:01:23.549> on

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
on the Walmart board and a kickflip on

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.370 
on the Walmart board and a kickflip on
the<00:01:23.850> real<00:01:24.030> board<00:01:24.360> we'll<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.930> able<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.170> tell

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the real board we'll be able to tell

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.240 
the real board we'll be able to tell
like<00:01:25.909> this<00:01:26.909> Aaron<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.479> suck<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
like this Aaron just suck or is it the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.980 
like this Aaron just suck or is it the
board<00:01:29.460> oh<00:01:32.570> pretty<00:01:33.570> good<00:01:33.840> actually<00:01:35.990> and

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
board oh pretty good actually and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.170 
board oh pretty good actually and
they're<00:01:37.979> real<00:01:38.159> cool

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
they're real cool

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.710 
they're real cool
whoo<00:01:41.530> it's<00:01:42.130> funny<00:01:42.430> when<00:01:42.610> I<00:01:42.730> step<00:01:42.970> on<00:01:43.120> this<00:01:43.270> it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
whoo it's funny when I step on this it

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.810 
whoo it's funny when I step on this it
just<00:01:43.750> feels<00:01:44.200> so<00:01:44.290> solid<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.130> so<00:01:45.280> good<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:47.820> it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
just feels so solid and so good and it

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.400 
just feels so solid and so good and it
actually<00:01:49.030> pops<00:01:49.540> into<00:01:49.870> the<00:01:50.050> air

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
actually pops into the air

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.020 
actually pops into the air
I<00:01:50.440> guess<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.830> actual<00:01:51.160> real<00:01:51.340> town<00:01:51.610> should<00:01:51.880> be<00:01:52.000> a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
I guess the actual real town should be a

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.030 
I guess the actual real town should be a
double<00:01:52.300> clip<00:01:52.690> that<00:01:53.080> requires<00:01:53.440> a<00:01:53.560> little<00:01:53.740> more

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
double clip that requires a little more

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.230 
double clip that requires a little more
like<00:01:54.390> hop<00:01:55.390> snapped<00:01:55.930> flip<00:01:56.410> gussto<00:02:00.060> double<00:02:01.060> flip

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
like hop snapped flip gussto double flip

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.620 
like hop snapped flip gussto double flip
real<00:02:01.480> bored<00:02:02.550> I'm<00:02:03.550> actually<00:02:03.700> terrified<00:02:04.180> to<00:02:04.420> try

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
real bored I'm actually terrified to try

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:13.040 
real bored I'm actually terrified to try
this<00:02:04.690> on<00:02:04.990> this<00:02:06.270> well<00:02:07.270> hmm<00:02:08.790> see<00:02:09.790> what<00:02:09.910> we<00:02:10.000> can<00:02:10.149> do

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050

the<00:02:14.050> trucks<00:02:14.320> are<00:02:14.470> really<00:02:14.620> loose<00:02:14.950> by<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.250> way

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
the trucks are really loose by the way
