winning this event now are almost

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:07.449 
winning this event now are almost
negated<00:00:06.350> because<00:00:06.439> there's<00:00:06.799> one<00:00:07.069> there's<00:00:07.310> no

00:00:07.449 --> 00:00:07.459 
negated because there's one there's no

way<00:00:07.700> they<00:00:07.850> can<00:00:08.000> finish<00:00:08.240> the<00:00:08.480> event<00:00:08.720> like<00:00:08.930> that

and<00:00:09.350> two<00:00:10.099> there's<00:00:10.400> very<00:00:10.700> little<00:00:10.880> doubt<00:00:11.120> that

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
and two there's very little doubt that

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.049 
and two there's very little doubt that
they<00:00:11.480> could<00:00:11.750> in<00:00:12.170> fact<00:00:12.620> change<00:00:13.160> the<00:00:13.460> tire<00:00:13.700> a

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059

very<00:00:14.450> dramatic<00:00:14.690> finish<00:00:15.259> and<00:00:15.469> that<00:00:16.129> always

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
very dramatic finish and that always

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.160 
very dramatic finish and that always
