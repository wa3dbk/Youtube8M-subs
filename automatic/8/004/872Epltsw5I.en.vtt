00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
what's up this is jeremy Shoom here

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.330 
what's up this is jeremy Shoom here
talking<00:00:08.700> about<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:09.150> ad<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.510> rad<00:00:10.260> glides<00:00:10.620> they

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
talking about the ad a rad glides they

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.720 
talking about the ad a rad glides they
are<00:00:11.460> available<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.000> 78<00:00:12.570> 80<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.590> 82<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:14.009> run

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
are available in the 78 80 and 82 a run

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.369 
are available in the 78 80 and 82 a run
in<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.880> red<00:00:15.000> 80s<00:00:15.509> mainly<00:00:15.839> because<00:00:15.990> they're<00:00:16.260> an

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
in the red 80s mainly because they're an

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.529 
in the red 80s mainly because they're an
in-between<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.609> they<00:00:17.699> don't<00:00:17.850> incur<00:00:18.150> be<00:00:18.330> an

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
in-between so they don't incur be an

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.210 
in-between so they don't incur be an
option<00:00:18.800> these<00:00:19.800> are<00:00:19.980> 70<00:00:20.939> millimeters<00:00:21.420> by<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> 30

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
option these are 70 millimeters by a 30

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:31.670 
option these are 70 millimeters by a 30
millimeter<00:00:23.670> contact<00:00:24.090> patch<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.600> their<00:00:24.810> ad<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.440 

as<00:00:32.680> you<00:00:32.830> can<00:00:32.920> see<00:00:33.130> the<00:00:33.550> wheel<00:00:33.730> had<00:00:34.060> a<00:00:34.090> fair<00:00:34.420> bit

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
as you can see the wheel had a fair bit

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.880 
as you can see the wheel had a fair bit
of<00:00:34.630> resistance<00:00:34.930> that<00:00:35.320> doesn't<00:00:35.680> mean<00:00:35.860> that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
of resistance that doesn't mean that

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.979 
of resistance that doesn't mean that
it's<00:00:36.280> a<00:00:36.430> worst<00:00:36.640> wheel<00:00:36.880> just<00:00:37.510> means<00:00:37.750> you<00:00:37.840> gotta

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
it's a worst wheel just means you gotta

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.390 
it's a worst wheel just means you gotta
lean<00:00:38.200> back<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.440> little<00:00:38.590> bit<00:00:38.830> more<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:39.070> take

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
lean back a little bit more and take

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.220 
lean back a little bit more and take
more<00:00:39.610> control<00:00:39.790> the<00:00:40.120> slides<00:00:40.390> it's<00:00:40.960> little

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
more control the slides it's little

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.900 
more control the slides it's little
really<00:00:41.470> smooth<00:00:41.710> predictably<00:00:42.309> and<00:00:42.670> I<00:00:42.730> could

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
really smooth predictably and I could

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.820 
really smooth predictably and I could
see<00:00:43.059> that<00:00:43.210> they'd<00:00:43.360> have<00:00:43.630> a<00:00:43.900> really<00:00:44.530> consistent

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
see that they'd have a really consistent

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.760 
see that they'd have a really consistent
slide<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.670> they'd<00:00:45.820> be<00:00:46.330> really<00:00:46.690> good<00:00:47.020> for<00:00:47.379> sort

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
slide and they'd be really good for sort

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.990 
slide and they'd be really good for sort
of<00:00:47.800> all<00:00:47.980> around<00:00:48.220> riding

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.640 

since<00:00:55.000> these<00:00:55.180> wheels<00:00:55.450> are<00:00:55.720> rad<00:00:55.990> thing<00:00:56.320> that

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
since these wheels are rad thing that

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.110 
since these wheels are rad thing that
does<00:00:56.830> mean<00:00:57.040> they<00:00:57.190> have<00:00:57.310> a<00:00:57.340> fair<00:00:57.640> bit<00:00:57.790> of<00:00:57.850> grip

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
does mean they have a fair bit of grip

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.960 
does mean they have a fair bit of grip
and<00:00:58.870> from<00:00:59.440> that<00:00:59.560> slide<00:00:59.890> I<00:01:00.190> was<00:01:00.550> able<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:00.820> tell

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
and from that slide I was able to tell

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.520 
and from that slide I was able to tell
they<00:01:01.150> had<00:01:01.240> a<00:01:01.270> really<00:01:01.480> easy<00:01:01.690> initiation<00:01:02.260> and

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
they had a really easy initiation and

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.140 
they had a really easy initiation and
we're<00:01:02.650> really<00:01:02.770> defined<00:01:03.130> hook<00:01:03.280> up<00:01:03.430> she<00:01:03.910> does

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
we're really defined hook up she does

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.090 
we're really defined hook up she does
have<00:01:04.270> a<00:01:04.330> really<00:01:04.630> controllable<00:01:05.170> slide<00:01:05.380> when<00:01:06.070> I

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
have a really controllable slide when I

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.130 
have a really controllable slide when I
kicked<00:01:06.400> out<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:06.760> that<00:01:06.850> last<00:01:07.060> sit<00:01:07.300> down<00:01:07.540> I<00:01:07.720> was

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
kicked out and that last sit down I was

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.170 
kicked out and that last sit down I was
able<00:01:08.230> to<00:01:08.350> take<00:01:08.500> full<00:01:08.740> control<00:01:08.890> and<00:01:09.430> I<00:01:09.580> felt

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
able to take full control and I felt

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.760 
able to take full control and I felt
like<00:01:10.360> I<00:01:10.540> knew<00:01:10.720> everything<00:01:11.260> that<00:01:11.410> was<00:01:11.560> going<00:01:11.650> to

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
like I knew everything that was going to

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.180 
like I knew everything that was going to
happen<00:01:11.890> as<00:01:12.490> soon<00:01:12.550> as<00:01:12.850> I<00:01:12.940> take<00:01:13.090> that<00:01:13.270> slide<00:01:13.510> out

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.280 

McCarron<00:01:18.190> core<00:01:18.430> on<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.970> glides<00:01:19.240> makes<00:01:20.050> the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
McCarron core on the glides makes the

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.680 
McCarron core on the glides makes the
wheel<00:01:20.500> feel<00:01:21.370> a<00:01:21.400> little<00:01:21.640> bit<00:01:21.820> harder<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.450> it

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
wheel feel a little bit harder and it

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.300 
wheel feel a little bit harder and it
stops<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.110> urethanes<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:23.740> deforming<00:01:24.220> as

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
stops the urethanes and deforming as

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.130 
stops the urethanes and deforming as
much<00:01:24.520> these<00:01:25.090> videos<00:01:25.330> are<00:01:25.420> really<00:01:25.540> consistent

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
much these videos are really consistent

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.109 
much these videos are really consistent
and<00:01:26.260> predictable<00:01:26.369> every<00:01:27.369> time<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:27.580> kicked<00:01:27.850> up<00:01:28.030> a

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
and predictable every time I kicked up a

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.150 
and predictable every time I kicked up a
slide<00:01:28.360> I<00:01:28.390> knew<00:01:28.960> it<00:01:29.200> was<00:01:29.350> gonna<00:01:29.470> happen<00:01:29.590> when<00:01:30.070> it

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
slide I knew it was gonna happen when it

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.800 
slide I knew it was gonna happen when it
was<00:01:30.310> going<00:01:30.400> to<00:01:30.520> happen<00:01:30.640> I<00:01:31.060> wasn't<00:01:31.600> really

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
was going to happen I wasn't really

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.650 
was going to happen I wasn't really
worried<00:01:32.170> about<00:01:32.229> me<00:01:32.470> lo<00:01:32.740> siding<00:01:33.100> you're<00:01:33.220> hiding

their income this wheel's named the
glides<00:01:42.550> you<00:01:43.360> can<00:01:43.510> probably<00:01:43.810> tell<00:01:43.930> that

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
glides you can probably tell that

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.650 
glides you can probably tell that
they're<00:01:44.890> really<00:01:45.070> gliding<00:01:45.580> we<00:01:46.030> don't<00:01:46.240> slide<00:01:46.479> it

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
they're really gliding we don't slide it

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.330 
they're really gliding we don't slide it
in<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.810> pavement<00:01:47.200> it's<00:01:47.530> like<00:01:47.740> they're<00:01:48.040> on<00:01:48.070> top

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
in the pavement it's like they're on top

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.310 
in the pavement it's like they're on top
of<00:01:48.400> it<00:01:48.580> you<00:01:48.790> can<00:01:48.910> actually<00:01:49.060> feel<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:49.600> after

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
of it you can actually feel that after

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.859 
of it you can actually feel that after
skating<00:01:50.860> these<00:01:51.070> all<00:01:51.250> day<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:51.820> really<00:01:52.660> hot

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
skating these all day and really hot

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.380 
skating these all day and really hot
weather<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.440> haven't<00:01:54.160> seen<00:01:54.310> any<00:01:54.520> day<00:01:54.759> lines<00:01:55.060> and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
weather I haven't seen any day lines and

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.150 
weather I haven't seen any day lines and
they've<00:01:55.570> had<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:55.780> really<00:01:56.170> minimal<00:01:56.619> where<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:57.009> can

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
they've had a really minimal where I can

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.800 
they've had a really minimal where I can
only<00:01:57.280> see<00:01:57.490> one<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:57.880> two<00:01:58.060> millimeters<00:01:58.300> gone

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
only see one to two millimeters gone

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.749 
only see one to two millimeters gone
from<00:01:59.020> this<00:01:59.170> wheel<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.619> they've<00:02:00.490> been<00:02:00.610> holding

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
from this wheel and they've been holding

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.749 
from this wheel and they've been holding
up<00:02:00.940> great<00:02:01.149> sliding<00:02:02.020> super<00:02:02.440> awesome<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:02.979> super

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
because of the side side core and the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.220 
because of the side side core and the
current<00:02:29.640> core<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.120> all<00:02:30.660> that's<00:02:30.870> been<00:02:31.110> put

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230

current core and all that's been put
into<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.530> wheel<00:02:31.800> makes<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.820> extra<00:02:33.360> sick<00:02:33.630> I

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
into this wheel makes it extra sick I

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.380 
into this wheel makes it extra sick I
have<00:02:35.100> failed<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.520> it's<00:02:35.670> more<00:02:35.940> fun<00:02:36.240> than

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
have failed that it's more fun than

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.510 
have failed that it's more fun than
other<00:02:36.600> prayer<00:02:36.930> wheels<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.530> very<00:02:38.130> comparable

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
other prayer wheels and very comparable

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.120 
other prayer wheels and very comparable
to<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.880> blu<00:02:39.150> rays<00:02:39.330> form<00:02:39.660> mainly<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:41.010> because

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
to a blu rays form mainly just because

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.040 
to a blu rays form mainly just because
it's<00:02:41.670> almost<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.180> same<00:02:42.330> urethane<00:02:42.840> and

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
it's almost the same urethane and

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.030 
it's almost the same urethane and
because<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.040> slides<00:02:44.280> very<00:02:44.730> similar<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:46.040> really

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
because it slides very similar I really

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.530 
because it slides very similar I really
didn't<00:02:47.370> have<00:02:47.460> any<00:02:47.610> troubles<00:02:48.030> with<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.300> wheel

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
it drips enough it slides enough and

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.860 
it drips enough it slides enough and
it's<00:02:53.160> just<00:02:53.370> generally<00:02:53.760> predictable<00:02:53.970> they're

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
it's just generally predictable they're
