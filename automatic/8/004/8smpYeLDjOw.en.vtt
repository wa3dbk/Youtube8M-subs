bold<00:01:49.100> prediction<00:01:49.640> on<00:01:49.700> wisconsin<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:50.600> it

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
bold prediction on wisconsin so it

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.749 
bold prediction on wisconsin so it
pretty<00:01:51.590> much<00:01:51.650> goes<00:01:51.770> everything<00:01:52.220> against<00:01:52.700> i

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
pretty much goes everything against i

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.820 
pretty much goes everything against i
said<00:01:53.060> but<00:01:53.330> wouldn't<00:01:54.080> mind<00:01:54.229> if<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.439> upset

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
said but wouldn't mind if the upset

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.910 
said but wouldn't mind if the upset
happens<00:01:56.259> wisconsin<00:01:57.259> though<00:01:57.380> i<00:01:57.409> think<00:01:57.560> they're

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
happens wisconsin though i think they're

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.100 
happens wisconsin though i think they're
as<00:01:58.130> i<00:01:58.250> said<00:01:58.460> very<00:01:58.670> well<00:01:58.880> rounded<00:01:59.090> I<00:01:59.509> expect

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
as i said very well rounded I expect

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.710 
as i said very well rounded I expect
holes<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.860> go<00:02:01.240> they<00:02:02.240> probably<00:02:02.450> don't<00:02:02.600> have

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
holes and to go they probably don't have

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.300 
holes and to go they probably don't have
to<00:02:02.900> pass<00:02:03.140> two<00:02:03.409> months<00:02:03.740> they<00:02:03.860> probably<00:02:04.100> could

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
to pass two months they probably could

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.130 
to pass two months they probably could
just<00:02:04.460> run<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.820> ball<00:02:05.000> on<00:02:05.180> San<00:02:05.390> Jose<00:02:05.630> State<00:02:05.689> but

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
just run the ball on San Jose State but

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.620 
just run the ball on San Jose State but
I<00:02:06.350> think<00:02:07.070> Tolson<00:02:07.549> is<00:02:07.700> still<00:02:08.030> an<00:02:08.149> underrated

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
I think Tolson is still an underrated

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.749 
I think Tolson is still an underrated
