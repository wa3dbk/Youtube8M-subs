 hello very good today I will come with 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.349
 how to unlock the bootloader 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.959
 good what are we going to need two 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.980
 programs that I will leave the links in 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:21.410
 the description of video programs 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.490
 what we are going to need is called the 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.940
 first s1 tool that is to know if 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.539
 our 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.490
 the device we can 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.220
 unlock the bootloader 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.760
 be here to erase that they are going to have to 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:44.010
 unzip and all these will come out 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:50.940
 files and these folders 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:54.670
 and we are going to use the one called msn 7227 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.239
 low bar cm and point 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.329
 cmd good that 's what we're going to use what 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.970
 first we have to do if we go to 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.420
 to unlock it we have to know if 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:13.240
 we can deactivate what we are going to download 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.240
 the s1 tool we installed 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.930
 and some like this program I 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.759
 place as a virus but do not worry 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:27.039
 does not carry any virus 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.039
 so turn off jce your 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.560
 antivirus and those who 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:40.970
 and good 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:44.640
 requirements have rooted the xperia 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.950
 with the original rom of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.750
 that came in 2.1 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.890
 Y 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:59.510
 and well now I'm going to see so you can see 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.720
 We give identity to identify the 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.590
 first option 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.409
 Y 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.379
 here we have to enter with the mode 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.989
 flash to know if we are compatible or 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.030
 not to unlock the good bootloader 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.930
 you already know that to unlock the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.700
 bootloader you have to turn off good for 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:26.319
 enter flash mode you have to turn off 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.910
 the phone we give you keep pressed 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.910
 the back key 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.480
 connect 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:41.260
 USB to tele phone until 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.260
 leave the green light 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.510
 and good is already 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.049
 and good 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.590
 here are you little letters that are going to have 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.540
 to go in uppercase 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.219
 if they do not have it unlocked 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.150
 am and I have them - in lowercase because I 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:09.319
 I have them 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:13.060
 the bootloader has been unlocked and we're going 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:17.200
 here to the last 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.709
 that we get that puts cmc without blogs 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.739
 certify you is because if you can 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.750
 unlock the bootloader or if you get 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.620
 no no no 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.290
 certify you is because you can not and my 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.670
 recommendation is that if it comes out you do not 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.040
 you can disable the bootloader, not the 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.210
 do because you can be damaged 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:46.000
 device 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:51.740
 good once we already have that we 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.490
 you can disable good and unlock the 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:58.370
 bootloader 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:03.080
 we disconnect and turn on the 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.860
 the xperia like this program we closed it 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.860
 I will 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.819
 tell him a little so he does not do it so 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.280
 long and to continue with the few with 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.700
 the other steps now I come back with that 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.280
 older turned on the expert 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:26.840
 good friends has already turned me on 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.840
 xperia and we're going to go to menu 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.860
 of adjustments 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.430
 Applications 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.980
 developing 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:48.409
 and activate usb debugging 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:54.249
 it is very important to have it activated 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:57.789
 and activate it we leave it activated and 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:05:00.169
 we open once we have 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:06.790
 decompressed 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:12.110
 this rar file we are going to use this 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:18.130
 application that is called msm7227 bar 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.130
 go down five m points of open 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:26.330
 Well I tell you again that if it has not 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.580
 come out that you can unlock it, not what 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:33.319
 try because you can fuck the 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:35.900
 xperia good once we have all 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:40.760
 the requirements already prepared have the 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:43.070
 phone rooted with the original rumba 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.430
 and that if we can unlock the 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:49.129
 bootloader and we have activated the 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.289
 debug usb 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:56.560
 we can already 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:59.650
 keep up with this good now here 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.969
 we connect the 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:07.999
 the phone to the computer 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:07.999
 and we are going to give him 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:16.499
 and this is going to start to come out 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.349
 no turning starting 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:21.659
 this tension is full and I get that 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:23.930
 because I will not do it because I already 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:27.080
 I have done 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.440
 and good friends 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.790

 the best thing is that you can do it 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.830
 I'm sorry I can not do it with me 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.040

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.040
