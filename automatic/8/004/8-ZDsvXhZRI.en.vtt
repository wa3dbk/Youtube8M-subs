00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:03.190
 show it 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.700
 one of them and the boats 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.700
 on ps3 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.939
 everything from go to vote 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.739
 commando course he explains 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.480
 political parties 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.480
 then we will choose 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.140
 first of all a bit limited 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.140
 if the customer the blow 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.410
 once we are told 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.400
 you place with the price 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.400
 the skin marks her age like that 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.030
 you turn around 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.410
 we practice the wall well 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.590
 here we are one of the few 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.990
 you are part 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.480
 analog stick option 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.170
 classic left-handed 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.790
 novelli 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.600
 you doubt it 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 now the goal is to find where it blocks 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.550
 like him 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.550
 I can get up 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.690
 you find that the shadow 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.360
 less than ten minutes aside 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.280
 sand 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.750
 but you have to 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.430
 to come back 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.430
 within our part 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.179
 and the goal is to find the happy medium 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.789
 where it blocks 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:16.819
 unfortunately it can not be 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:17.889
 of nuke 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:20.889
 very light and the blow 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.619
 it's really very accurate 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.139
 but just middle 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.099
 but sam 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.979
 very precise 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.839
 so here I am almost 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:16.649
 like what a tension 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.659
 3 we fly 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.429
 so do not touch after a stroke at all 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:29.659
 as long as you did not stop if we saw 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.269
 to know when you are arrested 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.969
 we won four wrestlers 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:35.679
 are charged 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:37.119
 this option 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:38.189
 and today 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.889
 properly 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.459
 except of course ethically here 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.459
 to appear a fight so we must move forward 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:48.499
 - on the tour 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.909
 you put our insatiable tactics 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.909
 now 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.879
 from turn to lavaur wanted to push 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.349
 we will see a little 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.349
 in a snap 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.779
 that's why it takes pro world 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.779
 see more 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:39.550
 a governorate 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.550
 so cynicism or not 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.069
 so here 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.879
 if they are of the kind 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.630
 it was the goal and the boats were waiting rails
