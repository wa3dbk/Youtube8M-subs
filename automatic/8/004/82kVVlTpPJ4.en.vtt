00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:03.625
 Fuck. 

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:04.499
 Are you serious?! 

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:05.083
 Don't worry, fellas. 

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:06.750
 The top turret has a 50-diameter gun. 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.499
 One of you guys is a gentleman ... 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.000
 ... he can fire that old man? 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.499
 Okay. 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:13.375
 You take the machine gun. 

00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:15.250
 I'il make the old man fly the plane blind. 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.917
 That's the worst plan I've ever heard. 

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:19.042
 Well okay. 

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:21.666
 But if I die, I still hate you. 

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.250
 I hope they shoot you in the face! 

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:34.209
 Take your souls! 

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:35.292
 Holy shit! 

00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:36.042
 Demon ninjas with jetpack! 

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:40.459
 We've cheered on you, so now we've got to give me a toast. 

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:42.791
 Well, just because it's tradition. 

00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:43.500
 Tom. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.917
 Who? 

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:45.625
 Okay. 

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:47.000
 I'm gonna take care of that. 

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:03.917
 Nice evasive maneuvers. 

00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:07.499
 You're gonna leave my mother out of this, you dickhead. 

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:08.334
 the mother. 

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.083
 Everyone has a mother. 

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:12.250
 Your mother has a mother. 

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:28.250
 Oh my God. 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.375
 I just threw up. 

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:30.750
 Don't be arrogant! 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.292
 Crooky? 

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.209
 No! 

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:46.083
 Hey, Red. 

00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:46.875
 What are your favorite animals? 

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:51.000
 I love the green color and also the bathroom. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.459
 'Cause that's where you vomit. 

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:56.417
 Hey! 

00:01:56.417 --> 00:01:57.083
 Hey, I got the last one! 

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:57.875
 Did you see that? 

00:01:57.875 --> 00:01:59.499
 Of course you haven't. 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.750
 Ah. 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.875
 Do you see that ?! 

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:04.499
 Pull the handle! 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.417
 We're gonna crash! 

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:05.958
 Are you hungry? 

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.250
 You must pull the lever immediately! 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.833
 We're about to hit! 

00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:29.499
 Everybody okay? 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:30.917
 I'm fine. 

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.334
 I'm ... dying. 

00:02:33.334 --> 00:02:34.499
 - Fuck you! - Fuck you! 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:35.750
 Oh, God. 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.209
 Here. 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.334
 Take this. 

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:41.958
 What is this? 

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.375
 You two, you have to complete my mission. 

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:48.499
 Those Red and Blue bastards ... 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:49.375
 ... Prevent Destiny to find the Supreme Sword. 

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:54.500
 It's on top of Le Tour Eiffel. 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.042
 What? 

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:55.625
 What does that mean? 

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:59.583
 I trust you, dear Tom and Tom. 

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:00.292
 No, wait! 

00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:01.167
 What's Le Tour Eiffel? 

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:04.958
 Another flight, another accident ... 

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.499
 ... perfect record. 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:11.459
 Now, tally-ho. 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.499
 Hawks move you to heaven. 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:14.750
 Ha! 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.583
 This uncle's gonna be a nasty hangover tomorrow. 

00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:20.459
 Dude, wait! 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.499
 Since we're stuck together, maybe ... 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:24.125
 ... we can move together. 

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:26.625
 I mean, I think your sniper with those ninjas was pretty good ... 

00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:30.125
 ... even though you vomited like a complete loser. 

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:31.250
 Shut up. 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.500
 Come on. 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.417
 Let's go find this sword. 

00:03:32.417 --> 00:03:36.083
 Account, please. 

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:37.708
 Oh la la. 

00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:38.250
 Yeah. 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.499
 I'm gonna call this waitress for information. 

00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:42.042
 Wait, what are you gonna do? 

00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:44.167
 Red, where are you going? 

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:53.375
 Come on, open it! 

00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:54.209
 Come on, open it! 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:54.583
 Hungry! 

00:03:54.583 --> 00:03:56.459
 Hey, I'm Blue. 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.292
 Just text me. 

00:03:57.292 --> 00:04:00.167
 Nobody listens to audio messages. 

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:00.708
 Hey, Blue. 

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:01.334
 I'm Pink. 

00:04:01.334 --> 00:04:04.499
 I'm calling you a hundred times. 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:05.417
 - Where were you? 

00:04:05.417 --> 00:04:08.334
 The mail box is full, you're crazy. 

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:10.083
 Damn it! 

00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:14.499
 I'm gonna cut you up! 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.209
 I'il chop you up! 

00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:23.209
 What's up, bitch? 

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.583
 Hi, Stacy. 

00:04:23.583 --> 00:04:24.917
 You never saw Red around, did you? 

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:28.499
 Blue hasn't answered her phone for two days. 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:29.334
 Who's the red one? 

00:04:29.334 --> 00:04:31.625
 The guy you're having sex with every day. 

00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:34.499
 Which? 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:36.541
 With a hat. 

00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:37.875
 Oh, Steven. 

00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:38.499
 What's up baby? 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:40.167
 Are you ready for the third round? 

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:41.375
 Nevermind. 

00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:43.875
 Brad, when did you get that hat? 

00:04:46.334 --> 00:04:50.750
 Sorry to not see you again, old Crookygrin, but ... 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.000
 ... I'm sure I'il see you again. 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.541
 I'm super old. 

00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:55.833
 Are you sure they're red and blue? 

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:56.459
 Oh yes. 

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:57.499
 They left. 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:58.083
 Great. 

00:04:58.083 --> 00:05:00.209
 No matter what, we'il find them. 

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:03.917
 Scan your surroundings and mustaches. 

00:05:03.917 --> 00:05:06.459
 Especially you, Jaque. 

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:07.750
 Qui. 

00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:13.499
 Great job, Colonel Dingleberry. 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.250
 Thanks to you, the sword is safe. 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.417
 You said I'd get a reward. 

00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:19.292
 And you will. 

00:05:19.292 --> 00:05:22.958
 You'il see your friend Crookygrin ... 

00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.250
 ... earlier than you think! 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.625
 Fuck. 

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:28.334
 I should have seen this happen! 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
