power of story takes a key that I think

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.540 
power of story takes a key that I think
the<00:02:16.070> film<00:02:16.310> is<00:02:16.610> nothing<00:02:17.510> if<00:02:17.630> not<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:18.460> kind<00:02:19.460> of

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
the film is nothing if not a kind of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.260 
the film is nothing if not a kind of
testament<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:21.790> unavoidable<00:02:22.790> and

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
testament to the unavoidable and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.840 
testament to the unavoidable and
enduring<00:02:23.870> power<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.260> our<00:02:24.920> emotional<00:02:25.670> lives

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
enduring power of our emotional lives

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.970 
enduring power of our emotional lives
and<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:27.050> think<00:02:27.200> our<00:02:27.290> emotional<00:02:27.620> lives<00:02:27.770> get

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
and I think our emotional lives get

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.710 
and I think our emotional lives get
distilled<00:02:28.340> into<00:02:28.610> our<00:02:28.820> creative<00:02:29.270> lives<00:02:29.480> as

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
distilled into our creative lives as

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.150 
distilled into our creative lives as
well<00:02:29.990> as<00:02:30.140> our<00:02:30.230> intellectual<00:02:30.590> lives<00:02:30.890> and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
well as our intellectual lives and

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.310 
well as our intellectual lives and
psychological<00:02:32.150> well-being<00:02:32.300> or<00:02:32.660> lack<00:02:33.020> thereof

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
psychological well-being or lack thereof

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.650 
psychological well-being or lack thereof
or<00:02:33.500> gets<00:02:34.220> gostosa<00:02:34.790> distilled<00:02:35.420> into<00:02:35.540> the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
or gets gostosa distilled into the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.200 
or gets gostosa distilled into the
creative<00:02:35.870> process<00:02:36.080> but<00:02:36.830> um<00:02:37.040> but<00:02:37.940> i<00:02:37.970> think<00:02:38.180> that

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
creative process but um but i think that

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.570 
creative process but um but i think that
i<00:02:38.360> think<00:02:38.510> that<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.810> film<00:02:39.020> is<00:02:39.430> ultimately<00:02:40.430> is

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
i think that the film is ultimately is

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.000 
i think that the film is ultimately is
moving<00:02:40.970> as<00:02:41.090> people<00:02:41.990> seem<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.230> feel<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.590> be<00:02:42.800> I

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
moving as people seem to feel it to be I

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.150 
moving as people seem to feel it to be I
think<00:02:43.810> means<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:45.050> it's<00:02:45.200> not<00:02:45.380> if<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.770> was<00:02:45.890> just

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
think means that it's not if it was just

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.940 
think means that it's not if it was just
a<00:02:46.280> kind<00:02:46.460> of<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.990> nod<00:02:47.990> of<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.200> head<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.770> kind

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
a kind of a nod of the head and a kind

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.160 
a kind of a nod of the head and a kind
of<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.070> glorification<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.910> of<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.780> great<00:02:50.960> Walt

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
of a glorification of of the great Walt

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.990 
of a glorification of of the great Walt
Disney<00:02:51.560> will<00:02:51.709> then<00:02:51.830> it<00:02:52.310> would<00:02:52.490> be<00:02:52.520> just<00:02:52.790> that

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
Disney will then it would be just that

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.310 
Disney will then it would be just that
and<00:02:53.240> it<00:02:53.360> might<00:02:53.510> be<00:02:53.630> entertaining<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.260> it

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
and it might be entertaining and it

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.170 
and it might be entertaining and it
might<00:02:54.410> be<00:02:54.440> fascinating<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.820> don't<00:02:56.090> know

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
might be fascinating but I don't know

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.550 
might be fascinating but I don't know
that<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:56.420> would<00:02:56.450> be<00:02:56.660> as<00:02:56.810> essentially<00:02:57.260> moving

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
that it would be as essentially moving

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.690 
that it would be as essentially moving
as<00:02:57.680> this<00:02:57.770> film<00:02:58.010> is<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.310> that's<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.520> testament

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
as this film is and that's a testament

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.610 
as this film is and that's a testament
again<00:02:59.270> to<00:02:59.480> Kelly<00:02:59.720> Marcel<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.380> approach

again to Kelly Marcel and the approach

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.980 
again to Kelly Marcel and the approach
that<00:03:00.650> she<00:03:01.010> took<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.000> story<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.510> of

course to to Tom and the rest the actors

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.690 
course to to Tom and the rest the actors
were<00:03:06.290> particularly<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.400> Emma's

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
were particularly to to Emma's

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.100 
were particularly to to Emma's
performance<00:03:08.270> in<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.420> film<00:03:08.450> which<00:03:08.720> is<00:03:08.840> just

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
performance in the film which is just

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.080 
performance in the film which is just
about<00:03:10.010> as<00:03:10.070> beautiful<00:03:10.550> of<00:03:10.670> things<00:03:10.880> I've<00:03:11.060> ever

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
about as beautiful of things I've ever

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.570 
about as beautiful of things I've ever
seen<00:03:11.300> any<00:03:11.690> used<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.260> word<00:03:12.380> cathartic<00:03:12.590> which

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
seen any used the word cathartic which

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.520 
seen any used the word cathartic which
is<00:03:13.760> feels<00:03:14.450> like<00:03:14.600> it's<00:03:14.750> an<00:03:14.810> appropriate<00:03:15.080> word

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
is feels like it's an appropriate word

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.290 
is feels like it's an appropriate word
because<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:15.950> think<00:03:16.040> not<00:03:16.520> all<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.700> timing<00:03:17.209> of

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
because I think not all the timing of

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.210 
because I think not all the timing of
film<00:03:17.660> as<00:03:17.840> healing<00:03:18.140> can<00:03:18.800> heal<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.100> community

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
film as healing can heal the community

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.310 
film as healing can heal the community
and<00:03:19.610> but<00:03:20.000> but<00:03:20.330> story<00:03:20.660> can<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.340> giving<00:03:22.340> giving

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
and but but story can and giving giving

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.300 
and but but story can and giving giving
