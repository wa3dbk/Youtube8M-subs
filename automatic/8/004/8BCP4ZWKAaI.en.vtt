00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.800

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.799
 go talking 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.840
 the chief wonder where's can remember 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.610
 can be afraid of the group that stayed there 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.439
 up with a bow and arrow to give a 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.950
 cover for it can only assume the 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.790
 face 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.700
 The sea rises up there and sees his bow in the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.799
 floor and sees that it has no trace of 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.220
 blood, nothing like it had 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.369
 simply abandoned the place then a 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.590
 mors as is his obligation as 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.680
 nightwatch it goes after the can not 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.780
 can not desert is not and begins to follow 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.310
 At that moment, our dog 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.740
 Truth begins to follow the path of 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.200
 smell of can then we go 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.380
 following the forest for it to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.060
 people find some strange face that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.399
 will talk to us will talk 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.040
 with morris is to give some information 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.049
 for us and further ahead against the group 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.360
 his his group talking to right now 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.700
 Are you going to show him how you can show him? 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.299
 passed through here and takes you to a local 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.329
 morse and set a trap for him to 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.450
 trap is simply to steal it 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.569
 The group gives this family of thieves speaks 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.930
 but us of their currencies their stops 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.609
 your boots and 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.650
 well, I 'm cool, I look at him, he talks and it 's e 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:23.140
 It can only be the joker you think 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.680
 If you do not steal the guy, this is you. 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.689
 He is alone and death speaks, but you 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.469
 probably not bunny you already 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:35.680
 met a man who is very lonely 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:38.019
 more dangerous than in a group and the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.760
 staff and the group in addition to the 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.719
 thieves this guy is crazy I'm going 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.790
 kill him obviously morse kills the world 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.540
 and after killing everyone 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.489
 You can find a little over the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.250
 adi ante and what is he doing this? 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.599
 He escaped for sure. He ran away. 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.840
 tried to desert he is trying 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.359
 rape a woman he met in the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.519
 road then the scene it finds is 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.079
 case our dog's encounter may be 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.239
 tried to rape his wife and tried 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.719
 rape her dog goes there for the woods 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.969
 We sure as dogs are made. 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.969
 done we'll go back to the 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:18.069
 wall there the Mormon where he asks to speak 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:21.340
 with more your way this is the message that 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.579
 the organ is already waiting for it when the 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.040
 Moss goes there to talk to Mormon where I 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:32.079
 I live where you speak, look. There's a letter here. 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.769
 of john allen the day online that is the hand 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.409
 the king is not the one who surrenders and he questions 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.269
 death how come you have that relationship 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:42.129
 Do you have the day online for those who do not 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.290
 reminds of an air faces in the first 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.509
 episode and game of thrones is the guy who 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.419
 dies is the mother of the king who is murdered and 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:51.370
 then the cheap robert goes there is to the north 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.229
 I lost to Ned Stark the king's hand in the 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.620
 his place then this letter from a harem 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:59.470
 comes pro mors humor is we read she is 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.379
 open in the game and has some messages 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.530
 subliminal emails kind of weird but 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:08.470
 It comes down to a sea A young woman 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.659
 the shows in which he delayed to rescue him not 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.040
 says exactly why in case of attack 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.739
 the woman but he asks how to 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.079
 do this and in this letter give the 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.720
 where she would be jajÃ¡ saying already 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.779
 they would be in a whorehouse in a city 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.490
 next to ali al-naimi smart fico 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.740
 thinking the guy is mine is in the script 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.700
 We'll have it in the script with hours. 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.170
 I imagine death 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:35.560
 in the puteiro is an organ where it is 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.840
 suspecting is that after all that john is bad 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.840
 and wanting with it but this letter from a 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.000
 It's bad came along with his two guards. 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.480
 behind this woman and there begins a 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.900
 It's a weird thing that 's godri and 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.180
 gardens are already waiting there on the wall 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.050
 or show and along behind this woman 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.850
 then the chancel was then speaks I go there we 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.770
 promote 10 to talk with the 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.870
 two is his goal that would be a 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.790
 soldier and at first sent from 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.890
 kingsley gandhi to find this girl 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.830
 after all no one knows what is the function of it 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:12.640
 but a harem asked and jerryd that 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.200
 apparently already had a tantrum with 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.120
 old fashion 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.980
 Why do I show him his brother? 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.500
 during the robert concrete war by 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.630
 they stole something there then 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.790
 rolled a dead thread speaks his 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.650
 brother trash and deserved his fate did not 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.580
 shows a very correct face 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:34.030
 while this discussion such 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:38.260
 happening an organ where it arrives and speaks 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:41.230
 Look dead at one night for you. 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.110
 He talks what news John is bad at the hand. 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.240
 of the king was just murdered and there 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.860
 what is that murder of the 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.880
 first episode was just 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.080
 murdered 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.670
 so it's just that we make this news 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.590
 I do not expect this has nothing to do with 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.870
 the final girl mission you have to get 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.550
 This woman that no one knows at last 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.580
 What do you have to get this woman? 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.250
 and then we end another chapter and 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.530
 if much faster and with much more 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.290
 Mystery, how much is this thing? 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:15.190
 more involvement with the history of 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:17.590
 book series because at this time of 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.750
 a harem than a property that is 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.120
 time robert cheap goes away 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.140
 to the north but you read that they manage 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.210
 died had a whole conspiracy and 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.280
 finished so let the next back 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.010
 pro alex ter that will find it right 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.660
 excess appear in the next episode 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.670
 I hope you have enjoyed it. 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.890
 forget to leave a review review 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.890
 this video and until the next
