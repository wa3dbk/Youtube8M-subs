00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.550
 everything that is connected with mac Well 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.870
 let's not drag out 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.870
 intro go 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.500
 mac os x is the most perfect 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.810
 world operating system 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.189
 but it often happens when a user 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.739
 just need to use 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.660
 alternate with namely windows 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.890
 Today I will tell you what to choose for 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.270
 install windows on mac 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.830
 can be divided into three categories 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.870
 need windows on mac 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.430
 1 difficult transition to this category 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.620
 include people who are so 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.790
 accustomed to working with windows so hard 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.830
 quickly change to a new one 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.360
 mac os operating system in this 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.590
 case of windows on mac will 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.840
 attend temporarily bye 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.610
 the user does not adapt the second 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.440
 work specialized programs 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.840
 There are a number of programs that do not 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.340
 working on mac such as jov and others 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.750
 in order to work in these 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.729
 applications you need to install 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.640
 windows as an alternative operating room 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.619
 third game system for many people and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.180
 mike macbook is working tools but

 modern computer games all the more 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.820
 CPU performance Mage 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.410
 high enough the problem is that 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.750
 most new gaming industry 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.110
 goes under windows sony playstation 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.810

 windows on mac 1 parallels desktop 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.799
 work with the program under windows is not 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.689
 exiting mac os and second boot camp 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.979
 installation in parallel regardless

 double click to launch the program 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.149
 parallels after running this program 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.450
 you will see a window with a full 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.770
 windows advantage parallels 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.929
 opportunity to work in full minus 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.789
 without leaving the mapquest opening 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.770
 files as windows put varnish without 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.450
 reboot in order to transfer 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.670
 files of one operating system in 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.470
 another just drag the file with 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.959

 disadvantages first education here on 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.420
 order below it will settle down so that 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.860
 main operating system mac

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.129
 operating systems wmap file access 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.569
 Venus will also be unavailable upon failure 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.720
 work in the main system on you

 and at the same time stay in the main 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.130
 Mac operating system has steered with 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.720
 easy to cope with programs 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.500
 who are not demanding

 alt and hold until before 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.890
 you will not see the choice of systems in case

 turn on the computer in the usual way by 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.640
 the default will load mac os

 1 maximum performance all 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.950
 technical performance 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.800
 computer will be sent only to 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.960

 disadvantages need to reboot 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.920
 computer case need to work 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.140
 another operating system 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.980
