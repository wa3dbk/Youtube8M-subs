airplane will be a bit all finished the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.510 
airplane will be a bit all finished the
tiles<00:01:17.090> yes<00:01:17.689> for<00:01:18.409> example<00:01:19.479> spinner<00:01:21.520> for

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
tiles yes for example spinner for

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.139 
tiles yes for example spinner for
folding<00:01:22.850> prop<00:01:23.119> is<00:01:23.689> too<00:01:24.289> bigger<00:01:25.159> because<00:01:25.759> I

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
folding prop is too bigger because I

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.639 
folding prop is too bigger because I
need<00:01:26.359> 35<00:01:27.140> millimeters<00:01:27.950> diameter<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:29.509> is<00:01:29.649> 40

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
need 35 millimeters diameter this is 40

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.849 
need 35 millimeters diameter this is 40
millimeters<00:01:31.640> diameter<00:01:31.789> so<00:01:32.659> this<00:01:32.689> is<00:01:33.049> only<00:01:33.259> set

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
millimeters diameter so this is only set

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.779 
millimeters diameter so this is only set
up<00:01:34.009> for<00:01:34.450> made<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.600> fly<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.200> for<00:01:36.829> testing<00:01:37.249> how

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
up for made in fly and for testing how

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.399 
up for made in fly and for testing how
this<00:01:38.240> nice<00:01:38.810> bird<00:01:39.170> will<00:01:39.619> be<00:01:39.770> fly<00:01:41.020> if<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.200> like

of<00:01:47.810> gravity<00:01:48.259> is<00:01:48.409> a<00:01:48.710> little<00:01:49.219> bit<00:01:49.630> maybe<00:01:50.630> I<00:01:51.020> think

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
of gravity is a little bit maybe I think

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.730 
of gravity is a little bit maybe I think
it's<00:01:51.710> okay<00:01:52.009> inside<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:53.030> only<00:01:53.359> one<00:01:53.539> arm<00:01:53.840> one

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
it's okay inside is only one arm one

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.499 
it's okay inside is only one arm one
point<00:01:55.340> six<00:01:55.759> hours<00:01:56.359> for<00:01:57.319> itself<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:58.119> I<00:01:59.119> must

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
point six hours for itself and I must

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.550 
point six hours for itself and I must
put<00:02:00.429> additional<00:02:01.429> right<00:02:01.880> in<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.240> nose<00:02:02.560> 100

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
put additional right in the nose 100

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.599 
put additional right in the nose 100
grams<00:02:03.859> because<00:02:04.399> inside<00:02:04.969> is<00:02:05.210> really<00:02:05.509> not<00:02:05.810> space

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
grams because inside is really not space

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:11.290 
grams because inside is really not space
for<00:02:07.840> bigger<00:02:08.840> battery<00:02:09.530> yesterday<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.610> was

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
for bigger battery yesterday I was

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.550 
for bigger battery yesterday I was
disciplined<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.500> amp<00:02:12.710> 2<00:02:13.040> hours<00:02:14.290> 2.2

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
disciplined it to amp 2 hours 2.2

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
disciplined it to amp 2 hours 2.2
hours<00:02:16.310> for<00:02:17.209> itself<00:02:17.500> but<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.680> was<00:02:18.830> too

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
hours for itself but it was too

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.960 
hours for itself but it was too
hard<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.360> closed-canopy<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:22.070> I<00:02:22.100> put<00:02:22.520> inside<00:02:22.910> a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
hard to closed-canopy so I put inside a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.280 
hard to closed-canopy so I put inside a
bigger<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:23.540> smaller<00:02:24.170> battery<00:02:24.730> 1.8<00:02:25.730> not<00:02:26.240> 6<00:02:26.570> 1.8

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
bigger but smaller battery 1.8 not 6 1.8

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.160 
bigger but smaller battery 1.8 not 6 1.8
on<00:02:28.190> power<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:29.000> think<00:02:29.240> it<00:02:29.330> will<00:02:29.450> be<00:02:29.600> okay<00:02:29.870> and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
on power and I think it will be okay and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.510 
on power and I think it will be okay and
I<00:02:30.950> have<00:02:31.430> here<00:02:31.760> only<00:02:32.680> voltage<00:02:33.680> sensor<00:02:34.130> for
