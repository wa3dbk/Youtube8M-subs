00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 dani dani dani here we are in the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.910
 hippodrome with some things that I do not know what 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.740
 which is that as a motorcycle 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.290
 we have a monologue forward because it 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:17.420
 it goes up there are alternative roads 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.420
 no here you can see a little 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:31.629
 a poster that takes you away - I agree 38 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:35.360
 seen a poster that now perfect and 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:39.519
 here was festival destination 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.519
 it's being very good 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.930
 the question is what do we do 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:55.269
 this race is the weirdest thing because 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:08.439
 times 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:12.380
 there comes a time when the patio 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:14.000
 I go first not for long 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.890
 companions mister aguililla like no 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.220
 describe you the wings are lost in 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.280
 account turns are 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:30.420
 33 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:36.300
 we go around here in slow and the enemy 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:39.290
 fail if that is impossible cloud and a 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.290
 tube of this from the head 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:49.759
 but the tires 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.940
 What's up 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.840
 and you start dancing with the door that 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.860
 big big blocks you can win if 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.390
 I can dance with the doors 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.489
 now buy me you are very big 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.830
 producer is too big too big 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.640
 for your voice we are as my foot 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.640
 right let's go 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:35.210
 if you're watching your face like a man 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.210
 who grows back 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.570
 that we make our same mistake 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.570
 Exterior 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.750
 We are looking forward peers 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.530
 it is a theme of the young woman that is that we are going 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.780
 liked the other time there we go several 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:16.770
 themes they asked him for before but first 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:19.100
 let's go the last lap the race is 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.100
 seriously 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.570
 and today what I have here 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.880
 I love last races 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.880
