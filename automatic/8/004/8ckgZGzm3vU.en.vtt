00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.320
 biometric authentication with smart card 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.599
 nfc authentication now with the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.849
 new dni with the electronic dni too 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.490
 you can authenticate and with the dni 3.0 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.020
 you can also do it and also those 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.490
 they are authentication modules that you can 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.010
 implant in any system to 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.580
 have strong authentication all that 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.019
 in addition strong authentication with yes what 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.760
 you want with the dge that is could 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.800
 authenticate me with the footprint and also 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.290
 have protected the biometric footprint with 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.670
 a second factor of authentication are 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.980
 components that you can use in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.309
 any system like the signal 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.579
 sign that is a recognition system 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.050
 digital signature signature handwritten 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.500
 biometric because we like it 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.239
 the biometric handwritten signature is separate 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.219
 because it is very useful and used in a 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.260
 lots of transactions and contracts 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.780
 because it has the advantage that if one day 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.030
 you copy your handwritten signature you can 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.710
 change while if you copy the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.570
 fingerprint well you have it a bit 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.030
 more shit changing you do not change the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.280
 iris or anything and we've already seen 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.820
 that the fingerprints have been cloned 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.710
 even from photographs as we saw this 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.479
 this last environment all this is a 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.280
 platform that you can use are 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.440
 components that are integrated so much for 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.170
 authentication as for digital signature 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.340
 with smart card with handwritten and so on 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.350
 you can put it on any platform 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.539
 and for you to see, I'm going to make you 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.020
 demo 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.020
 quickly in a jiffy 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.800
 so you can see how the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.450
 platform and with this already finished 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.450
 I'm going to put everything super difficult here 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.930
 let's click on this here we go to 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.340
 turn on the computer let's click on the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.340
 exit from vga to put it more difficult 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.030
 we all have hot as you see nothing 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.030
 of 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.750
 saleh 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.280
 good 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.950
 let's see this works 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.830
 this is a web page and I have a 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.180
 tablet here of wacom voucher and the process 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.720
 it's very simple I have here I have a 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.720
 I get it to work 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.379
 Well here I have the tablet and the pen 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.749
 what I'm going to do is something so simple 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.540
 how to register my signature register my 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:39.730
 sign and verify the with an algorithm of 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.290
 matching so you can see how it works 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.849
 then let's go to the part of 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.180
 register sign this to see if I 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.510
 initializes the tablet voucher we go to 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.510
 mark 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.840
 very well we give to continue 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.510
 here 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.160
 and now the only thing I have to do is 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.780
 register the signature I will not register my 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.550
 signature to sign the million- dollar stubs 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.630
 of euros but I will register the one that 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.630
 I use in my cartoons in 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.739
 ok i record you see there is record the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.739
 firm 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.940
 very well has been properly associated the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.670
 sign and now I can verify it 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.580
 I have a hard time making a signature that 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.710
 do not look like mine because I write 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.200
 with the same stroke that is more difficult 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.830
 hide that you are you that guarantee that 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.510
 are you I do not know if I explain myself then 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.980
 how I'm going to do is write with the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.110
 same let's see the score that I draw 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.700
 and then if someone who comes try 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.510
 stay as signed in and now someone 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.510
 let him come and try 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.560
 it also came out as if it was verified I'm a 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.050
 crack 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.510
 walesa recognized above one that 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.400
 it's a good ratio because as you can see 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.630
 what is most looked at is speed what 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.000
 we look at the algorithm is speed 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.040
 pressure that's why we use tablets that 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.480
 they recognize pressure we use the 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.610
 cards samsung tablets that 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.650
 they also recognize pressure we use the 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.350
 ballpoint pens with pressure sensor a 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.209
 through ipad because the ipad tablet 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.700
 you know he does not recognize pressure then 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.549
 with speed pressure and the number of 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.650
 curves etc using the techniques of 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.260
 the graphologists it is easy to recognize the 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.760
 signature of a person who is good all 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.990
 these are components we alone 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.090
 We offer the components so that 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.300
 integrate jce where you want to be worth 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.460
 and of course we would be happy to 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.960
 that we did things together and that 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.300
 let's make a lot more sense to the 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.560
 technology that we do so that 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.650
 really have value for our 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.650
 customers
