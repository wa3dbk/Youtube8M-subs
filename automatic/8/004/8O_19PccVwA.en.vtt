00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.009
 church and the signs of the movies 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.539
 I think of doing both what there is going to be needs and molina writes with 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:10.699
 cardboard in different layers cardboard in the representation is in this 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:14.349
 representation they took the image of the church and put the church that our 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.239
 place right 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.799
 but they wish they had this church, not even 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.099

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:26.729
 own a mountain 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.039
 they really liked our defense, it's a lot of pictures of her then, but 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.879
 was one aspect that calls me enough attention is to communicate 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.020
 his wife about the thing 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.259
 there I rescued an activity without it is enough 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.949
 I attended school very well, it was triggered to work with 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.740
 beads because it looks like a comparsa 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.449
 to increase the works by the less leaked defense was put tissue paper of 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.700
 a keyboard these rules of the school so when it hit the balance is 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.590
 who is missing 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.800

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.370
 drawn was also arrested for our school, right. 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.070
 through their work then it was also elaborated, and I'm more 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.139
 significantly 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.710
