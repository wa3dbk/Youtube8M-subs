long<00:00:19.920> limb<00:00:20.340> lifter<00:00:24.289> limbs<00:00:25.289> eye<00:00:25.529> limbs<00:00:26.369> over

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
long limb lifter limbs eye limbs over

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.700 
long limb lifter limbs eye limbs over
the<00:00:26.880> length<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> limb<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:28.140> important

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the length of the limb is as important

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.310 
the length of the limb is as important
as<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.039> width<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> body<00:00:30.080> you<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.109> if

as the width of the body you know if

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.900 
as the width of the body you know if
you're<00:00:34.700> what<00:00:35.700> I'm<00:00:35.850> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> say<00:00:36.210> eye<00:00:36.890> wide

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
you're what I'm going to say eye wide

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.010 
you're what I'm going to say eye wide
trash<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.420> know<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:39.600> you're<00:00:39.719> really

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
trash can you know if you're really

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.240 
trash can you know if you're really
really<00:00:40.170> wide<00:00:40.410> your<00:00:40.710> hands<00:00:40.920> are<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
really wide your hands are going to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.790 
really wide your hands are going to
obviously<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.329> wider<00:00:42.660> than<00:00:42.989> if

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
obviously have to be wider than if

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.020 
obviously have to be wider than if
somebody<00:00:43.829> who's<00:00:44.190> got<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> narrow<00:00:44.640> shoulder

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
somebody who's got a narrow shoulder

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.130 
somebody who's got a narrow shoulder
position<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.710> first<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.250> foremost<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:49.110> most

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
position and first and foremost the most

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.720 
position and first and foremost the most
obvious<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> need<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.250> make<00:00:50.460> sure<00:00:50.489> that

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
obvious is you need to make sure that

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.920 
obvious is you need to make sure that
your<00:00:50.879> hands<00:00:51.090> are<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.360> knurling<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
your hands are on the knurling of the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.959 
your hands are on the knurling of the
bar<00:00:52.140> that's<00:00:52.860> what<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:53.309> for

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
bar that's what it's there for

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.720 
bar that's what it's there for
so<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:55.260> you're<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> really<00:00:55.860> small<00:00:56.160> person<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
so if you're a really small person the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.220 
so if you're a really small person the
hands<00:00:56.940> might<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> little<00:00:57.809> bit<00:00:57.930> wider

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
hands might be out a little bit wider

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.020 
hands might be out a little bit wider
than<00:00:58.859> what<00:00:59.010> typically<00:00:59.520> would<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.730> necessary

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
than what typically would be necessary

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.930 
than what typically would be necessary
but<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.680> better<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.250> do<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.820> have

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
but it's it's better to do that and have

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.820 
but it's it's better to do that and have
all<00:01:03.270> fingers<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> knurling<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.739> then

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
all fingers on the knurling and then

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.649 
all fingers on the knurling and then
have<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.640> couple<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> knurling<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
have just a couple on the knurling and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.090 
have just a couple on the knurling and
the<00:01:06.720> other<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> smooth<00:01:07.380> because<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.920> if

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the other on the smooth because the if

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.250 
the other on the smooth because the if
you<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.430> lose<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.670> grip<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.810> first<00:01:10.049> finger

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
you do lose your grip the first finger

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.740 
you do lose your grip the first finger
to<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.860> pinky<00:01:11.340> finger<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.299> with

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
to go is the pinky finger so with

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.350 
to go is the pinky finger so with
actually<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.830> an<00:01:14.430> off<00:01:14.580> note<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:14.970> deadlift

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
actually on an off note with deadlift

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.820 
actually on an off note with deadlift
training<00:01:15.689> that's<00:01:15.900> what<00:01:16.200> needs<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
training that's what needs to be the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.070 
training that's what needs to be the
strongest<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.549> hand<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.030> pinky<00:01:18.570> all

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
strongest on the hand is the pinky all

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.630 
strongest on the hand is the pinky all
this<00:01:19.290> other<00:01:19.470> stuff<00:01:19.590> doesn't<00:01:20.040> mean<00:01:20.220> anything

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
this other stuff doesn't mean anything

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.100 
this other stuff doesn't mean anything
because<00:01:20.729> once<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.210> goes<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.900> chain

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
because once that goes it's just a chain

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.390 
because once that goes it's just a chain
effect<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.680> everything<00:01:22.890> else<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.189> being

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
effect and everything else is being

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.530 
effect and everything else is being
ripped<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.830> wider<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> person<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.000> I've

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
ripped out the wider the person is I've

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.100 
ripped out the wider the person is I've
seen<00:01:27.810> some<00:01:28.170> guys<00:01:29.030> mike<00:01:30.030> rogério<00:01:30.630> comes<00:01:30.930> to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
seen some guys mike rogério comes to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.109 
seen some guys mike rogério comes to
mind<00:01:31.350> who<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:32.869> 350<00:01:33.869> 360<00:01:34.710> pounds<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.520> his

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
mind who was 350 360 pounds and his

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.749 
mind who was 350 360 pounds and his
hands<00:01:36.450> were<00:01:36.860> he<00:01:37.860> may<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.100> even<00:01:38.250> been<00:01:38.549> outside

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
hands were he may have even been outside

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.480 
hands were he may have even been outside
the<00:01:39.240> Rings<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.840> know<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.979> deadlift<00:01:41.280> bar

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the Rings you know on a deadlift bar

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.380 
the Rings you know on a deadlift bar
very<00:01:41.729> close<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.210> being<00:01:42.360> outside<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.899> Rings<00:01:43.110> so

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
very close to being outside the Rings so

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.639 
very close to being outside the Rings so
optimum<00:01:45.390> ly<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:45.869> want<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.500> know<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
optimum ly you just want you know a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.069 
optimum ly you just want you know a
straight<00:01:47.009> arm<00:01:47.189> position<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.299> not<00:01:48.479> angled

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
straight arm position so it's not angled

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.859 
straight arm position so it's not angled
you<00:01:49.439> know<00:01:49.530> inward<00:01:49.920> or<00:01:50.130> outward<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.570> arm

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
you know inward or outward you know arm

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.810 
you know inward or outward you know arm
straight<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.829> wherever<00:01:53.310> they<00:01:53.579> fall

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
straight and just wherever they fall

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.190 
straight and just wherever they fall
it's<00:01:54.380> don't<00:01:55.380> overthink<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:57.200> think

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
it's don't overthink that one I think

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.350

you<00:01:58.350> Fred<00:01:58.680> our<00:01:59.310> next<00:01:59.670> question<00:02:00.060> comes<00:02:00.090> from

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
you Fred our next question comes from

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.749 
you Fred our next question comes from
Jonathan<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.439> same<00:02:01.649> type<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:01.950> topic<00:02:02.490> he

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
Jonathan on the same type of topic he

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.690 
Jonathan on the same type of topic he
asks<00:02:03.329> if<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.170> only<00:02:04.320> pronate<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.100> same<00:02:05.340> hand

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
asks if I can only pronate the same hand

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.540 
asks if I can only pronate the same hand
when<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.969> deadlift<00:02:06.509> due<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.710> wrist<00:02:08.039> injury

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
when I deadlift due to wrist injury

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.720 
when I deadlift due to wrist injury
should<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.910> be<00:02:09.090> concerned<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.780> developing<00:02:10.349> an

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
should I be concerned of developing an

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.390 
should I be concerned of developing an
imbalance

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.520 

if<00:02:17.400> you're<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.640> powerlifter<00:02:18.090> no<00:02:18.530> because

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
if you're a powerlifter no because

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.230 
if you're a powerlifter no because
you're<00:02:19.680> going<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.920> develop<00:02:20.220> imbalances<00:02:21.030> as<00:02:21.210> a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
you're going to develop imbalances as a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.670 
you're going to develop imbalances as a
powerlifter<00:02:21.720> that's<00:02:22.020> part<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.440> sport

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
powerlifter that's part of the sport

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.200 
powerlifter that's part of the sport
it's<00:02:22.860> actually<00:02:23.160> part<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.460> any<00:02:23.640> sport<00:02:24.030> all

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
it's actually part of any sport all

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.750 
it's actually part of any sport all
sports<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:26.160> succeed<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.000> sport<00:02:27.360> requires

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
sports to succeed in this sport requires

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.280 
sports to succeed in this sport requires
developing<00:02:29.760> what<00:02:30.000> some<00:02:30.360> would<00:02:30.510> consider<00:02:30.720> an

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
developing what some would consider an

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.720 
developing what some would consider an
imbalance<00:02:32.060> because<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.530> nature<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
imbalance because of the nature of the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.770 
imbalance because of the nature of the
sport<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.740> know<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:38.120> baseball<00:02:39.120> pitcher<00:02:39.300> is

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
sport you know a baseball pitcher is

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.220 
sport you know a baseball pitcher is
obvious<00:02:40.260> going<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.560> more<00:02:41.660> dominant<00:02:42.660> with

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
obvious going to be more dominant with

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.140 
obvious going to be more dominant with
their<00:02:43.410> throwing<00:02:43.710> arm<00:02:43.920> than<00:02:44.670> they<00:02:44.760> are<00:02:44.790> they're

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
their throwing arm than they are they're

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.760 
their throwing arm than they are they're
not<00:02:45.270> throwing<00:02:45.510> arms<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:45.930> that's<00:02:46.110> an<00:02:46.230> imbalance

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
not throwing arms so that's an imbalance

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.460 
not throwing arms so that's an imbalance
or<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.820> balance<00:02:48.209> for<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.510> sport<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.440> I

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
or is it balance for that sport so I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.080 
or is it balance for that sport so I
think<00:02:49.590> when<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:49.890> start<00:02:49.950> talking<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.550> balances

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
think when you start talking in balances

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.360 
think when you start talking in balances
you<00:02:51.209> need<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.450> start<00:02:51.660> talking<00:02:51.840> sports

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
you need to start talking sports

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.920 
you need to start talking sports
specificity<00:02:53.370> unless<00:02:54.120> you're<00:02:54.330> just<00:02:54.480> training

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
specificity unless you're just training

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.900 
specificity unless you're just training
for<00:02:55.080> general<00:02:55.740> fitness<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.580> strength<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:58.910> with

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
for general fitness and strength so with

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.160 
for general fitness and strength so with
that<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.300> mind<00:03:00.510> if<00:03:00.750> you're<00:03:00.870> competitive

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
that in mind if you're competitive

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.920 
that in mind if you're competitive
lifter<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:02.030> what's<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.150> difference<00:03:03.510> it's

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
lifter it what's the difference it's

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.070 
lifter it what's the difference it's
gonna<00:03:04.140> be<00:03:04.320> an<00:03:04.410> imbalance<00:03:04.680> anyhow<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:06.630> no<00:03:07.050> I

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
gonna be an imbalance anyhow so no I

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.040 
gonna be an imbalance anyhow so no I
want<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.440> be<00:03:07.560> concerned<00:03:07.890> with<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:09.020> all<00:03:10.020> right

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
want to be concerned with that all right

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:18.510 
want to be concerned with that all right
