 many things in our life to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.100
 to produce content on the internet 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.559
 we are very judged for producing 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.230
 content on the internet and is normal sometimes 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.850
 hit a depression youtube is online 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.739
 you should have some channel that 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.840
 you accompany the guy to the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.730
 produce video that the guy stops recording 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.190
 that comes from nothing at the peak of a 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.020
 bursting from inscribed it out of nowhere 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.520

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.989
 man begins to diminish 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.670

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.869
 thing is already accustomed in our day to 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.260

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.400
 at least in the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.750
 recorded content and in fact I understood 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.759
 Why does this happen as the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.590

 There are several reasons for this. 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.030
 happen and mine came from frustration 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.180
 It 's a very strange feeling. 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.520

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.659
 A lot of sad things, everything else, what time is it? 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.490

 It's working, bgs. I do not know what. 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.470
