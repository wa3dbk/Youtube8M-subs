hey guys brainy here and today I'll be

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.579 
hey guys brainy here and today I'll be
teaching<00:00:02.669> you<00:00:02.939> how<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.179> allocate<00:00:03.629> more<00:00:04.170> RAM<00:00:04.410> to

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
teaching you how to allocate more RAM to

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.470 
teaching you how to allocate more RAM to
your<00:00:04.680> minecraft<00:00:05.190> so<00:00:05.460> you<00:00:05.520> get<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.970> smoother

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
your minecraft so you get a smoother

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.299 
your minecraft so you get a smoother
gameplay<00:00:06.779> so<00:00:07.319> right<00:00:07.529> now<00:00:07.680> you'll<00:00:07.919> see<00:00:07.950> it

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
gameplay so right now you'll see it

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.280 
gameplay so right now you'll see it
seems<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.760> bit<00:00:08.970> jittery<00:00:09.150> for<00:00:09.540> me<00:00:09.690> it's<00:00:09.840> not<00:00:10.019> too

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
seems a bit jittery for me it's not too

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.190 
seems a bit jittery for me it's not too
bad<00:00:10.469> but<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.010> know<00:00:11.070> some<00:00:11.490> people<00:00:11.780> have<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.990> quite

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
bad but I know some people have it quite

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.799 
bad but I know some people have it quite
bad<00:00:13.469> when<00:00:14.099> recording<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:15.089> could<00:00:15.450> definitely

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
bad when recording you could definitely

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.859 
bad when recording you could definitely
see<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.650> lot<00:00:16.920> more<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:18.300> check<00:00:18.510> your<00:00:18.690> RAM

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
see this a lot more so to check your RAM

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.560 
see this a lot more so to check your RAM
you<00:00:19.050> press<00:00:19.260> f3<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:20.010> you'll<00:00:20.189> see<00:00:20.400> used<00:00:21.090> memory

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
you press f3 and you'll see used memory

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.880 
you press f3 and you'll see used memory
and<00:00:21.779> that's<00:00:22.020> how<00:00:22.140> much<00:00:22.320> you've<00:00:22.470> used<00:00:22.500> and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
and that's how much you've used and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.320 
and that's how much you've used and
that's<00:00:23.039> how<00:00:23.160> much<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.460> have<00:00:23.609> allocated<00:00:24.060> to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
that's how much you have allocated to

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.939 
that's how much you have allocated to
Minecraft<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> best<00:00:25.680> screen

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
Minecraft so this is the best screen

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.439 
Minecraft so this is the best screen
actually<00:00:26.160> there<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:26.910> go<00:00:27.000> that's<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.269> better

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
actually there we go that's a better

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.040 
actually there we go that's a better
screen<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.949> have<00:00:29.279> 910<00:00:30.210> megabytes<00:00:30.689> which<00:00:30.840> is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
screen so I have 910 megabytes which is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.410 
screen so I have 910 megabytes which is
the<00:00:31.199> default<00:00:31.380> I'd<00:00:32.130> set<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.730> 1<00:00:32.880> gig<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.329> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the default I'd set to 1 gig but it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.870 
the default I'd set to 1 gig but it
rounds<00:00:33.719> off<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.020> what's<00:00:34.260> better<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.100> Java

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
rounds off to what's better for Java

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.850 
rounds off to what's better for Java
I<00:00:35.969> believe<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.930> allocate<00:00:37.469> more<00:00:37.649> RAM<00:00:37.829> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
I believe so to allocate more RAM you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.760 
I believe so to allocate more RAM you
quit<00:00:38.309> out<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.640> your<00:00:38.790> Minecraft<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:40.050> open<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
quit out of your Minecraft you open it

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.889 
quit out of your Minecraft you open it
up<00:00:40.860> again<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.969> want<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.300> edit<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
up again and you want to edit the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.779 
up again and you want to edit the
profile<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.950> want<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> allocate<00:00:44.610> more

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
profile that you want to allocate more

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.819 
profile that you want to allocate more
ramp<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.210> now<00:00:45.390> each<00:00:45.629> profile<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.500> actually

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
ramp to now each profile can actually

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.490 
ramp to now each profile can actually
have<00:00:46.980> its<00:00:47.190> own<00:00:47.399> set<00:00:47.820> Ram<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.170> features<00:00:49.170> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
have its own set Ram and features and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.979 
have its own set Ram and features and
screen<00:00:49.980> size<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.340> all<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.120> we'll<00:00:51.690> go<00:00:51.930> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
screen size and all that so we'll go to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.600 
screen size and all that so we'll go to
the<00:00:52.260> brainy<00:00:52.440> beast<00:00:52.680> profile<00:00:53.160> which<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the brainy beast profile which is the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.970 
the brainy beast profile which is the
default<00:00:53.969> one<00:00:54.120> go<00:00:54.719> edit<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.320> down<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:55.860> it

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
default one go edit and down here it

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.880 
default one go edit and down here it
says<00:00:56.180> JVM<00:00:57.180> arguments<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:58.050> want<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.320> tick<00:00:58.680> that

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
says JVM arguments you want to tick that

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.959 
says JVM arguments you want to tick that
and<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.969> 1g<00:01:00.629> here<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.050> one<00:01:01.350> gig<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.340> xmx

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
and the 1g here is one gig so the xmx

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.210 
and the 1g here is one gig so the xmx
you<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.449> keep<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.979> can

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
you have to keep all that we can

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.060 
you have to keep all that we can
allocate<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:06.030> usually<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.500> do<00:01:07.650> have

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
allocate I usually go for but I do have

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.550 
allocate I usually go for but I do have
a<00:01:08.100> fair<00:01:08.549> bit<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.760> RAM<00:01:09.000> now<00:01:09.720> once<00:01:10.380> you've<00:01:10.530> done

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
a fair bit of RAM now once you've done

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560 
a fair bit of RAM now once you've done
that<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.040> click<00:01:11.340> Save<00:01:11.670> profile<00:01:12.119> click

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that you just click Save profile click

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.200 
that you just click Save profile click
play<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.500> game<00:01:13.680> will<00:01:13.860> load<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.670> more

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
play and the game will load up with more

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.600 
play and the game will load up with more
ramps<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.810> we'll<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.070> second

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
ramps so we'll see that in a second

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.520 
ramps so we'll see that in a second
hopefully<00:01:18.000> full<00:01:18.840> screen<00:01:19.610> single-player<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
hopefully full screen single-player and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
hopefully full screen single-player and
f3<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.770> there<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.130> go<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.939> three

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
f3 and there you go so it's three

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.030 
f3 and there you go so it's three
thousand<00:01:24.930> six<00:01:25.080> hundred<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.500> forty<00:01:25.710> megabytes

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
thousand six hundred and forty megabytes

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.660 
thousand six hundred and forty megabytes
which<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.820> what<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.360> calls<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:27.869> gig<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.740> you

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
which is what it calls for gig and you

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.999 
which is what it calls for gig and you
can<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:30.030> my<00:01:30.210> used<00:01:30.479> Ram<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> lot<00:01:31.259> lower

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
can see my used Ram is a lot lower

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.910 
can see my used Ram is a lot lower
I've<00:01:32.490> noticed<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.240> stepping<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> ram

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
I've noticed that stepping up the ram

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.940 
I've noticed that stepping up the ram
allows<00:01:35.310> minecraft<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.000> use<00:01:36.240> more<00:01:36.509> which<00:01:36.950> when

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
allows minecraft to use more which when

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
allows minecraft to use more which when
it<00:01:38.100> net-like<00:01:38.520> doesn't<00:01:38.970> even<00:01:39.090> need<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.479> like

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
it net-like doesn't even need to like

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.690 
it net-like doesn't even need to like
right<00:01:40.020> now<00:01:40.200> we're<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> same<00:01:40.740> situation<00:01:41.040> as

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
right now we're in the same situation as

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.179 
right now we're in the same situation as
before<00:01:42.180> but<00:01:42.630> we're<00:01:42.840> using<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.229> bit<00:01:43.409> more<00:01:43.590> RAM<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
before but we're using a bit more RAM I

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.859 
before but we're using a bit more RAM I
think<00:01:44.700> that's<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.030> because<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.450> wants<00:01:45.720> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
think that's just because it wants to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.980 
think that's just because it wants to
make<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> smoothest<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.689> now<00:01:48.689> it

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
make it the smoothest it can be now it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.020 
make it the smoothest it can be now it
seems<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.470> bit<00:01:49.500> weird<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:50.100> downgrade<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.759> RAM

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
seems a bit weird to downgrade the RAM

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.940 
seems a bit weird to downgrade the RAM
again<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.659> I'll<00:01:51.899> teach<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.320> guys<00:01:52.439> how<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.680> do

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
again so I'll teach you guys how to do

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.130 
again so I'll teach you guys how to do
that<00:01:53.220> once<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.030> loads<00:01:54.180> up<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.630> check<00:01:54.930> your

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
that once that loads up to check your

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.959 
that once that loads up to check your
ram<00:01:55.320> by<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.560> way<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.829> go<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.009> my<00:01:56.460> computer

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
ram by the way you go to my computer

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.819 
ram by the way you go to my computer
wherever<00:01:57.299> that's<00:01:57.630> located<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.229> your<00:01:58.380> computer

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
wherever that's located on your computer

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.830 
wherever that's located on your computer
right<00:01:59.430> click<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.000> go<00:02:00.119> properties<00:02:00.600> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
right click it and go properties and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.770 
right click it and go properties and
your<00:02:01.079> RAM<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.649> here<00:02:02.189> right<00:02:03.119> there<00:02:03.270> installed

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
your RAM is here right there installed

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.550 
your RAM is here right there installed
memory<00:02:04.560> are<00:02:04.829> a.m.<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.479> have<00:02:06.600> 16<00:02:07.110> gigabytes

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
memory are a.m. and I have 16 gigabytes

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.100 
memory are a.m. and I have 16 gigabytes
now<00:02:07.920> depending<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.670> how<00:02:08.729> much<00:02:09.479> RAM<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.780> have

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
now depending on how much RAM you have

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.470 
now depending on how much RAM you have
you<00:02:10.379> might<00:02:10.530> want<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.950> obviously<00:02:11.310> not<00:02:12.150> give<00:02:12.360> it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
you might want to obviously not give it

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.270 
you might want to obviously not give it
more<00:02:12.690> than<00:02:12.810> half

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
more than half

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.420 
more than half
every<00:02:13.430> one<00:02:13.640> quarter<00:02:14.060> maximum<00:02:14.600> so<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:16.010> get<00:02:16.310> it

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
every one quarter maximum so to get it

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.580 
every one quarter maximum so to get it
to<00:02:16.640> set<00:02:16.940> itself<00:02:17.330> back<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.690> one<00:02:17.870> like<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.319> can't

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
to set itself back to one like you can't

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.260 
to set itself back to one like you can't
just<00:02:18.709> do<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:19.130> sometimes<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.880> doesn't<00:02:20.090> work

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
just do this sometimes it doesn't work

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.740 
just do this sometimes it doesn't work
or<00:02:20.800> let's<00:02:21.800> say<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.490> tried<00:02:22.940> for<00:02:23.270> but<00:02:23.569> that

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
or let's say I I tried for but that

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.690 
or let's say I I tried for but that
wasn't<00:02:24.110> enough<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.560> wanted<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.920> try<00:02:25.100> six<00:02:25.430> so

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
wasn't enough and I wanted to try six so

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.610 
wasn't enough and I wanted to try six so
I<00:02:25.730> click<00:02:26.030> Save<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.630> doesn't<00:02:27.200> work<00:02:27.350> like<00:02:27.560> that

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
I click Save it doesn't work like that

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.400 
I click Save it doesn't work like that
you<00:02:27.860> have<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.190> unpick<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.180> save<00:02:29.660> profile<00:02:30.140> and

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
you have to unpick it save profile and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.100 
you have to unpick it save profile and
then<00:02:30.980> retake<00:02:31.520> it<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.880> then<00:02:32.030> set<00:02:32.300> it<00:02:32.420> there<00:02:32.720> so

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
then retake it and then set it there so

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.850 
then retake it and then set it there so
now<00:02:33.560> when<00:02:33.800> we<00:02:33.830> go<00:02:33.980> let's<00:02:34.730> say<00:02:35.090> I'll<00:02:35.959> do<00:02:36.380> three

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
now when we go let's say I'll do three

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.570 
now when we go let's say I'll do three
save<00:02:37.700> profile<00:02:38.209> play<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:40.010> guys<00:02:40.190> will<00:02:40.400> see

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
save profile play and you guys will see

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.550 
save profile play and you guys will see
that<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:40.880> have<00:02:41.030> three<00:02:41.270> gigabytes<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.900> RAM<00:02:42.110> I

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
that we have three gigabytes of RAM I

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.559 
that we have three gigabytes of RAM I
hope<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.130> guys<00:02:43.250> did<00:02:43.670> enjoy<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:44.330> tutorial

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
hope you guys did enjoy this tutorial

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.900 
hope you guys did enjoy this tutorial
and<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.230> did<00:02:45.410> teach<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.830> I<00:02:45.860> know<00:02:46.100> some<00:02:46.730> people

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
and it did teach you I know some people

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.729 
and it did teach you I know some people
have<00:02:47.180> really<00:02:47.540> experienced<00:02:48.050> this<00:02:48.290> stuff<00:02:48.530> and

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
have really experienced this stuff and

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.979 
have really experienced this stuff and
then<00:02:48.890> some<00:02:49.130> people<00:02:49.459> aren't<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:49.910> I'm<00:02:50.480> hoping

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
then some people aren't so I'm hoping

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.080 
then some people aren't so I'm hoping
the<00:02:51.140> people<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.560> are<00:02:51.709> don't<00:02:52.070> get<00:02:52.340> too<00:02:52.910> upset

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
the people that are don't get too upset

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.850 
the people that are don't get too upset
about<00:02:53.330> me<00:02:53.720> doing<00:02:53.959> this<00:02:54.050> but<00:02:54.320> there<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.560> go<00:02:54.680> at

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
about me doing this but there you go at

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.430 
about me doing this but there you go at
the<00:02:55.010> top<00:02:55.220> we<00:02:55.370> have<00:02:55.420> nearly<00:02:56.420> three<00:02:56.780> gig<00:02:57.019> I<00:02:57.200> goes

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
the top we have nearly three gig I goes

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.680 
the top we have nearly three gig I goes
by<00:02:57.650> megabytes<00:02:58.100> so<00:02:58.280> in<00:02:58.819> the<00:02:59.030> thousands<00:02:59.569> it

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
by megabytes so in the thousands it

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.350 
by megabytes so in the thousands it
means<00:02:59.870> go<00:03:00.380> if<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.040> was<00:03:01.160> 1,000<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.819> would<00:03:01.940> be<00:03:02.120> one

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
means go if it was 1,000 it would be one

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.259 
means go if it was 1,000 it would be one
gig<00:03:02.660> if<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.050> was<00:03:03.170> 2008<00:03:03.739> be<00:03:03.920> two<00:03:04.069> gig<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.519> just<00:03:05.090> for

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
gig if it was 2008 be two gig I just for

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.530 
gig if it was 2008 be two gig I just for
the<00:03:05.450> less<00:03:06.140> computer<00:03:06.709> savvy<00:03:07.010> people<00:03:07.340> IP<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.269> hope

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
the less computer savvy people IP I hope

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.910
