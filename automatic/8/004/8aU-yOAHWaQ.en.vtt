00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hey people talking on monday this week 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.060
 two days ago has my prag week 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.830
 That means I'm up 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.929
 saturday every day a video on the topic 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.730
 prague on the topic pragradstadt online 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.200
 Yesterday you can relax 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.089
 my blog channel online when i go there 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.680
 was and on Monday a tip like the above 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.029
 prague you will find the two videos as well 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.600
 again at the end but also in the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.270
 infobox 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.340
 today comes something delicious it is already 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.080
 In the oven we have to be and indeed 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.060
 was inspired by a Czech 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.680
 court what I have seen in frack it 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.510
 is really heavy and ready 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.640
 but I have something transformed and 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.820
 it actually consists of a layer 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.579
 of sugar and milk and honey and otherwise 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.030
 drink rolls about apples raisins 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.710
 and cinnamon and over again in bread 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.390
 bread in milk and sugar and cinnamon 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.219
 Separate drinks roll and then 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.870
 baked kind of a kind anyway 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.289
 casserole as a bit of a combo 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.699
 only city ​​the clutter then stop bread that 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.620
 I changed something has something 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.780
 made easier a bit more summery 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.399
 a bit more fruity and I hope so 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.170
 namely succeeded in an oven and 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.090
 I would say now we start with 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.710
 the recipe in my prague week and if 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.210
 you like it then let me like 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.770
 a thumbs up there we start 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.630
 So with the modified form of 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.270
 this actually relatively heavy 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.560
 dessert and there we need for 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.360
 every case fruits i have now 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.650
 strawberries and blueberries taken her 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.790
 But you can also take something else 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.020
 but those are for me immediately 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.030
 summer fruits and we need that 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.710
 most importantly bread I have 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 now taken a sesame bun because 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.950
 I like sesame somehow nice 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.270
 combined as dessert you can 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.290
 Of course you take exactly what you do 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.509
 You want to be able to get some old rolls? 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.180
 Somehow you take everything 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.650
 like and we need walnuts bz what 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.390
 I still find it funny with this 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.009
 so have a bit of fun 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.240
 you do not have to do it but me 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.100
 have made it so we so one 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.689
 still a few different structures 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.240
 also have in it and milk is quite whole 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.009
 that's where we become very important 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.360
 the buns pensions with which we now 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.189
 that's why we start taking ours 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.590
 rolls or our bread and cut 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.119
 is a centimeter-thick slices her 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.890
 can also make you fat or thin but 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.840
 a centimeter is a good thick because 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.020
 it is baked the same when I &amp; 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.719
 I 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.039
 cards and that is what we think now 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.659
 just that in the purely me 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.460
 I do not do anything about it now 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.049
 you make sugar now and still 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.910
 custard and everything but that is 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.259
 I could be too much for myself 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.940
 well imagine if you put that in there 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.250
 and now we are giving it a go 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.590
 while now as one because we're on 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.640
 our fruits to tailor ours 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.920
 Fruits with me are just the ones 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.420
 strawberries and do it in bite size 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.620
 Pieces so that they do not stop hugely 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.690
 huge there and you hang out somehow 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.540
 the whole pieces you later than then 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.190
 this casserole has yet to cut up 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.079
 if we have it all done 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.760
 Let's start with our casserole 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.260
 that means we take our bread 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.519
 and make the lower class that 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.140
 the floor, so to speak 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.930
 there we just put that soaked 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.010
 Put the bread in and put on that fruit I 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.349
 I just have somehow so far 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.239
 whirled around from the blueberries over 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.920
 the strawberries bit to the walnuts 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.390
 and then we put it on top of it again 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.769
 the last layer I have now 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.690
 not fully made and he like that 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.860
 because I somehow beat it to myself 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.120
 have presented more beautiful if it 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.530
 is founded as if it were such a 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.519
 right story especially system 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.500
 not bad if it breaks because 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.329
 it amounts to it, so to speak , if one 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.260
 it just crumbs and that is actually 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.630
 everything 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.819
 you could still if you now 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.109
 to be trolled by the original court 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.420
 actually wanted a few raisins 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.290
 and pudding that we always was 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.720
 me too much 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.910
 and that comes now at 170 180 degrees for 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.680
 about 30 minutes in the oven then looks 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.209
 Just how it is so consistent 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.440
 is I have it ten more then 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.090
 minutes longer left in it because she 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.290
 I was still relatively soft 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.060
 not had to hand over because 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.280
 to send the upper boat 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.470
 not brown enough, so to speak 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.299
 and then we get that 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.260
 whole house and is appraised and then 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.680
 now comes the same 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.090
 taste test okay i am very 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.650
 it is curious it has been so looks 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.359
 really like such a combo somehow 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.579
 that is now the plate sees something 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.109
 destroyed I see before the 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.220
 consistency I have to finish again 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.230
 I was given something I did not 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.760
 filmed that you do not need that 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.540
 the milk was too many I see 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.030
 right here 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.010
 before that, it was relatively tight now 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.660
 it has softened again so you 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.910
 you just have to have the milk, so to speak 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.239
 one prints from the rolls 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.239
 looks 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.739
 if the choice does not fit just ok 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.030
 culinary especially for really soft 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.010
 Always there you are still there 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.050
 This floor is because only the top 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.030
 A soft, so to speak , crumbles off 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.620
 only so evil is clear but below is 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.780
 a real floor and it tastes good 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.220
 I'll have to give it a try 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.449
 So, when I think about this 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.790
 I do not milk it anymore in the end 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.410
 has not been there because that is 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.479
 very fluid and that has schmidt 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.940
 very milk then it is right 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.790
 delicious it is also facing delicious halt 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.290
 It was still very fluid, it keeps me 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.910
 after drumrum but otherwise this 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.650
 combination of the walnuts with this 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.750
 bread somehow tastes a bit like 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.570
 french fist it actually too 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.669
 french toast so to speak and it tastes good 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.200
 fully well so i never thought that 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.820
 it will taste so good it is one 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.470
 You can succeed with it 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.850
 fits as I said in any case to that 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.630
 not too much milk does because the 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.760
 can mess it up 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.340
 I would say hereby we finish 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.479
 this video i eat i will cook 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.710
 not what they say they say in 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.389
 actually somehow something semmel 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.250
 I think I'm going to German demmel 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.870
 munching or something like that right now 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.030
 more finished I have so much more 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.350
