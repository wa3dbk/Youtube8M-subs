so new stabil still see us free a huge
update<00:00:12.300> for<00:00:12.570> us<00:00:12.769> we<00:00:13.769> again<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:15.179> shoe<00:00:15.389> hadn't

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.180 
update for us we again this shoe hadn't
been<00:00:15.960> updated<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.379> number<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.680> years<00:00:16.859> we

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
been updated a number of years we

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.859 
been updated a number of years we
dropped<00:00:17.520> down<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.730> eight<00:00:17.970> millimeter<00:00:18.390> offset

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
dropped down to eight millimeter offset

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.609 
dropped down to eight millimeter offset
so<00:00:20.240> again<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> smoother<00:00:22.020> ride<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.470> it

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
so again to have a smoother ride to it

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.840 
so again to have a smoother ride to it
we<00:00:22.769> drop<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.130> heel<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.369> little<00:00:23.400> bit<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.820> little

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
we drop the heel a little bit a little

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.990 
we drop the heel a little bit a little
more<00:00:24.330> under<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> forefoot<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:26.039> platinum<00:00:26.730> is

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
more under the forefoot the platinum is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.599 
more under the forefoot the platinum is
very<00:00:27.510> filled<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.380> very<00:00:28.859> very<00:00:29.250> stable

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
very filled it it's very very stable

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.030 
very filled it it's very very stable
very<00:00:30.029> controlling<00:00:30.660> d<00:00:31.260> couple<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.650> heal<00:00:31.830> nicely

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
very controlling d couple to heal nicely

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.549 
very controlling d couple to heal nicely
then<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> similar<00:00:33.930> outer<00:00:34.200> sole

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
then you see a similar outer sole

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.950 
then you see a similar outer sole
configuration<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.670> see<00:00:35.880> with<00:00:36.090> hurricane

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
configuration as you see with hurricane

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.440 
configuration as you see with hurricane
and<00:00:37.170> omni<00:00:37.590> were<00:00:38.190> taken<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.820> heavy<00:00:39.030> motion

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and omni were taken to that heavy motion

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.510 
and omni were taken to that heavy motion
control<00:00:39.750> area<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.500> issue<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.890> filled<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.370> at

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
control area the issue is filled in at

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.209 
control area the issue is filled in at
the<00:00:41.610> mid-foot<00:00:42.059> 12<00:00:42.870> millimeters<00:00:43.559> more<00:00:43.980> than

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the mid-foot 12 millimeters more than

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.760 
the mid-foot 12 millimeters more than
the<00:00:44.340> hurricane<00:00:44.789> five<00:00:45.149> millimeters<00:00:45.629> more<00:00:45.930> than

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the hurricane five millimeters more than

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.229 
the hurricane five millimeters more than
the<00:00:47.070> omni<00:00:48.050> so<00:00:49.070> again<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.250> widest<00:00:50.670> platform

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the omni so again the widest platform

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.500 
the omni so again the widest platform
then<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> huge<00:00:52.350> medial<00:00:52.829> post<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.270> foots

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
then a huge medial post on it the foots

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.049 
then a huge medial post on it the foots
going<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.750> sit<00:00:54.960> down<00:00:55.170> into<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> shoe<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.940> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
going to sit down into the shoe so it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.680 
going to sit down into the shoe so it
looks<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.539> chunky<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.710> light<00:00:59.690> 11.4

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
few this is going to be a very straight

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.520 
few this is going to be a very straight
ish<00:02:10.170> last<00:02:10.619> but<00:02:11.310> there's<00:02:11.489> still<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.760> semi<00:02:12.720> semi

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
ish last but there's still a semi semi

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.710 
ish last but there's still a semi semi
curve<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.310> mean<00:02:14.459> it's<00:02:14.910> quite<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.330> nice

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
curve to it I mean it's quite the nice

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.270 
curve to it I mean it's quite the nice
thing<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.140> full<00:02:16.380> platform<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.100> look

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
thing it's a full platform you look

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.030 
thing it's a full platform you look
portion<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:18.150> very<00:02:18.510> very<00:02:18.930> rigid<00:02:19.380> it's<00:02:19.800> going

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
portion it's very very rigid it's going

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.830 
portion it's very very rigid it's going
really<00:02:20.310> slow<00:02:20.670> down<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.090> protein<00:02:21.480> yeah<00:02:21.600> but

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
really slow down that protein yeah but

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.449 
really slow down that protein yeah but
it's<00:02:21.959> going<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> natural<00:02:22.920> ride<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.370> it

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
it's going to have a natural ride to it

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.449 
it's going to have a natural ride to it
so<00:02:23.580> we<00:02:23.670> basically<00:02:24.240> taking<00:02:24.990> design<00:02:25.830> concepts

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
so we basically taking design concepts

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.809 
so we basically taking design concepts
and<00:02:27.200> by<00:02:28.200> mechanic<00:02:28.650> concepts<00:02:29.069> up<00:02:29.250> from<00:02:29.730> our

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
and by mechanic concepts up from our

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.130 
and by mechanic concepts up from our
natural<00:02:30.209> running<00:02:30.420> series<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.870> we're<00:02:30.989> bring

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
natural running series and we're bring

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.320 
natural running series and we're bring
it<00:02:31.230> into<00:02:31.350> motion<00:02:31.560> control<00:02:32.100> yeah<00:02:32.489> instead<00:02:33.270> of

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
it into motion control yeah instead of

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.120 
it into motion control yeah instead of
it<00:02:33.510> being<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.870> shoe<00:02:34.080> box<00:02:34.290> on<00:02:34.530> your<00:02:34.620> foot<00:02:34.860> it's

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
it being that shoe box on your foot it's

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.770 
it being that shoe box on your foot it's
going<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.310> feel<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.640> shoe<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.239> can<00:02:36.270> run<00:02:36.600> in

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
going to feel like a shoe you can run in

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.930 
going to feel like a shoe you can run in
it<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.410> know<00:02:37.530> if<00:02:38.100> you're<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.280> competitive<00:02:38.819> run

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
it you know if you're a competitive run

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.580 
it you know if you're a competitive run
you<00:02:39.030> can<00:02:39.150> actually<00:02:39.300> run<00:02:39.569> fast<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.080> there's<00:02:40.500> a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590
