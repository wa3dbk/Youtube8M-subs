00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello viewers of the charm so search 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.170
 my new video i'm here in feed 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.150
 the beast 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.059
 and today I'm going to make you ridiculous 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.400
 handy mouth shows yes is in whitby 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.469
 of course you have had a lot and we 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.210
 all have their own ranch so then 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.779
 you really have four peel leftovers 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.310
 needed for different motts 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.220
 in addition if you like it and head rings 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.490
 ted you have three different ones 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.859
 holy shit what is this it is going on 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.720
 every moth as intended forces in the sir 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.949
 scratch on which adds its own suitcase 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.270
 ing 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.070
 well there is a very easy way 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.190
 to solve this problem 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.559
 Imagine you have the one head there though 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.640
 need the other yes that is one 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.079
 a bit awkward 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.539
 well I 'm just going to start at the beginning 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.489
 here in the jules we cross things with one 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.200
 in the sir ranch cuts as you see 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.840
 can do it all 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.550
 demolish with this ranch we can do it around 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.320
 turn as you see 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.480
 but of course you can't do that with 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.399
 this ranch of this rens that becomes 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.080
 used example kraft pipes 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.080
 like this iron paper 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.540
 so yes and then you can't 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.880
 change with you in this work or french 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.750
 and then you fall a crash member 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.500
 you use that for volts and emmies 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.659
 torch test of light energy sticks 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.270
 they don't work on this well either 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.490
 this or that but they do not work for 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.860
 nor did that work for you 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.840
 those sherlock or titans and the same 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:41.040
 applies therefore feels for the items from 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.259
 this is then thermal expansion is possible 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.240
 just don't stare at the board there 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.649
 margin to girl I work for 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.360
 so then you can already see that this patient is him 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.930
 there is handy only that it works 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.649
 also not for prorail kraft like you 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.750
 see 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.000
 well in raid there is an easy way 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.170
 to solve that and that is the ronnu 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.270
 ranch 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.090
 test the mot hey thommie tools for 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.920
 Detail to a ranch that makes you so bad 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.050
 simply who wants and wants people 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.840
 ns a ranch that can pretty much any 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.940
 moth you can use almost every use 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.230
 you have to marry from shaft however it is possible 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.180
 evade 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.760
 can I change with shift scrapping 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.410
 clicking the trigger 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.640
 so and then you see every catcher 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.970
 even gadver dees that also breaks then 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.530
 did we feel this also works the ms 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.530
 torch test also works 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.750
 yes these glasses do not craft because like 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.099
 me creation incidence opinion 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.630
 deployed 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.000
 this also works if you see it work 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.620
 this with pretty much anything really 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.340
 handy of course you but a ranch 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.530
 Invite now to do your job actually 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.090
 well then you have the forge plex you can with 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.430
 hold shift right mouse button 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.890
 and you get this gi 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.760
 get an information button trash here 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.069
 with items 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.170
 the swing for smart switch the power of 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.290
 the neck seconds vacation 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.299
 So whatever we propose here 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.150
 letting it and you have a lot of others 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.000
 different expressions as you see well 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.709
 this is bb that we are therefore different from 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.799
 these they also have other block ardies 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.980
 just click on this button and turn it on 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.989
 in the other moth version 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.610
 same money for this one that has one already 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.950
 a blockade 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.329
 like this even the blocks have that 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.849
 this one another blocks that 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.370
 so you put it very easily to well that 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.500
 applies to most moors 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.489
 and if you do not this thing called in 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.010
 imst dragging war 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.870
 then you have a mist captur in i give them 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.489
 it shows how you make a ball 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.090
 rolls 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:47.010
 iron and will and you make it through 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.010
 the shit in the drop also waits a while 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:53.140
 to get through 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.420
 oh that works on one side are there that 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.900
 make with on cd and you may want to be 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.090
 brother 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.519
 whatever and gold and then you need him 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.659
 the rest put me down didn't work 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.849
 points out 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.879
 just drop it there you get it here 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.769
 and then on ledge right block, and 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.090
 then you open the thing 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.400
 and then it works just like that 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.409
 worked first so that is actually handy 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.870

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.989
