00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.330 

I've<00:01:22.110> already<00:01:22.290> taking<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.980> to<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:23.220> this

I've already taking this in to get this

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700 
I've already taking this in to get this
thing<00:01:23.520> started<00:01:23.670> once<00:01:24.120> I<00:01:24.470> don't<00:01:25.470> know<00:01:25.560> what

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.960 
thing started once I don't know what
they<00:01:25.800> did<00:01:26.010> but<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.250> clearly<00:01:26.520> wasn't<00:01:26.760> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
they did but it clearly wasn't a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
they did but it clearly wasn't a
permanent<00:01:27.510> solution<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:29.070> was<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
permanent solution it was just a

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.190 
permanent solution it was just a
temporary<00:01:29.610> fix<00:01:30.120> because<00:01:30.330> it's<00:01:30.540> back<00:01:30.690> doing

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
temporary fix because it's back doing

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.560 
temporary fix because it's back doing
the<00:01:31.320> same<00:01:31.500> thing<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.980> want<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.730> thing<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the same thing and I want this thing to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.740 
the same thing and I want this thing to
be<00:01:33.870> fixed<00:01:35.600> permanently

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
be fixed permanently

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.230 
be fixed permanently
I<00:01:36.780> mean<00:01:37.020> replace<00:01:37.440> parts<00:01:38.720> replace<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.900> starter

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
I mean replace parts replace the starter

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.400 
I mean replace parts replace the starter
seems<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> power<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.080> fuel<00:01:43.380> pump<00:01:43.650> is

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
seems like the power to the fuel pump is

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.770 
seems like the power to the fuel pump is
it's<00:01:46.410> shutting<00:01:46.680> off<00:01:47.210> because<00:01:48.210> even<00:01:48.630> when<00:01:48.750> I

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it's shutting off because even when I

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.620 
it's shutting off because even when I
step<00:01:49.050> on<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.260> gas<00:01:49.790> it's<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:50.970> getting<00:01:51.270> fuel<00:01:51.480> to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
step on the gas it's not getting fuel to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.140 
step on the gas it's not getting fuel to
cause<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.080> ignition<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.550> continues<00:01:54.000> to

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
cause the ignition it just continues to

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.250 
cause the ignition it just continues to
try<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.300> turn<00:01:54.600> over<00:01:54.890> over<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.040> over<00:01:56.190> and<00:01:56.340> over

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
again once the warranty runs out so

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.900 
again once the warranty runs out so
anything<00:02:57.330> that's<00:02:57.480> damaged<00:02:58.050> as<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:59.310> result<00:02:59.580> of

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
anything that's damaged as a result of

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.509 
anything that's damaged as a result of
this<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.300> want<00:03:00.989> all<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.440> stuff<00:03:01.500> replaced

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
this I want all that stuff replaced

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.620 
this I want all that stuff replaced
I<00:03:03.800> want<00:03:04.800> all<00:03:04.980> replaced

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
I want all replaced

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.900 
I want all replaced
I<00:03:06.720> have<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.710> feeling<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.610> case<00:03:08.790> I

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
I have a feeling that is the case I

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.540 
I have a feeling that is the case I
think<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.180> I've<00:03:09.450> been<00:03:10.280> starting<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.370> thing

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
think that I've been starting this thing

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.350 
think that I've been starting this thing
up<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.330> whole<00:03:12.510> issue<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:14.360> probably

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
up and this whole issue is probably

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.940 
up and this whole issue is probably
causing<00:03:15.600> some<00:03:15.900> other<00:03:16.050> domino<00:03:16.470> effect<00:03:16.800> to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
causing some other domino effect to

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:17.930 
causing some other domino effect to
something<00:03:17.220> else<00:03:17.400> that's<00:03:17.580> going<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.790> break

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
something else that's going to break

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.940 
something else that's going to break
down<00:03:18.000> later<00:03:18.740> yesterday

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
down later yesterday

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.930 
down later yesterday
the<00:03:20.910> car<00:03:21.740> completely<00:03:22.740> shut<00:03:23.190> down<00:03:23.340> while<00:03:23.610> I<00:03:23.670> was

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
the car completely shut down while I was

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.320 
the car completely shut down while I was
driving<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.950> that's<00:03:26.100> absolutely<00:03:26.370> unsafe

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
driving it so that's absolutely unsafe

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.750 
driving it so that's absolutely unsafe
and<00:03:28.080> whenever<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:28.560> issue<00:03:28.860> is<00:03:29.220> it's<00:03:29.460> known

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
and whenever this issue is it's known

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.790

about it this shit needs to be addressed
by<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.430> company<00:03:35.790> because<00:03:35.970> if<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.240> thing<00:03:36.570> had

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
by the company because if that thing had

fast lane of the highway what would be

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.730

the end result of that what needs to be

the end result of that what needs to be
investigated<00:03:47.400> if<00:03:47.490> it's<00:03:47.610> a<00:03:47.700> simple<00:03:48.000> fix<00:03:49.220> fix<00:03:50.220> it

any issue like this after only driving

any issue like this after only driving
the<00:04:04.110> vehicle<00:04:04.530> for<00:04:05.000> two<00:04:06.000> years<00:04:06.270> and<00:04:06.390> some

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
the vehicle for two years and some

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.730 
the vehicle for two years and some
change<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.080> as<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:07.590> can<00:04:07.740> see<00:04:07.800> I<00:04:08.160> only<00:04:09.000> have

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
change and as you can see I only have

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.120 
change and as you can see I only have
32,000<00:04:10.740> miles<00:04:10.970> so<00:04:11.970> I<00:04:12.440> just<00:04:13.440> want<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.650> document

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
32,000 miles so I just want to document

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.470 
32,000 miles so I just want to document
this<00:04:14.310> in<00:04:14.520> case<00:04:14.670> someone<00:04:14.940> else<00:04:15.030> is<00:04:15.210> going

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
this in case someone else is going

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.410 
this in case someone else is going
through<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.720> same<00:04:15.930> problem<00:04:17.120> you're<00:04:18.120> not<00:04:18.180> the

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
through the same problem you're not the

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.930 
through the same problem you're not the
only<00:04:18.570> one<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.109> I<00:04:19.739> think<00:04:19.980> that<00:04:20.160> Chrysler<00:04:20.760> Jeep

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
only one and I think that Chrysler Jeep

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.420 
only one and I think that Chrysler Jeep
needs<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.710> speak<00:04:22.710> up<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.040> reach<00:04:23.130> out<00:04:23.310> to

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
needs to speak up and reach out to

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.910 
needs to speak up and reach out to
customers<00:04:23.580> about<00:04:24.180> providing<00:04:25.170> a<00:04:25.440> permanent

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
customers about providing a permanent

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.550 
customers about providing a permanent
solution<00:04:25.980> and<00:04:26.430> not<00:04:26.850> a<00:04:27.060> temporary<00:04:27.840> fix<00:04:28.230> like<00:04:28.440> I

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
solution and not a temporary fix like I

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.340 
solution and not a temporary fix like I
got<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.920> last<00:04:28.950> time
