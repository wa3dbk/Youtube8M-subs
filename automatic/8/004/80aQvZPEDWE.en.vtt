 [music] 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.869
 Hello everyone, we will see the house today 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.970
 on the publication of the comic frank miller 300 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.160
 or 300 Spartans here's a publishing house 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.020
 amphora finally they released this 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.720
 release 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.670
 Here is such a comic book 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.670
 pretty custom size on 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.559
 compared with the usual other editions 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.290
 but we will come back to this later 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.900
 In general, I adore 300 Spartans. 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.579
 exactly the film zack snider itself in 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.280
 the basis of which the plot served exactly 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.320
 This comic used to look at it. 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.210
 divide then on blu-ray 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.070
 but so many times looked one such of 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.659
 favorite films but the second part of course 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.150
 it seems that, nevertheless, I waited when we 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.100
 Finally, they will release publications in Russian 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.309
 this comic to say so 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.460
 get acquainted with the original and finally 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.369
 This happened here such a book as I already 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.060
 said the size of her non-standard if 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.729
 take for example a regular single then she 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.680
 takes like two singles we probably too 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.040
 as is usually the case for example 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.040
 our Marvelos comic like this 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.990
 Looks like I don't know where I'll put it 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.820
 because size is understandable 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:33.360
 non-standard well, it doesnâ€™t matter 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:36.730
 cover sandstorm on the turn 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.030
 such as bloody probably yes background 300 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.060
 and actually still such a yard for 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.270
 goal 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.740
 300 and the actual plot and graphics 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.990
 frank miller and color ling varle let's 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.710
 let's see what's next 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.530
 the comic came out in the period in the year 98 since May 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.150
 until September , only five were released 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.360
 issues that actually went into 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.750
 This edition and here we have the first chapter 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.000
 honor here is told to us as 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.569
 spartans are going to go to battle with 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.409
 the Persians 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.500
 Well, actually like all the film in 480 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.450
 ad 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.830
 his own father probably the main 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:29.070
 hero king leonid 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:31.380
 here he is right here for us 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.180
 same shot who remembers watched the movie yes 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.240
 where we started being told how 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.850
 trained the Spartans what they should 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.600
 to endure hunger hunger more properly 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.310
 fight here such a wolf and 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.370
 only then was he already considered Spartans 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:53.010
 and here too that moment is present 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:55.200
 when the Persian ambassador leaves us 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.970
 well or don't know how it is yamada how 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.750
 once again the catchphrase which then 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:06.720
 went in by and so on it 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.850
 This Sparta here actually this moment 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:17.520
 kicks metal ambassador this flies away from us 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:20.239
 here is the pit the second chapter is actually all that 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.480
 same as he went scrawl to 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.080
 ask for 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.590
 like permission up to go fight and 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.260
 in the end, they were bribed as a result 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.150
 nothing they approved this hike but in 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.430
 In the end, anyway, Leonid went without them. 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.560
 accord here are various battles with the Persians 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.580
 these are the immortal so-called before 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.360
 who are not the strongest Persians 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.660
 and somewhere here 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.390
 block for some reason I missed the main 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.410
 traitor and taffy alt who wanted 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.299
 fight on the side of the spartans but of 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.630
 the fact that you see such a freak humpbacked 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:04.829
 yes he could not raise his accounts if 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.200
 some one and spartans will lower bills 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.180
 can break through the defense and perish all 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.510
 of one and for that reason 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.109
 Leonid refuses him and in the end he him 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.239
 then gives this ether alt shows 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:24.160
 Persians secret path through which 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:27.940
 actually don't kill Spartans in general 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:36.570
 the building is excellent 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:39.310
 money and so since the last we have 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.590
 the image is like a movie 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.080
 torn to pieces 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.810
 spartans are all shot single 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.240
 whose survivor went on himself 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.990
 Leonid so he told them their exploits and 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.120
 to take revenge on the Persians and then to have this 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.880
 come to an end 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.800
 such an edition of comic frank miller 300 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.729
 Spartans from Amphora Publishing 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.770
 I am completely satisfied with this edition and 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.050

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.780
