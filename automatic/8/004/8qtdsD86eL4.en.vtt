00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
that meet the bay is full of water and

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:51.729 
that meet the bay is full of water and
and<00:00:49.609> the<00:00:50.420> water<00:00:50.690> is<00:00:50.840> going<00:00:51.079> with<00:00:51.289> us<00:00:51.350> we<00:00:51.710> have

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
and the water is going with us we have

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.299 
and the water is going with us we have
an<00:00:52.010> easterly<00:00:52.519> wind<00:00:52.940> which<00:00:53.300> is<00:00:53.539> favorable<00:00:54.309> but

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
an easterly wind which is favorable but

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.069 
an easterly wind which is favorable but
what<00:00:55.489> happens<00:00:55.879> when<00:00:55.969> we<00:00:56.269> haven't<00:00:56.570> i'm<00:00:56.750> going

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
what happens when we haven't i'm going

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.259 
what happens when we haven't i'm going
with<00:00:57.260> us<00:00:57.469> it<00:00:58.100> makes<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.550> bumps<00:00:58.850> actually

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
with us it makes the bumps actually

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.209 
with us it makes the bumps actually
smaller<00:00:59.600> because<00:00:59.929> the<00:01:00.140> waters<00:01:00.530> moving<00:01:00.769> with

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
smaller because the waters moving with

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.109 
smaller because the waters moving with
the<00:01:01.250> with<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:02.179> swell<00:01:02.629> train<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:03.850> so<00:01:04.850> it<00:01:04.970> makes

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
the with the swell train and so it makes

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.029 
the with the swell train and so it makes
the<00:01:05.269> bump<00:01:05.539> smaller<00:01:05.929> but<00:01:06.289> it<00:01:06.380> also<00:01:06.530> makes<00:01:06.860> it

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
the bump smaller but it also makes it

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:10.570 
the bump smaller but it also makes it
runs<00:01:07.340> faster<00:01:08.229> so<00:01:09.229> your<00:01:09.410> best<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.890> i<00:01:10.070> turn<00:01:10.399> the

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
runs faster so your best and i turn the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.700 
runs faster so your best and i turn the
incoming<00:01:11.060> tide<00:01:14.080> obviously<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.200> windier<00:01:15.619> it

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
incoming tide obviously the windier it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.850 
incoming tide obviously the windier it
is<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.690> workbench<00:01:17.690> that's<00:01:18.409> created<00:01:19.090> chops<00:01:20.860> so

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
is the workbench that's created chops so

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.940 
is the workbench that's created chops so
what<00:01:22.849> we're<00:01:22.970> looking<00:01:23.000> at<00:01:23.300> right<00:01:23.360> now<00:01:23.569> so<00:01:24.080> we<00:01:24.830> go

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
what we're looking at right now so we go

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.580 
what we're looking at right now so we go
out<00:01:25.099> there<00:01:25.369> kind<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:25.880> set<00:01:26.119> up<00:01:26.560> our<00:01:27.560> equipment

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
out there kind of set up our equipment

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.389

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
even changed my scans to grab more water

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.380 
even changed my scans to grab more water
but<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.440> really<00:03:25.739> need<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.070> go<00:03:26.310> into<00:03:26.489> go<00:03:26.970> and

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
but you really need to go into go and

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.470 
but you really need to go into go and
change<00:03:27.750> offset<00:03:28.290> your<00:03:28.440> stand<00:03:28.739> really<00:03:29.340> drive<00:03:29.760> up

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.830 

that's<00:03:33.480> how<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.630> don't<00:03:33.840> compress<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.290> hull

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.770 

you're<00:03:40.840> also<00:03:41.610> up<00:03:42.610> on<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:42.910> water<00:03:44.520> okay<00:03:45.780> so

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
you're also up on the water okay so

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.180 
you're also up on the water okay so
let's<00:03:46.960> look<00:03:47.050> at<00:03:47.200> him<00:03:47.320> then<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:47.740> if<00:03:47.860> he's<00:03:48.010> doing

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
let's look at him then so if he's doing

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.660 
let's look at him then so if he's doing
this<00:03:48.310> stroke<00:03:49.800> try<00:03:50.800> and<00:03:50.920> do<00:03:50.980> this<00:03:51.010> deep<00:03:51.340> strokes

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
this stroke try and do this deep strokes

00:03:51.670 --> 00:04:19.360 
this stroke try and do this deep strokes
missing

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.979 

so<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.820> blades<00:04:21.060> always<00:04:21.509> straight<00:04:21.750> up<00:04:21.840> and

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
so the blades always straight up and

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.749 
so the blades always straight up and
down<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:24.150> board<00:04:24.419> tends<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.919> board<00:04:26.190> NC<00:04:26.580> yah

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
down the board tends to the board NC yah

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:34.339 
down the board tends to the board NC yah
when<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.180> stroke<00:04:32.570> but<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:33.690> do<00:04:33.840> those<00:04:34.050> kinds

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
when you stroke but you do those kinds

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:35.960 
when you stroke but you do those kinds
of<00:04:34.380> stroke<00:04:34.620> sometimes<00:04:35.009> on<00:04:35.220> on<00:04:35.430> that<00:04:35.759> kind<00:04:35.910> of

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
of stroke sometimes on on that kind of

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.460 
of stroke sometimes on on that kind of
board<00:04:38.270> control<00:04:39.270> it's<00:04:39.509> called<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.810> chase<00:04:40.080> drug

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
board control it's called the chase drug

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.020 
board control it's called the chase drug
like<00:04:41.099> that<00:04:41.570> okay<00:04:43.310> so<00:04:44.310> now<00:04:44.460> we're<00:04:44.729> getting<00:04:44.940> on

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
like that okay so now we're getting on

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.779 
like that okay so now we're getting on
towards<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.360> buoy<00:04:45.599> what<00:04:45.810> are<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:45.960> looking<00:04:46.199> at

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
towards the buoy what are you looking at

00:04:46.789 --> 00:06:13.020 
towards the buoy what are you looking at
or<00:04:47.789> thinking<00:04:48.120> about<00:05:06.800> okay<00:05:07.800> so

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.090
