following that we have to design his
helmet<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:54.270> first<00:03:54.510> is<00:03:54.900> going<00:03:55.110> to<00:03:55.200> be<00:03:55.320> a

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
helmet so the first is going to be a

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.080 
helmet so the first is going to be a
white<00:03:55.980> sticker<00:03:56.370> here<00:03:56.670> it's<00:03:56.820> going<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:56.970> be<00:03:57.060> a

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
white sticker here it's going to be a

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.880 
white sticker here it's going to be a
circle<00:03:57.570> I'm<00:03:58.080> going<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.290> place<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.650> at<00:03:58.740> this

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
circle I'm going to place it at this

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.290 
circle I'm going to place it at this
angle<00:03:59.160> right<00:03:59.430> here<00:03:59.490> you<00:03:59.760> can<00:03:59.880> see<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.180> right

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
angle right here you can see it right

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.790 
angle right here you can see it right
there

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
there

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.750 
there
you're<00:04:01.800> going<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:01.980> use<00:04:02.070> a<00:04:02.100> upside-down

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
you're going to use a upside-down

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.030 
you're going to use a upside-down
triangle<00:04:03.330> make<00:04:03.450> sure<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:03.720> switch<00:04:04.040> flip

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
triangle make sure you switch flip

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.180 
triangle make sure you switch flip
vertically<00:04:05.550> to<00:04:05.790> on<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:07.170> I'll<00:04:07.320> just<00:04:07.530> place<00:04:08.160> it

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
vertically to on and I'll just place it

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.660 
vertically to on and I'll just place it
around<00:04:08.640> this<00:04:09.060> angle<00:04:09.450> right<00:04:09.570> here<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:10.670> then

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
around this angle right here and then

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.729 
around this angle right here and then
you<00:04:11.820> need<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.270> sticker<00:04:12.660> for<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:12.989> back<00:04:13.260> end<00:04:13.560> as

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739

you need a sticker for the back end as
well<00:04:14.070> for<00:04:14.640> consistency<00:04:15.000> purposes<00:04:16.070> so<00:04:17.070> just

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
well for consistency purposes so just

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.180

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
place it under these settings right here

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.140 
place it under these settings right here
and<00:04:20.900> then<00:04:21.950> you'll<00:04:22.950> need<00:04:23.100> a<00:04:23.280> sticker<00:04:23.730> for<00:04:24.060> his

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
place it around this angle here and then

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.280 
place it around this angle here and then
you<00:04:34.980> pretty<00:04:35.370> much<00:04:35.520> have<00:04:35.910> 0<00:04:36.360> from<00:04:36.690> magnetic<00:04:36.990> so

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
you pretty much have 0 from magnetic so

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.410 
you pretty much have 0 from magnetic so
and<00:04:37.530> color<00:04:38.010> is<00:04:38.190> blade<00:04:38.400> like<00:04:38.580> this<00:04:38.640> light<00:04:39.150> blue
