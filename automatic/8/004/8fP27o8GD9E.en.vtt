00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.350
 hello friends a taste again are 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.880
 with all of you this time I love you 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.789
 talk about extensibles for 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.430
 face 20 which sometimes not 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:20.640
 They are very practical and they facilitate us 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.619
 pretty good work 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.280
 how stencils are made I made them 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.920
 with this type of material is a folder 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.930
 of plastic there is a plastic that they sell 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.149
 for stencil is just I have 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.730
 seen in walmart stores but it's 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.410
 much thicker than this and at the time 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.670
 that you place it in what is the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.609
 face of the child as it does not remain 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.769
 rigid then this one I like because 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.920
 as it is a bit soft because it 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.809
 Adhere and take the shape of the cheek or 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.579
 of the arm or on the forehead where what 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.100
 let's go use then I'll 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.109
 I recommend using this type of plastic 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.149
 that comes in these folders or one 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.979
 seemed like you are and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.570
 especially so that they accommodate 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.220
 work with he 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.180
 this one helped me a lot and in fact 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.600
 all my stencils I made with this 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.259
 type of plastic 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.360
 good that more I'm going to share about 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.030
 of my experience with resistance to 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.290
 principle when I did not know what was going 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.790
 starting that I did not have much 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.580
 experience had not learned techniques 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.229
 about how to paint hearts or 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.259
 paint the flowers that I have shown 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.409
 and how to do them and all that I did 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.409
 many extensibles look I have them 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.330
 saved here in this is an album in 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.630
 a light for photos I took it for 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.909
 save all my stencil is here they are 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.280
 I have enough of many figures 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.229
 and good to date although I already dominate 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.819
 some techniques are also very 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.819
 practical as for example 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.410
 these of these spiders are very 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.660
 easy to do and nothing else with the 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.850
 placed in this part and with the sponge 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.520
 with black paint because quickly no longer 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.350
 you have to be delineating or anything by the 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.620
 style then this is a very design 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.630
 fast in ten minutes you are already 34 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.790
 spiders and he has very another of the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.780
 stencil is that I like to use East 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.750
 abbot and signal 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.600
 since it also goes nothing else with 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.640
 black color and nothing else we can put 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.890
 maybe some blank hairline for 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.780
 give a little light to the design in what 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.550
 that is some little bank and we have left 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.250
 pretty nice another of the stencils 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.640
 that they also used frequently was 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.030
 this one to make the mini mouse design 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.170
 since they asked me enough 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.840
 and well I made the little heart more or less 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.150
 to the size of the girl's cheek and the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.530
 outline of what is the bun and nothing 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.330
 more he painted everything red and now 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.760
 delineate because it was much easier for me and 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.440
 It saved me time, but of course now 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.860
 It's faster for me to do it with the 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.210
 brush to be putting him that is 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.820
 another one that I recommend is this 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.100
 in children sometimes they ask us for something like 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.350
 of lightning mcqueen and well then this one 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.900
 doing the ray saves us enough 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.930
 time to be there designing them with 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.940
 orange and the yellow that leads to 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.730
 we put him in those two colors and we see 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.280
 the fluffy here and we're just going to 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.380
 delineate it with red or black color and we 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.840
 it will be very very beautiful and it is very 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.030
 Quick 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.819
 and well, well, there are many who 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.690
 could recommend little by little I will go 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.790
 doing some designs on videos in 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.950
 where I use them and well, since they already 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.800
 you will be able to give an idea if you 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.629
 like to have that stencil or not from where 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.000
 you can take out the images for 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:52.510
 do your stencil is good directly 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.760
 this one they put there lightning mcqueen in google 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.920
 and images and something will appear 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.349
 like this and nothing else for you 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.880
 they make the image bigger or bigger 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.099
 depending on the size that you 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.709
 they will love and they do the same with 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.019
 of batman they put there goes to you signal of 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.849
 batman and they will appear this and for 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.410
 be able to make your stay in a way 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.209
 easy what they have to do is already 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.610
 then once they have already lowered their 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.760
 image will be loaded in this way 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.640
 what is the plastic 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.360
 well and nothing more carefully with the 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.600
 Cutter tip or exact one will go 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.090
 cutting like this 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.250
 of the pure banks and they will stay 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:37.340
 what is the outline of the ghost 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.690
 and already this part if you like the 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.690
 can stick in what is 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.410
 your notebook or your album where you go to 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.680
 have their specials to serve them 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.360
 as a reference of how the 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.360
 detail of your stay and as per 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.590
 example here in this I here I left what 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.990
 I reported to the stencil of my the skull 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.570
 that is more to me and that's how it's easier for me 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.520
 see how it is drawn in the eyes a 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.180
 Once I've done the white outline 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.180
 with the sterile 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:17.129
 and good friends, I think they are all 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.500
 the details that I had to tell you 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:21.150
 about the stencils I hope this 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.190
 brief tutorial give you an idea of ​​how 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.449
 make yours and see you in the 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.449
 next tutorial until see
