00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 what are the sighs this is something 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.620
 everyday life does not know what 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.450
 sigh but good look in reality 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.150
 has biological explanation because 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.670
 we sigh for what purpose to sigh the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.789
 lung is full of alveoli that are 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.730
 like water balloons that inflate each 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.710
 time you breathe but not always 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.920
 they open all and sometimes there are some 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.949
 how many without air capped then is 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.340
 necessary every so much hyperventilation is 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.730
 expand the lungs that's a sigh 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.489
 what I do is expand ventilate the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.329
 pulmonary alveoli that are not well 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.520
 ventilated expand the lung now 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.950
 when you sigh that you realize 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.420
 in everyday life when one sighs 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.039
 well do not sigh for example in 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.030
 Boredom sometimes does not get bored 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.000
 sighs in fatigue one sighs sometimes 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.270
 in an angry situation 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.040
 sighs sometimes a sighs when 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.050
 change of task for example one is 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.470
 doing such a task as it is a bit 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.160
 tired changes another task and in that 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.050
 moment sighs a thousand is so important 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.630
 sigh that even the respirators 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.400
 automatic devices used in therapy 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.130
 intensive when a patient is with 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.619
 automatic respirator that gives air to 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.510
 the lungs that one can regulate up 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.170
 the amount of sighs per minute 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:30.130
 because you need to expand some parts 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.649
 of the lung and as we say that one 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.410
 sighs in boredom tiredness change 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.050
 of tasks or anger is good of life 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.640
 everyday that sometimes there are emotions that 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.090
 they make you sigh 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.340
 love maybe those situations life 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.670
 they make one also every so often sigh 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.440
 there is no biological explanation 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.619
 psicobiolÃ³gica if you ask me to 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.009
 made of why one sighs in a 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.140
 situation of love the truth that would have 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.720
 to use something simply from life 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.790
 everyday of what one hears in the 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.390
 street is probably that sigh of 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.950
 love is nothing but air that remains 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.950
 for someone who is missing
