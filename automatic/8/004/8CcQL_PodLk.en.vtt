00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.200
 a display harms the nexus 7 here 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.860
 the umts version at the one 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.170
 repair still worth 165 euro costs 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.990
 new display such damage 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.949
 a 200 euro expensive 16 gb wlan model 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.150
 would be a total economic loss 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.130
 this display can only be opened 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.340
 one half serve it so you have to 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.869
 turn around to unlock 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.039
 the repair starts with the 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.930
 remove the lid 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.870
 This has become a tough guitar 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.030
 plektrum proves the inner life of the wlan 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.380
 version looks a little bit different 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.090
 at the procedure at 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.430
 disassemble changes as a result 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.680
 but hardly anything 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.020
 the battery of the umpte nexus is of two 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.360
 he is also with adhesive strips 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.399
 The adhesive tape sticks to the housing 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.050
 solve with tweezers too 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.309
 Prying careful gentleman one needs 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.320
 a suitable tool 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.039
 then you pull the connections of the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.039
 batteries off 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.320
 Now comes the speaker's turn 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.270
 he will 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.100
 keep screwed after that 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.830
 also remove the associated stronger 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.810
 from the wlan nexus is the 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.170
 plug under the heat baffles then 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.640
 he is a little later in the series 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.650
 one of the screws for the boards 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.420
 Micro USB connection and headset socket 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.119
 will hold a piece of tape 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.110
 covered, turn the screw 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.740
 liberate the catch and 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.479
 pull the board out to the front 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.520
 with a hair dryer you solve the glue of the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.500
 heat light black sun at the umts 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.940
 version first the adhesive film on the edge 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.940
 then the heat baffles 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.070
 the thin tinplate over the processor 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.420
 is not available at the wlan version 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.460
 solve the connection of the on the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.020
 chassis glued flat cable 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.020
 and pull it off carefully 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.820
 Now disconnect the connection 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.610
 motherboard 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.960
 buttons and a switch solve them all 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.100
 the remaining ones screw the ones 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.290
 hold the board 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.690
 two of them are under the connection 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.090
 To the display, release the locks 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.950
 and push the wires out 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.720
 One does not screw it right away 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.209
 see her sitting under a small 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.450
 Sticker at the top about two 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.800
 centimeters away from the right edge 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.720
 just push the screwdriver 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.099
 through now they still solve the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.209
 Connection left of the two 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:39.540
 Ribbon cable now lift the circuit board 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.340
 out of the chassis two more 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.690
 screws hold the metal frame on 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.519
 display chassis fixed 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.430
 they are on the left side 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.579
 untie the adhesive film on the top right and 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.500
 Take the frame 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.120
 Now you need some of the new display 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.459
 Parts must be transferred 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.590
 these include the adhesive film as well as a 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.360
 short connecting cable remove them 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.610
 the insulating tape and open the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.620
 Lock both parts briefly 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.150
 to the side 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.930
 loosen the adhesive foil with a hair dryer 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.430
 it's easier to pull off 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.290
 put the foil back on and 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.950
 put the short connection cable 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.269
 again 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.069
 Isolation, too, belongs to it now 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.109
 still has the plastic frame of the old 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.239
 chassis to be brought to the new 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.400
 Above all, he is strong up and down 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.329
 glue the glue back together with it 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.370
 to a hair dryer 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.400
 Press the frame from all sides 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.260
 away so he should not break that 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.060
 double-sided adhesive tape on the old 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.040
 Chassis remain so loosen them 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.660
 already when disassembling and sticking 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.109
 smooth it as smoothly as possible 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.239
 frame again on the glassplitter of the 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.620
 old displays must now be careful 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.660
 removed from the frame 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.609
 this is about a sharp 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.030
 knife easier go again with 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.859
 a hair dryer that dissolves the glue now 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.900
 build the new display in the frame 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.910
 and push it carefully at all 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.500
 pages firmly 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.780
 after assembling all parts in 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.769
 The device should reverse the order 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.900
 start again 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.669
 At first we came back to our nexus 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.010
 about problems with the display operation 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:14.540
 re- insert the display connector 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.540
 was enough to fix that
