enough that the players are running out

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.960 
enough that the players are running out
of<00:00:25.920> minerals<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.340> there<00:00:26.460> man<00:00:26.609> that's<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:26.910> of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
of minerals in there man that's one of

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.700 
of minerals in there man that's one of
the<00:00:27.029> reasons<00:00:27.300> why<00:00:27.420> they're<00:00:27.630> bothering<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.590> get

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the reasons why they're bothering to get

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.400 
the reasons why they're bothering to get
these<00:00:29.490> expansions<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.179> much<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.840> more<00:00:31.109> tanks

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410

going down on that Ridge Savior again in
trouble<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.719> time<00:00:33.780> he<00:00:34.020> doesn't<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.350> those

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
trouble this time he doesn't have those

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.049 
trouble this time he doesn't have those
valkyries<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.100> he<00:00:35.160> does<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> lights<00:00:35.880> on

valkyries but he does have the lights on
that<00:00:36.239> Ridge<00:00:36.360> not<00:00:36.630> enough<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.050> don't<00:00:37.200> think<00:00:37.380> to

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
that Ridge not enough I don't think to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.380 
that Ridge not enough I don't think to
prevent<00:00:37.829> saving<00:00:38.730> from<00:00:38.850> really<00:00:39.059> taking<00:00:39.329> out

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
prevent saving from really taking out

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.240 
prevent saving from really taking out
those<00:00:39.540> tanks<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:39.989> those<00:00:40.140> mule<00:00:40.590> estar<00:00:41.010> enough

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
those tanks but those mule estar enough

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.280 
those tanks but those mule estar enough
to<00:00:41.370> prevent<00:00:41.610> Savior<00:00:41.940> another<00:00:42.809> Valkyrie

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
to prevent Savior another Valkyrie

to prevent Savior another Valkyrie
coming<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.670> looks<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:44.910> Savior

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
coming in there but it looks like Savior

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.930

lost a few medalist there and lakes
medals<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.390> kind<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.780> pulling<00:00:49.050> him<00:00:49.289> back

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
medals just kind of pulling him back

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.910 
medals just kind of pulling him back
there<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:49.950> wow<00:00:51.320> that's<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.410> really<00:00:52.440> really

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
there and now wow that's a really really

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.100 
there and now wow that's a really really
nice<00:00:53.129> spot<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:53.670> shutter<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.719> dropping

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
nice spot for shutter to be dropping

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
nice spot for shutter to be dropping
some<00:00:55.260> more<00:00:55.410> forces<00:00:55.800> there<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.190> those<00:00:56.370> glass

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
some more forces there so those glass

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.430 
some more forces there so those glass
are<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.180> perfect<00:00:57.420> position<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:58.020> hold<00:00:58.260> off

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
are in a perfect position to hold off

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.750 
are in a perfect position to hold off
air<00:00:58.710> forces<00:00:59.480> from<00:01:00.480> his<00:01:00.750> forces<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> ridge

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
air forces from his forces on the ridge

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.549 
air forces from his forces on the ridge
so<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.180> really<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.780> looking<00:01:03.899> bad<00:01:04.290> for

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
so this is really really looking bad for

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.190 
so this is really really looking bad for
CJ<00:01:05.460> honestly<00:01:05.880> basically<00:01:06.720> at<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.930> point

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
CJ honestly basically at this point

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.469 
CJ honestly basically at this point
Savior<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.250> kind<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.580> pinned<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.060> right<00:01:09.299> now

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479

Savior is kind of pinned in right now
and<00:01:10.549> memories<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.000> do

something crazy pretty soon if he's

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.410 
something crazy pretty soon if he's
gonna<00:01:15.380> if<00:01:16.490> CJ<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> come<00:01:18.090> back<00:01:18.270> in

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
gonna if CJ is going to come back in

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.929 
gonna if CJ is going to come back in
this<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.080> now<00:01:19.259> Savior's<00:01:20.189> expansion<00:01:20.729> getting

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
this and now Savior's expansion getting

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.550 
this and now Savior's expansion getting
attacked<00:01:21.180> by<00:01:21.270> siblings<00:01:21.689> ok<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.170> lose<00:01:22.380> so

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
attacked by siblings ok as we lose so

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.690 
attacked by siblings ok as we lose so
there's<00:01:22.740> these<00:01:22.860> people<00:01:23.250> take<00:01:23.400> up<00:01:23.549> those

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
there's these people take up those

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.030 
there's these people take up those
things<00:01:23.909> though<00:01:24.439> it<00:01:25.439> looks<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.830> pause

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
things though it looks like you pause

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.440 
things though it looks like you pause
just<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> formula<00:01:26.850> probably<00:01:27.150> go<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.360> there

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
just the formula probably go in there

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.990 
just the formula probably go in there
and<00:01:27.540> take<00:01:27.630> those<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:28.130> basically<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.850> said

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and take those out basically like I said

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.249 
and take those out basically like I said
save<00:01:30.240> your<00:01:30.390> kind<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.630> pin<00:01:30.780> back<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.680> to

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
save your kind of pin back so it's up to

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.319 
save your kind of pin back so it's up to
memory<00:01:34.259> at<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.530> point<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.280> pull<00:01:35.850> something

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
memory at this point to pull something

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
memory at this point to pull something
out<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:37.439> would<00:01:38.159> really<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.700> them

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
out I would really like to see them

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.280 
out I would really like to see them
going<00:01:39.090> with<00:01:39.240> some<00:01:39.390> cultures<00:01:39.840> or<00:01:40.020> something

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.679 
going with some cultures or something
like<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.060> open<00:01:42.060> things<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.540> don't

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
like that and open things up I don't

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.580 
like that and open things up I don't

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
factory there he's going to have to pull

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.620 
factory there he's going to have to pull
off<00:04:09.550> some<00:04:09.790> drops<00:04:10.060> or<00:04:10.209> something<00:04:10.480> like<00:04:10.569> that

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
off some drops or something like that

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.270 
off some drops or something like that
and<00:04:11.160> now<00:04:12.660> we're<00:04:13.660> okay<00:04:14.110> oh<00:04:14.140> this<00:04:14.380> is<00:04:14.440> outside<00:04:14.740> oh

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
and now we're okay oh this is outside oh

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.090 
and now we're okay oh this is outside oh

Savior<00:04:22.950> memory<00:04:23.950> has<00:04:24.100> has<00:04:24.640> dropped<00:04:25.210> a

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
Savior memory has has dropped a

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.570 
Savior memory has has dropped a
substantial<00:04:25.840> force<00:04:26.080> in<00:04:26.230> his<00:04:26.290> base<00:04:26.500> some<00:04:27.310> tanks

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
substantial force in his base some tanks

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.620 
substantial force in his base some tanks
on<00:04:27.669> some<00:04:27.820> fly<00:04:27.910> off<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.240> that's<00:04:28.360> going<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.570> be

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
on some fly off so that's going to be

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.110 
on some fly off so that's going to be
able<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.870> put<00:04:28.960> things<00:04:29.230> back<00:04:29.440> pretty<00:04:29.710> well<00:04:30.120> it

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
able to put things back pretty well it

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.990 
able to put things back pretty well it
looks<00:04:31.330> like<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:32.260> CJ<00:04:33.070> may<00:04:33.460> have<00:04:33.700> finally

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
looks like the CJ may have finally

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.630 
looks like the CJ may have finally
reached<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.510> stalemate<00:04:34.750> it<00:04:34.990> looks<00:04:35.140> like<00:04:35.260> they

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
reached the stalemate it looks like they

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.159 
reached the stalemate it looks like they
looks<00:04:36.640> like<00:04:36.790> shutter<00:04:37.480> took<00:04:37.780> some<00:04:37.930> of<00:04:37.960> his

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
looks like shutter took some of his

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.530 
looks like shutter took some of his
forces<00:04:38.470> out<00:04:38.650> in<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.860> middle<00:04:39.100> so<00:04:39.610> they<00:04:40.360> haven't

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
forces out in the middle so they haven't

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.180 
forces out in the middle so they haven't
faded<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.200> all<00:04:41.320> that<00:04:41.470> very<00:04:41.650> well<00:04:41.800> right<00:04:42.160> now

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
faded and all that very well right now

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.400 
faded and all that very well right now
but<00:04:42.760> yeah<00:04:42.910> save<00:04:43.240> your<00:04:43.270> loss<00:04:43.600> that<00:04:43.930> Hatcher<00:04:44.140> in

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
but yeah save your loss that Hatcher in

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.170 
but yeah save your loss that Hatcher in
the<00:04:44.470> bottom<00:04:44.770> right<00:04:44.890> corner<00:04:44.919> so<00:04:45.760> Savior

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
the bottom right corner so Savior

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.060 
the bottom right corner so Savior
basically<00:04:46.690> doesn't<00:04:46.870> have<00:04:47.110> any<00:04:47.440> intake<00:04:47.860> right

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
basically doesn't have any intake right

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.100 
basically doesn't have any intake right
now<00:04:48.280> he's<00:04:48.790> got<00:04:49.000> extremely<00:04:49.540> little<00:04:49.780> intake

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
now he's got extremely little intake

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.400 
now he's got extremely little intake
inside<00:04:50.680> his<00:04:50.830> base<00:04:51.010> and<00:04:51.250> now<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:52.020> memory<00:04:53.020> trying

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
inside his base and now a memory trying

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.440 
inside his base and now a memory trying
to<00:04:53.500> expand<00:04:53.830> their<00:04:53.860> mute<00:04:54.610> lists<00:04:54.940> coming<00:04:55.240> in<00:04:55.330> if

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
to expand their mute lists coming in if

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.880 
to expand their mute lists coming in if
he<00:04:55.480> loses<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:55.900> if<00:04:56.169> you<00:04:56.290> lose<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.650> space

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
he loses that if you lose the space

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.980 
he loses that if you lose the space
that's<00:04:57.430> basically<00:04:57.820> GG<00:04:58.300> because<00:04:58.600> then<00:04:58.780> neither

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
that's basically GG because then neither

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.420 
that's basically GG because then neither
player<00:04:59.290> will<00:04:59.500> have<00:04:59.620> much<00:04:59.830> intake<00:05:00.160> right<00:05:00.310> now

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
player will have much intake right now

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.060 
player will have much intake right now
he<00:05:00.490> loses<00:05:00.880> that<00:05:01.000> bunker<00:05:01.419> and<00:05:01.919> it's<00:05:02.919> going<00:05:03.010> to

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
he loses that bunker and it's going to

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.270 
he loses that bunker and it's going to
lose<00:05:03.310> a<00:05:03.340> lot<00:05:03.820> of<00:05:04.060> SCV's<00:05:04.750> right<00:05:04.990> now<00:05:05.169> oh<00:05:05.440> my<00:05:06.070> god

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
game both sides holding out very well

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.380 
game both sides holding out very well
and<00:05:23.890> it<00:05:24.220> was<00:05:24.370> not<00:05:24.550> one<00:05:24.760> of<00:05:24.790> those<00:05:24.940> quick<00:05:25.180> games
