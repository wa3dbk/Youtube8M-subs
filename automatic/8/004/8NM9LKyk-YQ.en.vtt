00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.970
 the ingredients are four eggs 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.110
 small or three large eggs 150 g of 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.029
 icing sugar 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.150
 2 tablespoons of bitter cocoa in 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.430
 powder 500 grams of mascarpone 10 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.640
 cups of coffee 300 g of biscuits 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.890
 ladyfingers or pavesini a pinch of salt 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.829
 and 2 tablespoons of sweet segre liqueur 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.840
 companies start by making coffee 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.200
 then put it in a bowl and leave it 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.200
 cool down 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:50.129
 break the eggs and separate the egg whites 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.129
 from the yolks as I am doing 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.620
 add a pinch of salt to the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.190
 egg whites and then beat them with one 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.370
 whip 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.560
 until they are well set up 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.560
 well so 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.530
 if you have not found the icing sugar 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.720
 already ready at the supermarket 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.860
 you can do it by grinding the col 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.909
 coffee grinder then add it to the yolks 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.770
 some eggs and start mixing the 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:51.000
 everything first with a fork and then 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.000
 beat them with a whisk 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.750
 this is a result 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:02.190
 then add the two compounds and mix 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.190
 there well well 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:23.659
 finally add the mascarpone e 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.980
 stir well until I am 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:29.480
 become the very creamy mixture 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.049
 at this point we begin the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.840
 real preparation of tiramisu 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:39.340
 dip the biscuits for a few seconds 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.090
 in the cold coffee to which you have added 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.879
 if you want it a little heart 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.470
 then pour the mixture over it 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.959
 you have prepared the cream you have 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.670
 prepared let's say about a quarter of the 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.920
 total 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.290
 so that you can make four of them 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.319
 layers 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:04.760
 spread the cream on the biscuits so 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:10.549
 uniform and then make another layer 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:14.170
 of biscuits indeed three other layers of 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.170
 biscuits and cream 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.760
 on the last layer sprinkled c over the 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.970
 bitter cocoa 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.970
 et voila the tiramisu is ready
