00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.280
 hello to all here I freeze and we get 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.630
 found in a new video where I 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.179
 will explain to you how to transform 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.910
 your iphone ipod touch ipad ipad mini 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.380
 android devices on the phone 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.660
 multi sim portable 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.519
 even though it may be surprising you 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.160
 be able to call and send 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.119
 sms directly with ipod touch 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.429
 and ipad 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.349
 all this is possible thanks to this little 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.059
 case called soglo which is 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.370
 connects in bluetooth with your 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.989
 camera looking closer at you 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.480
 have a location where you go 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.070
 power m 1 up to three sim cards 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.260
 it depends on who you go 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.620
 buy me for example it's a multi 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.750
 sim 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.000
 I will be able to use two 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.260
 sim cards simultaneously and if I have a 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.230
 iphone i'll be able to handle up 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.539
 three sim cards before anything a 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.309
 little demonstration is needed here I am 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.020
 with an ipod touch that is connected with 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.270
 mons of blue precisely you have a 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.980
 blue light that tell us I'm going 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.820
 call now with the sim card 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.820
 which is in the case 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.260
 and you see it works very well we're going 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.260
 see what it gives by sending an SMS 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.830
 e 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.100
 we 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.130
 we will now do the opposite in 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.729
 phoning and sending an SMS to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.729
 the ipod touch 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.420
 or 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.480
 you 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.460
 which is also very practical and which 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.380
 can be seen as a solution of 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.600
 unlocking is the fact that if you 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.310
 buy a future iphone blocked you 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.470
 will no longer need to pay a euro 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.600
 to have an official unblocking via 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.000
 websites or even for 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.590
 buy sim card holders for 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.020
 to show you that it works well I have my 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.120
 iphone without sim card with application 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.000
 sos blue that I will introduce you 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.320
 after the case is connected it's good 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.320
 we can start doing the test 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.659
 now let's look at the products 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.519
 the packaging 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.720
 at first glance 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.659
 apple products 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.980
 it comes with a usb dock cable which 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.440
 is the same as apple 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.090
 you have a leaflet and a needle 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.840
 to precisely remove the media from 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.299
 sim cards 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.220
 we will now focus on the 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.019
 case it's pretty fine is enough 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.859
 light one can slip easily into 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.579
 a pocket 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:06.440
 in front you have a white light for 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.530
 Starting and searching for devices 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.810
 bluetooth the purple when it charges and 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.790
 red when the times to the right and to 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.079
 left you have a location for 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.599
 put a sim card 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.549
 we just have to take the little needle 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.889
 and their entry into the hole is like 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.049
 on the iphone at the top you have the button 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.180
 power to turn it on and off 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.879
 it is pressed for 5 seconds to 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.220
 put it to own way of is right next 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.069
 pressing with the eagle you go 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.840
 make a reset and to connect it the 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.980
 mastiff lies down it's good 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.410
 you have understood how it works 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.269
 the case we will go to our device 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.620
 first of all for the apple products there 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.639
 must be broken already because 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.040
 we will have to download a 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.959
 application in cydia therefore worth 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.569
 to manage source and add this 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.829
 source farted point is proud this point 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.569
 as a point cn slash soc blue next 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.090
 we're going in and you're going 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.680
 to install the application for others I 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.370
 you will put the tutorial in the description 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.370
 video 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.109
 if by chance the source does not work I 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.910
 will put a second source that allows 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.919
 also to download the application base 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.329
 we end up in the springboard and 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:14.030
 that you can notice the application 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.290
 has been added that inside you 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.479
 have a part that is dedicated to 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.639
 messages so sms that you will have 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.580
 sent to the top right you go 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.320
 can write a new recent message 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.220
 Well, we'll show you the history 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.810
 contact calls listen there is the 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.630
 contacts of your device will require 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.220
 accept the application taking 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.280
 contacts who are in the app 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.960
 basic iphone contacts 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.849
 after you have the party that is dedicated 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.680
 to the phones where you are going to type your 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.460
 phone numbers and you notice 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.130
 below you have 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.139
 and a phone with a number one is a 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.690
 phone with a number 2 and precisely 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.400
 it will be where we will have to choose if we 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.740
 wants to call with the card also put 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.240
 number one where with as for the 6000 number 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.009
 2 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.840
 then you have died where we are going to support 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.910
 on status connectors he will search 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.580
 the case so there the base where must be 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.400
 on and flash when the connection 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.139
 will be established and we will hear a little are

 and when we are sent a message 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.599
