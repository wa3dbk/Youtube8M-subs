to<00:00:35.219> use<00:00:35.340> wax<00:00:35.610> paper<00:00:35.809> because<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.930> will<00:00:37.079> melt

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
to use wax paper because it will melt

whoops<00:01:00.300> pour<00:01:01.020> some<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.410> out<00:01:01.620> on

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
whoops pour some of this out on

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
whoops pour some of this out on
parchment<00:01:03.840> paper<00:01:04.400> now<00:01:05.400> internally

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
parchment paper now internally

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.080 
parchment paper now internally
impossible<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:07.520> like<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:08.729> layer<00:01:08.939> of

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
impossible to get this like one layer of

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.289 
impossible to get this like one layer of
thick<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.229> love<00:01:10.439> how<00:01:10.590> people<00:01:10.770> say<00:01:11.070> that

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
thick so I love how people say that

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.280 
thick so I love how people say that
basically<00:01:12.299> what<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.540> want<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.810> do<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.140> just

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
basically what you want to do is just

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.070 
basically what you want to do is just
spread<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.740> cuz<00:01:14.400> um<00:01:14.729> at<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.840> end<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
spread it out cuz um at the end of the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.530 
spread it out cuz um at the end of the
dehydrating<00:01:16.710> time<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.000> actually<00:01:18.180> just

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
dehydrating time you can actually just

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.749 
dehydrating time you can actually just
crumble<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.110> your<00:01:19.200> fingers<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.860> it'll

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
crumble it with your fingers and it'll

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.300 
crumble it with your fingers and it'll
just<00:01:20.970> fall<00:01:21.210> right<00:01:21.270> apart<00:01:21.740> mmm<00:01:22.770> excuse<00:01:22.979> me<00:01:23.100> yes

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
this will probably take longer to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.080 
this will probably take longer to
dehydrate<00:01:25.430> but<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> usually<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.850> rice<00:01:27.030> at<00:01:27.270> night

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090
