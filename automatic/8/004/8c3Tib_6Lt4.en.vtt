00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
processor but you can also use a Vitamix

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.670 
processor but you can also use a Vitamix
which<00:00:31.890> sometimes<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.550> better<00:00:32.850> because

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
which sometimes is better because

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.040 
which sometimes is better because
there's<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.950> lot<00:00:35.100> more<00:00:35.280> powerful<00:00:36.050> but

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
there's just a lot more powerful but

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.900 
there's just a lot more powerful but
either<00:00:37.380> way<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:38.040> both<00:00:38.070> work<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.610> will<00:00:38.790> take

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
either way they both work this will take

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.700 
either way they both work this will take
a<00:00:38.940> little<00:00:39.180> bit<00:00:39.270> longer<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.930> Vitamix<00:00:40.410> will<00:00:40.590> do

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
a little bit longer the Vitamix will do

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.040 
a little bit longer the Vitamix will do
a<00:00:40.739> new<00:00:40.950> clicker<00:00:41.250> amount<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.550> time<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.899> to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
a new clicker amount of time I like to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.510 
a new clicker amount of time I like to
use<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.290> sometimes<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.980> easier<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.309> scoop

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
use this sometimes it's easier to scoop

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:59.090 
use this sometimes it's easier to scoop
out<00:00:45.050> okay

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.520 

okay<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.800> now<00:01:02.980> you<00:01:03.040> have<00:01:03.840> pretty<00:01:04.840> fine<00:01:05.170> powder

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
okay so now you have pretty fine powder

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.720 
okay so now you have pretty fine powder
you<00:01:06.490> want<00:01:06.610> it<00:01:06.730> thinner<00:01:08.310> keep<00:01:09.310> going<00:01:09.550> longer

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
you want it thinner keep going longer

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.060 
you want it thinner keep going longer
okay<00:01:10.570> what<00:01:10.810> I'm<00:01:10.900> gonna<00:01:11.020> do<00:01:11.260> now<00:01:11.440> is<00:01:11.470> I'm<00:01:11.800> an<00:01:11.950> AI
