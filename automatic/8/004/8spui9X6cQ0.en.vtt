00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.110
 ah 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.809
 hello bite onerous and balconies I am 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.869
 josema source 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.000
 and this is a good day market 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.610
 seeing that every day, well, there is more 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.950
 29 inches and the brands that make 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.439
 tires realize that this has 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.180
 to go forward there are two brands in 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.750
 concrete that we have here today in the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.930
 writing that are mostly for xc and 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.000
 MarathÃ³n who are making their August 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.160
 type your August because they possibly are 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.480
 the two most used tires 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:50.490
 in 29 inches are the continental rail 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.970
 skin 2.2 that is a width of 2.2 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.390
 inches and then the archifamoso fast 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.370
 track of the special air brand that is a 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.620
 tire how good he is champion 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.480
 Olympic with javi has brought him in 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.420
 multiple careers and here are the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.430
 results the king skin already in his day what 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.549
 made a kalentieva with 26 inches 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.470
 and they continue to be manufactured in 29 inches 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.360
 let's see a little bit of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.900
 characteristics that both have 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.620
 tires the continental 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.659
 it's a more seasonal tire more for 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.240
 when it's better time 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.579
 the compound that uses the special is 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.859
 custom made and the compound you use 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.560
 the continental is a compound that they 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:36.649
 they call black chili 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.780
 is manufactured and produced and designed 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.780
 also in the corbacho factory in 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.420
 Germany when it comes to testing in situ 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.430
 on the ground we can ensure that 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.380
 both tires roll at a thousand 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.380
 however wonders 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.320
 in a time of rain mud the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.240
 continental 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.490
 we can say then that it shows 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.070
 quite more dangerous than in this case 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.729
 that the fast track of special light that 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.700
 with its three more technology it adapted to 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.009
 all kinds of stations because it has been 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.099
 shown thus with better behavior 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.069
 has surprised us a lot in mud and 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.680
 even on wet terrain 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.139
 both tires have drawn in their 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.489
 flanks what is the meaning of the 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:27.490
 rotation both the continental and the 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.770
 special air 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.260
 the grip that both tires have is 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.600
 the expected for some tires of xc 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.550
 marathon however we can also 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.610
 affirm that at the time of knocking down the 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.890
 bicycle in this case the fast track t 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.990
 space ya light has let us knock down more 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.030
 and with more security 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.060
 the edges per inch of the tires 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.970
 they are practically the same however 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.730
 in the compound there is a difference a 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.790
 compound of hardness 55 for the 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.340
 continental and a compound of 51 for the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.990
 fast track of special light in this case 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.950
 is a somewhat softer compound in the 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.090
 special aid that's why it has had better grip 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.610
 like that it's about marathon rally 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.070
 some of us are a bit obsessive with the 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.550
 weight and therefore we will start weighing the 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.550
 tires 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.799
 good six hundred and sixty-five grams 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:28.879
 is the weight that has given us in our 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:42.200
 scale the continental race skin 2.2 of 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:46.260
 99 inches and in this case the fast track 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.239
 has given 555 grams 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.269
 well we have already seen that in the weight there is 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.400
 a difference in favor in this case the 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.829
 fast track after ya light of 110 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.310
 grams in a bicycle set 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:02.459
 they are 220 grams and in a rolling element 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.190
 it's important and now let's see the 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.290
 ball that describe both tires to 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.420
 When placing them on the rim 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:16.919
 Look at the racing has 2.2 inches according to 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.289
 the manufacturer and 2.0 the fast track we see 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.380
 that the difference is real at the time of 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.699
 place it then we go practically 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.490
 imperceptibly you have to fix 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:30.270
 very much to realize that one is 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:33.150
 2.2 and another is 2.0 here there is not a 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.889
 unanimous criterion when making a 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.830
 tire and everything is exactly 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.539
 the same is not like size 36 size 38 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.660
 well you know women a little 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.490
 that there are brands because we say that 36 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.620
 I fit the 38 bodies with this 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.610
 it happens exactly the same 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.540
 you have to 2.2 and 2.0 is practically what 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.650
 same 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:59.280
 tires are exclusively x 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:04.210
 marathon x country and marathon to shoot 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.520
 fast however I am here to launch 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.100
 the special light tire has the 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.210
 technology that they call 3 that is 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.509
 for all types 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.509
 of time both for winter and for 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:20.210
 spring autumn and summer has a 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:22.819
 technology they call adaptive of 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.470
 this way is a is a tire for 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:26.300
 all year long I'll put you 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.669
 we have seen two tires on 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.780
 29 inches I'll keep in mind for 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:35.990
 those who do marathons and xt against 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:38.330
 fast rollers with good grip and good 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.060
 here is going to decide things like is the 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.840
 composed the weight and you are going to decide 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.490
 but of course both are really 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.770
 extraordinary next source and we 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.770
 we see in a next market day
