00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.460
 picture and everything is ugly xd of good for 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.260
 solve this we must download the 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.750
 file that I will leave in the description 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.029

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.259
 this folder opens it 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.550
 now we go where we have installed 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.550
 our gta 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.330
 ok now we open the folder that 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.310
 download gta 4 we copy all the 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.770
 files and we paste it in the folder of 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.770
 Our gta we give you copy and replace 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.460
 now let's go to the gta 5 folder 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.180
 we copy all the files minus gta 3 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:57.050
 point and m &amp; g and we paste it in our gta 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.050
 again copy and replace 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.460
 now we open our beams img editor 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.580
 we give to file then to open and we look for 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.580
 where we have our gta 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.150
 now we open models and gta 3 point ymg 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.430
 we give green arrow pointing 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.440
 down and we look for the folder that 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.160
 I told them today that we did not have to copy 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.080
 that was gta 3 point and m &amp; g we opened it and 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.770
 we select all the files and we 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.770
 we give to open 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.130
 and we give the blue diskette to save 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.940
 ok now we close and go to the folder 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.940
 of our gta 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.210
 and we opened the folder gta 4 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.520
 we open the main file 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.520
 here where is one we put zero 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.460
 now we close and keep 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.140
 well and now the problem would already be 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.710
 solved but if it did not work out I have 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.710

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.360

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.730

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.190
