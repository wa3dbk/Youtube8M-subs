00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
another wart I think if that's how you

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.300 
another wart I think if that's how you
pronounce<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:06.959> get<00:04:07.080> our<00:04:07.170> character<00:04:07.650> look

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
pronounce it to get our character look

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.800 
pronounce it to get our character look
at<00:04:08.400> our<00:04:08.490> diamond<00:04:08.850> armor<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.390> looks<00:04:09.630> like<00:04:09.660> a

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
at our diamond armor it looks like a

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.640 
at our diamond armor it looks like a
beautiful<00:04:10.050> skin<00:04:10.500> it's<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:10.890> beautiful<00:04:11.070> skin

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.719 

yeah<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.160> I<00:04:17.169> believe<00:04:18.169> these<00:04:19.160> are<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.549> three

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
yeah so I believe these are the three

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.180 
yeah so I believe these are the three
texture<00:04:20.120> packs<00:04:20.329> from<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:21.109> Yogbox<00:04:21.350> that<00:04:21.979> I

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
texture packs from the Yogbox that I

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.950 
texture packs from the Yogbox that I
doubt<00:04:22.550> that<00:04:22.820> because<00:04:23.060> remember<00:04:23.300> like<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:23.780> said

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
doubt that because remember like I said

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.510 
doubt that because remember like I said
before<00:04:24.080> like<00:04:24.470> I<00:04:24.560> download<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.919> Yogbox<00:04:25.070> and

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
before like I download the Yogbox and

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.640 
before like I download the Yogbox and
then<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:26.090> gave<00:04:26.210> me<00:04:26.389> an<00:04:26.479> error<00:04:26.630> so<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.289> didn't

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
then it gave me an error so I didn't

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.110 
then it gave me an error so I didn't
even<00:04:27.740> realize<00:04:27.979> that<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.370> had<00:04:28.520> these<00:04:28.699> texture

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
even realize that I had these texture

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.670 
even realize that I had these texture
pack<00:04:29.270> inside<00:04:29.539> so<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:29.780> just<00:04:30.020> decided<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.380> use<00:04:30.530> it

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
pack inside so I just decided to use it
