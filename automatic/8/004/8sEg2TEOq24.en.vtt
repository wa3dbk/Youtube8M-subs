00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.960
 many doubts about everything where we are 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.880

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.210

 in the bank you see that I have a thousand 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.559
 Dollars 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.239

 side of each vehicle to the shtick that 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.180
 there is next to the blue doll those 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.399
 would be the players that fit in each 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 vehicle is worth for example the diver would be 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.870
 of two people there is a truck that is 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.030
 10 people and each vehicle then you 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.870
 indicates the number of occupants that is a 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.850
 doubt that I had 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.640

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.070
 so as not to dizzy us a lot since they 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.890
 tide at the beginning because I do not 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.500
 I found it would be called pegasus vale 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.330
 every time we want to look 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.240

 it puts there that already it is already what 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.610
 I have but you would leave the location 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.190
 As we do, we give the start 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.380
 let's go to the map now we will have two 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.140
 vehicles would be two vehicles 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.250
 personal the advice that with the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.590
 crosshead up and down 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.640
 look there you see that it comes out as in form 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.800
 I'm looking for a helicopter 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.530
 but put search and you'll have to go 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.300
 towards there is worth here because we do not know 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.710
 we take the helicopter this is the rum 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.170
 calling 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.760
 and good is very important that you about 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.310
 all do not forget that a car comes out 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.440
 you will have two cars now two vehicles 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.290
 personal on the radar on the maps 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.390
 will mark your personal vehicle as 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.480
 car and your personal vehicle like 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.310
 diver when he claimed it is worth bozar 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.720
 you will see that every time you call 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.660
 they are a thousand dollars 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.070
 once bought and good is a 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.980
 vehicle that the truth is that they laugh 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.200
 very much especially in the online then 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.250
 you go with your colleagues there is over there is a 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.110
 surprise that I do not know if it's a search or 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.970
 usually happens but well I went with my 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.520
 girls with nani we were going to look for them 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.110
 search always come out here in the 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.140
 roof this here I do not know if this is the 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.830
 hospital I do not know but hey there 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.140
 we parked and we go out looking for sale 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.040
 simbolito the vehicle and everything already 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.270
 I'm in a hurry to catch a helicopter 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.240
 be careful with the propellers that you already know 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.860
 that are dangerous and we put the 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.290
 then to look for our divers 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.350
 as simple as that we will not have 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.690
 no hangar or anything at all nor were we 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.310
 going to put in the parking lot or anything 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.400
 only then that will be changing 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.760
 location, we'll have to give the 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.190
 'all star' search the map and move 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.230
 towards there good now can say 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.110
 several very important things also already 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.310
 you're going to spend a dough and I do not know 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.290
 the only video I've seen is in 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.060
 English about the bazaar to buy it in 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.920
 online and sure that more than one 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.860
 it helps in the event that 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.800
 let's destroy as cases so more everything 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.870
 what you take and destroy what happens 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.690
 how much is worth repairing worth a pastÃ³n 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.130
 you will see that the only thing is not worth a hard 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.870
 we have to do is take call 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.380
 pegasus again as I told you in 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.160
 our contact for the bus ar 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.160
 pegasus 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.949
 cater to the girl is well very polite 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:20.259
 very friendly correct to her very nice 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:22.150
 good heart in this case it costs me I do not know 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.949
 if even less than a thousand dollars one 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.540
 it gets to get two thousand dollars in 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.420
 total 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.240
 and nothing to look for it again the bus ar so 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.420
 simple as that start and there we will have 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.000
 another helicopter prepared to make 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.910
 ours are going something else very 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.920
 interesting for missions for missions 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.870
 we will also be able to use the bus at 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.640
 something very interesting since there are missions 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.790
 for example that we get the other point or 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.310
 the goal to 6 kilometers or the other 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.500
 point of the map then nothing interesting 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.990
 you take the bus art we will go to the best 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.820
 a little bit far from where we are but 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.620
 well I'm going to give another advice another 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.390
 which I usually do that although not 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.770
 have the bus you can do and you can 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.660
 go by helicopter up and to 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:11.960
 down is to call merry webber 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.430
 - a helicopter collection and theoretically 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.800
 of the helicopter pickup then you 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.240
 pick up and take you 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.250
 but good you are going to see what is our 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.370
 technique is a bit gypsy 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.120
 but good is what there is when the 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.680
 helicopter because what you have to do is 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.810
 what you have to do is hit four 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.360
 shots in the mouth 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.250
 and nothing with our merriweather we 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.190
 we can transport to the search and 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.470
 I do not know what getting the charge is a 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.380
 good way to escort for example to 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.110
 our partner or for whatever it is not 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.270
 we can use it a lot and the truth 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.950
 which is an interesting and good thing 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.950
