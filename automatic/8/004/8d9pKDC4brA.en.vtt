Nexus<00:00:02.370> dotnet<00:00:02.790> and<00:00:02.820> today<00:00:03.270> we're<00:00:03.480> looking<00:00:03.810> at

the<00:00:04.020> -<00:00:04.200> nique<00:00:04.350> tower<00:00:04.620> 120<00:00:05.310> xtreme<00:00:05.819> CPU<00:00:06.390> cooler

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
the - nique tower 120 xtreme CPU cooler

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.110 
the - nique tower 120 xtreme CPU cooler
which<00:00:07.350> has<00:00:07.740> extreme<00:00:08.370> in<00:00:08.519> its<00:00:08.670> name<00:00:08.849> so

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
which has extreme in its name so

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.430 
which has extreme in its name so
obviously<00:00:09.630> it's<00:00:09.840> pretty<00:00:09.900> good

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
obviously it's pretty good

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.379 
obviously it's pretty good
this<00:00:10.740> cooler<00:00:11.130> was<00:00:11.280> first<00:00:11.610> released<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.210> few

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
this cooler was first released a few

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.150 
this cooler was first released a few
years<00:00:12.630> ago<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.019> has<00:00:13.170> become<00:00:13.380> one<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.860> top

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
years ago and has become one of the top

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.310 
years ago and has become one of the top
rated<00:00:14.400> consumer<00:00:15.059> grade<00:00:15.210> coolers<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.870> all<00:00:16.020> time

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
rated consumer grade coolers of all time

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.830 
rated consumer grade coolers of all time
so<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:16.980> figured<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.490> despite<00:00:17.970> its<00:00:18.150> age<00:00:18.270> we'd

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
so I figured that despite its age we'd

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.980 
so I figured that despite its age we'd
review<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.529> use<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.890> as<00:00:20.160> an<00:00:20.580> example<00:00:20.990> for

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
review it and use it as an example for

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.720 
review it and use it as an example for
what<00:00:22.170> makes<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.590> good<00:00:22.769> cooler<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.490> first

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
what makes a good cooler in the first

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
even be 15 or 16 or 14 I think -

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.490 
even be 15 or 16 or 14 I think -
advertises<00:01:32.159> 14<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.810> that's<00:01:33.810> gonna<00:01:34.320> be

advertises 14 and that's gonna be

remember there was that high riser from
the<00:05:37.729> bottom<00:05:38.060> of<00:05:38.180> the<00:05:38.300> plate<00:05:38.539> that<00:05:39.050> is<00:05:39.229> because

finishes<00:05:43.970> funneling<00:05:44.360> up<00:05:44.570> to<00:05:44.690> the<00:05:44.780> pipes<00:05:45.050> so

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
finishes funneling up to the pipes so

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.350 
finishes funneling up to the pipes so
that<00:05:45.860> does<00:05:46.099> help<00:05:46.130> considerably<00:05:46.820> and<00:05:47.060> is<00:05:47.180> not

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
that does help considerably and is not

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.450 
that does help considerably and is not
present<00:05:47.840> on<00:05:47.960> a<00:05:48.020> lot<00:05:48.260> of<00:05:48.440> coolers<00:05:49.099> that<00:05:49.130> are

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
present on a lot of coolers that are

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.490 
present on a lot of coolers that are
smaller<00:05:49.880> this<00:05:50.360> is<00:05:50.539> quite<00:05:50.810> big<00:05:51.050> though<00:05:51.229> and

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
smaller this is quite big though and

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.110 
smaller this is quite big though and
that<00:05:51.530> there<00:05:52.099> is<00:05:52.190> a<00:05:52.220> reason<00:05:52.580> for<00:05:52.610> that<00:05:52.789> so<00:05:52.849> do

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
that there is a reason for that so do

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.520 
that there is a reason for that so do
keep<00:05:53.330> that<00:05:53.360> in<00:05:53.599> mind<00:05:53.780> when<00:05:53.930> shopping<00:05:54.080> for<00:05:54.409> your

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
keep that in mind when shopping for your

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.710 
keep that in mind when shopping for your
case<00:05:54.770> and<00:05:55.009> that's<00:05:55.699> all<00:05:55.909> for<00:05:56.060> this<00:05:56.210> video<00:05:56.509> I'll
