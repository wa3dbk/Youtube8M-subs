defense<00:01:12.680> if<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.850> beyblade<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.630> with<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.409> 145

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
defense if the beyblade is with the 145

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.450 
defense if the beyblade is with the 145
because<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.880> gives<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:19.460> high-profile

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
because it gives it a high-profile

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.450 
because it gives it a high-profile
attack<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:22.350> performance<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> was<00:01:23.040> Doug

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
attack and the performance it was Doug

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.910 
attack and the performance it was Doug
why<00:01:23.670> defense<00:01:24.150> because<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.900> wide<00:01:25.080> defense<00:01:25.560> tip

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
why defense because the wide defense tip

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.490 
why defense because the wide defense tip
is<00:01:26.130> good<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:26.820> endurance<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:30.630> clear<00:01:30.900> wheel<00:01:31.140> is

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
is good for endurance the clear wheel is

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.039 
is good for endurance the clear wheel is

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.490 
Atiya and it weighs two point nine grams
which<00:01:34.710> makes<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.549> heaviest<00:01:36.500> clear

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
which makes it one of the heaviest clear

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.609 
which makes it one of the heaviest clear

endurance and also I recommend this

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.750 
endurance and also I recommend this
beyblade<00:02:36.990> because<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.500> really<00:02:39.430> good

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
beyblade because it is a really good

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.170 
get one of these if not too just for
customization<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:27.459> don't<00:03:27.700> really<00:03:27.910> have

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
customization and you don't really have

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.840 
customization and you don't really have
to<00:03:28.239> customize<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:28.900> but<00:03:29.260> if<00:03:29.350> you<00:03:29.380> want<00:03:29.739> to<00:03:29.950> use<00:03:30.820> a

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
to customize it but if you want to use a

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.470 
to customize it but if you want to use a
c1<00:03:31.780> 45<00:03:32.410> instead<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:33.310> 145<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.780> C<00:03:34.959> 1<00:03:35.110> 45<00:03:35.590> is<00:03:35.890> a

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
c1 45 instead of 145 the C 1 45 is a

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.979 
c1 45 instead of 145 the C 1 45 is a
sagittario's<00:03:37.620> spin<00:03:38.620> track<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:40.120> it's<00:03:40.690> good

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
sagittario's spin track and it's good

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.449 
sagittario's spin track and it's good
for<00:03:41.280> four<00:03:42.280> it's<00:03:43.060> good<00:03:43.360> for<00:03:43.600> defense<00:03:43.959> from<00:03:44.459> low

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
for four it's good for defense from low

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.930 
for four it's good for defense from low
attackers<00:03:46.030> like<00:03:46.410> like<00:03:47.410> attack<00:03:47.709> types<00:03:48.010> such<00:03:48.910> as

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
attackers like like attack types such as

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.600 
attackers like like attack types such as
a<00:03:51.030> storm<00:03:52.230> storm<00:03:53.230> Pegasus<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:53.950> kawatche

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
a storm storm Pegasus and kawatche

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.210 
a storm storm Pegasus and kawatche
school<00:03:55.000> or<00:03:55.239> something<00:03:55.600> and<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:59.320> also<00:04:00.070> good

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
school or something and the also good

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.140 
school or something and the also good
customization<00:04:01.180> is<00:04:01.410> instead<00:04:02.410> of<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:03.150> clear

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
customization is instead of the clear

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.550 
customization is instead of the clear
wheel<00:04:04.329> which<00:04:04.510> is<00:04:04.540> this<00:04:06.150> ego<00:04:07.150> use<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.290> dark

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.500 
wheel which is this ego use the dark
bulb<00:04:08.890> which<00:04:09.160> is<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.640> think<00:04:10.269> about<00:04:12.150> 0.3<00:04:13.150> grams

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
bulb which is I think about 0.3 grams

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.550 
bulb which is I think about 0.3 grams
heavier<00:04:13.840> than<00:04:14.170> this<00:04:14.350> and<00:04:15.630> yeah<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:16.959> is<00:04:17.140> my

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
heavier than this and yeah this is my
