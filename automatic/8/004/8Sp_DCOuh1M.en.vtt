00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
going to be using my absolute zero and

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.169 
going to be using my absolute zero and
my<00:00:26.880> Jaden<00:00:27.660> picture<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.760> just<00:00:29.760> go<00:00:29.970> into

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
my Jaden picture here you just go into

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.170 
my Jaden picture here you just go into
the<00:00:30.390> file<00:00:30.720> Yukio<00:00:31.439> Pro<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.730> you're<00:00:33.030> going<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
the file Yukio Pro and you're going to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.410 
the file Yukio Pro and you're going to
go<00:00:33.329> into<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.780> file<00:00:34.309> and<00:00:35.309> you're<00:00:36.059> going<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.270> go

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
go into that file and you're going to go

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.350 
go into that file and you're going to go
into<00:00:36.630> textures<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.680> see<00:00:37.980> all<00:00:38.129> these<00:00:38.360> so

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
into textures and you see all these so

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.819 
into textures and you see all these so
basically<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.840> could<00:00:39.989> also<00:00:40.110> change<00:00:40.440> what

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
basically you could also change what

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.240 
basically you could also change what
negation<00:00:41.700> looks<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.149> what<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:43.250> forbidden

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
negation looks like what a forbidden

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.119 
negation looks like what a forbidden
limited<00:00:44.640> stuff<00:00:44.879> looks<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.260> if<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.440> make

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
limited stuff looks like if you make

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.209 
limited stuff looks like if you make
sure<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.430> follow<00:00:47.700> these<00:00:47.969> things<00:00:48.329> chains<00:00:49.219> your

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
sure you follow these things chains your

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.740 
sure you follow these things chains your
attack<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.730> all<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> change<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.480> looks

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
attack of all the change that looks

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.430 
attack of all the change that looks
really<00:00:51.930> weird<00:00:52.230> um<00:00:54.050> I'm<00:00:55.050> probably<00:00:55.199> gonna

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
really weird um I'm probably gonna

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.250 
really weird um I'm probably gonna
change<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> rock-paper-scissors<00:00:56.010> thing<00:00:56.640> too

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
change the rock-paper-scissors thing too

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.389 
change the rock-paper-scissors thing too
but<00:00:58.260> for<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.680> video<00:00:59.010> I'll<00:00:59.129> show<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
but for this video I'll show you the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.240 
but for this video I'll show you the
background<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> cover<00:01:00.739> it's<00:01:01.739> quite

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
background and the cover it's quite

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.429 
background and the cover it's quite
simple<00:01:02.640> actually<00:01:02.989> you're<00:01:03.989> gonna<00:01:04.140> probably

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
simple actually you're gonna probably

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.080 
simple actually you're gonna probably
want<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> keep<00:01:05.040> your<00:01:05.400> image<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.970> your

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
want to keep your image of your

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.969 
want to keep your image of your
background<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.020> parameters<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
background in this parameters the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.750 
background in this parameters the
dimensions<00:01:08.490> being<00:01:08.700> 1024<00:01:09.510> by<00:01:09.689> 642<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.520> be

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
dimensions being 1024 by 642 it can be

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.460 
dimensions being 1024 by 642 it can be
larger<00:01:12.119> or<00:01:12.150> smaller<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.869> it'll<00:01:13.080> look<00:01:13.200> really

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
larger or smaller but it'll look really

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.280 
larger or smaller but it'll look really
weird<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:15.119> may<00:01:15.270> want<00:01:15.450> your<00:01:15.600> image<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.020> be

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
weird and you may want your image to be

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.700 
weird and you may want your image to be
more<00:01:16.619> toward<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> right<00:01:17.159> side<00:01:17.390> because<00:01:18.390> your

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
more toward the right side because your

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.469 
more toward the right side because your
I'll<00:01:19.710> show<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.570> you'll<00:01:21.570> see<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:24.030> kind<00:01:24.390> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
I'll show you you'll see this kind of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.420 
I'll show you you'll see this kind of
blocks<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.020> left<00:01:25.350> side<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.100> you're<00:01:26.280> gonna

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
blocks the left side so you're gonna

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.429 
blocks the left side so you're gonna
want<00:01:26.729> an<00:01:26.909> image<00:01:27.090> probably<00:01:27.509> more<00:01:28.080> toward<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
want an image probably more toward the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.710 
want an image probably more toward the
right<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:30.290> let's<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.740> started

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
right and let's just get started

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.310 
right and let's just get started
delete<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.750> throw<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:36.110> go<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
delete that throw in here go to the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.819 
delete that throw in here go to the
cover<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.689> throw<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.710> to

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
cover and throw that in here you have to

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.969 
cover and throw that in here you have to
make<00:01:40.860> sure<00:01:41.009> your<00:01:41.520> image<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> jpg<00:01:42.829> so<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:43.890> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
make sure your image is a jpg so if you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.649 
make sure your image is a jpg so if you
don't<00:01:44.130> know<00:01:44.189> how<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.399> change<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.119> go<00:01:45.390> into

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
don't know how to change it just go into

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.889 
don't know how to change it just go into
like<00:01:45.810> Microsoft<00:01:46.320> pain<00:01:46.590> file<00:01:46.950> save<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.670> save<00:01:48.659> as

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
like Microsoft pain file save as save as

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.910 
like Microsoft pain file save as save as
JPEG<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:50.009> then<00:01:51.380> that's<00:01:52.380> pretty<00:01:52.590> much<00:01:52.710> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
JPEG and then that's pretty much it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.850 
JPEG and then that's pretty much it
because<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.149> was<00:01:54.630> having<00:01:55.140> issues<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.799> I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
because I was having issues and I

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.850 
because I was having issues and I
realized<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.880> was<00:01:57.180> originally<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> PNG<00:01:58.619> image

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
realized this was originally a PNG image

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.030 
realized this was originally a PNG image
and<00:01:59.689> that's<00:02:00.689> why<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.899> wasn't<00:02:01.170> registering<00:02:01.710> you

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
and that's why I wasn't registering you

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.350 
and that's why I wasn't registering you
have<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.250> make<00:02:02.399> sure<00:02:02.549> all<00:02:02.700> your<00:02:02.880> images<00:02:03.090> are

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
have to make sure all your images are

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.620 
have to make sure all your images are
JPEGs<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.170> then<00:02:05.070> watch<00:02:05.250> after<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.240> replace

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
JPEGs and then watch after I replace

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.630 
JPEGs and then watch after I replace
those<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.350> images<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.890> see<00:02:11.069> my<00:02:11.190> absolute

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
those the images you see my absolute

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.550 
those the images you see my absolute
zero

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
zero

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.320 
zero

edit<00:02:18.980> your<00:02:19.459> background<00:02:20.060> in<00:02:20.209> your<00:02:20.390> cover<00:02:20.690> and

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
edit your background in your cover and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.900 
edit your background in your cover and
you'll<00:02:21.110> probably<00:02:21.230> change<00:02:21.650> your<00:02:21.910> attack

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
you'll probably change your attack

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.780 
you'll probably change your attack
symbol<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.420> stuff<00:02:23.690> like<00:02:23.990> that<00:02:24.170> too

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
symbol and stuff like that too
