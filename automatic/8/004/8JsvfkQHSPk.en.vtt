00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 hello everyone with my family today i 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.200
 cooking a cake called zebra so 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.219
 Now we will start with us here 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.660
 bowl 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.660
 here i will put one pack of margarine 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.170
 now we melt you 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.420
 microwaves and whether I will continue so we 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:33.289
 we all melted down now we enter here 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.289
 a glass of sugar and add 3 eggs here . 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:57.170
 and we will continue to beat it first 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:01:00.410
 everything we do so on we take the glass and 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.690
 add here a little baking powder not 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.690
 add about 5 grams 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.840
 a pack of baking powder 10 grams exactly 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.500
 half a pack so add here a little bit 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.860
 citric acid to put it all out 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.860
 a business 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:29.260
 and add some water as we introduce water here 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.979
 extinguish about 1 tablespoon of water 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.990
 we mix it all up and add ours 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.509
 dough and again you judged the sofa 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.840
 Mixer secret dough add a little 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.399
 flour hurt mixer to get 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.399
 we have the consistency of sour cream 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:27.379
 so now we divide this business by 2 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:27.379
 pieces and here we will add cocoa 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.769
 you think somewhere a teaspoon with a slide 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.049
 he has enough 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.379
 all mix it up again the thing is 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.379
 mixer 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:55.379
 so on we take the griddle either 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.780
 cake pan but I donâ€™t have 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.709
 so do differently i take 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.129
 frying pan 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.700
 and now I take one tablespoon 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:13.670
 tablespoon spread in the middle 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:13.670
 white dough and a half to two 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.720
 further already dark by the way here I got not 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:31.079
 teaspoon responding to cocoa ears 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:40.440
 so that it is darker here and 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:47.940
 again now white is black again 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:52.620
 and until we have this whole thing 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:04:00.299
 it's over now we spoon 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:05.909
 we turn over such from the middle such 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:10.400
 here's a decoration well, not ideal of course 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.400
