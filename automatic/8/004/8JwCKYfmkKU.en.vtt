and despatched two parts there's a lot
of<00:02:10.240> quality<00:02:10.360> control<00:02:10.899> within<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:12.040> process

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
of quality control within that process

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.160 
of quality control within that process
to<00:02:13.240> make<00:02:13.270> sure<00:02:13.450> all<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.780> way<00:02:13.870> through<00:02:14.050> the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
to make sure all the way through the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.930 
to make sure all the way through the
process<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.590> we<00:02:14.890> use<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.280> parameters<00:02:15.790> that

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
process that we use the parameters that

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.070 
process that we use the parameters that
we<00:02:16.000> know<00:02:16.450> work<00:02:16.750> for<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.110> product<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.840> first

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
we know work for that product the first

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.560 
we know work for that product the first
ones<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.350> develop<00:02:20.770> this<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.910> technique<00:02:22.390> this

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
ones to develop this this technique this

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.870 
ones to develop this this technique this
this<00:02:22.900> added<00:02:23.200> work<00:02:23.410> that<00:02:23.650> we<00:02:23.740> do<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.700> doubt

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
this added work that we do and I doubt

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.900 
this added work that we do and I doubt
if<00:02:25.060> anybody<00:02:25.530> quite<00:02:26.530> does<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.980> way<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.580> we<00:02:27.730> do

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
if anybody quite does the way that we do

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.080 
if anybody quite does the way that we do
it<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.380> actually<00:02:29.530> known<00:02:29.980> as<00:02:30.400> far<00:02:31.000> as

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
it and it is actually known as far as

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.320 
it and it is actually known as far as
I'm<00:02:31.180> aware<00:02:31.270> as<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.260> english<00:02:32.650> suede<00:02:33.060> because<00:02:34.060> of

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
I'm aware as it english suede because of

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.240 
I'm aware as it english suede because of
this<00:02:34.420> very<00:02:34.690> tight<00:02:35.050> suit<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.680> they<00:02:35.890> were<00:02:35.980> able

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
this very tight suit that they were able

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.740 
this very tight suit that they were able
to<00:02:36.280> make<00:02:36.550> why<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.820> technique<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.420> dis

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
to make why the technique so dis

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.410 
to make why the technique so dis
mentioned<00:02:38.640> we've<00:02:39.640> used<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.030> same<00:02:40.150> basic

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
mentioned we've used the same basic

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.510 
mentioned we've used the same basic
technique<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:41.230> making<00:02:41.620> their<00:02:41.830> Bronto<00:02:42.220> spend

technique to making their Bronto spend
since<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:43.540> started<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.989> 50s<00:02:44.410> but<00:02:44.860> as<00:02:44.980> time<00:02:45.280> has

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
since we started the 50s but as time has

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.760 
since we started the 50s but as time has
gone<00:02:45.459> by<00:02:45.670> because<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.840> various<00:02:47.050> influences<00:02:47.350> we

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
gone by because of various influences we

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.400 
gone by because of various influences we
have<00:02:47.950> up<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.280> obviously<00:02:49.209> make<00:02:49.420> changes<00:02:49.930> some

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
have up to obviously make changes some

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.600 
have up to obviously make changes some
of<00:02:50.500> those<00:02:50.560> changes<00:02:50.950> have<00:02:51.040> being<00:02:51.130> chemical

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
of those changes have being chemical

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.640 
of those changes have being chemical
environmentally<00:02:52.330> but<00:02:52.720> overall<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.440> the

environmentally but overall the the
basic<00:02:54.130> put<00:02:54.880> process<00:02:55.390> has<00:02:55.660> remained<00:02:56.050> in<00:02:56.350> tight

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
basic put process has remained in tight

I<00:02:57.540> can't<00:02:58.540> see<00:02:58.720> Britain<00:02:59.080> in<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.320> future<00:02:59.650> being

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
I can't see Britain in the future being

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.570 
I can't see Britain in the future being
involved<00:03:00.340> in<00:03:00.580> again<00:03:01.330> in<00:03:01.540> mus<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.890> manufacture

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
involved in again in mus to manufacture

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.690 
involved in again in mus to manufacture
but<00:03:03.790> in<00:03:03.940> terms<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.620> design<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.980> innovation

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
but in terms of design and innovation

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.509 
but in terms of design and innovation
I'm<00:03:07.090> sure<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:08.080> is<00:03:08.260> where<00:03:08.500> we<00:03:08.890> will<00:03:09.040> still<00:03:09.310> be

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
I'm sure this is where we will still be

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.280 
I'm sure this is where we will still be
