00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
those is actually really easy to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.289 
those is actually really easy to
demonstrate<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.409> idea<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.740> lens

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299

breathing<00:01:45.299> when<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.869> rack<00:01:46.200> or<00:01:46.470> pull<00:01:46.829> focus<00:01:47.280> on

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
breathing when you rack or pull focus on

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.310 
breathing when you rack or pull focus on

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
a lens it's not designed to shoot video

or<00:01:49.590> motion<00:01:49.890> pictures<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.060> actually

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
or motion pictures it can actually

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.240 
or motion pictures it can actually
change<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.840> apparent<00:01:52.409> focal<00:01:52.799> length<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.130> the

change the apparent focal length of the
lens<00:01:53.460> you're<00:01:53.729> using<00:01:53.909> I'll<00:01:54.329> demonstrate<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
lens you're using I'll demonstrate and

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.270 
lens you're using I'll demonstrate and
I'm<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.320> reach<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.799> camera<00:01:56.100> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
I'm going to reach for the camera to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.800 
I'm going to reach for the camera to
pretend<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:56.969> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.360> shoot<00:01:57.540> something

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
pretend I'm going to shoot something

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.300 
pretend I'm going to shoot something
that<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.079> already<00:01:58.350> shot<00:01:58.649> earlier<00:01:59.009> right<00:01:59.549> now<00:01:59.729> as

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
that I already shot earlier right now as

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.359 
that I already shot earlier right now as
transition<00:02:00.820> you<00:02:01.090> ready<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.890> now<00:02:02.920> I'm<00:02:03.159> shooting

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
transition you ready so now I'm shooting

one kind of cheap and easy way is to

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.280 
one kind of cheap and easy way is to
every<00:03:00.880> time<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.180> want<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.390> pull<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.569> rack<00:03:01.840> focus

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
every time you want to pull a rack focus

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.289 
every time you want to pull a rack focus
just<00:03:02.500> disguise<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:03.099> with<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> camera<00:03:03.730> move<00:03:03.880> like

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
just disguise it with a camera move like

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.750 
just disguise it with a camera move like
so<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.930> lot<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.620> people<00:03:05.709> won't<00:03:06.010> know<00:03:06.220> unless

so a lot of people won't know unless

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.610 
so a lot of people won't know unless
they're<00:03:07.030> smart<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:07.780> watched<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.140> video<00:03:08.380> like

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
they're smart and watched a video like

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.560 
they're smart and watched a video like
this<00:03:08.739> one<00:03:08.799> what<00:03:09.220> lens<00:03:09.519> breathing<00:03:09.940> actually<00:03:10.359> is

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
this one what lens breathing actually is

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.630 
this one what lens breathing actually is
so<00:03:10.989> if<00:03:11.079> you<00:03:11.170> move<00:03:11.380> during<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.650> focus<00:03:11.829> pole<00:03:12.130> you

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
so if you move during the focus pole you

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.340 
so if you move during the focus pole you
can<00:03:12.760> trick<00:03:13.120> them<00:03:13.299> it's<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.660> neat<00:03:13.810> trick<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.230> get

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
can trick them it's a neat trick to get

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.650 
can trick them it's a neat trick to get
around<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:14.799> really<00:03:15.370> common<00:03:15.700> problem<00:03:15.850> that's

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660
