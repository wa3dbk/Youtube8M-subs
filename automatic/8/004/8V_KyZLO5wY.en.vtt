in the mid 2000s Ford started using a

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.879 
in the mid 2000s Ford started using a

hundred<00:03:56.849> thousand<00:03:57.269> miles<00:03:57.479> which<00:03:58.109> is<00:03:58.139> pretty

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
hundred thousand miles which is pretty

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.860 
hundred thousand miles which is pretty
standard<00:03:58.799> these<00:03:59.190> days<00:03:59.329> but<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:00.449> was<00:04:00.569> quickly

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
standard these days but it was quickly

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.949 
standard these days but it was quickly
realized<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.919> that's<00:04:02.099> far<00:04:02.519> too<00:04:02.549> long<00:04:03.000> it

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
realized that that's far too long it

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.140 
realized that that's far too long it
comes<00:04:04.260> down<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.769> what<00:04:04.949> I<00:04:05.099> consider<00:04:05.579> a<00:04:05.790> major

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
comes down to what I consider a major

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.289 
comes down to what I consider a major
design<00:04:06.629> flaw<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:07.229> results<00:04:08.129> in<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.489> strong

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
design flaw that results in a strong

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.599 
design flaw that results in a strong
possibility<00:04:09.709> but<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.859> spark<00:04:11.129> plugs<00:04:11.400> will

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
possibility but the spark plugs will

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.520 
possibility but the spark plugs will
break<00:04:12.030> off<00:04:12.269> inside<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.959> cylinder<00:04:13.260> head

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
break off inside the cylinder head

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.819 
break off inside the cylinder head
during<00:04:13.979> removal<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:15.060> longer<00:04:15.479> one<00:04:15.720> waits<00:04:16.079> it's

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
during removal the longer one waits it's

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.819 
during removal the longer one waits it's
now<00:04:17.389> suggested<00:04:18.389> that<00:04:18.539> they<00:04:18.720> replaced<00:04:19.139> every

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
now suggested that they replaced every

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.940 
now suggested that they replaced every
50,000<00:04:20.669> miles<00:04:20.880> which<00:04:21.539> I<00:04:21.719> still<00:04:22.200> think<00:04:22.590> is<00:04:22.710> too

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
50,000 miles which I still think is too

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.640 
50,000 miles which I still think is too
long<00:04:23.159> it<00:04:23.849> should<00:04:24.180> be<00:04:24.210> more<00:04:24.510> like<00:04:24.570> every<00:04:24.930> 30,000

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
long it should be more like every 30,000

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.270 
long it should be more like every 30,000
miles

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
miles

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.730

here's<00:04:26.790> a<00:04:26.880> list<00:04:27.180> of<00:04:27.389> the<00:04:27.540> ford<00:04:27.870> lincoln<00:04:28.440> and

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
here's a list of the ford lincoln and

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.010 
here's a list of the ford lincoln and
mercury<00:04:28.860> vehicles<00:04:29.460> that<00:04:30.270> are<00:04:30.300> afflicted<00:04:30.900> with

mercury vehicles that are afflicted with
this<00:04:31.260> issue<00:04:31.500> so<00:04:32.430> what's<00:04:32.639> causing<00:04:33.000> them<00:04:33.090> to

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
this issue so what's causing them to

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.050 
this issue so what's causing them to
break<00:04:33.510> well<00:04:34.350> as<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:34.710> can<00:04:34.860> see<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.700> top<00:04:36.000> half

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
break well as you can see the top half

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.150 
break well as you can see the top half
of<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:36.540> spark<00:04:36.870> plug<00:04:37.110> looks<00:04:37.560> like<00:04:37.740> any<00:04:37.919> other

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.030 
of the spark plug looks like any other
plug<00:04:38.490> but<00:04:39.120> it's<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.450> bottom<00:04:40.020> half<00:04:40.230> which<00:04:40.889> is

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
plug but it's that bottom half which is

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.770 
plug but it's that bottom half which is
called<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.370> ground<00:04:41.760> electrode<00:04:42.419> shield

hours<00:06:01.740> of<00:06:01.979> labor<00:06:02.340> to<00:06:02.430> remove<00:06:02.850> them<00:06:03.120> but<00:06:03.750> that's

hours of labor to remove them but that's

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.100 
hours of labor to remove them but that's
if<00:06:04.140> they<00:06:04.530> don't<00:06:04.800> break<00:06:05.150> most<00:06:06.150> places<00:06:06.419> will

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
if they don't break most places will

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.770 
if they don't break most places will
charge<00:06:07.440> an<00:06:07.620> extra<00:06:07.770> hour<00:06:08.250> of<00:06:08.430> labor<00:06:08.789> /<00:06:09.390> plug

that<00:06:09.990> breaks<00:06:10.350> and<00:06:10.710> you<00:06:11.370> never<00:06:11.729> know<00:06:11.940> how<00:06:12.060> many

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
that breaks and you never know how many

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.570 
that breaks and you never know how many
will<00:06:12.650> so<00:06:13.650> if<00:06:13.860> you've<00:06:14.010> got<00:06:14.070> one<00:06:14.370> of<00:06:14.490> these

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
will so if you've got one of these

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.390 
will so if you've got one of these

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
are other examples out there but this

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.500

was the most egregious example that I

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.480 
was the most egregious example that I

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
could think of that was the exception to

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.240 
could think of that was the exception to
my<00:06:32.700> service<00:06:33.090> interval<00:06:33.600> rule<00:06:33.870> and<00:06:34.250> engineers

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.159 
if you want to reinvent the wheel fine
just<00:06:38.370> make<00:06:38.460> sure<00:06:38.729> the<00:06:38.880> wheel<00:06:39.030> still<00:06:39.300> comes<00:06:39.570> off

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169
