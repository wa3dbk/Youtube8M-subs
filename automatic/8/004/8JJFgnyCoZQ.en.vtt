00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.290
 Hello everyone, so today is another 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.389
 home block I am very pleased that 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.270
 such videos you like that they you 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.060
 interesting and I suggest to see you 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.039
 a kind of hodgepodge of everything 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.930
 a little bit 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.939
 general beginning of spring and all summer in our 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.859
 family is a series of holidays 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.199
 just recently celebrated a birthday 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.390
 my beloved niece sonechki many 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.760
 of you know her and this time we decided 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.399
 spend it on a children's holiday in such 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.710
 unexpected place like bowling but 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.370
 say that the kids really liked 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.100
 the holiday was just a bang everyone was 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.579
 happy you can say so first 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.700
 throw 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.730
 sophia nastakat he is not the best but 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.539
 nevertheless she even managed something 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.730
 shoot down when our children grow up yes and 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.100
 I clowns they are no longer surprised at the course 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.470
 parents have a headache then how interesting 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.140
 spend a children's birthday well and in 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.659
 certainly not the most original way but 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:27.780
 in any case, the children really liked and 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:29.850
 us by the way we move too 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.290
 farther into my living room from decorative 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.720
 I got new products for my home 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.670
 so so wool and model so 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.280
 aluminum decorative light 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.220
 energy saving bulbs are they 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.799
 here in these buds in the future I plan 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.020
 but the buds still paint bright 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.359
 paint probably it 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.820
 red color is likely and it seems to me 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:53.060
 so more original it will look 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.759
 in any case, this idea seemed to us 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.670
 not banal and it seems to me not bad 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.840
 decorates the living room also bought myself 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.119
 new scales 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.610
 No, of course, the necessary thing in the household 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.590
 surely my old ones have already ordered 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.649
 long live a long time ago in principle parabola 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.780
 change them what I did have them here 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.610
 different settings but I honestly even 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.340
 not interested because well somehow 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.470
 I do not care about me a little worried about me 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.239
 only my nose weight can not see the settings 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.840
 nothing special to you 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.239
 scales scales like many other electronic 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.920
 in the morning I was 50 kilograms but now 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:33.440
 me camera all sorts of gadgets for the camera 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.260
 51 800 but 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.380
 51 kilogram objection called me so 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.480
 thunder baba here but i'm having fun that year 49 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.750
 but I realized that this is brute force because 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.660
 for my age 35 for my kind 51 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.060
 52 kilograms will be itself so 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.660
 no as usual under the control of scales 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.660
 bought 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.780
 Well, let's go on a couple of months ago, I 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.489
 He ordered his Faberlik is 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.420
 buckwheat orthopedic seat 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.790
 huskies 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.739
 This thing will certainly appreciate the one who 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.390
 spends a lot of time at the computer like 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.450
 I like because sit on it 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.610
 the seat is very comfortable and it seems to me not 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.069
 so quickly you get tired of it 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.680
 buckwheat does great thigh massage 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:29.269
 which of course none of the women 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.819
 over will not be well we move 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.409
 next and go to the kitchen I take 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.480
 your words back is that soup 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.430
 multivarka is tasteless actually 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.319
 just doom to prepare anything and I 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.709
 your advice that I did not do without you 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.569
 I know I'm cooking now and the soup is quite 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.180
 differently of course shove everything 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.639
 ingredients in the pan and wait for a miracle it 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.180
 turned out to be absolutely not an option, but now 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:54.739
 I make a separate fire this way 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.389
 fry vegetables and then put all that 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.400
 necessary for broth meat and here still 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:03.709
 I put the potatoes this time I cooked 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.549
 as far as i remember rice soup and rice i already 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:10.150
 added practically when the whole soup was 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.150
 ready 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.820
 she still water for broth in a slow cooker i 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.780
 add already hot and this of course 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.390
 surely 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.300
 reduces cooking time and 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.550
 great and in any case just on the stove 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.970
 cook such a delicious broth 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.830
 I still can not get here on 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.160
 I'll probably say goodbye to this 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.530
 thank you so much for seeing this 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.400
 delicious summer to see you on my 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.400
 channel bye
