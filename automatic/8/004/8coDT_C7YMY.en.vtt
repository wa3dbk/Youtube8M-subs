you're<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.240> born<00:02:00.510> there<00:02:00.720> because

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
you're just born there because

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.410 
you're just born there because
physically<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:01.860> ensigns<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.000> makes<00:02:03.180> sense

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
physically like ensigns it makes sense

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.350 
physically like ensigns it makes sense
but<00:02:04.410> if<00:02:04.650> you're<00:02:04.770> put<00:02:05.010> there<00:02:05.220> it's<00:02:05.940> different

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
but if you're put there it's different

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.900 
but if you're put there it's different
it's<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.930> different<00:02:07.200> thought

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.480 

when<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:15.940> hear<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.360> word<00:02:16.510> immigration<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.530> think

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
when I hear the word immigration I think

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.820 
when I hear the word immigration I think
about<00:02:18.610> how<00:02:18.790> hard<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.240> is<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.600> get<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.780> visa<00:02:20.050> from

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
about how hard it is to get a visa from

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.220 
about how hard it is to get a visa from
China<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.460> hear<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.940> think<00:02:22.210> about<00:02:22.600> stories

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
China to hear I think about stories

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.720 
China to hear I think about stories
where<00:02:23.380> people<00:02:23.410> are<00:02:23.800> like<00:02:23.980> smuggled<00:02:24.520> over

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
where people are like smuggled over

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.810 
where people are like smuggled over
borders<00:02:25.210> and<00:02:25.480> things<00:02:25.630> like<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.670> I'm

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
borders and things like that and I'm

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.090 
borders and things like that and I'm
proud<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.330> be<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.720> first-generation<00:02:29.320> immigrant

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
proud to be a first-generation immigrant

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.190 
proud to be a first-generation immigrant
is<00:02:30.820> making<00:02:31.690> history

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
is making history

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.560 
is making history
I<00:02:35.160> think<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.250> transracial<00:02:36.640> families<00:02:37.150> shines

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
I think the transracial families shines

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.070 
I think the transracial families shines
light<00:02:37.960> on<00:02:38.310> what<00:02:39.310> race<00:02:39.520> needs<00:02:39.880> because<00:02:40.600> it

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
light on what race needs because it

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.320 
light on what race needs because it
forces<00:02:41.440> people<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.830> deal<00:02:42.130> with<00:02:42.340> racial<00:02:43.030> issues

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
forces people to deal with racial issues

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.210 
forces people to deal with racial issues
and<00:02:43.600> what<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.900> means<00:02:43.990> to<00:02:44.200> be<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.320> family<00:02:44.740> what<00:02:45.130> it

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
and what it means to be a family what it

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.500 
and what it means to be a family what it
means<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.490> be<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.640> race<00:02:45.880> when<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.209> means<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.450> be

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
means to be a race when it means to be

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.890 
means to be a race when it means to be
American<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:48.730> kind<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.240> struggle<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.600> find

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
American it's kind of a struggle to find

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.140 
American it's kind of a struggle to find
the<00:02:50.080> balance<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.800> how<00:02:51.250> much<00:02:51.490> does<00:02:51.760> your<00:02:51.880> past

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
the balance and how much does your past
