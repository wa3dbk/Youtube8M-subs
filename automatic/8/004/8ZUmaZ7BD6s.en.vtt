00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 tomorrow we have thiago de cana against phil 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.300
 hellmuth on eagle needle where 10k nÃ© 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:15.870
 the next of his with the chechnya disease 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:19.140
 was different even though 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.380
 gained from there and bought the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.710
 lady do not man come out of mimi 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:36.860
 So, twitter, that's the idea. 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:43.379
 I'm tired of going there and kicked the ball 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:45.899
 catch the welt who is a guy who is not so 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.460
 famous despite having enjoyed the face 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.920
 his is not the one everyone knows 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.719
 first and even asked me at 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.739
 Time to sit down a little, you know who you are. 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.750
 that guy 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.020
 now you know the opponent of 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.719
 tomorrow you can not recognize 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.480
 He knows me, this is good. 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.090
 so it's very good I faced it once 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.090
 just do not take it in los angeles 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.080
 sit at the table with him but frankly was a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.240
 few in a few minutes the head 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.280
 lit up outside 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.939
 but is a great player does not have a 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.790
 undisputed and may have defects in the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.250
 his model then plays in a non 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.350
 conventional way of 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.119
 What we think is good, then we do not have to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.780
 talk about the grass guy 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.680
 but I know everyone here come 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.229
 where he arrived and commented eliane up 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.880
 his 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.250
 in one year he made three 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.110
 the gaucho stayed 6 second is not to leave 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.729
 no one would lose net let him 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.130
 in good leaves no one would believe me 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:01.860
 this is there because we are close 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:04.200
 close and very little to earn a 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.600
 This tournament is only fierce I only have 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.080
 sure at the end of the day I saw a guy 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.010
 who plays fairly plays a reasonable 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:21.269
 that's all it would be to sit there only the best 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:22.610
 even of them Brazilian crowd to anyone 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.110
 will hold 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.260
 to finish explained a little bit to 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.440
 class how the strategy works 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.500
 has the stec divided into three 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.650
 and you have the option of getting started with 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.480
 an all or get a text with it 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.640
 then buy another third of it 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.200
 depends on the hotel opponent you like 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.340
 to make a specific strategy 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.140
 adversary 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.700
 If you speak, buy all of yourself. 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.549
 Computing will know too that there the thing 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.430
 so much in an attack that I do not 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.280
 I really like to know five bad 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.420
 I do not like it much, I prefer it. 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.170
 nothing else in my line of play is 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:11.850
 much more with the flops and my 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:15.510
 aggressiveness that detail but I 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:19.320
 I'd rather play 10 x number of 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.840
 neighborhoods in the beginning were a first 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.200
 were felt in 200 had each 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.870
 had 30 years 150 blogs the second doctor 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.320
 were 200,400 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.540
 we started with 21 and 20 thousand 20 thousand 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.540
 with another 12 to 60 thousand 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.600
 now lends countless blogs because 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.870
 started hot thousand with 40 thousand level of 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:51.310
 game with 120 Brazilians 150 you to 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.640
 they wrote down this family at last 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.580
 A little shorter is already playing 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.660
 50 more than 40 but finally gave all 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:06.600
 right between tomorrow and the next table 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.600
 Now twist twist janete business
