it<00:02:27.409> go<00:02:28.250> up<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:28.700> front<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.750> load<00:02:30.079> the

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
it go up in the front so you load the

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.009 
it go up in the front so you load the
cart<00:02:30.879> some<00:02:31.879> of<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.030> front<00:02:32.299> put<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.720> kiddies

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
cart some of the front put the kiddies

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.190 
cart some of the front put the kiddies
in<00:02:33.049> here<00:02:33.349> get<00:02:33.560> some<00:02:33.769> weight<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:35.239> unload

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
in here get some weight and you unload

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.350 
in here get some weight and you unload
take<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.769> largest<00:02:37.280> child<00:02:37.519> gives<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:38.180> back

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
take the largest child gives you back

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.309 
take the largest child gives you back
your<00:02:38.390> out<00:02:38.750> first

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
your out first

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.000 
your out first
and<00:02:39.440> this<00:02:40.129> balancer<00:02:40.790> so<00:02:41.110> about<00:02:42.110> 80%<00:02:42.860> of<00:02:42.920> the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
and this balancer so about 80% of the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.650 
and this balancer so about 80% of the
weight<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.400> carried<00:02:43.609> by<00:02:43.940> those<00:02:44.150> rear<00:02:44.359> wheels

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
weight is carried by those rear wheels

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.430 
weight is carried by those rear wheels
that<00:02:44.989> makes<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.650> balanced<00:02:47.079> a-frame<00:02:48.079> again

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
that makes it a balanced a-frame again

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.869 
that makes it a balanced a-frame again
so<00:02:48.680> it's<00:02:48.829> very<00:02:49.129> easy<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.760> up<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:51.829> turn<00:02:52.099> but<00:02:52.670> for

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
so it's very easy to up to turn but for

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.580 
so it's very easy to up to turn but for
real<00:02:53.030> sharp<00:02:53.329> turn<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.599> have<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.780> set<00:02:54.109> it<00:02:54.140> about

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
real sharp turn you have to set it about

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.869 
real sharp turn you have to set it about
an<00:02:54.739> inch<00:02:54.890> above<00:02:55.129> the<00:02:55.310> ground

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
an inch above the ground

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.539 
an inch above the ground
so<00:02:56.510> here<00:02:56.720> again<00:02:56.840> for<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:58.069> know<00:02:58.190> normal

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
so here again for you know normal

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.330 
so here again for you know normal
turning<00:02:58.909> you<00:02:59.000> just<00:02:59.239> steer<00:02:59.540> it<00:02:59.890> just<00:03:00.890> like<00:03:01.069> mama

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
turning you just steer it just like mama

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.860 
turning you just steer it just like mama
but<00:03:01.579> if<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.760> want<00:03:01.970> really<00:03:02.239> sharp<00:03:02.480> turns<00:03:02.750> you

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
but if you want really sharp turns you

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.199 
but if you want really sharp turns you
go<00:03:03.019> down<00:03:03.200> hit<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.560> wheel<00:03:03.739> you<00:03:04.609> can<00:03:04.640> just<00:03:04.970> spin

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
go down hit the wheel you can just spin

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.380 
go down hit the wheel you can just spin
it<00:03:05.329> right<00:03:05.480> around<00:03:06.489> now<00:03:07.489> our<00:03:07.760> top<00:03:08.030> of<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.299> line
