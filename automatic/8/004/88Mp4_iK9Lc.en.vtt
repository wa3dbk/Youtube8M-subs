moon it's just very it's a completely
different<00:01:47.520> experience<00:01:48.000> from<00:01:48.180> doing<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
different experience from doing the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.380 
different experience from doing the
arenas<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.950> my<00:01:50.100> guess<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.370> absolutely<00:01:51.030> more

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
arenas so my guess is absolutely more

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.360 
arenas so my guess is absolutely more
than<00:01:51.420> worth<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:51.930> price<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.680> admission<00:01:52.860> on

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
than worth the price of admission on

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.430 
than worth the price of admission on
this<00:01:53.610> one<00:01:53.960> different<00:01:54.960> from<00:01:54.990> anything<00:01:55.230> you

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
this one different from anything you

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.580 
this one different from anything you
other<00:01:56.130> you've<00:01:56.370> done<00:01:56.550> on<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.090> stadium<00:01:57.330> tour<00:01:57.600> yeah
