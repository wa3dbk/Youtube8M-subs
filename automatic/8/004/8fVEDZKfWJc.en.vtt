00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
think it's just like any other sibling
rivalry<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.600> intensified<00:01:01.260> by

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
rivalry but it's just intensified by

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.910 
rivalry but it's just intensified by
like<00:01:02.030> 5,000<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.470> anger

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
like 5,000 it's that that that anger

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.590 
like 5,000 it's that that that anger
that<00:01:05.070> comes<00:01:05.309> from<00:01:05.580> loving<00:01:05.820> someone<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.570> much

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
that comes from loving someone so much

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.300

their<00:01:07.110> siblings<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> very

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
their siblings we have a very

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.730 
their siblings we have a very
interesting<00:01:08.990> relationship<00:01:09.990> with<00:01:10.619> our

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
interesting relationship with our

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.260 
interesting relationship with our
siblings<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:11.549> think<00:01:11.820> at<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> end<00:01:12.090> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
siblings but I do think at the end of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.050 
siblings but I do think at the end of
the<00:01:12.390> day<00:01:13.010> Stefan<00:01:14.010> loves<00:01:14.400> his<00:01:14.610> brother<00:01:14.790> no

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the day Stefan loves his brother no

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.060 
the day Stefan loves his brother no

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
matter how flawed or aggressive or

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.400 
matter how flawed or aggressive or
in<00:01:18.190> moral<00:01:18.610> is<00:01:18.850> I<00:01:19.150> don't<00:01:19.660> know<00:01:19.810> if<00:01:19.900> I'm<00:01:20.020> bad<00:01:20.380> I

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
in moral is I don't know if I'm bad I

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.220 
in moral is I don't know if I'm bad I
mean<00:01:20.800> I<00:01:20.920> definitely<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:22.090> know<00:01:22.210> they<00:01:23.080> all<00:01:23.200> have

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
mean I definitely you know they all have

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.680 
mean I definitely you know they all have
reasons<00:01:23.550> he<00:01:24.550> likes<00:01:24.760> to<00:01:24.970> cause<00:01:25.180> a<00:01:25.210> little<00:01:25.480> bit

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
reasons he likes to cause a little bit

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.920 
reasons he likes to cause a little bit
of<00:01:25.810> harm<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:27.580> he<00:01:27.700> has<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:27.850> good<00:01:28.060> time<00:01:28.240> doing<00:01:28.510> it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
of harm but he has a good time doing it

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.660 
of harm but he has a good time doing it
and<00:01:29.410> I<00:01:29.500> think<00:01:29.560> sometimes<00:01:30.160> it's<00:01:30.400> kind<00:01:30.610> of

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
and I think sometimes it's kind of

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.150 
and I think sometimes it's kind of
difficult<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.350> hate<00:01:32.560> someone<00:01:32.980> who's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
difficult to to hate someone who's

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.890 
difficult to to hate someone who's
loving<00:01:33.910> so<00:01:34.210> much<00:01:34.270> what<00:01:34.600> they<00:01:34.720> do

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
loving so much what they do

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.220 
loving so much what they do
