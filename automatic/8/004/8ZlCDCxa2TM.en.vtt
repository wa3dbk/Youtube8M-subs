00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 Hello to you Andrew Andrew Andreitch 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.030
 my site is all point dot ru 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.550
 1340 first task in the aircraft for 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.109
 polar expeditions loaded three 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.770
 tractor weighing 1 2 tenths of tons each 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.519
 and 7 her 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:27.630
 the mass of all with Anya is two tons more 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:32.570
 what is the mass of tractors what is the mass 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.880
 some snowmobiles so we have every tractor 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.910
 weighs one point two tenths this 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.020
 each tractor and all tractors we have 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.039
 let's multiply three to find out 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.890
 weight of all tractors weight of 1 tractor 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:01:00.420
 multiply by the number of tractors to 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:04.350
 find out the mass of all tractors 3 by 2 will be 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.360
 63 on 1 will be 3, on one sign here 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.220
 so the comma is transferable to 1 and us 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:18.350
 here is 3.6 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:21.840
 3.6 tons is the mass of all tractors 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.229
 it is known that the mass of all arras her on 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.490
 two tons more weight tractors weight 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.720
 tractors we know let's second 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.979
 the action will find the mass of all snowmobiles 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.119
 mass of all snowmobiles 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.119
 this is the mass of all tractors and another two tons 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.610
 mass and time they all snowmobiles 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.040
 two tons more tractor weight 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.970
 therefore we add to the mass of doctors 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.780
 two tons inside whole tons is 2 whole 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.100
 tons it will be 5 point volumes and 6 more 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:06.920
 60s remain so this mass remains 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:11.150
 all snowmobiles are the mass of all snowmobiles 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.580
 as you snowmobile snowmobiles we 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:21.150
 77 pieces of mass of all 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:25.159
 snowmobiles 5 and 6 tons 55 60 tons in total 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:31.319
 snowmobile 7 we need to know the weight of one 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:34.410
 snowmobile snowmobile 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:39.390
 we will divide it by the number of snowmobiles 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:44.069
 and then we find out the weight of one of some hay poco 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:50.400
 her one thing let's divide in 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:54.859
 column 5, 6 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:00.079
 divide by 7 here look carefully 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:04.560
 the whole part of us 5 5 by 7 is not divisible 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:08.549
 so the whole part will be 0 starting 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:13.260
 use decimal 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:18.049
 we divide the first digit 56 by 7 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:23.150
 take on 8 8 by 756 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:30.120
 it turns out 0 so the mass of some snowmobiles 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:33.299
 80s tons 80s tons is the answer to the problem 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.290
 someone have the answer if you want to check 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:39.959
 You can multiply the mass of one races by 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.280
 the number of snowmobiles and then get 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:49.200
 weight of all snowmobiles so 80s response 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.769
 tons of such a problem on it all 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.769
 until
