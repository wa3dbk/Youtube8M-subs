00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 michel jansen same start question as 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.470
 last week you were expecting after 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.540
 to be at the top this weekend 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.090
 yes precede the weekend 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.540
 after the defeat of course no longer like 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.820
 lions 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.010
 hurray for running and how 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.750
 surprisingly, football can be the only thing left 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.930
 analysis on letting go what it 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.400
 happened during the past weekend 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.019
 Yes, on the one hand, you want a lot 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.210
 Young teams just put it all in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.990
 a weekend happens then that is quite 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.269
 extreme 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.309
 so but you can see that all teams 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.540
 it can be fairly changeable yes 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.890
 then you can do a little bit of linking 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.780
 naturally make a lot of teenagers with 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.239
 so many young players assume it 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.010
 it can be explained from that point of view 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.090
 with what i say all in one 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.090
 weekend is very extreme 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.690
 to you have a number a number 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.670
 players who yes those who what more by the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.649
 Wool dyed and you hope he 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.660
 ultimately a certain role in a team 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.829
 take on a little more leadership 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.989
 and in particular this type of competition 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.780
 the one you lose now at ado 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.910
 that your animals are just right about that 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.530
 know the finisch puller and yes 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.229
 there you call on them 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.580
 you also after her finally goes to work 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.110
 when you talk about what is routine 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.150
 players then you talk about boys 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.680
 like a rasmus plus from andrÃ© 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.350
 so that are all the guys who need some more 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.600
 be dyed by wool and yes, hope so 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.090
 he more in competitions like that 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.390
 say my role as leader 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.390
 picking up 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.310
 it's not that she didn't do it 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.009
 only have one specific competition 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.299
 where it's untrue what it's really about 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.039
 hope you there it is absolutely no 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.500
 refer country that are also players who 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.520
 to grow in such a role so 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.319
 in the end there are many players 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.069
 Those animals got more or less gone 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.659
 had 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.829
 in the end we have another player 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.479
 our selection 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.369
 you have already forgotten everyone 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.140
 because he's been playing that for a long time 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.599
 like no other than wout brama 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.000
 so no it's not just blame for years 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.920
 you do hope that she would have one 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.969
 that they are going to take over praying 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.179
 this week you also have something 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.060
 has had an adjusted training schedule 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.049
 it also has to do with the 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.219
 development of the teams or is that 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.829
 something you already wanted anyway 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.319
 try some more rest 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.299
 yes basically we say so 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.739
 fixed training week anyway and we are 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.989
 just a little at the moment 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.019
 we set up a game schedule and saturday 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.150
 Saturday then we come somewhere somewhere 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.769
 little bit in trouble and there we are 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.690
 Now a little bit to see what then 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.239
 best for the group so this week is 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.500
 filled in with with two days off 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.180
 it can tell already say once 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.280
 but a day off in the run-up to 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.019
 four training days for the name contest 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.510
 that's kind of true on this 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.489
 were looking for something at the time 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.500
 yes, inventing a little is what 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.690
 maybe it's best he had to 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.549
 group so far this moment is everyone 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.680
 fit for the match against nec with 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.660
 exception of the took absent and 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.220
 long-term injured is one here 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.419
 the yes 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.490
 you chose it last week 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.980
 to 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.120
 a change in your basic team diet 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:59.090
 so don't apply that to anything 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.380
 as much logical as you look with 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.110
 name shadrach 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.270
 young player so yes a very good start 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.610
 had sect sank a bit and so 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.560
 also logical or think is such a young 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.620
 age so much to the west 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.940
 so basically higher that tired so 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.790
 he then has the has for that matter 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.410
 yes got some rest also in the week 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.970
 befits internationals two days off 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.740
 to have him go there too 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.870
 to get him back yet again 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.450
 and that looks pretty nice 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.980
 so he high twitter is what that 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.970
 concerned, this has us feeling 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.710
 well succeeded 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.990
 so chances are therefore that he 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.830
 tomorrow their base will be in them again 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.910
 anyways option and then has about nec and 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.320
 how do you look at that at the moment 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.530
 to go 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.970
 yes difficult start nevertheless the legacy 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.460
 catching it from the previous season 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.830
 after the they came after that whole 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.340
 long-lasting series among victories 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.140
 they have now broken that 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.940
 first say their first competition 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.160
 victory since a long time after that 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.690
 Immediately grabbed a good soaking result 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.310
 so there are 10 with quite a few 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.840
 trust is coming this way 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.519
 and with a very different feeling than say 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.650
 just one two three weeks ago 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.629
 in addition, that they are there anyway 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.280
 what some players have joined 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.099
 so that always requires some time and you 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.959
 sees that it really is more a team 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.459
 is becoming under 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.269
 under one the yes say the new 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.269
 trainer anton janssen
