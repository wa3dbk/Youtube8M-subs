same<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.549> they're<00:01:29.820> gonna<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.240> their<00:01:30.420> same

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
same and they're gonna be their same

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.499 
same and they're gonna be their same
likeness<00:01:31.229> within<00:01:31.619> advanced<00:01:32.040> warfare<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.820> we

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
likeness within advanced warfare and we

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.910 
likeness within advanced warfare and we
can<00:01:33.630> already<00:01:33.750> see<00:01:33.990> kind<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.229> three<00:01:34.500> characters

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
can already see kind of three characters

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.840 
can already see kind of three characters
they<00:01:35.040> look<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> same<00:01:35.369> as<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.670> pretty<00:01:35.790> much

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
they look the same as we can pretty much

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.399 
they look the same as we can pretty much
assume<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.750> pretty<00:01:36.960> cool<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
assume this it's just pretty cool and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.289 
assume this it's just pretty cool and
obviously<00:01:38.040> they've<00:01:38.430> done<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> remodeling

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
obviously they've done the remodeling

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.670 
obviously they've done the remodeling
with<00:01:39.450> Kevin<00:01:39.689> Spacey<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.259> there<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.500> some

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
with Kevin Spacey and there was some

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.469 
with Kevin Spacey and there was some

pictures tweeted out of there Kevin

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.210 
pictures tweeted out of there Kevin
Spacey<00:01:42.750> doing<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.170> kind<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.619> mograph

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
Spacey doing the kind of the mograph

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.859 
Spacey doing the kind of the mograph
stuff<00:01:44.640> where<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.329> work<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
stuff where you kind of work on the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
stuff where you kind of work on the
animation<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.560> stuff<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.310> they

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
animation and stuff like that and they

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.830 
animation and stuff like that and they
definitely<00:01:47.700> put<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.030> lot<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.270> effort<00:01:48.509> into<00:01:48.659> it

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
definitely put a lot of effort into it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.910 
definitely put a lot of effort into it
which<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.049> pretty<00:01:49.290> cool<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> basis

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
which is pretty cool so the basis

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.980 
which is pretty cool so the basis

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
game so you won't have any of the core

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.280 
game so you won't have any of the core
technology<00:02:24.000> it'll<00:02:24.420> kind<00:02:24.570> of<00:02:24.630> ease<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.080> into

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
the game and kind of get used to it no

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.000 
the game and kind of get used to it no
pro<00:02:27.180> feel<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.570> look<00:02:27.690> exactly<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.410> any<00:02:28.740> other

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
pro feel and look exactly like any other

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.010 
pro feel and look exactly like any other
college<00:02:29.400> game<00:02:29.730> very<00:02:30.030> standard<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.900> then

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
college game very standard and then

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.690 
college game very standard and then
probably<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.320> few<00:02:31.440> missions<00:02:31.740> after<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.220> as<00:02:32.400> I

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
probably a few missions after that as I

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.340 
probably a few missions after that as I
mentioned<00:02:33.180> Jonathan<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.570> obviously<00:02:33.930> approach

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
mentioned Jonathan I obviously approach

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.860 
mentioned Jonathan I obviously approach
you<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.800> he<00:02:35.430> will<00:02:35.550> ask<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.120> join<00:02:36.360> Atlas

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
you and he will ask you to join Atlas

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.480 
you and he will ask you to join Atlas
and<00:02:37.020> obviously<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.410> will<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.280> where

warfare is to all the core G games
you'll<00:02:44.130> get<00:02:44.250> stuff<00:02:44.460> like<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.730> exosuit<00:02:45.300> you'll

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
you'll get stuff like the exosuit you'll

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
and I've a bit cool technology also

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.820 
and I've a bit cool technology also
shown<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.240> single-player<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.990> that<00:02:52.560> said

shown in the single-player is that said
this<00:02:53.040> kind<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.280> special<00:02:53.820> variable<00:02:54.510> grenade

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
this kind of special variable grenade

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.180 
this kind of special variable grenade
and<00:02:55.080> while<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.290> cook<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.710> you<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.100> actually

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
and while you cook it you can actually

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.310 
and while you cook it you can actually
change<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.940> while<00:02:57.240> in<00:02:57.510> midair<00:02:57.810> or<00:02:57.990> wire

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
change it while in midair or wire

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.680 
change it while in midair or wire
cooking<00:02:58.770> it<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.280> stun<00:02:59.640> grenade<00:02:59.940> or<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.210> sense

cooking it to a stun grenade or a sense

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.090 
cooking it to a stun grenade or a sense
of<00:03:00.900> grenade<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.530> will<00:03:01.680> reveal<00:03:01.950> the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
of grenade and this will reveal the

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.740 
of grenade and this will reveal the
enemy's<00:03:02.400> positions<00:03:02.940> with<00:03:03.360> all<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.570> red

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
enemy's positions with all the red

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.120 
enemy's positions with all the red
lasers<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.380> you've<00:03:04.470> probably<00:03:04.680> seen<00:03:04.830> in<00:03:05.010> this

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
lasers that you've probably seen in this

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.220 
lasers that you've probably seen in this
picture<00:03:05.310> here<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.850> this<00:03:06.540> only<00:03:06.780> works<00:03:07.110> with

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
picture here and this only works with

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.470 
picture here and this only works with
your<00:03:07.530> special<00:03:07.770> visor<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.430> shows<00:03:08.760> augmented

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
your special visor that shows augmented

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.540 
your special visor that shows augmented
reality<00:03:09.510> which<00:03:10.170> is<00:03:10.260> really<00:03:10.620> cool<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.010> that's

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
reality which is really cool and that's

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.220 
reality which is really cool and that's
within<00:03:11.850> your<00:03:12.090> visor<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.540> can<00:03:12.720> see<00:03:12.900> enemy

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
within your visor you can see enemy

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.110 
within your visor you can see enemy
positions<00:03:13.710> because<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.070> works<00:03:14.280> with<00:03:14.790> the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
positions because it works with the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.100 
positions because it works with the
centigrade<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:15.930> pretty

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
centigrade and this is pretty

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.510 
centigrade and this is pretty
interesting<00:03:16.290> in<00:03:16.620> terms<00:03:16.830> of<00:03:17.040> multiplayer

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
interesting in terms of multiplayer

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.190 
interesting in terms of multiplayer
because<00:03:17.850> we<00:03:18.210> don't<00:03:18.450> know<00:03:18.570> whether<00:03:18.750> things

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
because we don't know whether things

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.440 
because we don't know whether things
like<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.500> visor<00:03:19.740> will<00:03:20.250> be<00:03:20.430> included<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.240> if

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
like the visor will be included and if

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.810 
like the visor will be included and if
this<00:03:21.900> kind<00:03:22.050> of<00:03:22.200> variable<00:03:23.070> centigrade<00:03:23.610> is

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
this kind of variable centigrade is

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.430 
this kind of variable centigrade is
included<00:03:24.240> in<00:03:24.300> multiplayer<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:25.080> means<00:03:25.320> that

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
included in multiplayer that means that

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.080 
included in multiplayer that means that
your<00:03:25.560> visor<00:03:25.860> will<00:03:26.100> have<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.490> be<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.610> mouth<00:03:26.820> pair

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
your visor will have to be a mouth pair

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.580 
your visor will have to be a mouth pair
as<00:03:27.180> well<00:03:27.210> that's<00:03:27.660> pretty<00:03:27.840> interesting<00:03:28.290> if<00:03:28.380> one

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
as well that's pretty interesting if one

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.710 
as well that's pretty interesting if one
is<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:29.100> other<00:03:29.220> has<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.460> be<00:03:29.760> so<00:03:30.000> we<00:03:30.360> don't<00:03:30.600> know

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
is the other has to be so we don't know

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.200 
is the other has to be so we don't know
which<00:03:31.050> kind<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.500> how<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.710> what<00:03:32.040> extent<00:03:32.550> all<00:03:32.940> of

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
which kind of how to what extent all of

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.580 
which kind of how to what extent all of
this<00:03:33.300> technology<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.900> gonna<00:03:34.080> be<00:03:34.170> Marth<00:03:34.380> paper

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
this technology is gonna be Marth paper

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.960 
this technology is gonna be Marth paper
it's<00:03:34.710> definitely<00:03:35.040> very<00:03:35.220> very<00:03:35.280> interesting

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
it's definitely very very interesting

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.150 
it's definitely very very interesting
and<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.840> course<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.260> single-player<00:03:37.800> stuff

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
and of course the single-player stuff

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.530 
and of course the single-player stuff
like<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.640> exosuit

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
like the exosuit

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.720 
like the exosuit
will<00:03:39.810> be<00:03:39.990> included<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.890> multiplayer<00:03:41.280> as<00:03:41.550> well

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
will be included in multiplayer as well

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.700 
will be included in multiplayer as well
have<00:03:42.270> confirmation<00:03:42.960> from<00:03:43.140> sledgehammer

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
have confirmation from sledgehammer

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.320 
have confirmation from sledgehammer
they're<00:03:44.130> saying<00:03:44.400> how<00:03:44.640> massively<00:03:45.090> they're

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
they're saying how massively they're

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.310 
they're saying how massively they're
gonna<00:03:45.420> change<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.990> and<00:03:46.080> they're<00:03:46.170> obviously

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
gonna change it and they're obviously

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.560 
gonna change it and they're obviously
kind<00:03:46.800> of<00:03:46.890> hints<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.610> they<00:03:48.030> are<00:03:48.240> going<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.510> be

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
kind of hints that they are going to be

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.090 
kind of hints that they are going to be
including<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.960> exosuit<00:03:49.470> I'm<00:03:49.710> not<00:03:49.980> sure

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
including the exosuit I'm not sure

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.740 
including the exosuit I'm not sure
exactly<00:03:50.340> where<00:03:50.670> things<00:03:51.000> like<00:03:51.180> invisibility

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
exactly where things like invisibility

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.510 
exactly where things like invisibility
and<00:03:52.110> all<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.440> stuff<00:03:52.680> will<00:03:52.830> be<00:03:52.950> included<00:03:53.400> but

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
and all that stuff will be included but

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.280 
and all that stuff will be included but
I'm<00:03:53.670> sure<00:03:53.970> there's<00:03:54.420> gonna<00:03:54.600> be<00:03:54.810> some<00:03:54.990> massive

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
I'm sure there's gonna be some massive

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.200 
I'm sure there's gonna be some massive
changes<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.100> core<00:03:56.340> multiplayer<00:03:56.970> and

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
changes to the core multiplayer and

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.210 
changes to the core multiplayer and
we're<00:03:57.870> gonna<00:03:57.960> pretty<00:03:58.200> much<00:03:58.320> get<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.620> use<00:03:58.950> those

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
we're gonna pretty much get to use those

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.410 
we're gonna pretty much get to use those
in<00:03:59.460> single-player<00:03:59.880> which<00:04:00.030> is<00:04:00.120> always<00:04:00.210> why

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
in single-player which is always why

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.850 
in single-player which is always why
it's<00:04:00.570> a<00:04:00.600> very<00:04:00.810> very<00:04:00.990> good<00:04:01.140> idea<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.680> play

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
it's a very very good idea to play

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.230 
it's a very very good idea to play
single-player<00:04:02.280> because<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:02.880> kind<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.060> gets

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
single-player because it kind of gets

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.610 
single-player because it kind of gets
you<00:04:03.300> acclimate<00:04:03.840> it's<00:04:03.960> at<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.140> game<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.560> I

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
you acclimate it's at the game and I

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.080 
you acclimate it's at the game and I
always<00:04:04.980> play<00:04:05.190> single-player<00:04:05.670> just<00:04:05.880> kind<00:04:06.060> of

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
always play single-player just kind of

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.640 
always play single-player just kind of
get<00:04:06.240> used<00:04:06.330> to<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.540> technology<00:04:06.720> some<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.560> the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
get used to the technology some of the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.320 
get used to the technology some of the
weapons<00:04:07.890> what's<00:04:08.400> good<00:04:08.640> what's<00:04:08.880> not<00:04:09.090> how<00:04:09.270> the

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
weapons what's good what's not how the

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.300 
weapons what's good what's not how the
game<00:04:09.600> feels<00:04:09.990> and<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.800> this<00:04:10.920> game<00:04:11.130> is

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
game feels and that this game is

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.770 
game feels and that this game is
definitely<00:04:11.670> gonna<00:04:11.760> be<00:04:11.910> very<00:04:12.120> very<00:04:12.330> different

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
definitely gonna be very very different

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.850 
definitely gonna be very very different
the<00:04:12.870> single-player<00:04:13.200> is<00:04:13.320> gonna<00:04:13.470> be<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.620> good

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
the single-player is gonna be a good

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.310 
the single-player is gonna be a good
kind<00:04:14.100> of<00:04:14.130> way<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.910> gauge<00:04:15.330> how<00:04:15.690> different<00:04:16.170> it

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
kind of way to a gauge how different it

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.460 
kind of way to a gauge how different it
is

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
is

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.170 
is
and<00:04:16.739> that's<00:04:17.220> basically<00:04:17.609> come<00:04:17.730> like<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.940> rundown

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
and that's basically come like a rundown

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.820 
and that's basically come like a rundown
of<00:04:18.359> all<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.840> characters<00:04:19.170> and<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.620> really

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
of all the characters and the really

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.039 
of all the characters and the really
interesting<00:04:20.010> thing<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:21.180> question<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.720> how

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
interesting thing is the question of how

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.320 
interesting thing is the question of how
do<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.560> Mitchell<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.340> Jonathan<00:04:23.850> ions<00:04:24.150> the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
do you Mitchell and Jonathan ions the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.600 
do you Mitchell and Jonathan ions the
head<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.810> Atlas<00:04:25.290> how<00:04:25.620> do<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.950> two<00:04:26.130> get<00:04:26.310> along

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
head of Atlas how do you two get along

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.140 
head of Atlas how do you two get along
because

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
because

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.360 
because
I<00:04:27.180> seem<00:04:27.509> to<00:04:27.540> suggest<00:04:27.870> that<00:04:28.259> ions<00:04:28.650> is<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:29.190> bad

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
I seem to suggest that ions is that bad

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.430 
I seem to suggest that ions is that bad
guy<00:04:29.669> he's<00:04:29.910> almost<00:04:30.120> like<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.300> dictator<00:04:30.870> who<00:04:31.199> with

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
guy he's almost like a dictator who with

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.560 
guy he's almost like a dictator who with
Atlas<00:04:31.889> tries<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.550> destroy<00:04:32.910> America<00:04:33.060> and

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
Atlas tries to destroy America and

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.810 
Atlas tries to destroy America and
obviously<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:34.139> are<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.350> part<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:34.770> Atlas<00:04:35.130> so<00:04:35.580> are

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
obviously you are a part of Atlas so are

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.550 
obviously you are a part of Atlas so are
you<00:04:36.060> actually<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.570> bad<00:04:36.900> guy<00:04:37.169> in<00:04:37.289> this<00:04:37.380> game

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
you actually a bad guy in this game

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.560 
you actually a bad guy in this game
who's<00:04:37.830> attacking<00:04:38.220> America<00:04:38.789> or<00:04:38.970> do<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:39.270> end<00:04:39.419> up

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
who's attacking America or do you end up

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.080 
who's attacking America or do you end up
turning<00:04:39.870> on<00:04:40.139> Atlas<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.650> ions<00:04:41.280> as<00:04:41.460> well<00:04:41.699> it's

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
turning on Atlas and ions as well it's

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.390 
turning on Atlas and ions as well it's
very<00:04:42.270> interesting<00:04:42.690> and<00:04:43.199> I'm<00:04:43.620> sure<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.160> plot

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
very interesting and I'm sure the plot

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.310 
very interesting and I'm sure the plot
will<00:04:44.520> develop<00:04:44.880> in<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.060> really<00:04:45.419> cool<00:04:45.600> way<00:04:45.870> and

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
will develop in a really cool way and

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.990 
will develop in a really cool way and
looks<00:04:46.560> like<00:04:46.590> I<00:04:46.680> said<00:04:46.830> am<00:04:47.009> I<00:04:47.100> really<00:04:47.400> trying<00:04:47.699> to

looks like I said am I really trying to

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.580 
looks like I said am I really trying to
make<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.240> story<00:04:48.479> amazing<00:04:48.840> not<00:04:49.229> just<00:04:49.440> like<00:04:49.560> a

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.980 
Condrey from sledgehammer is that in
between<00:05:14.550> missions<00:05:15.120> there<00:05:15.330> will<00:05:15.419> be<00:05:15.449> different

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
between missions there will be different

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.840 
between missions there will be different
kind<00:05:16.650> of<00:05:16.710> things<00:05:16.979> to<00:05:17.160> what<00:05:17.310> we've<00:05:17.460> seen<00:05:17.639> before

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
kind of things to what we've seen before

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.850 
kind of things to what we've seen before
there<00:05:18.479> won't<00:05:18.630> be<00:05:18.720> the<00:05:18.840> coolican<00:05:19.260> animations

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
there won't be the coolican animations

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.020 
there won't be the coolican animations
which<00:05:20.099> like<00:05:20.310> we<00:05:20.430> normally<00:05:20.550> get<00:05:20.820> which<00:05:20.910> I

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
which like we normally get which I

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.400 
which like we normally get which I
personally<00:05:21.449> think<00:05:21.570> looked<00:05:21.780> amazing<00:05:22.320> I

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
personally think looked amazing I

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.170 
personally think looked amazing I
actually<00:05:22.710> really<00:05:23.010> like<00:05:23.130> those<00:05:23.340> animations<00:05:23.760> in

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
actually really like those animations in

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.420 
actually really like those animations in
between<00:05:24.570> each<00:05:24.810> mission<00:05:25.139> but<00:05:25.800> they<00:05:26.190> say

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
between each mission but they say

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.200 
between each mission but they say
there's<00:05:26.639> gonna<00:05:26.759> be<00:05:26.880> something<00:05:27.120> completely

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
there's gonna be something completely

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.050 
there's gonna be something completely
different<00:05:27.990> this<00:05:28.080> time<00:05:28.139> around<00:05:28.560> and<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:29.490> mixing

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
different this time around and I mixing

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.430 
different this time around and I mixing
what<00:05:30.509> they<00:05:30.599> mean<00:05:30.750> is<00:05:30.900> probably<00:05:31.169> something

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
what they mean is probably something

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.050 
what they mean is probably something
like<00:05:31.470> a<00:05:31.590> cutscene<00:05:31.919> and<00:05:32.550> apparently<00:05:32.940> during

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
like a cutscene and apparently during

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.000 
like a cutscene and apparently during
these<00:05:33.270> cutscenes<00:05:33.660> is<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:34.050> only<00:05:34.440> time<00:05:34.740> when

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
these cutscenes is the only time when

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.620 
these cutscenes is the only time when
your<00:05:35.220> character<00:05:35.430> will<00:05:35.699> actually<00:05:35.910> talk<00:05:36.120> that's

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
your character will actually talk that's

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.000 
your character will actually talk that's
the<00:05:36.690> only<00:05:36.960> time<00:05:37.229> you<00:05:37.260> will<00:05:37.560> actually<00:05:37.860> be<00:05:37.919> able

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
the only time you will actually be able
