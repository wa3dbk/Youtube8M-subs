00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 who better than an examiner to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.640
 give us advice to approve the membership card 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.470
 sometimes lead thanks to the website 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.719
 kart has managed to get one of the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.460
 few interviews that they grant and 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.710
 we have asked for advice for those 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.560
 to be examined because after that 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.600
 class enough class to be 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.550
 prepare correctly say no 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.010
 Welcome, also without preparation 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.920
 by the end it will not be more expensive to say 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.900
 that stealing the documentation is a thread 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.369
 that is spent on fees that if you do not 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.120
 can fight in class and learn 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.120
 when the student of 18 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.500
 with 100% to stay in a 70 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.450
 jose carlos recognizes that the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.309
 examiners impose but his seriousness is 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.590
 for the benefit of the students only the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.000
 Instruction costs clearly 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.739
 that the student really knows what has 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.109
 what to do if you do not understand it and what 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.629
 ask and pending the exam without 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.730
 speak a versed in the teacher the most 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.390
 as brief as possible we are deciding to place 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.390
 to a stick 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.520
 and that does not influence or may affect you 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.980
 we are pissed we have to be like this 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.810
 they also advise those who 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.210
 they learn on their own or they already know 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.340
 let them be guided by experts because 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.380
 at the end we can go the more expensive it 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.560
 learns from a concept wrongly with 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.320
 the type of roulette that crosses it from 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.440
 middle sector things are done remove the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.240
 shift lever at hand by the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.610
 deadlock this kind of thing are 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.560
 habits that everyone does that if 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.570
 there is a sensor then clear they are bad 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.740
 habits by a perfectly learned 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.619
 has its unusual flaws and that's why 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.200
 teaching a place says that it knows is 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.150
 magnificent it is wrong to know the routes of 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.520
 exam either circulating previously by 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.920
 them or with the help of cheat websites and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.810
 advice like don car assure us 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.790
 that gives more confidence when it comes to 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.970
 take the exam to test the exam 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.119
 practical driving with a kart point 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.119
 is
