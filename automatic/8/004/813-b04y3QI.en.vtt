00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.269
 couples cheese 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.269
 fabio ham because the cheese is going to cut with my friends there are 3 6 points of 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.339
 average vincent poussard with my pc 'hello george' for their part 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:34.679
 respectively for san francisco 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:36.380
 producer the farmers 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.600
 willy bergé in the Basque country and producer of cheese we will discover 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.950
 in a moment you will see they are beautiful and in 100 years you will 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.710
 are both chef culinary advisor chef I have a lot of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.510
 lucky angeles i only have to talk about aquitaine broccoli only god knows if there 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.639
 so we will see this delight 

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:54.820
 and now pay attention on 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.710
 the manceau 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.179
 erratic he is there 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.519
 look at this marvel of cheese so we will revel this morning 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.080
 in the good sense of the word aquitaine 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.240
 but here with precisely geographically for the threshold 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.890
 fateful 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.190
 which territory 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.940
 in these two territories, Basque countries and Bearn 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.550
 and the name of the cheese and carries the number of these areas of the trough valley its 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.850
 iconic with his country other lots 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.010
 the hitherto to the iraty plateau which is a mountainous area and there is a 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.050
 historical know-how of the shepherds especially the manufacture of the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.420
 ewe's milk cheese we're counting on you to develop all that in 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.560
 will also speak of gascogne with vincent of the making of the history 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.200
 we are happy to share this moment with us 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.100
 and we travel from the Basque country 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.840
 at the start of the season all this fusion of aquitaine were manufactured 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.690
 launching the reactions do not have today with his health and fabrice 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.650
 so here's looking at the property it's probably our lady of two 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.740
 dimensions 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.999
 william aurelien 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.999
 small formats that are traditionally made in the Basque country 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.289
 a little more that sit you make the cheese a little bit the driest and then 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.790
 the large format 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.470
 more than 4 kilos which was traditionally made gang so the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.019
 valleys of aspe and ossau replacements mears 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.119
 the concerned in cases more than a minute 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:16.649
 and who keeps the cheese a long time and who looks a lot of flexibility a little to 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:17.299
 the image 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.899
 d mountain pastures and styles 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:23.319
 because you have to know that we started a production that does not take place 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.169
 the year the cheese begins only from December and we stop at 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.149
 swell July in August a season position but because she has some 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:32.279
 small animals 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:36.319
 the country since there is a risk that there was the fact that for four to six 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.549
 months the buildings not the mountain okay you because you were telling me 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.730
 what you eat in winter is like making a doll 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.540
 and it's a bit like fashion 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.049
 finally paris has always done 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.560
 she galliani in a dozen other cheeses he says 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.930
 he goes out his presence in France is gone because soon 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.930
 it will be without me I love the happy who can more balanced 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:59.729
 there need a little more than 26 cities of Bourbon Island 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:00.999
 made it 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:04.109
 of this survey the others are a little smaller between two and three 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:04.900
 kilos 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.660
 it takes ten minutes from unesco both groups 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:13.569
 as they had to evolve the local breed positions so despite 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.779
 the omnipresence of this famous ruby ​​because I believe they have some 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:20.249
 peculiarities of the years to be able to tell us 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.349
 alizée me I want to taste precisely I would like to talk to you about the job before 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.519
 talk about lava manufacturing 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.909
 how you are expressed briefly in your opinion 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.320
 in vain we already perfectly know where the rules of art 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.580
 but hey we know that job app and jalal al discovered in the in the 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.610
 blow cheese that makes it a little bit the trademark for me 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.419
 ID 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.329
 so once we've felt it's true it's something to the police in 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.399
 general who can sweat room temperature 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:47.499
 solution on its cheeses is accompanied with the famous cherry jam 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:49.229
 on you but especially they do not go there 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.799
 having done when one tastes like his prince charming we would like without a voice 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.709
 but we always start with thin slices in small by small 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:56.250
 parts 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.750
 to avoid precisely the effect of chewing a little a little shabby 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.359
 hires 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.580
 while there we will have a little bit to tell me 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.329
 we really feel the lherm at 140 in the 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:06.949
 often theirs grazing 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.619
 with the medal has a lot of work but it is not necessarily absolutely 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:13.599
 not trained for me and in addition the taste is very close to the park facing 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.540
 records in the mouth 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.829
 when we have it so well before that person who has a lot of 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.910
 outside we do what I call a little muscular but muscular but not strong 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:23.560
 for the character gaec yes there something but the victory in 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.659
 did we win the average purses but that's it 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:29.610
 before evacuating the particularity of the products 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.319
 we must give it time to express itself and the particularity is 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.289
 that it does not emerge to mark the coup 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:36.069
 remaining 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.740
 Sunday with characteristics of individuals 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.680
 at the level of all 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.130
 milk fat a specific to the sheep and that's it 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.110
 which will give customers a particularity 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.889
 of this sheep cheese to listen to it is excellent - well here I am not 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.229
 did not know at all really poor plates do discover 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.629
 she was interested in honor today we talked about her 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.530
 manufacturing 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.210
 then there is really a specialist to all the French is producers 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.950
 farmers and we have pictures you may be able to be more 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.479
 comment on the file 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.860
 watch to see happen in the story for 100 places and valleys 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.189
 the first part because of noise 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:14.360
 because the photos have friends or not 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.610
 and then there's the phrase once you've sold the lambs to milking 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.349
 so you have to milk the sheep in the morning and evening 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.740
 we would like to say how many liters of milk already for the cheese group at 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.039
 number 25 june will be in the province then the lez 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.710
 it is put in vat is emptied with prayer 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.759
 the notebooks look like we're in your hands 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.529
 the winger cut out the trenches 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:37.949
 it's now calling the tools she can perfect 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.909
 traditionally celebrated in the cauldron 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.019
 she with a loved one who has been home yet to be filled and by hand 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.110
 he actually has a pretense to a game 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.150
 in q2 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.770
 to press the dough and then take out the whey and then we will cut 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.949
 the pieces that will go into the molds 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.830
 so that would not be a pressed cheese 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.280
 that's what did not come down 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.870
 mans since not because I work in temperatures that 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.719
 range from 32 from 30 to 32 in several agencies 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.489
 a up to 1 40% to 38 40 level in his remains 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.590
 and then in May 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.800
 in molds 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.099
 or almost 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.310
 low price simi in press to finally finish evacuate the little feat 

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:22.150
 yesterday 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.659
 then he is put 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:24.869
 in his hero 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:28.669
 and go back to ripening I kept up so there is a ripening 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.210
 pretty traditional 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.380
 of last type the group a4 format and serves a ripening that last long 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.729
 then actually these products and provincial stations must be 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.960
 shot regularly at least once a week 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.869
 e on boards at the start 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:46.930
 and elected it is done little by little it takes at least 120 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.830
 not for a cheese of his kilos 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.500
 a little less 90 days for them the little cheeses blocked a time 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.619
 it's for fun if it's unlikely from a look of a CV 

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:59.029
 all the people coming in missing but the characteristic of the first spring 

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:02.410
 not too much where you have to work and grow 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.319
 this element but his voice 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.319
 see to know 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.330
 while we are still in Aquitaine alsace in france after the rmf 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.139
 fm 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:19.150
 we still have plenty to see actually on this beautiful 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.099
 tribute we will talk about blues 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:24.039
 if we talk about gastronomy 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:27.210
 in general the banks are preparing to have a good time I played too 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.490
 hard to deal with saying 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.490
 he is in his region necessarily with cheese 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.960
 after learning that I read some specialties 

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:40.039
 we knew the fields 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:42.759
 other than that it will be really 

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:49.009
 after 89 days 20 hours on France 3 to be true she is also her 

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:50.210
 coach 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.699
 rare adverse engagement 

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:57.939
 everyone is concerned with this case the attacking fortress Obama 

00:07:57.939 --> 00:07:58.729
 adverse 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:01.749
 a fortnight for intestinal cancer 

00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:04.590
 today for
