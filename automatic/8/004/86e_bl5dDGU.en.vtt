 the application or the game here is the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.120
 the incorrect description is below 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.120

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.250
 size of the pk and the button of the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:21.680
 download here instead there is 700 file cache 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.380
 megabytes and are zip or rar files 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.750
 containing a file or which would be i 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.700
 Prevent additional game data not

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.619
 we click download now and it will open one 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.310
 peace with advertising and we wait 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:49.140
 because that's enough for us at the top right 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:53.670
 just to get ahead then one 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.619
 checa front time we have gp share a 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.850
 very convenient file sharing site because 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.079
 no need to enter any 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.540
 code 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:05.520
 so let's click download now here 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.110
 is the download will serve and you can 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.569
 check from the bar 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.830
 applications 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.230
 so what's downloading now 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.800
 is the apk file ie the application 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.420
 by itself if the game will be 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.640
 downloading does not require additional data 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.239
 you are okay otherwise you have to 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.390
 to unload the various parts then as 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.019
 I have already downloaded the app ik can 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:35.790
 also interrupts and I show you how 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:39.030
 continue once downloaded from the pk 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:45.360
 come back down and you'll have to download part1 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:48.840
 part2 part3 part4 once downloaded 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:55.470
 all the parties with a manager 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:58.349
 file for example use of for seven a lot 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.440
 this file manager is handy 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:04.400
 allows you to extract from 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.549
 extract the various parts of the gip e 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.129
 then assemble them by returning to us one 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:15.799
 Once all parts are unloaded, remove them 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:23.730
 the content and the file as written here 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:30.630
 must be allowed on the sd card in the folder 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:35.489
 android home own monster where so 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.739
 open new file manager sd card la 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:43.200
 folder where additional data goes e 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:47.400
 android home is the folder the folder 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.069
 then containing the additional data that 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.370
 this file would be here with the extension 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.370
 ob 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:02.450
 perfect that said and that's it 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.450
 and you will have the game ready and working 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.389
 here is gameloft first game 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:22.940
 available for android with technology 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:24.710
 other valentine's and as you can see both 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.580
 because it starts perfectly there is not 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.580
 no problem 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.229
 obviously the loading is a bit slow 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:43.250
 because however the game is enough 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:45.560
 heavy you just want to show you that the 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:54.830
 game works if you make us favorites 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:57.970
 start up no I do n't have pulp and so that 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.970
 it works I've played before 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:13.330
 here is how you can see very beautiful 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:16.630
 the graphics lecce see the game a bit 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.630
 by itself 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.260
 the game in Italian 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.590
 the judge of the title 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:40.470
 skip the introduction and I'll do it 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:42.919
 see the game commands a bit and how 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.919
 it works 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:58.229
 so I already went a little further 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.659
 then with the left side of the 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:04.490
 screen you can move while with the 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.490
 right side sticks 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.360
 I 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:45.430
 you have to see enough graphics 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.430
 closed and the controls are very comfortable 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.110
 perfect 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.379
 all this remains for me to do 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:06.159
 next with the next video there 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:06.159
 will explain with what
