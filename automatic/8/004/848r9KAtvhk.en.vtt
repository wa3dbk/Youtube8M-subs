00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
anything because this is blocking you so

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.440 
anything because this is blocking you so
first<00:00:37.530> thing<00:00:37.739> I'm<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.250> say<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.000> you

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
first thing I'm going to say is that you

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.850 
first thing I'm going to say is that you
should<00:00:39.600> probably<00:00:39.750> do<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> quick<00:00:40.260> save<00:00:40.500> because

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
should probably do a quick save because

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.260 
should probably do a quick save because
these<00:00:41.040> console<00:00:41.430> commands<00:00:41.700> they<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.120> mess

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
these console commands they like to mess

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.420 
these console commands they like to mess
with<00:00:42.390> your<00:00:42.510> game<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> little<00:00:42.870> bit<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.040> to

with your game a little bit so just to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.119 
with your game a little bit so just to
be<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> safe<00:00:44.820> side<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.329> bad<00:00:45.480> idea

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
be on the safe side it's on a bad idea

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.770 
be on the safe side it's on a bad idea
to<00:00:47.129> into<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> console<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.940> press<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.360> tilde

to into the console you press the tilde

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.139 
to into the console you press the tilde
key<00:00:48.930> which<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.980> right<00:00:50.160> beside<00:00:50.460> your<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:50.910> key

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
basically turn off collision and I'll

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.189 
basically turn off collision and I'll
let<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.559> fly<00:00:58.770> around<00:00:59.750> another<00:01:00.750> command<00:01:01.079> I'm

command your body is actually going to
fall<00:02:10.500> down<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:11.070> if<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.000> fall<00:02:12.210> down<00:02:12.360> off<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
fall down and if you fall down off the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.840 
fall down and if you fall down off the
cliff<00:02:12.960> then<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.650> find<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.370> doesn't<00:02:14.580> really<00:02:14.670> work

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
cliff then I find it doesn't really work

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.930 
cliff then I find it doesn't really work
so<00:02:14.910> well<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:16.280> keep<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.400> mind<00:02:17.550> this<00:02:17.670> plug<00:02:17.850> won't

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
so well and keep in mind this plug won't

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.270 
so well and keep in mind this plug won't
work<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.270> first<00:02:18.480> time<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.780> try<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.320> have

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
work the first time you try it I have

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.070 
work the first time you try it I have
had<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.970> record<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.450> few<00:02:21.690> times<00:02:21.720> now

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
had to record this a few times now

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.300 
had to record this a few times now
because<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.350> just<00:02:22.380> haven't<00:02:22.950> got<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.160> working

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
because I just haven't got it working

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.000 
because I just haven't got it working
properly<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.930> also<00:02:25.110> see<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.740> weather's

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
properly you also see that the weather's

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.650 
properly you also see that the weather's
bad<00:02:26.490> weather<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:26.880> coming<00:02:26.970> back<00:02:27.210> so<00:02:27.480> I'm<00:02:27.540> just

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
bad weather is coming back so I'm just

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.600 
bad weather is coming back so I'm just
going<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.900> do<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.380> command<00:02:28.620> again<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:28.980> there

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
going to do that command again and there

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.280 
going to do that command again and there
we<00:02:29.670> go<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:32.100> good<00:02:32.400> view<00:02:32.640> over<00:02:33.330> there<00:02:33.510> you

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
we go so a good view over there you

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.280 
we go so a good view over there you
can't<00:02:34.500> see<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.860> city<00:02:35.760> yet<00:02:35.910> though<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:37.020> we're

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
can't see the city yet though so we're

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.690 
can't see the city yet though so we're
going<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.500> type<00:02:38.150> T<00:02:39.150> FC<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:41.040> that'll<00:02:41.370> let<00:02:41.520> us

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
going to type T FC and that'll let us

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.690 
going to type T FC and that'll let us
fly<00:02:42.240> around<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:46.709> notice<00:02:46.860> before<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.580> you

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
fly around you notice before that you

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.130 
fly around you notice before that you
can<00:02:47.910> go<00:02:48.090> past<00:02:48.330> here<00:02:48.540> because<00:02:48.900> there's<00:02:49.050> a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
can go past here because there's a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.520 
can go past here because there's a
border<00:02:49.440> there<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:49.830> now<00:02:50.209> we<00:02:51.209> are<00:02:51.330> in<00:02:51.510> free<00:02:52.290> cam

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
border there but now we are in free cam

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.370 
border there but now we are in free cam
mode<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.430> we<00:02:53.550> can<00:02:53.700> just<00:02:53.850> fly<00:02:54.150> straight<00:02:54.480> over

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
mode so we can just fly straight over

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.670 
mode so we can just fly straight over
here

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.280 

so<00:03:00.680> rate<00:03:01.069> around<00:03:01.370> around<00:03:01.640> looking<00:03:02.109> should<00:03:03.109> pop

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
so rate around around looking should pop

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.649 
so rate around around looking should pop
up<00:03:03.319> any<00:03:03.620> second<00:03:04.069> now<00:03:04.099> there<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:04.760> go<00:03:07.389> so<00:03:08.389> there

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
up any second now there you go so there

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.440 
up any second now there you go so there
you<00:03:08.840> have<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.049> that's<00:03:09.790> just<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.939> tower<00:03:11.180> base

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
you have it that's just the tower base

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.470 
you have it that's just the tower base
of<00:03:11.659> the<00:03:11.780> Imperial<00:03:12.109> City<00:03:12.879> I'm<00:03:13.879> not<00:03:14.030> really<00:03:14.150> sure

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
of the Imperial City I'm not really sure

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.149 
of the Imperial City I'm not really sure
if<00:03:14.629> this<00:03:14.959> is<00:03:15.019> a<00:03:16.659> Easter<00:03:17.659> Egg<00:03:17.750> per<00:03:17.959> se<00:03:18.200> if<00:03:18.409> maybe

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
if this is a Easter Egg per se if maybe

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.289 
if this is a Easter Egg per se if maybe
it<00:03:19.280> was<00:03:19.370> intended<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.819> be<00:03:19.939> something<00:03:20.269> that

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
it was intended to be something that

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.670 
it was intended to be something that
divisible<00:03:20.810> although<00:03:21.200> I<00:03:21.230> don't<00:03:21.349> really<00:03:21.500> know

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
divisible although I don't really know

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.729 
divisible although I don't really know
how<00:03:21.889> since<00:03:22.340> there's<00:03:22.459> mountains<00:03:22.790> everywhere

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
how since there's mountains everywhere

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.619 
how since there's mountains everywhere
but<00:03:24.739> it's<00:03:25.579> it's<00:03:26.480> definitely<00:03:26.930> there

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
but it's it's definitely there

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.940 
but it's it's definitely there
so<00:03:29.629> you're<00:03:30.169> not<00:03:30.319> going<00:03:30.439> to<00:03:30.499> make<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.829> first

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
so you're not going to make it the first

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.949 
so you're not going to make it the first
time<00:03:31.159> you<00:03:31.280> try<00:03:31.459> this<00:03:31.519> probably<00:03:31.909> like<00:03:32.599> I<00:03:32.719> said

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
time you try this probably like I said

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.640 
time you try this probably like I said
go<00:03:33.319> above<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:33.709> crevice<00:03:33.889> over<00:03:34.219> there<00:03:34.370> and

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
go above that crevice over there and

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:48.100 
go above that crevice over there and
should<00:03:36.650> be<00:03:36.769> able<00:03:36.829> to<00:03:36.949> get<00:03:37.069> it

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.990
