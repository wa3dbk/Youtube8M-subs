reposition our bear right over here
we're<00:02:43.430> gonna<00:02:43.519> see<00:02:43.760> if<00:02:43.850> he<00:02:43.940> has<00:02:44.090> any<00:02:44.360> fleas

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.630 

you<00:02:54.700> use<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.910> manual<00:02:55.330> focusing<00:02:55.930> option<00:02:56.640> there

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
you use a manual focusing option there

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.600 
you use a manual focusing option there
we<00:02:57.700> go

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.610 

these<00:03:05.210> are<00:03:05.360> used<00:03:05.650> widely<00:03:06.650> in<00:03:08.620> various

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
these are used widely in various

these are used widely in various
businesses<00:03:10.160> where<00:03:10.640> we're<00:03:11.030> actually<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.570> school

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
businesses where we're actually a school

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.080 
businesses where we're actually a school
district<00:03:12.470> so<00:03:12.620> we<00:03:12.740> use<00:03:12.890> these<00:03:13.220> in<00:03:13.520> the

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
district so we use these in the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.020 
district so we use these in the
classroom<00:03:14.740> especially<00:03:15.740> in<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.370> science<00:03:16.790> labs

three-dimensional<00:03:20.210> objects<00:03:20.710> so<00:03:21.710> the

three-dimensional objects so the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.530 
three-dimensional objects so the
students<00:03:22.430> can<00:03:22.550> see<00:03:22.610> them<00:03:23.030> up<00:03:24.460> close<00:03:25.540> just

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
students can see them up close just

students can see them up close just
recently<00:03:26.900> we<00:03:27.050> used<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.380> document<00:03:27.860> camera

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
recently we used a document camera

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.860 
recently we used a document camera
similar<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.700> this<00:03:28.820> but<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.090> much<00:03:29.270> more<00:03:29.480> modern

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
similar to this but a much more modern

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.410 
similar to this but a much more modern
version<00:03:30.490> they<00:03:31.490> could<00:03:31.640> be<00:03:31.700> interfaced<00:03:32.090> with<00:03:32.240> a

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
version they could be interfaced with a

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.740 
version they could be interfaced with a
PC<00:03:33.070> for<00:03:34.070> a<00:03:34.670> heart<00:03:35.090> dissection<00:03:35.300> lab<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:37.750> think

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
PC for a heart dissection lab I think

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.470 
PC for a heart dissection lab I think
it's<00:03:38.930> as<00:03:39.170> far<00:03:39.440> in<00:03:39.620> as<00:03:39.770> it<00:03:39.950> goes<00:03:40.209> now<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.330> can

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
it's as far in as it goes now you can

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.800 
it's as far in as it goes now you can
adjust<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:42.050> white<00:03:42.320> balance<00:03:42.350> controls

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
adjust the white balance controls

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.740 
adjust the white balance controls
manually<00:03:46.239> from<00:03:47.239> red<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.630> blue<00:03:49.510> this<00:03:50.510> can

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
manually from red to blue this can

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.979 
manually from red to blue this can
actually<00:03:50.959> help<00:03:51.440> compensate<00:03:52.720> for<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.810> wall

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
actually help compensate for the wall

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:02.890 
actually help compensate for the wall
colors<00:03:54.470> or<00:03:55.340> lighting<00:03:56.120> issues<00:03:56.450> in<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:56.690> room

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.510 

as<00:04:03.140> I<00:04:03.590> said<00:04:03.800> it<00:04:03.920> has<00:04:03.950> no<00:04:04.250> rs-232<00:04:05.060> control<00:04:05.569> port

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
as I said it has no rs-232 control port

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.040 
as I said it has no rs-232 control port
this<00:04:07.520> allows<00:04:07.819> you<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.090> enable<00:04:08.420> or<00:04:08.569> disable<00:04:08.690> the

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
this allows you to enable or disable the

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.089 
this allows you to enable or disable the
remote<00:04:09.640> application<00:04:10.640> you<00:04:11.569> can<00:04:11.890> switch<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:13.040> to

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
remote application you can switch it to

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:19.860 
remote application you can switch it to
a<00:04:13.130> negative<00:04:13.599> image<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:17.269> push<00:04:17.480> of<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.720> button

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.980 

now<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:20.900> looks<00:04:21.200> like<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.500> evil<00:04:21.829> monkey<00:04:22.990> Chris

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
now it looks like the evil monkey Chris

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.880 
now it looks like the evil monkey Chris
Griffin's<00:04:24.440> closet

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.360 

it's<00:04:30.310> a<00:04:30.370> pretty<00:04:30.550> neat<00:04:30.760> little<00:04:30.790> device<00:04:32.370> for

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
it's a pretty neat little device for

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.210 
it's a pretty neat little device for
being<00:04:33.550> so<00:04:33.790> old<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:35.590> of<00:04:35.710> course<00:04:35.920> you<00:04:36.040> have<00:04:36.190> your

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
being so old and of course you have your

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.430 
being so old and of course you have your
backlight<00:04:36.730> now<00:04:36.910> look<00:04:37.030> at<00:04:37.150> that<00:04:37.180> in<00:04:37.510> that<00:04:37.540> cool

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.000 

the<00:04:41.440> evil<00:04:41.800> monkey

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.280 

the<00:04:45.490> thing<00:04:45.700> is<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:45.940> can't<00:04:46.290> simultaneously

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
the thing is you can't simultaneously

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.730 
the thing is you can't simultaneously
have<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.860> overhead<00:04:48.700> lights<00:04:48.940> and<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:50.410> under

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
have the overhead lights and the under

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.810 
have the overhead lights and the under
table<00:04:51.190> light<00:04:51.340> on<00:04:51.520> at<00:04:51.670> the<00:04:51.730> same<00:04:51.880> time<00:04:53.820> it

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
table light on at the same time it

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.970 
table light on at the same time it
doesn't<00:04:55.030> allow<00:04:55.270> you<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.420> do<00:04:55.600> that<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:59.470> because

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
doesn't allow you to do that and because

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.230 
doesn't allow you to do that and because
they're<00:05:00.220> fluorescent<00:05:00.790> they<00:05:00.880> do<00:05:00.940> take<00:05:01.210> a

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
they're fluorescent they do take a

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.930 
they're fluorescent they do take a
little<00:05:01.510> bit<00:05:01.660> of<00:05:02.050> time<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.740> warm<00:05:02.950> up

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.879 

but<00:05:09.940> it's<00:05:10.120> pretty<00:05:10.300> much<00:05:10.540> it<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:10.810> mean<00:05:11.080> it's<00:05:11.650> a

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
but it's pretty much it I mean it's a

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.530 
but it's pretty much it I mean it's a
very<00:05:11.919> capable<00:05:12.790> device<00:05:14.100> and<00:05:15.540> unfortunately

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
very capable device and unfortunately

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.090 
very capable device and unfortunately
it's<00:05:16.780> um<00:05:18.060> it's<00:05:19.060> spent<00:05:19.330> 90%<00:05:20.110> of<00:05:20.470> its<00:05:20.620> life<00:05:20.830> in

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
it's um it's spent 90% of its life in

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.610 
it's um it's spent 90% of its life in
storage
