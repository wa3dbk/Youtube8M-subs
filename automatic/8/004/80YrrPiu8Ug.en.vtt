00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
thread we're gonna go ahead and get the

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.980 
thread we're gonna go ahead and get the
chest<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.339> back<00:00:05.520> assembled<00:00:06.150> what<00:00:06.750> I've<00:00:06.839> done

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
chest and back assembled what I've done

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.870 
chest and back assembled what I've done
is<00:00:07.109> I've<00:00:07.200> already<00:00:07.319> gone<00:00:07.560> ahead<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:07.890> shimmed

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
is I've already gone ahead and shimmed

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.080 
is I've already gone ahead and shimmed
the<00:00:09.179> sides<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.469> top<00:00:10.650> as<00:00:10.980> well<00:00:11.639> as<00:00:11.790> cut

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
the sides and the top as well as cut

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.580 
the sides and the top as well as cut
that<00:00:12.210> angle<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.630> we<00:00:12.750> talked<00:00:12.990> about<00:00:13.110> after<00:00:13.500> we

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
that angle that we talked about after we

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.129 
that angle that we talked about after we
measured<00:00:13.920> where<00:00:14.070> abs<00:00:14.340> were<00:00:14.490> gonna<00:00:14.639> be<00:00:15.139> for

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
measured where abs were gonna be for

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.609 
measured where abs were gonna be for
myself<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.740> ended<00:00:17.010> up<00:00:17.130> being<00:00:18.619> triangular

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
myself it ended up being triangular

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.580 
myself it ended up being triangular
pieces<00:00:20.510> for<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.570> way<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.779> angle<00:00:22.109> met<00:00:22.320> and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
pieces for the way the angle met and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.590 
pieces for the way the angle met and
that's<00:00:23.310> why<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.490> ended<00:00:23.670> up<00:00:23.760> cutting<00:00:24.000> off<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
that's why I ended up cutting off the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.290 
that's why I ended up cutting off the
back<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.369> if<00:00:26.369> you're<00:00:26.580> if<00:00:26.789> you're<00:00:26.820> when<00:00:27.180> you're

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
back and if you're if you're when you're

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.790 
back and if you're if you're when you're
eyeballing<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:28.349> they<00:00:28.470> don't<00:00:28.619> match<00:00:28.769> up

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
eyeballing it if they don't match up

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.290 
eyeballing it if they don't match up
just<00:00:29.310> do<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> math<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.880> make<00:00:30.000> sure<00:00:30.179> that

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
just do the math and make sure that

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.460 
just do the math and make sure that
you're<00:00:30.420> cutting<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.720> same<00:00:30.900> amount<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.320> both

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
you're cutting the same amount on both

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.700 
you're cutting the same amount on both
sides<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.520> don't<00:00:32.700> get<00:00:32.790> lopsided<00:00:33.450> also<00:00:34.440> on

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
sides so you don't get lopsided also on

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.069 
sides so you don't get lopsided also on
the<00:00:35.040> shoulders<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.180> took<00:00:36.390> off<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.600> back

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the shoulders I took off the back

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.260 
the shoulders I took off the back
portion<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> strap<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.000> marked<00:00:39.210> where

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
portion of the strap and I marked where

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.900 
portion of the strap and I marked where
they<00:00:39.420> overlapped<00:00:39.890> measured<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.760> I

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
they overlapped measured it out and I

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.410 
they overlapped measured it out and I
took<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.210> much<00:00:42.390> off<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.600> back<00:00:42.899> strap<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:45.390> I

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
took that much off the back strap and I

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.060 
took that much off the back strap and I
didn't<00:00:45.629> use<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> front<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.289> want<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.559> keep<00:00:46.770> this

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
didn't use the front I want to keep this

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.740 
didn't use the front I want to keep this
nice<00:00:47.309> curve<00:00:47.640> that's<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.510> we're<00:00:48.690> gonna

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
nice curve that's here and we're gonna

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.060 
nice curve that's here and we're gonna
follow<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.230> shape<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.710> you're<00:00:49.829> gonna<00:00:49.920> be

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
follow that shape so you're gonna be

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.860 
follow that shape so you're gonna be
cutting<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.370> one-inch<00:00:50.760> shim<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.510> inch<00:00:51.660> wide

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
cutting a one-inch shim one inch wide

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.069 
cutting a one-inch shim one inch wide
shim<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:52.680> about<00:00:52.890> five<00:00:53.190> inches<00:00:53.520> long<00:00:53.730> and

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
shim that's about five inches long and

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.049 
shim that's about five inches long and
that's<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.309> narrow<00:00:56.309> enough<00:00:56.520> piece<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.969> you

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
that's a narrow enough piece that you

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.310 
that's a narrow enough piece that you
can<00:00:57.180> bend<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.629> bit<00:00:57.780> by<00:00:57.899> hand<00:00:58.109> get

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
can bend it a little bit by hand get

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.650 
can bend it a little bit by hand get
that<00:00:58.469> shape<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> little<00:00:59.070> early<00:00:59.430> and

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
that shape going a little early and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.029 
that shape going a little early and
you're<00:01:00.660> gonna<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.930> half<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> back<00:01:01.559> half<00:01:01.859> on

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
you're gonna do half on the back half on

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.740 
you're gonna do half on the back half on
the<00:01:02.129> front<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.640> went<00:01:02.789> ahead<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.059> shimmed

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the front but we went ahead and shimmed

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.310 
the front but we went ahead and shimmed
up<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.559> shoulders<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:06.060> sides<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
up the shoulders and the sides on the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.660 
up the shoulders and the sides on the
back<00:01:07.530> piece<00:01:07.830> first<00:01:08.130> because<00:01:08.340> that's<00:01:08.400> where<00:01:08.580> we

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
back piece first because that's where we

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.890 
back piece first because that's where we
did<00:01:08.790> our<00:01:08.820> cutting<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.330> want<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> front<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
did our cutting we want the front to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.500 
did our cutting we want the front to
hold<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.409> shape<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.189> much<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.490> possible<00:01:11.700> I've

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
hold the shape as much as possible I've

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.210 
hold the shape as much as possible I've
gone<00:01:12.720> ahead<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.049> glued<00:01:13.560> one<00:01:13.770> side<00:01:14.040> together

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
gone ahead and glued one side together

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.740 
gone ahead and glued one side together
just<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:14.970> easier<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.360> me<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> show<00:01:15.570> you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
just so it's easier for me to show you

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.240 
just so it's easier for me to show you
the<00:01:15.869> last<00:01:15.990> three<00:01:16.229> steps<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.740> sequence

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the last three steps in sequence

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.179 
the last three steps in sequence
I've<00:01:17.820> ground<00:01:18.240> down<00:01:18.479> all<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.960> my<00:01:19.409> seams<00:01:19.830> where

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
I've ground down all of my seams where

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.429 
I've ground down all of my seams where
the<00:01:20.340> glue<00:01:20.610> had<00:01:20.909> squeezed<00:01:21.240> through<00:01:21.600> grounded

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the glue had squeezed through grounded

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.070 
the glue had squeezed through grounded
down<00:01:22.590> flat<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.270> now<00:01:24.420> we're<00:01:24.570> ready<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.810> go<00:01:24.990> ahead

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
down flat so now we're ready to go ahead

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:34.820 
down flat so now we're ready to go ahead
and<00:01:25.470> meet<00:01:25.650> those<00:01:25.860> angles<00:01:26.280> up

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.500

Michigan<00:01:55.420> here<00:01:55.960> we<00:01:56.080> are<00:01:56.110> for<00:01:56.950> part<00:01:57.130> 14

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
Michigan here we are for part 14

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.120 
Michigan here we are for part 14
remember<00:01:59.229> on<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.410> front<00:01:59.590> half<00:01:59.770> of<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.920> Sham

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
remember on the front half of the Sham

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.469 
remember on the front half of the Sham
it<00:02:00.250> didn't<00:02:00.400> really<00:02:00.520> matter<00:02:00.700> how<00:02:00.880> much<00:02:01.030> glue<00:02:01.330> we

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
it didn't really matter how much glue we

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.330 
it didn't really matter how much glue we
use<00:02:01.660> we<00:02:01.840> just<00:02:01.960> need<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.110> little<00:02:02.229> bit<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.440> make

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
use we just need a little bit to make

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.359 
use we just need a little bit to make
sure<00:02:03.460> that<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.670> was<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:04.440> solid<00:02:05.440> layer<00:02:05.619> on<00:02:06.130> the

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
sure that it was a solid layer on the

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.760 
sure that it was a solid layer on the
front<00:02:06.640> we<00:02:06.910> want<00:02:07.149> to<00:02:07.270> glob<00:02:07.660> it<00:02:07.810> on<00:02:07.930> there<00:02:08.229> so

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
front we want to glob it on there so

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.530 
front we want to glob it on there so
that<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:08.920> squeezes<00:02:09.280> up<00:02:09.520> through<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:09.940> seam<00:02:10.179> and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
that it squeezes up through the seam and

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.270 
that it squeezes up through the seam and
we<00:02:10.989> don't<00:02:11.170> have<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.350> do<00:02:11.440> as<00:02:11.530> much<00:02:11.650> bondo<00:02:12.100> work

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
we don't have to do as much bondo work

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.620 
we don't have to do as much bondo work
later<00:02:12.520> on<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.989> be<00:02:14.650> generous<00:02:14.920> with<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:16.209> DEF<00:02:16.390> CON

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
later on so be generous with the DEF CON

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:27.780 
later on so be generous with the DEF CON
on<00:02:16.930> these<00:02:17.290> seams<00:02:23.760> go<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:26.370> little<00:02:27.370> bit<00:02:27.459> there<00:02:27.730> we

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
on these seams go a little bit there we

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.120 
on these seams go a little bit there we
go<00:02:28.140> nice<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.200> thick<00:02:29.530> on<00:02:29.680> there

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
go nice and thick on there

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.340 
go nice and thick on there
make<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.520> deep<00:02:30.820> clamp<00:02:31.120> ready<00:02:33.360> line<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.600> up<00:02:34.720> close

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
make a deep clamp ready line it up close

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.270 
make a deep clamp ready line it up close
and<00:02:37.650> get<00:02:38.970> make<00:02:39.970> sure<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.209> go<00:02:40.299> in<00:02:40.420> at<00:02:40.540> an<00:02:40.660> angle

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
and get make sure to go in at an angle

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.890 
and get make sure to go in at an angle
so<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.549> can<00:02:42.640> get<00:02:42.820> other<00:02:43.360> clamps<00:02:43.780> in

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
so that you can get other clamps in

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.680 
so that you can get other clamps in
behind<00:02:44.230> it

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
behind it

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.740 
behind it
and<00:02:46.690> squeeze<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.560> extra<00:02:47.860> glue<00:02:48.010> up<00:02:48.130> in<00:02:48.280> there

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
and squeeze that extra glue up in there

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.940 
and squeeze that extra glue up in there
do<00:02:49.750> another<00:02:49.959> long<00:02:50.200> clamp<00:02:50.530> from<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.830> other

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
do another long clamp from the other

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.820 
do another long clamp from the other
side<00:02:51.780> remember<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.019> front<00:02:53.290> is<00:02:53.560> what<00:02:53.709> we're

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
side remember the front is what we're

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.500 
side remember the front is what we're
clamping<00:02:54.340> here<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:54.820> you<00:02:54.910> don't<00:02:55.000> actually<00:02:55.209> have

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
clamping here so you don't actually have

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.789 
clamping here so you don't actually have
to<00:02:55.570> go<00:02:55.690> over<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.200> seam<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.410> just<00:02:56.650> have<00:02:56.739> to

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
to go over the seam you just have to

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:05.160 
to go over the seam you just have to
make<00:02:56.920> sure<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.310> front<00:02:57.519> is<00:02:57.760> hit<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:04.170> just

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
make sure that the front is hit it just

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.110 
make sure that the front is hit it just
clamps<00:03:05.470> in<00:03:05.739> there<00:03:05.890> as<00:03:05.980> best<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.280> can<00:03:06.489> if<00:03:06.970> you

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
clamps in there as best you can if you

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.310 
clamps in there as best you can if you
find<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.390> can't<00:03:07.600> get<00:03:07.720> another<00:03:07.870> clamp<00:03:08.140> in

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
find you can't get another clamp in

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.930 
find you can't get another clamp in
there<00:03:08.500> then<00:03:08.860> you're<00:03:09.340> gonna<00:03:09.430> have<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.700> back<00:03:09.910> off

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
there then you're gonna have to back off

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.300 
there then you're gonna have to back off
the<00:03:10.269> big<00:03:10.420> one<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.600> little<00:03:10.750> bit<00:03:11.190> does<00:03:12.190> it's

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
the big one a little bit does it's

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.670 
the big one a little bit does it's
better<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.580> have<00:03:12.640> multiple<00:03:12.850> clamps<00:03:13.510> than<00:03:13.750> one

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
better to have multiple clamps than one

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.910 
better to have multiple clamps than one
all<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.890> way<00:03:14.980> in<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.310> nothing<00:03:15.579> else<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:19.920> if

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
all the way in and nothing else and if

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.800 
all the way in and nothing else and if
you<00:03:21.040> see<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.310> bubbling<00:03:21.519> up<00:03:21.760> like<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.120> go

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
you see it bubbling up like that go

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.900 
you see it bubbling up like that go
ahead<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.019> smooth<00:03:23.650> out<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:23.829> seam<00:03:24.220> make<00:03:24.760> sure

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
ahead and smooth out that seam make sure

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.240 
ahead and smooth out that seam make sure
it's<00:03:25.060> it's<00:03:25.299> level<00:03:25.720> I'm<00:03:26.560> sure<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:26.890> figured<00:03:27.070> out

it's it's level I'm sure you figured out

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.470 
it's it's level I'm sure you figured out
by<00:03:27.400> now<00:03:27.430> how<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.730> get<00:03:27.880> this<00:03:27.970> stuff<00:03:28.150> off<00:03:28.329> your
