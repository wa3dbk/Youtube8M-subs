00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.000
 the dtm clutch is a unit contribution 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.709
 and thus drive all manufacturers or 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.480
 every driver in his vehicle the 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.480
 same clutch of celebration stand 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.680
 The role of the clutch is the start 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.780
 relatively important in particular 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.920
 Run right in the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.920
 Start-up start 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.730
 and the coupling is the best way to look at it 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.950
 always similar to any startup or 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.450
 the driver will work with 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.070
 can feel his foot 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.290
 I have the right point 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.090
 where I found the optimal 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.710
 start down 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.540
 before the start process there are the 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.490
 warm up and since it is for the 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.410
 driver very very important that he his 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.300
 clutch even if then every driver has 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.200
 each team has its own preferences 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.000
 if he then of course in the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.770
 startup com active the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.750
 Handbrake on against handbrake 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.180
 starting at a certain point 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.050
 then the motorcyclists will be on 6000 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.390
 turns set 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.190
 and the driver starts then at the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.080
 third light to look at the point 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.820
 So where does the clutch begin to attack 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.670
 and then, of course, the lights 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.980
 He releases the handbrake and is off 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.780
 then in the optimal area where he then 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.780
 an ideal start can lie down 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.750
 all very very difficult is in the dtm 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.850
 to overtake is the start very much 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.810
 important and then a successful one 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.810
 good race to lie down
