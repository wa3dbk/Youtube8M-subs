the<00:01:44.840> towards<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> trevor<00:01:46.440> area<00:01:46.860> over<00:01:47.190> there

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the towards the trevor area over there

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.859 
the towards the trevor area over there
by<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> fields<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.180> stuff<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.570> get<00:01:48.690> to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
by the fields and stuff you get to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.430 
by the fields and stuff you get to
really<00:01:49.229> see<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:51.240> purple<00:01:51.750> dinosaur<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
really see that that purple dinosaur and

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.130 
really see that that purple dinosaur and
actually<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> ride<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.720> normally<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.900> can

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
actually get to ride it normally I can

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.570 
actually get to ride it normally I can
pretty<00:01:55.260> much<00:01:55.380> hit<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.860> thing<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.400> on

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
pretty much hit this thing and like on

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.050 
pretty much hit this thing and like on
the<00:01:56.700> first<00:01:56.940> try<00:01:57.680> for<00:01:58.680> some<00:01:58.830> odd<00:01:58.860> reason<00:01:59.060> you

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the first try for some odd reason you

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.630 
the first try for some odd reason you
know<00:02:00.150> I<00:02:00.210> really<00:02:00.710> towards<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.830> turbine<00:02:02.189> area<00:02:02.580> I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
know I really towards the turbine area I

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.160 
know I really towards the turbine area I
struggled<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.360> bit<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:03.960> pretty

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
struggled a little bit but it's pretty

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.149 
struggled a little bit but it's pretty
cool<00:02:04.320> because<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.590> gave<00:02:04.680> me<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> little<00:02:05.010> bit

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
cool because it gave me a little bit

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.250 
cool because it gave me a little bit
longer<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.820> gameplay<00:02:06.240> which<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:07.080> really

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
longer of a gameplay which I can really

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.479 
longer of a gameplay which I can really
go<00:02:07.380> into<00:02:07.560> depth<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.920> don't<00:02:08.069> know<00:02:08.129> what<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> hell

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
go into depth I don't know what the hell

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.219 
go into depth I don't know what the hell
happened<00:02:08.819> there<00:02:08.849> I've<00:02:09.090> never<00:02:09.299> really<00:02:09.690> hit<00:02:10.170> a

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
happened there I've never really hit a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.309 
happened there I've never really hit a
bump<00:02:10.500> at<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.770> railroad

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
bump at the railroad

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.709 
bump at the railroad
railroad<00:02:11.890> tracks<00:02:12.129> it's<00:02:12.340> just<00:02:12.489> odd<00:02:12.670> but<00:02:13.450> this

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:13.719 
railroad tracks it's just odd but this

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.649 
railroad tracks it's just odd but this
map<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:13.959> really<00:02:14.560> fun<00:02:14.859> I<00:02:15.099> enjoyed<00:02:15.969> it<00:02:15.999> a<00:02:16.329> lot

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
map is really fun I enjoyed it a lot

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.110 
map is really fun I enjoyed it a lot
it's<00:02:17.019> very<00:02:17.260> creative<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.639> parts<00:02:18.999> where

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
it's very creative this the parts where

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.910 
it's very creative this the parts where
you<00:02:19.239> have<00:02:19.389> to<00:02:19.569> make<00:02:19.719> sharp<00:02:20.019> turns<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.620> end<00:02:20.769> up

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
you have to make sharp turns you end up

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.879 
you have to make sharp turns you end up
going<00:02:21.069> towards<00:02:21.609> the<00:02:22.319> trailer<00:02:23.319> homes<00:02:23.560> and

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:23.889 
going towards the trailer homes and

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.410 
going towards the trailer homes and
stuff<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.249> mobile<00:02:24.579> homes<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.120> get<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.389> go

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
stuff the mobile homes and you get to go

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.239 
stuff the mobile homes and you get to go
through<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.840> area<00:02:26.200> with<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.010> lot<00:02:27.129> of

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:27.249 
through that area with a lot of

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:29.009 
through that area with a lot of
precision<00:02:27.939> when<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.180> have<00:02:28.299> a<00:02:28.329> lot<00:02:28.689> of<00:02:28.719> people

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
precision when you have a lot of people

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.809 
precision when you have a lot of people
this<00:02:29.439> area<00:02:29.769> gets<00:02:29.980> really<00:02:30.310> hectic<00:02:30.489> because

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
this area gets really hectic because

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.449 
this area gets really hectic because
it's<00:02:31.120> such<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.269> tight<00:02:31.629> area<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.129> have<00:02:33.310> to

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
it's such a tight area that you have to

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.039 
it's such a tight area that you have to
maneuver<00:02:33.730> very<00:02:34.180> very<00:02:34.420> carefully<00:02:34.900> especially

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
maneuver very very carefully especially

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.470 
maneuver very very carefully especially
if<00:02:35.379> you<00:02:35.469> don't<00:02:35.709> have<00:02:35.889> no<00:02:36.159> contact<00:02:36.700> on<00:02:36.879> it

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
if you don't have no contact on it

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.300 
if you don't have no contact on it
becomes<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:38.019> really<00:02:38.409> big<00:02:38.590> challenge<00:02:39.069> now<00:02:39.159> this

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
becomes a really big challenge now this

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.739 
becomes a really big challenge now this
is<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.430> part<00:02:39.549> for<00:02:39.969> some<00:02:40.180> reason<00:02:40.599> that<00:02:40.689> I

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:40.749 
is the part for some reason that I

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.619 
is the part for some reason that I
struggled<00:02:41.349> during<00:02:42.099> my<00:02:42.400> livestreams<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.209> always

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
struggled during my livestreams I always

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.659 
struggled during my livestreams I always
hit<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:44.049> on<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.379> first<00:02:44.620> try<00:02:44.859> I<00:02:45.129> don't<00:02:45.609> know

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:45.669 
hit this on the first try I don't know

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.879 
hit this on the first try I don't know
what<00:02:46.030> was<00:02:46.209> happening<00:02:46.359> I<00:02:46.840> dunno<00:02:47.139> I<00:02:47.409> was<00:02:47.469> having

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.869 
some controller issues my like left
thumbstick<00:02:50.620> has<00:02:51.040> been<00:02:51.219> just<00:02:51.370> acting<00:02:51.699> really

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
thumbstick has been just acting really

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.149 
thumbstick has been just acting really
funny<00:02:52.000> lately<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.810> might<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.409> to<00:02:53.530> replace<00:02:53.889> it

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
funny lately I might have to replace it

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.089 
funny lately I might have to replace it
but<00:02:55.090> uh<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.629> know<00:02:55.750> normally<00:02:56.319> I<00:02:56.530> can<00:02:56.889> hit<00:02:57.010> this

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
but uh you know normally I can hit this

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.589 
but uh you know normally I can hit this
on<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.340> first<00:02:57.519> try<00:02:57.790> but<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.209> is<00:02:58.329> where<00:02:58.510> it

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
on the first try but this is where it

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.659 
on the first try but this is where it
gets<00:02:58.629> really<00:02:59.169> really<00:02:59.439> technical<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.549> you

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:00.669 
gets really really technical and you

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:03.149 
gets really really technical and you
have<00:03:00.849> to<00:03:01.090> get<00:03:01.239> really<00:03:01.689> really<00:03:01.959> precise<00:03:02.469> with

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
have to get really really precise with

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.399 
have to get really really precise with
your<00:03:03.219> movement<00:03:03.909> your<00:03:04.120> speed<00:03:04.449> your<00:03:04.480> timing<00:03:05.230> and

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
your movement your speed your timing and

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.099 
your movement your speed your timing and
above<00:03:06.219> all<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.699> have<00:03:06.939> to<00:03:07.180> get<00:03:07.329> pretty<00:03:07.659> lucky

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
above all you have to get pretty lucky

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.449 
above all you have to get pretty lucky
as<00:03:08.290> well<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.560> mean<00:03:08.799> you're<00:03:08.949> really<00:03:09.159> not<00:03:09.310> gonna

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:11.469 
it really isn't too much time to think

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:12.659 
it really isn't too much time to think
about<00:03:11.739> what<00:03:12.010> you're<00:03:12.129> going<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.340> do<00:03:12.489> you're

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
mainly just kind of have to hit the ramp

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.530 
mainly just kind of have to hit the ramp
and<00:03:14.260> go<00:03:14.500> lift<00:03:15.459> up<00:03:15.639> the<00:03:15.790> back<00:03:16.000> side<00:03:16.299> a<00:03:16.329> little

and go lift up the back side a little
bit<00:03:16.689> get<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.049> little<00:03:17.109> lift<00:03:17.500> before<00:03:17.979> you<00:03:18.099> take

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
bit get a little lift before you take

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.979 
bit get a little lift before you take
off<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:18.759> you<00:03:18.849> can<00:03:19.000> clear<00:03:19.359> that<00:03:19.569> because<00:03:19.780> if<00:03:19.900> you

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
off so you can clear that because if you

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.869 
off so you can clear that because if you
don't<00:03:20.139> have<00:03:20.229> enough<00:03:20.349> speed<00:03:20.709> or<00:03:20.949> if<00:03:21.579> you<00:03:21.669> don't

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
don't have enough speed or if you don't

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.490 
don't have enough speed or if you don't
lift<00:03:22.150> up<00:03:22.359> the<00:03:22.540> motorcycle<00:03:23.049> it's<00:03:23.169> going<00:03:23.319> to<00:03:23.379> be

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
lift up the motorcycle it's going to be

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.699 
lift up the motorcycle it's going to be
very<00:03:23.530> difficult<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.549> get<00:03:25.090> this<00:03:25.239> particular

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
very difficult to get this particular

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.349 
very difficult to get this particular
this<00:03:26.709> particular<00:03:26.859> jump<00:03:27.459> done<00:03:27.639> now<00:03:27.819> I<00:03:27.849> do<00:03:28.030> end

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
this particular jump done now I do end

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.129 
this particular jump done now I do end
up<00:03:28.449> using<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:29.470> body<00:03:30.430> 801<00:03:31.060> only<00:03:31.509> because<00:03:31.900> I

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
up using the body 801 only because I

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.869 
up using the body 801 only because I
really<00:03:32.409> I<00:03:32.650> really<00:03:33.009> think<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.489> that's<00:03:33.669> the

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
really I really think that that's the

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.059 
really I really think that that's the
best<00:03:34.120> motorcycle<00:03:34.449> to<00:03:34.840> use<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.409> Dinka<00:03:35.769> thrust

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
best motorcycle to use the Dinka thrust

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.920 
best motorcycle to use the Dinka thrust
that<00:03:36.220> thing<00:03:36.370> is<00:03:36.459> a<00:03:36.549> big<00:03:36.849> old<00:03:37.030> jalopy<00:03:37.479> of<00:03:37.780> a

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
that thing is a big old jalopy of a

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.409 
that thing is a big old jalopy of a
mammoth<00:03:38.799> of<00:03:38.919> a<00:03:39.009> bike<00:03:39.220> so<00:03:39.909> I<00:03:39.939> think<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.329> would

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
mammoth of a bike so I think you would

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.949 
mammoth of a bike so I think you would
have<00:03:40.599> some<00:03:40.780> issues<00:03:40.900> maybe<00:03:41.319> with<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:41.560> one<00:03:41.769> but

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
have some issues maybe with that one but

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.050 
have some issues maybe with that one but
you<00:03:43.959> know<00:03:44.079> this<00:03:44.620> one<00:03:44.859> is<00:03:45.099> really<00:03:45.459> fun

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
you know this one is really fun

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.490 
you know this one is really fun
especially<00:03:46.389> once<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.139> start<00:03:47.409> getting

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
especially once you start getting

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.349 
especially once you start getting
towards<00:03:47.949> the<00:03:47.949> end<00:03:48.099> of<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.549> once<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:48.939> clear<00:03:49.180> this

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
towards the end of it once I clear this

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.909 
towards the end of it once I clear this
spot<00:03:49.659> you<00:03:50.199> guys<00:03:50.319> will<00:03:50.500> see<00:03:50.530> what<00:03:50.799> I'm<00:03:50.889> talking

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
timing thing the only good thing about

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.719 
timing thing the only good thing about
this<00:03:55.930> particular<00:03:56.290> turbine<00:03:56.829> spot<00:03:57.159> is<00:03:57.310> after

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:57.729 
this particular turbine spot is after

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:59.280 
this particular turbine spot is after
you<00:03:57.819> get<00:03:58.030> one<00:03:58.269> of<00:03:58.389> the<00:03:58.449> checkpoints<00:03:58.719> you

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
you get one of the checkpoints you

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.860 
you get one of the checkpoints you
pretty<00:03:59.500> much<00:03:59.560> will<00:03:59.919> start<00:04:00.250> on<00:04:00.459> that<00:04:01.030> next<00:04:01.329> the

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
pretty much will start on that next the

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.449 
pretty much will start on that next the
next<00:04:02.109> spot<00:04:02.409> which<00:04:02.620> is<00:04:02.769> really<00:04:03.040> great<00:04:03.250> you

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
next spot which is really great you

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.530 
next spot which is really great you
don't<00:04:03.549> have<00:04:03.699> to<00:04:03.790> like<00:04:03.909> start<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.269> whole<00:04:04.509> thing

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
don't have to like start the whole thing

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.240 
don't have to like start the whole thing
over<00:04:04.870> again<00:04:05.049> can<00:04:05.409> you<00:04:05.439> imagine<00:04:05.709> you'd<00:04:06.219> be

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
over again can you imagine you'd be

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.659 
over again can you imagine you'd be
there<00:04:06.489> forever<00:04:06.989> but<00:04:07.989> this<00:04:08.590> is<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.769> really<00:04:09.219> fun

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
there forever but this is a really fun

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.189 
there forever but this is a really fun
map<00:04:09.909> I<00:04:10.120> suggest<00:04:10.629> if<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.840> guys<00:04:10.989> are<00:04:11.169> looking

map I suggest if you guys are looking
for<00:04:11.560> some<00:04:11.709> fun<00:04:11.739> stuff<00:04:12.189> to<00:04:12.250> do<00:04:12.459> maybe<00:04:12.699> you<00:04:12.939> do

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
for some fun stuff to do maybe you do

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.770 
for some fun stuff to do maybe you do
live<00:04:13.539> stream<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:13.930> yourself<00:04:14.289> or<00:04:14.799> maybe<00:04:15.039> you<00:04:15.280> do

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
live stream it yourself or maybe you do

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.640 
live stream it yourself or maybe you do
races<00:04:16.780> with<00:04:16.930> your<00:04:17.079> friends<00:04:17.440> and<00:04:17.469> you<00:04:17.590> guys

time and play with some friends and
stuff<00:04:20.169> this<00:04:20.769> is<00:04:20.919> a<00:04:20.949> really<00:04:21.370> good<00:04:21.549> math<00:04:21.729> to<00:04:21.970> do

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
stuff this is a really good math to do

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.629 
stuff this is a really good math to do
it<00:04:22.599> took<00:04:23.020> me<00:04:23.169> probably<00:04:23.199> about<00:04:23.889> I<00:04:24.340> think<00:04:24.520> it's

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
it took me probably about I think it's

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.070 
it took me probably about I think it's
like<00:04:24.729> five<00:04:25.000> minutes<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.569> complete<00:04:25.960> it

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
like five minutes to complete it

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.589 
like five minutes to complete it
normally<00:04:26.530> takes<00:04:26.860> me<00:04:27.009> about<00:04:27.099> three<00:04:27.669> when<00:04:28.479> I'm

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
normally takes me about three when I'm

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.480 
normally takes me about three when I'm
really<00:04:28.810> really<00:04:29.110> lucky<00:04:29.409> and<00:04:29.560> I'm<00:04:29.710> spot<00:04:30.039> on<00:04:30.250> my

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
really really lucky and I'm spot on my

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.490 
really really lucky and I'm spot on my
jumps<00:04:30.879> as<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.569> can<00:04:31.689> see<00:04:31.870> here<00:04:32.110> I'm<00:04:32.229> still

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
jumps as you can see here I'm still

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.320 
jumps as you can see here I'm still
struggling<00:04:32.860> I<00:04:33.250> don't<00:04:33.729> know<00:04:33.789> what<00:04:33.969> the<00:04:34.060> hell<00:04:34.210> is

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
somehow I managed to get this on the

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.110 
somehow I managed to get this on the
first<00:05:41.680> try<00:05:41.919> you<00:05:42.099> want<00:05:42.279> to<00:05:42.370> first<00:05:42.550> knock<00:05:42.819> off

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
first try you want to first knock off

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.809 
first try you want to first knock off
the<00:05:43.469> you<00:05:44.469> want<00:05:44.620> to<00:05:44.710> knock<00:05:44.860> off<00:05:45.069> those<00:05:45.370> barrels

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:45.819 
the you want to knock off those barrels

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.279 
the you want to knock off those barrels
they're<00:05:46.060> kind<00:05:46.330> of<00:05:46.389> push<00:05:46.599> them<00:05:46.779> forward<00:05:46.960> so

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
they're kind of push them forward so

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.230 
they're kind of push them forward so
that<00:05:47.319> the<00:05:47.469> turbine<00:05:48.190> can<00:05:48.370> knock<00:05:48.639> them<00:05:48.789> off<00:05:48.969> and

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
that the turbine can knock them off and

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.089 
that the turbine can knock them off and
once<00:05:49.750> you<00:05:49.870> do<00:05:50.020> that<00:05:50.050> you<00:05:50.440> can<00:05:50.589> see<00:05:50.740> here<00:05:50.949> it

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
once you do that you can see here it

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:52.529
