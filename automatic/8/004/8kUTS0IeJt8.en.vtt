00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
fun maybe it's not as challenging but

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.480 
fun maybe it's not as challenging but
Ryan<00:01:14.259> and<00:01:15.259> we<00:01:15.380> keep<00:01:15.530> it<00:01:15.710> challenging<00:01:16.250> enough

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
don't ly nothing is perfect so

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.859 
don't ly nothing is perfect so
yeah<00:01:21.909> that's<00:01:22.570> right<00:01:22.840> that's<00:01:23.140> right<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:25.030> lot<00:01:25.689> of

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
yeah that's right that's right a lot of

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:35.280 
yeah that's right that's right a lot of
times<00:01:26.079> people<00:01:26.590> are<00:01:26.920> prone<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.490> say

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.770 

I<00:01:35.350> guess<00:01:36.190> there's<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.550> nice<00:01:36.760> show<00:01:37.060> tonight<00:01:37.510> and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
I guess there's a nice show tonight and

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.660 
I guess there's a nice show tonight and
they<00:01:38.020> think<00:01:38.350> it's<00:01:38.560> almost<00:01:38.800> dark<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:39.520> they

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
they think it's almost dark so they

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.850 
they think it's almost dark so they
started<00:01:40.060> flying<00:01:40.330> but<00:01:41.230> now<00:01:41.350> there<00:01:41.560> are<00:01:41.620> a<00:01:41.680> few

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
started flying but now there are a few

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.060 
started flying but now there are a few
holes<00:01:42.130> left<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.670> grill<00:01:42.880> even<00:01:43.330> though<00:01:43.480> is

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
holes left the grill even though is

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.510 
holes left the grill even though is
they're<00:01:45.070> all<00:01:45.190> still<00:01:45.700> piloted<00:01:46.690> for<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.520> don't

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
they're all still piloted for you don't

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.920 
they're all still piloted for you don't
have<00:01:48.730> a<00:01:48.760> vision<00:01:49.030> of<00:01:49.210> marketing<00:01:49.930> anyway<00:01:51.930> we're

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
putting quite a bit of emphasis on that

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.880 
putting quite a bit of emphasis on that
airplane<00:01:54.940> because<00:01:55.390> we<00:01:55.840> really<00:01:56.140> think<00:01:56.380> we'd
