00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.020 

so<00:00:07.930> here<00:00:08.170> we're<00:00:08.320> demonstrating<00:00:08.910> what<00:00:09.910> I'm

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
so here we're demonstrating what I'm

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.100 
so here we're demonstrating what I'm
calling<00:00:10.270> tire<00:00:10.720> scrub<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.790> we<00:00:13.660> found<00:00:13.840> a<00:00:13.990> way<00:00:14.080> to

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
calling tire scrub and we found a way to

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.760 
calling tire scrub and we found a way to
measure<00:00:14.469> it<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:16.450> this<00:00:16.630> is<00:00:16.840> the<00:00:16.990> bike<00:00:17.200> with<00:00:17.650> the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
measure it so this is the bike with the

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.290 
measure it so this is the bike with the
steering<00:00:18.070> fully<00:00:19.000> lock<00:00:19.270> to<00:00:19.450> lock<00:00:21.300> and

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
steering fully lock to lock and

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.890 
steering fully lock to lock and
basically<00:00:22.900> making<00:00:23.110> a<00:00:23.320> u-turn<00:00:23.680> and<00:00:24.450> we<00:00:25.450> can<00:00:25.630> see

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
basically making a u-turn and we can see

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.019 
basically making a u-turn and we can see
by<00:00:26.079> the<00:00:26.140> action<00:00:26.710> of<00:00:26.800> that<00:00:26.980> pad<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:30.189> as<00:00:30.579> we

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
by the action of that pad that as we

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.000 
by the action of that pad that as we
move<00:00:31.329> the<00:00:31.599> vehicle<00:00:32.110> through<00:00:32.349> its<00:00:32.529> turning

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
move the vehicle through its turning

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.880 
move the vehicle through its turning
radius<00:00:35.160> its<00:00:36.160> scrubbing<00:00:36.820> enough<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.890> really

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
radius its scrubbing enough to really

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.660 
radius its scrubbing enough to really
move<00:00:39.250> that<00:00:39.519> pad<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:43.000> I<00:00:43.239> mean<00:00:43.420> it<00:00:43.600> it's<00:00:44.109> nearly

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
move that pad and I mean it it's nearly

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.330 
move that pad and I mean it it's nearly
50/50<00:00:45.670> so<00:00:45.940> in<00:00:46.090> other<00:00:46.239> words<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.890> know<00:00:48.010> a<00:00:48.039> few

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
50/50 so in other words you know a few

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.790 
50/50 so in other words you know a few
inches<00:00:48.489> forward<00:00:49.000> and<00:00:49.420> it's<00:00:49.570> scrubbing<00:00:50.440> just

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
inches forward and it's scrubbing just

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.599 
inches forward and it's scrubbing just
as<00:00:50.980> much<00:00:51.250> off<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.879> side

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.899 

so<00:00:55.149> what<00:00:55.539> this<00:00:55.719> is<00:00:55.899> demonstrating<00:00:56.710> is<00:00:56.859> that<00:00:57.670> as

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
so what this is demonstrating is that as

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.740 
so what this is demonstrating is that as
the<00:00:58.239> landing<00:00:58.719> gear<00:00:58.989> comes<00:00:59.969> forward<00:01:00.969> or<00:01:01.719> I

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
the landing gear comes forward or I

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.979 
the landing gear comes forward or I
should<00:01:02.379> say<00:01:02.559> is<00:01:02.739> placed<00:01:03.129> forward<00:01:04.030> of<00:01:04.269> the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
should say is placed forward of the

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.450 
should say is placed forward of the
center<00:01:05.590> of<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.670> vehicle<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.590> wheels<00:01:08.890> instead

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
center of the vehicle the wheels instead

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.330 
center of the vehicle the wheels instead
of<00:01:09.520> having<00:01:09.909> a<00:01:10.000> differential<00:01:10.810> action<00:01:11.619> like

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
of having a differential action like

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.889 
of having a differential action like
they<00:01:12.520> do<00:01:12.580> in<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:12.970> back<00:01:13.149> like<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.509> set<00:01:13.810> of

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
they do in the back like a set of

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.039 
they do in the back like a set of
training<00:01:14.170> wheels<00:01:14.320> on<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.770> child's<00:01:15.250> bike

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
training wheels on a child's bike

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.310 
training wheels on a child's bike
there's<00:01:17.049> there's<00:01:17.590> very<00:01:17.890> little<00:01:18.369> differential

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
there's there's very little differential

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.779 
there's there's very little differential
action<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:21.220> tire<00:01:21.429> is<00:01:21.610> actually

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
action and the tire is actually

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.719 
action and the tire is actually
scrubbing<00:01:22.600> sideways<00:01:23.320> as<00:01:23.619> much<00:01:24.100> as<00:01:24.429> it's

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
scrubbing sideways as much as it's

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.889 
scrubbing sideways as much as it's
moving<00:01:25.479> forward<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.600> in<00:01:28.780> this

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
moving forward and so in this

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.859 
moving forward and so in this
configuration<00:01:29.259> with<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:29.950> landing<00:01:30.369> gear

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
configuration with the landing gear

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.029 
configuration with the landing gear
forward<00:01:31.869> of<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.289> center<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.369> vehicle

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
forward of the center of the vehicle

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.430 
forward of the center of the vehicle
center<00:01:36.039> of<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:37.330> medium<00:01:37.750> point<00:01:37.990> between

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
center of the the medium point between

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.809 
center of the the medium point between
the<00:01:38.560> front<00:01:38.830> wheel<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.459> rear<00:01:39.729> wheel<00:01:41.819> we've

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
the front wheel and the rear wheel we've

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.130 
the front wheel and the rear wheel we've
got<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.270> use<00:01:43.539> an<00:01:43.899> omnidirectional<00:01:45.060> wheel<00:01:46.140> if

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
got to use an omnidirectional wheel if

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.190 
got to use an omnidirectional wheel if
we<00:01:47.440> come<00:01:48.000> forward<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.479> center<00:01:49.840> point<00:01:50.049> of

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
we come forward of the center point of

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.570 
we come forward of the center point of
the<00:01:50.289> vehicle<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.799> that's<00:01:51.130> what<00:01:51.369> we're<00:01:51.459> going

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
the vehicle and that's what we're going

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.219 
the vehicle and that's what we're going
to<00:01:51.640> do<00:01:51.789> here<00:01:52.030> so<00:01:52.179> we're<00:01:52.810> going<00:01:52.929> to<00:01:53.020> eliminate

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
to do here so we're going to eliminate

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.090 
to do here so we're going to eliminate
just<00:01:53.770> a<00:01:53.920> standard<00:01:54.369> old-fashioned<00:01:55.149> wheel<00:01:55.330> only

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
just a standard old-fashioned wheel only

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.029 
just a standard old-fashioned wheel only
rotates<00:01:57.100> in<00:01:57.280> one<00:01:57.399> direction<00:01:57.599> and<00:01:58.890> we're<00:01:59.890> going

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
rotates in one direction and we're going

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.520 
rotates in one direction and we're going
to<00:02:00.099> replace<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:00.459> with<00:02:00.759> an<00:02:00.879> omnidirectional

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
to replace it with an omnidirectional

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.569 
to replace it with an omnidirectional
wheel<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:03.489> you'll<00:02:03.640> see<00:02:03.910> that<00:02:04.060> next
