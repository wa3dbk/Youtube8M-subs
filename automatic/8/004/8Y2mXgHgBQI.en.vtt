00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
know that that will never happen for me

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.270 
know that that will never happen for me
again<00:01:52.700> that's<00:01:52.969> completely<00:01:53.360> unrealistic<00:01:54.280> you

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
again that's completely unrealistic you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.410 
again that's completely unrealistic you
know<00:01:55.369> sometimes<00:01:55.729> you<00:01:55.819> got<00:01:55.939> to<00:01:55.970> just<00:01:56.090> Rin<00:01:56.390> and

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
know sometimes you got to just Rin and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.039 
know sometimes you got to just Rin and
bear<00:01:56.720> it<00:01:56.840> but<00:01:57.880> well<00:01:58.880> worth<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.329> well<00:01:59.689> worth<00:01:59.869> it

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
bear it but well worth it well worth it

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.459 
bear it but well worth it well worth it
I<00:02:00.110> think<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:01.009> good<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.549> comes<00:02:01.759> of<00:02:02.000> that

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
I think the the good that comes of that

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.870 
I think the the good that comes of that
certainly<00:02:03.469> outweighs<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:04.189> bad<00:02:04.340> even<00:02:04.670> if<00:02:04.759> it

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
certainly outweighs the bad even if it

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.380 
certainly outweighs the bad even if it
means<00:02:05.649> not<00:02:06.649> winning<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.039> tour<00:02:07.250> I<00:02:07.549> think<00:02:08.030> that

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
means not winning the tour I think that

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.470 
means not winning the tour I think that
looking<00:02:09.379> back<00:02:09.410> on<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:10.060> looking<00:02:11.060> at<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.269> things

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
looking back on it looking at the things

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.890 
looking back on it looking at the things
