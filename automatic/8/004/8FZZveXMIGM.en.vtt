00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:21.030
 and is the 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.030
 [Applause] 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.600
 [Music] 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:42.630
 [Applause] 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.730
 [Music] 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 Crazy 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:01:08.610
 [Applause] 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.610
 ae 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:24.359
 [Applause] 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.530
 the first aspect we have to 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.600
 Unfortunately, the field is not in the 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.690
 my opinion it is inadmissible 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.180
 playing a game of a competition 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.840
 and especially of the level that the 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.970
 federation is accepting this field 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.110
 This is the first point but we do not 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.180
 we are to blame and we have to play 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.350
 football somehow we try 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.320
 do this from first to last minute 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.700
 first time a very risky game 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.580
 second time at the time we were 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.610
 best at starting is the pylon unfortunately 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.070
 he was expelled he retaliated is an aggression that 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.510
 previous throw or referee to expel 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.000
 one of their players did not expel him 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.830
 unfortunately because of this it is part and 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.649
 We're going to charge week use and more. 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.700
 and more in us we will guide you no more 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.800
 a little still 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.320
 the second aspect is that playing with the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.970
 less in a bad field, did not have much 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.250
 thing to be done do not be retracted two 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.230
 lines of four leaving 11 attackers 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.910
 on the front it just worked it out 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.930
 Paulo started twice in giving a 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.110
 of the plays 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.530
 ended up propitiating the move that originated 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.840
 the goal né pedrinho was very happy too 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.300
 this enables us to have a 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.920
 greater tranquility during the week 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.930
 we will analyze the match well in the match 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.209
 next Saturday we have decisive and 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.140
 we dedicate our passage to the 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.140
 quarterfinals of the São Paulo championship
