00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 or teachers of dance and expression 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.710
 corporal denounced this morning the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.830
 lack of creation of positions for 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.590
 teachers of corporal expression dances and 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.590
 theater in public schools and their 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.590
 different levels did it before the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.570
 hour extension announcement in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.070
 different schools of the province 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.080
 we had to impose on 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.090
 presentation of extended day because 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.560
 the dialogue was not opened it was not opened to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.050
 debate and there was no possibility of 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.540
 neither is this what we 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.250
 We claim is more than 16 years ago 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.829
 creation of positions for teachers of 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.870
 theater and dance that are formed 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.989
 publicly in faculty of the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.000
 province and they do not have workspace 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.760
 and of inclusion in the same education 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.550
 public the only possibility of work 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.649
 what we have is in private schools 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.190
 we saw in extended day a 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.750
 the place where you can finally enter 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.270
 to elementary school and to be able 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.340
 democratize the languages â€‹â€‹of dance and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.680
 theater and be able to start changing a bit 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.230
 the conception of art in education 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.300
 that is not recreate 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.610
 that is not merely entertainment and 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.700
 which is a place of training and 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.410
 creation of knowledge justly 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.410
 enter what they said 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.159
 and to dialogue so we had to ask 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.990
 the word and raise the tone a bit 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.880
 like to be able to listen because there was not 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.469
 microphone and they were not expected either 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.549
 no question do not go with a 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.549
 feeling a bit 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.420
 if in fact what they said is 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.050
 like they promised that they are going to 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.700
 create charges so said 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.610
 the government people where they are going to 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.290
 create positions for dance or theater that 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.960
 it's also a topic is why the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.340
 nation says dance but good the subject of 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.080
 the creation of charges must wait 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.290
 they say they are going to open a ladder but 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.180
 well that's not what they exposed in the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.830
 presentation they did and if they said 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.300
 that before the question and existence 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.300
 our that because they did not create charges
