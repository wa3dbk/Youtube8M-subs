figures so far the whole set um just the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.670 
figures so far the whole set um just the
lack<00:03:25.760> of<00:03:25.790> maybe<00:03:26.210> detail<00:03:26.750> but<00:03:26.990> I<00:03:27.020> get<00:03:27.380> that<00:03:27.530> it's

a<00:03:27.740> whole<00:03:27.890> animated<00:03:28.460> kind<00:03:28.670> of<00:03:28.730> look<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.120> him<00:03:29.270> and
