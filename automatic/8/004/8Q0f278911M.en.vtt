00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.490 

in<00:00:04.149> the<00:00:04.299> backward<00:00:04.810> direction<00:00:06.090> alright<00:00:07.090> and

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
in the backward direction alright and

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.780 
in the backward direction alright and
again<00:00:08.500> this<00:00:08.920> doesn't<00:00:08.980> have<00:00:09.280> to<00:00:09.400> be<00:00:09.519> half<00:00:09.760> way

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
again this doesn't have to be half way

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.490 
again this doesn't have to be half way
it<00:00:10.179> can<00:00:10.300> be<00:00:10.420> really<00:00:10.690> anywhere<00:00:11.080> in<00:00:11.349> between

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500 
it can be really anywhere in between

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.730 
it can be really anywhere in between
there<00:00:11.950> and<00:00:11.980> we're<00:00:12.339> trying<00:00:12.610> to<00:00:12.730> figure<00:00:12.910> out<00:00:13.740> the

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
there and we're trying to figure out the

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.060 
there and we're trying to figure out the
head<00:00:15.180> because<00:00:16.180> this<00:00:16.330> is<00:00:16.480> not<00:00:16.750> calm<00:00:17.500> around<00:00:17.920> it

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
head because this is not calm around it

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.670 
head because this is not calm around it
they<00:00:18.789> had<00:00:19.060> in<00:00:19.360> a<00:00:19.510> backwards<00:00:20.020> direction<00:00:20.230> is

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
they had in a backwards direction is

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.120 
they had in a backwards direction is
equal<00:00:21.040> to<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.730> same<00:00:21.970> thing<00:00:22.530> over<00:00:23.530> Delta<00:00:23.920> X

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
equal to the same thing over Delta X

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.620 
equal to the same thing over Delta X
here<00:00:24.990> alright<00:00:25.990> so<00:00:26.550> what<00:00:27.550> this<00:00:27.700> thing<00:00:28.000> does<00:00:28.240> is

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
here alright so what this thing does is

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.150 
here alright so what this thing does is
it<00:00:28.930> basically<00:00:29.530> we're<00:00:30.040> trying<00:00:30.340> to<00:00:30.460> get<00:00:30.640> a<00:00:30.910> an

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
it basically we're trying to get a an

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.830 
it basically we're trying to get a an
estimate<00:00:33.160> of<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:33.489> head<00:00:33.700> at<00:00:33.879> some<00:00:34.149> point<00:00:34.450> by

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
estimate of the head at some point by

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.100 
estimate of the head at some point by
using<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:35.379> heads<00:00:36.370> that<00:00:36.579> are<00:00:36.750> at<00:00:37.750> these

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
using the heads that are at these

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.590 
using the heads that are at these
particularly<00:00:38.710> nodes

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
particularly nodes

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.760 
particularly nodes
realizing<00:00:40.600> that<00:00:40.630> we<00:00:40.960> may<00:00:41.170> not<00:00:41.320> know<00:00:41.380> what

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
realizing that we may not know what

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.210 
realizing that we may not know what
those<00:00:41.950> heads<00:00:42.370> are<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:44.230> that'll<00:00:44.860> be<00:00:44.980> shown

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
those heads are and that'll be shown

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.170 
those heads are and that'll be shown
here<00:00:45.430> in<00:00:45.550> a<00:00:45.610> second

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
here in a second

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.410 
here in a second
alright<00:00:47.140> so<00:00:47.500> let's<00:00:48.130> let's<00:00:48.760> just<00:00:48.850> take<00:00:49.149> a<00:00:49.180> look

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
alright so let's let's just take a look

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.450 
alright so let's let's just take a look
then<00:00:49.690> at<00:00:49.720> what<00:00:50.200> where<00:00:50.560> this<00:00:50.710> gives<00:00:51.010> us<00:00:51.160> just

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
then at what where this gives us just

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.450 
then at what where this gives us just
right<00:00:51.730> now<00:00:51.880> it's<00:00:52.120> it's<00:00:52.780> like<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.860> remember

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
right now it's it's like you remember

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.560 
right now it's it's like you remember
that<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:59.140> governing<00:00:59.890> equation<00:01:00.399> has<00:01:00.670> second

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
that the governing equation has second

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.170 
that the governing equation has second
derivatives<00:01:02.140> in<00:01:02.410> it<00:01:02.620> and<00:01:03.100> a<00:01:03.820> second

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
derivatives in it and a second

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.420 
derivatives in it and a second
derivative<00:01:04.689> is<00:01:04.960> simply<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.500> derivative<00:01:05.740> of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
derivative is simply the derivative of

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.750 
derivative is simply the derivative of
the<00:01:06.610> derivative<00:01:07.380> now<00:01:08.380> we<00:01:08.799> have<00:01:09.070> actually

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
the derivative now we have actually

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.430 
the derivative now we have actually
examined<00:01:10.479> this<00:01:10.960> part

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
examined this part

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.460 
examined this part
all<00:01:12.400> right<00:01:12.610> through<00:01:13.120> this<00:01:13.479> finite<00:01:13.960> difference

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
all right through this finite difference

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.280 
all right through this finite difference
approximation<00:01:15.330> what<00:01:16.330> we<00:01:16.479> want<00:01:16.690> to<00:01:16.780> do<00:01:16.900> is<00:01:17.080> take

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
approximation what we want to do is take

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.399 
approximation what we want to do is take
the<00:01:17.500> derivative<00:01:17.650> of<00:01:18.220> that<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.170> finite

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
the derivative of that so the finite

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.770 
the derivative of that so the finite
difference<00:01:20.740> is<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.159> way<00:01:21.430> of<00:01:21.640> getting<00:01:21.820> is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
difference is a way of getting is

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.950 
difference is a way of getting is
actually<00:01:23.290> figuring<00:01:23.619> out<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:24.070> derivative

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
actually figuring out the derivative

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.410 
actually figuring out the derivative
alright<00:01:25.960> and<00:01:26.229> and<00:01:26.799> actually<00:01:27.420> approximating

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
alright and and actually approximating

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.670 
alright and and actually approximating
what<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.750> is<00:01:29.340> using<00:01:30.340> a<00:01:30.430> series<00:01:30.790> of<00:01:30.850> steps

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
what that is using a series of steps

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.830 
what that is using a series of steps
that's<00:01:32.680> why<00:01:32.830> it's<00:01:32.979> called<00:01:33.130> discrete<00:01:33.840> discrete

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
that's why it's called discrete discrete

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.620 
that's why it's called discrete discrete
approximation<00:01:35.760> so<00:01:36.760> this<00:01:37.119> is<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.240> second

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
approximation so this is a second

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.399 
approximation so this is a second
derivative<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.200> get<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:41.320> may

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
derivative so to get that and you may

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.080 
derivative so to get that and you may
have<00:01:41.470> to<00:01:41.590> kind<00:01:41.830> of<00:01:41.860> take<00:01:42.040> a<00:01:42.070> look<00:01:42.250> at<00:01:42.430> it<00:01:42.790> back

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
have to kind of take a look at it back

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.730 
have to kind of take a look at it back
on<00:01:43.330> this<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:44.380> get<00:01:44.560> that<00:01:44.799> what<00:01:45.159> we<00:01:45.400> do<00:01:45.640> is<00:01:46.740> we

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
on this to get that what we do is we

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.499 
on this to get that what we do is we
take<00:01:48.070> what<00:01:48.490> we<00:01:48.520> did<00:01:48.820> in<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.090> forward

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
take what we did in the forward

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.370 
take what we did in the forward
direction<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:51.040> take<00:01:51.420> from<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:52.720> what<00:01:53.049> we<00:01:53.200> did

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
direction we take from that what we did

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.100 
direction we take from that what we did
in<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.680> backward<00:01:54.130> direction<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:54.970> we<00:01:55.720> divide

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
in the backward direction and we divide

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.580 
in the backward direction and we divide
it<00:01:56.140> by<00:01:56.350> Delta<00:01:56.979> X<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.869> Delta<00:01:59.590> X<00:01:59.909> then<00:02:01.290> gets<00:02:02.290> us

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
it by Delta X and Delta X then gets us

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.770 
it by Delta X and Delta X then gets us
back<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:04.570> actually<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.380> head<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:07.210> we<00:02:07.450> want

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
back to actually the head that we want

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.619 
back to actually the head that we want
at<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:08.530> particular<00:02:08.769> point<00:02:09.340> all<00:02:10.209> right<00:02:10.299> so<00:02:10.509> we

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
at this particular point all right so we

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.900 
at this particular point all right so we
step<00:02:10.899> out<00:02:11.079> we<00:02:11.439> step<00:02:11.680> back<00:02:11.920> we<00:02:11.950> subtract<00:02:12.640> those

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
step out we step back we subtract those

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.600 
step out we step back we subtract those
and<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.360> Delta<00:02:13.690> X<00:02:13.810> remember<00:02:14.140> is

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
and the Delta X remember is

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.340 
and the Delta X remember is
distance<00:02:14.970> between<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:17.550> lattice<00:02:17.940> points<00:02:18.360> and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
distance between the lattice points and

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.760 
distance between the lattice points and
that's<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.740> same<00:02:19.980> distance<00:02:20.490> that's<00:02:21.000> here<00:02:21.770> all

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
that's the same distance that's here all

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.850 
that's the same distance that's here all
right<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.960> an<00:02:25.170> approximation

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
right and this that is an approximation

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.990 
right and this that is an approximation
of<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.790> second<00:02:27.240> derivative<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.980> find<00:02:29.910> that

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
of the second derivative and find that

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.420 
of the second derivative and find that
difference<00:02:30.420> form<00:02:30.830> in<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.370> x-direction<00:02:37.430> so

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
difference form in the x-direction so

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.360 
difference form in the x-direction so
you<00:02:38.850> could<00:02:39.000> use<00:02:39.240> this<00:02:39.709> this<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:40.890> essentially

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
you could use this this is essentially

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.150 
you could use this this is essentially
what<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.940> did<00:02:42.300> when<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.230> did<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.890> kind<00:02:44.070> of

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
what you did when you did the kind of

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.990 
what you did when you did the kind of
the<00:02:44.280> iteration<00:02:44.790> exercise<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.070> column<00:02:47.520> all

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
the iteration exercise in the column all

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.060 
the iteration exercise in the column all
right<00:02:48.209> what<00:02:48.900> we're<00:02:49.020> going<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.170> do<00:02:49.380> here<00:02:49.920> is

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
right what we're going to do here is

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.479 
right what we're going to do here is
we're<00:02:50.340> going<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:51.020> actually<00:02:52.020> have<00:02:52.590> this

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
we're going to actually have this

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.610 
we're going to actually have this
iterate<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.450> come<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.810> solution<00:02:55.020> that

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
iterate and come to a solution that

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.820 
iterate and come to a solution that
solves<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:57.050> right<00:02:58.050> it's<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.230> very<00:02:58.440> simplified

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
solves this right it's a very simplified

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.120 
solves this right it's a very simplified
way<00:02:59.480> finite<00:03:00.480> element<00:03:00.900> methods<00:03:01.320> go<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.890> whole

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
way finite element methods go a whole

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.490 
way finite element methods go a whole
different<00:03:02.520> direction<00:03:02.640> all<00:03:03.480> right<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.930> he's<00:03:04.470> a

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
different direction all right and he's a

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.050 
different direction all right and he's a
whole<00:03:04.739> different<00:03:05.070> set<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.250> functions<00:03:05.790> that

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
whole different set of functions that

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.300 
whole different set of functions that
are<00:03:06.780> difficult<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.470> kind<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.709> show<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.100> way

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
are difficult to kind of show this way

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.190 
are difficult to kind of show this way
this<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:09.209> can<00:03:09.330> think<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:09.780> an<00:03:09.989> average

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
this you can think of it as an average

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.979 
this you can think of it as an average
averaging<00:03:11.130> technique<00:03:11.450> all<00:03:12.450> right<00:03:12.600> that's<00:03:12.810> all

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
averaging technique all right that's all

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.540 
averaging technique all right that's all
it<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:13.230> all<00:03:13.790> right<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.709> if<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.920> combine<00:03:17.100> terms

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
it is all right so if you combine terms

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.090 
it is all right so if you combine terms
if<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.000> take<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:19.140> notice<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.799> J

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
if you take this you notice that I J

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.600 
if you take this you notice that I J
appears<00:03:20.459> twice<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:21.810> get<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:23.250> pull

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
appears twice you get this and you pull

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.920 
appears twice you get this and you pull
the<00:03:24.120> X<00:03:25.430> into<00:03:26.430> here<00:03:26.730> all<00:03:27.299> right<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.600> combine

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
the X into here all right you combine

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.880 
the X into here all right you combine
those<00:03:28.080> terms<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.650> get<00:03:28.830> this<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.180> this

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
those terms you get this and so this

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.570 
those terms you get this and so this
solves<00:03:31.890> our<00:03:32.250> head<00:03:32.459> at<00:03:32.850> some<00:03:33.120> point<00:03:33.480> IJ<00:03:34.580> all

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
solves our head at some point IJ all

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.710 
solves our head at some point IJ all
right<00:03:37.160> basically<00:03:38.160> using<00:03:38.910> this<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.360> the

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
right basically using this and the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.860 
right basically using this and the
characteristic<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.470> this<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:40.890> this<00:03:41.730> -<00:03:42.060> h<00:03:42.390> IJ

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
characteristic of this is this - h IJ

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.729 
characteristic of this is this - h IJ
term<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:44.700> you're<00:03:45.390> solving<00:03:45.780> for<00:03:45.989> head<00:03:46.440> at<00:03:46.709> a

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
term so you're solving for head at a

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.479 
term so you're solving for head at a
point<00:03:47.420> but<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.720> head<00:03:48.989> is<00:03:49.110> also<00:03:49.650> in<00:03:50.100> the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
point but that head is also in the

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.720 
point but that head is also in the
equation<00:03:51.030> on<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.239> right<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.370> generally

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
equation on the right so this generally

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.979 
equation on the right so this generally
means<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.060> though<00:03:54.420> there<00:03:54.900> will<00:03:55.019> be<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:56.989> some

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
means that though there will be a some

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.210 
means that though there will be a some
kind<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.760> iteration<00:03:59.760> procedure<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:01.220> deal

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
kind of a iteration procedure to deal

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.720 
kind of a iteration procedure to deal
with<00:04:02.400> it

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
with it

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.970 
with it
remember<00:04:03.090> you've<00:04:03.299> had<00:04:03.480> probably<00:04:04.140> equations

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
remember you've had probably equations

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.070 
remember you've had probably equations
with<00:04:05.250> unknowns<00:04:05.760> on<00:04:06.030> both<00:04:06.209> sides<00:04:06.480> or<00:04:06.780> something

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
with unknowns on both sides or something

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.940 
with unknowns on both sides or something
that's<00:04:07.260> an<00:04:07.410> example<00:04:07.739> of<00:04:07.950> here<00:04:09.560> all<00:04:10.560> right<00:04:10.709> so

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
that's an example of here all right so

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.280 
that's an example of here all right so
this<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:12.000> equate<00:04:12.269> this<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.810> equation

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
this is the equate this is the equation

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.630 
this is the equate this is the equation
for<00:04:13.320> a<00:04:13.709> single<00:04:14.280> row<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:16.040> assuming<00:04:17.040> you<00:04:17.160> know<00:04:17.340> X

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
for a single row and assuming you know X

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.380 
for a single row and assuming you know X
and<00:04:18.120> if<00:04:18.329> you<00:04:18.479> know<00:04:18.690> this<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:20.060> you've<00:04:21.060> known

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
and if you know this and you've known

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.810 
and if you know this and you've known
this<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:22.019> we'll<00:04:22.260> show<00:04:22.470> why<00:04:22.890> this<00:04:22.950> works<00:04:23.460> in<00:04:23.729> a

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
this and we'll show why this works in a

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.740 
this and we'll show why this works in a
second<00:04:25.039> okay<00:04:26.039> so<00:04:26.400> I<00:04:26.430> think<00:04:26.669> pretty<00:04:27.030> easy<00:04:27.330> so

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
second okay so I think pretty easy so

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.040 
second okay so I think pretty easy so
far

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
far

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.260 
far
and<00:04:28.500> when<00:04:28.889> you<00:04:29.009> see<00:04:29.190> how<00:04:29.310> this<00:04:29.430> works<00:04:29.669> it<00:04:30.000> will

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
and when you see how this works it will

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.990 
and when you see how this works it will
be<00:04:30.330> amazed<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.080> it<00:04:31.259> actually<00:04:31.560> does<00:04:31.770> work<00:04:32.000> now

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
be amazed that it actually does work now

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.900 
be amazed that it actually does work now
if<00:04:33.300> we<00:04:33.389> want<00:04:33.599> to<00:04:33.720> do<00:04:33.840> J<00:04:34.349> or<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.310> y-direction

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
if we want to do J or the y-direction

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.510 
if we want to do J or the y-direction
and<00:04:36.690> these<00:04:37.319> are<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.530> columns<00:04:37.979> then<00:04:38.220> we<00:04:38.370> would

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
and these are the columns then we would

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.360 
and these are the columns then we would
go<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:39.810> other<00:04:39.840> way<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:40.229> we<00:04:40.620> would<00:04:40.830> have<00:04:41.009> a<00:04:41.039> cut

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
go the other way so we would have a cut

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.620 
go the other way so we would have a cut
out<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.669> something<00:04:41.880> that<00:04:42.000> went<00:04:42.240> close<00:04:42.449> like

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
out of something that went close like

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.540 
out of something that went close like
this

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
this

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.719 
this
all<00:04:44.550> right<00:04:44.729> and<00:04:45.979> the<00:04:46.979> same<00:04:47.160> kind<00:04:47.430> of<00:04:47.460> deal<00:04:47.610> I

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
all right and the same kind of deal I

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.150 
all right and the same kind of deal I
just<00:04:47.910> skip<00:04:48.090> this<00:04:48.240> step<00:04:48.449> and<00:04:49.139> this<00:04:49.349> solver<00:04:49.919> had

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
just skip this step and this solver had

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
just skip this step and this solver had
a<00:04:50.190> log<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.610> single<00:04:50.880> call<00:04:52.639> now<00:04:53.639> we're<00:04:53.970> still

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
a log of single call now we're still

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.689 
a log of single call now we're still
dealing<00:04:54.360> with<00:04:54.660> one<00:04:54.900> dimensions<00:04:55.410> here<00:04:55.710> all

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
dealing with one dimensions here all

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.210 
dealing with one dimensions here all
right<00:04:56.819> one<00:04:57.060> dimension<00:04:57.509> here<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:58.190> Mitch

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
right one dimension here and Mitch

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.089 
right one dimension here and Mitch
you'll<00:04:59.759> notice<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.449> what<00:05:01.259> we've<00:05:01.470> done<00:05:01.710> here

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
you'll notice that what we've done here

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.460 
you'll notice that what we've done here
is<00:05:02.460> we've<00:05:02.759> said<00:05:03.240> you<00:05:03.930> know<00:05:04.099> head<00:05:05.099> here<00:05:05.940> is

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
is we've said you know head here is

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.939 
is we've said you know head here is
that's<00:05:07.470> minus<00:05:08.130> this<00:05:08.400> is<00:05:08.520> plus<00:05:08.819> and<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:10.500> reason

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
that's minus this is plus and the reason

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.620 
that's minus this is plus and the reason
that<00:05:11.099> we<00:05:11.280> do<00:05:11.460> it<00:05:11.490> this<00:05:11.729> way<00:05:11.970> is<00:05:12.300> because<00:05:14.630> the

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
that we do it this way is because the

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.990 
that we do it this way is because the
sweeping<00:05:16.380> arrangement<00:05:17.069> that<00:05:17.220> we<00:05:17.370> use<00:05:17.610> when<00:05:17.880> we

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
sweeping arrangement that we use when we

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.140 
sweeping arrangement that we use when we
solve<00:05:18.330> these<00:05:18.569> goes<00:05:19.460> like<00:05:20.460> this<00:05:21.949> so<00:05:22.949> this<00:05:23.880> one

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
solve these goes like this so this one

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.240 
solve these goes like this so this one
is<00:05:24.300> always<00:05:24.509> the<00:05:24.840> head<00:05:25.020> that<00:05:25.199> we<00:05:25.349> know<00:05:25.590> this<00:05:26.130> is

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
is always the head that we know this is

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.550 
is always the head that we know this is
the<00:05:26.370> head<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:26.699> we<00:05:26.789> don't<00:05:27.000> know<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:27.750> so<00:05:28.110> it

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
the head that we don't know and so it

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.950 
the head that we don't know and so it
means<00:05:29.280> this<00:05:29.610> need<00:05:29.880> to<00:05:29.909> be<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.240> old<00:05:30.419> days<00:05:30.659> these

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
means this need to be the old days these

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.560 
means this need to be the old days these
need<00:05:31.169> to<00:05:31.199> be<00:05:31.289> Danube<00:05:31.710> so<00:05:32.039> the<00:05:32.190> minus<00:05:32.849> ones<00:05:33.360> are

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
need to be Danube so the minus ones are

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.420 
need to be Danube so the minus ones are
back<00:05:33.719> on<00:05:33.960> this<00:05:34.080> side<00:05:34.289> it's<00:05:35.009> just<00:05:35.159> a<00:05:35.250> convention

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
back on this side it's just a convention

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.140 
back on this side it's just a convention
to<00:05:35.880> kind<00:05:36.090> of<00:05:36.120> keep<00:05:36.270> us<00:05:37.520> kind<00:05:38.520> of<00:05:38.580> saying<00:05:38.880> I

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
to kind of keep us kind of saying I

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.749 
to kind of keep us kind of saying I
guess<00:05:39.330> all<00:05:39.960> right<00:05:40.080> so<00:05:40.320> we've<00:05:40.889> got<00:05:40.919> two

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
guess all right so we've got two

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.969 
guess all right so we've got two
equations<00:05:42.479> both<00:05:43.039> one-dimensional<00:05:44.039> in<00:05:44.219> form

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
equations both one-dimensional in form

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.649 
equations both one-dimensional in form
if<00:05:46.979> we<00:05:47.310> want<00:05:47.580> to<00:05:47.789> do<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.389> Laplace<00:05:48.630> equation

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
if we want to do the Laplace equation

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.950 
if we want to do the Laplace equation
then<00:05:49.409> if<00:05:49.530> we<00:05:49.740> combine<00:05:50.130> those<00:05:50.370> two<00:05:50.639> and<00:05:51.150> because

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
then if we combine those two and because

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.689 
then if we combine those two and because
we<00:05:52.110> know<00:05:52.289> that<00:05:52.320> it<00:05:52.650> stays<00:05:52.860> safe<00:05:53.159> we<00:05:53.340> set<00:05:53.550> those

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
we know that it stays safe we set those

00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:04.279 
we know that it stays safe we set those
zero<00:05:57.110> okay<00:05:58.639> so<00:06:01.880> this<00:06:02.880> is<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.780> equation<00:06:04.259> that

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
zero okay so this is the equation that

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.980 
zero okay so this is the equation that
you'll<00:06:04.590> get<00:06:04.770> to<00:06:04.919> know<00:06:04.949> and<00:06:05.400> look<00:06:05.639> this<00:06:06.630> is<00:06:06.780> what

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
you'll get to know and look this is what

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.950 
you'll get to know and look this is what
we'll<00:06:07.199> do<00:06:07.440> in<00:06:08.210> we'll<00:06:09.210> work<00:06:09.389> with<00:06:09.539> this<00:06:09.750> on

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
we'll do in we'll work with this on

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.580 
we'll do in we'll work with this on
Friday<00:06:10.440> doing<00:06:11.250> a<00:06:11.340> spreadsheet<00:06:11.610> model<00:06:12.590> it's

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
Friday doing a spreadsheet model it's

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.390 
Friday doing a spreadsheet model it's
actually<00:06:13.740> in<00:06:14.039> your<00:06:14.159> book<00:06:14.370> now<00:06:16.219> everybody<00:06:17.219> see

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
actually in your book now everybody see

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.820 
actually in your book now everybody see
how<00:06:17.430> we<00:06:17.930> help<00:06:18.930> what<00:06:19.110> we<00:06:19.229> just<00:06:19.380> did

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
how we help what we just did

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.520 
how we help what we just did
we<00:06:20.550> took<00:06:20.729> the<00:06:20.880> X<00:06:21.090> in<00:06:21.479> the<00:06:21.719> Y<00:06:21.870> direction<00:06:22.380> if<00:06:22.500> we

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
we took the X in the Y direction if we

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.959 
we took the X in the Y direction if we
combine<00:06:22.979> them<00:06:23.159> and<00:06:24.620> this<00:06:25.620> is<00:06:25.889> this<00:06:26.099> term<00:06:26.400> this

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969 
combine them and this is this term this

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.350 
combine them and this is this term this
is<00:06:27.210> this<00:06:27.419> term<00:06:27.750> and<00:06:28.080> so<00:06:28.919> so<00:06:29.610> what<00:06:29.819> you<00:06:29.940> see<00:06:30.120> here

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
is this term and so so what you see here

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.600 
is this term and so so what you see here
is<00:06:30.569> an<00:06:30.780> algebraic<00:06:31.440> equation<00:06:32.930> that<00:06:33.930> solves<00:06:34.740> the

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
is an algebraic equation that solves the

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.219 
is an algebraic equation that solves the
differential<00:06:36.180> equation<00:06:36.810> that's<00:06:36.960> here

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
differential equation that's here

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.589 
differential equation that's here
remember<00:06:38.190> we<00:06:38.310> said<00:06:38.520> you<00:06:38.940> know<00:06:38.969> the<00:06:39.330> part<00:06:39.539> of

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
remember we said you know the part of

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.450 
remember we said you know the part of
the<00:06:39.659> game<00:06:39.779> is<00:06:40.080> to<00:06:40.320> solve<00:06:40.650> the<00:06:41.099> out

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
the game is to solve the out

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.219 
the game is to solve the out
I<00:06:41.520> solve<00:06:41.970> the<00:06:42.090> differential<00:06:42.419> equation<00:06:42.900> using

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229 
I solve the differential equation using

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.850 
I solve the differential equation using
algebra<00:06:43.710> but<00:06:44.430> we<00:06:44.550> just<00:06:44.729> did<00:06:45.000> and<00:06:45.270> this<00:06:45.539> is<00:06:45.860> the

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
algebra but we just did and this is the

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.200 
algebra but we just did and this is the
technique<00:06:47.100> we<00:06:47.400> used<00:06:47.639> is<00:06:47.789> just<00:06:48.000> funny

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
technique we used is just funny

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:55.640 
technique we used is just funny
differences<00:06:53.389> no<00:06:54.389> I<00:06:54.660> you<00:06:55.050> know<00:06:55.139> I<00:06:55.169> do<00:06:55.289> close

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
differences no I you know I do close

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.249 
differences no I you know I do close
these<00:06:55.860> up<00:06:56.099> on<00:06:56.220> the<00:06:56.250> web<00:06:56.490> so<00:06:56.819> if<00:06:56.910> you<00:06:57.000> don't<00:06:57.259> want

00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 
these up on the web so if you don't want

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:03.040 
these up on the web so if you don't want
to<00:06:58.410> write<00:06:58.590> them<00:06:58.770> down

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.480 

Aran's<00:07:04.050> are<00:07:04.199> doesn't<00:07:04.530> know<00:07:04.650> this<00:07:05.240> okay<00:07:07.490> so

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
Aran's are doesn't know this okay so

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.760 
Aran's are doesn't know this okay so
we've<00:07:08.669> got<00:07:08.699> that<00:07:08.910> now<00:07:09.509> what<00:07:09.810> we<00:07:09.840> need<00:07:10.139> to<00:07:10.229> do<00:07:10.410> is

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
we've got that now what we need to do is

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.830 
we've got that now what we need to do is
to<00:07:11.280> combine<00:07:11.580> terms<00:07:13.759> all<00:07:14.759> right<00:07:15.030> and<00:07:15.270> we<00:07:15.509> can<00:07:15.660> do

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
to combine terms all right and we can do

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.360 
to combine terms all right and we can do
that<00:07:16.080> because<00:07:17.060> the<00:07:18.590> hij<00:07:19.590> appears<00:07:19.949> in<00:07:20.130> both

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
that because the hij appears in both

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:27.100 
that because the hij appears in both
sides<00:07:21.919> and<00:07:22.919> so<00:07:23.490> this<00:07:23.910> means<00:07:24.539> that<00:07:25.639> these<00:07:26.639> four

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
sides and so this means that these four

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:32.390 
sides and so this means that these four
-<00:07:28.110> they<00:07:28.830> have<00:07:29.539> that<00:07:30.539> we're<00:07:30.720> looking<00:07:30.840> for<00:07:31.400> is

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 
- they have that we're looking for is

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.520 
- they have that we're looking for is
equal<00:07:32.789> to<00:07:32.880> zero<00:07:33.210> and<00:07:34.199> then<00:07:35.750> we<00:07:36.750> can<00:07:36.960> solve<00:07:37.320> for

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:37.530 
equal to zero and then we can solve for

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.980 
equal to zero and then we can solve for
that<00:07:37.830> head<00:07:38.599> and<00:07:40.039> this<00:07:41.039> is<00:07:41.280> the<00:07:41.430> kicker

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:41.990 
that head and this is the kicker

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:50.590 
that head and this is the kicker
so<00:07:42.990> what<00:07:43.409> this

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:50.600 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.660
