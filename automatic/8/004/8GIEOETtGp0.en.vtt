you play at eSports talking about that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.870 
you play at eSports talking about that
as<00:01:21.720> well<00:01:21.930> how<00:01:22.439> competitive<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
as well how competitive is that you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.100 
as well how competitive is that you
think<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.240> comparison<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.840> world<00:01:24.990> of

think in comparison to the world of

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.370 
think in comparison to the world of
competitive<00:01:25.320> sport<00:01:26.060> I<00:01:27.060> think<00:01:27.330> most<00:01:27.960> sport

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
competitive sport I think most sport

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.039 
competitive sport I think most sport
games<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:30.290> mean<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:32.009> terms<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.460> eSports<00:01:33.049> ones

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
games I mean in terms of eSports ones

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.749 
games I mean in terms of eSports ones
they're<00:01:34.229> taken<00:01:34.530> seriously<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.159> lie<00:01:35.340> league<00:01:35.549> of

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
they're taken seriously a lie league of

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.510 
they're taken seriously a lie league of
legends<00:01:36.150> or<00:01:36.390> counter-strike<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.560> something

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
legends or counter-strike or something

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.580 
legends or counter-strike or something
that<00:01:38.729> requires<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.329> lot<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.630> kind<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.900> strategic

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that requires a lot of kind of strategic

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.999 
that requires a lot of kind of strategic
skill<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.220> teamwork<00:01:41.840> I<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
skill and teamwork I think that the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.679 
skill and teamwork I think that the
sports<00:01:44.250> games<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:45.030> those<00:01:45.149> elements<00:01:45.570> in

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
sports games can have those elements in

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.240 
sports games can have those elements in
them<00:01:45.840> by<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.380> standing<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:46.770> taking<00:01:47.040> it
