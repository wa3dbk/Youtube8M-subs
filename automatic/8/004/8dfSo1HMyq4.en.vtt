00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.990
 hey hello everyone my dear friends 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.750
 with you as always christopher and actually 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.969
 this is a rubric called what to build 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.090
 on the server today we will build 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.850
 the balloon is simple enough and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.230
 at the same time very beautiful i did 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.630
 here is such a thing 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.939
 it's kind of like a rope that will 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.840
 keep our balloon your not 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.030
 flew away so well here we need to do 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.370
 such an interesting thing now all 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.910
 orienting so that this is all good 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 your forehead so yes we need to do 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.460
 platforochka that is how else would 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.399
 make put a pair of auxiliary 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.780
 blocks like this and we need to do both 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.289
 frame only it will be with us approximately 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.110
 come on 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.780
 yes he will we have stairs 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.510
 so we put one block over here 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.390
 to start putting these steps 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.689
 and below we will have a solid block 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.650
 here so actually this thing will be 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.040
 come here with us here is one of the corners and 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.700
 here we will go all the steps 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.259
 checks along the contour so inverted 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.450
 then below we put a half block 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.770
 and on the sides ie in the corners in other 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.220
 countries we also do here such 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.490
 things will hang on them 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.070
 Now I will say that the stone fence here 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.030
 so it can be regarded as 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.240
 weighting 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:44.880
 but you can simply regard it as a decor 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:47.360
 so what we have further propose 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.360
 to make 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.729
 so let's raise we are here by seven 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.390
 blocks two times three 4 5 six 7 s 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.430
 the rest of the parties will also do though 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.830
 possible in principle 6 but not fundamentally 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:10.900
 then itâ€™s important to understand why I'll show you 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:15.170
 hop hop 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:18.170
 Excellent student and then we mean 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.590
 white wool goes find the last two 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.000
 block name of the mind fence and top 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.130
 set of two blocks on each side 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.360
 wool means here you can bring one 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.810
 wool and put here now hob 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.250
 crow like that and why am I saying that 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.769
 here you can make 7 blocks 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.450
 that is, if you made 7 blocks then 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.310
 Of course, these would be higher 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.310
 slightly and here it would be possible 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.820
 put two blocks of wool like that 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.370
 and the bottom below is a funnel but I 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.590
 like in principle and so mean further 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.519
 we do 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.550
 that's such a thing on the contour and on top yet 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.000
 we put the same layer like this 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.370
 looks like 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.239
 then on the sides we still put one by one 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.900
 block and top 3 more 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:15.890
 This is our construction 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.680
 spherical put the green part here 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.400
 here we understand that we put 3 in total 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.730
 block like this and connect with us remains 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.459
 into such a space in one block between 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:33.349
 green and white wool so and so 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:37.310
 An excellent student means further we put here one 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:41.200
 block and here we do like this 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.299
 bezel to put in the middle 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.280
 glowing pebble and top hatch by the way 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.280
 hatches can still be put right here and 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.629
 do exactly the same here my own 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.280
 from other sides 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:03.980
 ap ap ap and by the way below we will also put 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.920
 two blocks of the same wool by the way 6 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.250
 You can take what you do not like 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.989
 fundamentally important so yes we let's 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:18.540
 So quickly we will finish it this way 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:21.750
 so here we put a pebble 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:29.280
 hatch do not forget about the hatch floor that 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:36.860
 new good again finish here 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:41.490
 and go to the tip itself so 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.440
 so this is not put anything mean 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.150
 on top of us too everything is pretty 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.150
 just let's do it for now 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.400
 let's see what happens 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.160
 principle can do enough here 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.270
 easy to put three blocks here 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:05.910
 even so so so easy to do and here 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:08.880
 cross here because it looks super 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.740
 as one option you can do another 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:19.820
 so here it will be more elongated 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:22.770
 insert and here is the end well 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.090
 255 Height yes here already blocks are not 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.710
 put here can only be put 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.630
 some water at the last height 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.220
 Now I will demonstrate it to you as 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.580
 how to do everything so that she does not 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.580
 flowed away 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.970
 hop hop but didn't have time okay she 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.210
 will run away 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:46.620
 in general, then who did not know put a finger 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:49.080
 up and we'll do it back like this 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.980
 cross the way you can still pour and 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.410
 low 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.320
 oh well, actually this is how it is 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.050
 it looks quite cozy you can still 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:02.370
 do one thing that is right here 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.620
 put a padva fence and one 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.590
 stone fence on all sides so 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.360
 also give some 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:15.320
 beauty then there are even more details 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:17.060
 decor like that yes she is so far all 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.850
 christopher was with you 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.820
 do not forget to put Lois if of course 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.300
 did you like it and thanks as always 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.300
 for watching 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.860
 cube
