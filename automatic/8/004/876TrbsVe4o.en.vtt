00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
of it taking the cube out the first

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.330 
of it taking the cube out the first
thing<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.289> noticed<00:00:22.590> was<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.890> corner<00:00:23.160> cap

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
thing I noticed was that a corner cap

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.830 
thing I noticed was that a corner cap
was<00:00:23.519> missing<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.029> had<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.269> look<00:00:24.390> back<00:00:24.630> into

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
was missing so I had to look back into

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.929 
was missing so I had to look back into
the<00:00:24.990> package<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.650> see<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.400> piece<00:00:26.580> was<00:00:26.789> in

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
the package to see if the piece was in

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.210 
the package to see if the piece was in
there<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.390> actually<00:00:27.750> wasn't<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.949> piece

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
there it actually wasn't the piece

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.980 
there it actually wasn't the piece
actually<00:00:29.670> got<00:00:29.789> wedged<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.269> top<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.840> another

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
actually got wedged on top of another

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.330 
actually got wedged on top of another
corner<00:00:31.380> but<00:00:31.529> putting<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.859> back<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.099> was<00:00:32.219> pretty

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
corner but putting it back in was pretty

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.770 
corner but putting it back in was pretty
straightforward<00:00:32.669> there<00:00:33.030> are<00:00:33.120> three<00:00:33.329> holes<00:00:33.540> on

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
straightforward there are three holes on

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.420 
straightforward there are three holes on
the<00:00:33.870> corner<00:00:34.110> piece<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.559> there<00:00:35.070> are<00:00:35.190> three

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
the corner piece and there are three

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.370 
the corner piece and there are three
pegs<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> cap<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:36.780> go<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.260> you

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
pegs on the cap so they go in as you

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.139 
pegs on the cap so they go in as you
would<00:00:37.500> assume<00:00:37.710> first<00:00:38.280> turns<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.969> puzzle

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
would assume first turns on this puzzle

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.229 
would assume first turns on this puzzle
it<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.840> actually<00:00:40.440> kind<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.710> squeaky<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.250> it

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
it is actually kind of squeaky and it

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.150 
it is actually kind of squeaky and it
feels<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.780> dry<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.440> very<00:00:43.620> very<00:00:43.890> fast

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
feels really dry but it's very very fast

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.340 
feels really dry but it's very very fast
it's<00:00:44.670> kind<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.180> smoothed<00:00:45.480> although<00:00:46.020> pretty

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
it's kind of smoothed although pretty

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.830 
it's kind of smoothed although pretty
crispy<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.579> very<00:00:47.820> easy<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.180> control<00:00:48.450> I

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
crispy and it's very easy to control I

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.540 
crispy and it's very easy to control I
really<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.469> all<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> turns<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.430> M

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
really like all of the turns the M

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.580 
really like all of the turns the M
slices<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> outer<00:00:51.270> layers<00:00:51.539> everything<00:00:52.440> just

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
slices the outer layers everything just

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.250 
slices the outer layers everything just
works<00:00:52.890> very<00:00:53.280> very<00:00:53.399> well<00:00:53.820> as<00:00:54.449> far<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.870> stickers

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
works very very well as far as stickers

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.139 
works very very well as far as stickers
go<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:55.739> all<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.100> very<00:00:56.280> good<00:00:56.430> contrast<00:00:56.789> I

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
go they all have very good contrast I

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.209 
go they all have very good contrast I
think<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.870> me<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.320> red<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.739> orange<00:00:58.770> were

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
think for me the red and the orange were

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.459 
think for me the red and the orange were
pretty<00:00:59.550> similar<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.480> used<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.809> bright<00:01:01.109> orange

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
pretty similar I'm used to bright orange

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.900 
pretty similar I'm used to bright orange
but<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.680> do<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:01.949> Dan<00:01:02.280> likes<00:01:02.550> regular

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
but I do know that Dan likes regular

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.160 
but I do know that Dan likes regular
orange<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.870> personal

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
orange so it is just a personal

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.359 
orange so it is just a personal
preference<00:01:04.409> thing<00:01:04.650> overall<00:01:05.189> though<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
preference thing overall though the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.859 
preference thing overall though the
stickers<00:01:05.820> are<00:01:06.030> really<00:01:06.299> nice<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.600> he<00:01:06.689> did<00:01:06.840> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
stickers are really nice and he did a

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.270 
stickers are really nice and he did a
really<00:01:07.020> good<00:01:07.200> job<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.500> putting<00:01:07.770> them<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.070> there

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
really good job of putting them on there

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.640 
really good job of putting them on there
popping<00:01:08.939> out<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.210> pieces<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.350> see<00:01:10.530> that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
popping out the pieces we can see that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.890 
popping out the pieces we can see that
it<00:01:10.830> has<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.040> red<00:01:11.400> core<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.420> course<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it has a red core this of course is the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.469 
it has a red core this of course is the
prototype<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.619> he<00:01:14.040> had<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.850> think<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
prototype that he had so I think the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.940 
prototype that he had so I think the
mass-produced<00:01:16.110> version<00:01:16.409> actually<00:01:16.560> has<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
mass-produced version actually has a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.469 
mass-produced version actually has a
blue<00:01:17.159> core<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.700> do<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> mass-produced

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
blue core and I do have a mass-produced

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.929 
blue core and I do have a mass-produced
version<00:01:19.110> coming<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.860> will<00:01:20.490> make<00:01:20.759> sure<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
version coming so I will make sure to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.700 
version coming so I will make sure to
check<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.780> also<00:01:22.290> see<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.619> are

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
check on that and also see if there are

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.770 
check on that and also see if there are
any<00:01:22.860> other<00:01:22.979> differences<00:01:23.490> as<00:01:24.420> far<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
any other differences as far as the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.210 
any other differences as far as the
pieces<00:01:25.080> go<00:01:25.229> they're<00:01:25.439> pretty<00:01:25.650> straightforward

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
pieces go they're pretty straightforward

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.640 
pieces go they're pretty straightforward
the<00:01:26.310> edge<00:01:26.460> actually<00:01:26.790> looks<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.659> lot<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.229> older

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the edge actually looks a lot like older

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.950 
the edge actually looks a lot like older
cubes<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.280> very<00:01:29.490> blocky<00:01:29.820> while<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> corner

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
cubes it's very blocky while the corner

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.270 
cubes it's very blocky while the corner
actually<00:01:31.079> looks<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.500> lot<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.920> Witt<00:01:32.070> long

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
actually looks a lot like the Witt long

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.520 
actually looks a lot like the Witt long
corner<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.850> actually<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> think<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:34.110> because

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
corner and actually I think it's because

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.090 
corner and actually I think it's because
the<00:01:34.770> same<00:01:35.040> person<00:01:35.549> designed<00:01:35.970> both<00:01:36.329> cubes<00:01:37.100> what

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the same person designed both cubes what

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.380 
the same person designed both cubes what
you're<00:01:38.189> watching<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.579> now<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.909> they<00:01:39.060> sub<00:01:39.240> 12

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
you're watching right now is they sub 12

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.749 
you're watching right now is they sub 12
average<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.869> 5<00:01:40.079> which<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.590> really<00:01:41.009> impressive

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
average of 5 which is really impressive

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.850 
average of 5 which is really impressive
to<00:01:42.060> me<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.689> even<00:01:43.380> though<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:43.680> not

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
to me because even though it's not

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.560 
to me because even though it's not
really<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> average<00:01:44.939> considering<00:01:45.450> this

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
really what I average considering this

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.539 
really what I average considering this
is<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> cube<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.229> got<00:01:46.470> out<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.159> package

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
is a cube I just got out of the package

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.969 
is a cube I just got out of the package
I'm<00:01:47.759> getting<00:01:48.450> pretty<00:01:48.869> decent<00:01:49.350> times<00:01:49.560> I've

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
I'm getting pretty decent times I've

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.130 
I'm getting pretty decent times I've
gotten<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.549> 8<00:01:50.880> secconds<00:01:51.299> solves<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.750> one<00:01:51.930> 7

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
gotten to 8 secconds solves and one 7

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.719 
gotten to 8 secconds solves and one 7
second<00:01:52.530> solve<00:01:52.680> all<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.950> them<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.369> which<00:01:53.549> were

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
second solve all of them of which were

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.520 
second solve all of them of which were
full<00:01:53.939> step<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.930> incredible

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
full step it's just incredible

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.200 
full step it's just incredible
now<00:01:55.829> if<00:01:55.950> you've<00:01:56.070> actually<00:01:56.280> watched<00:01:56.700> my<00:01:56.880> videos

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
now if you've actually watched my videos

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.819 
now if you've actually watched my videos
for<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.450> while<00:01:57.509> now<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.290> usually

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
for a while now you know that usually

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.130 
for a while now you know that usually
I'm<00:01:58.979> pretty<00:01:59.040> harsh<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.060> cubes<00:02:00.420> especially<00:02:00.960> for

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
I'm pretty harsh on cubes especially for

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.139 
I'm pretty harsh on cubes especially for
first<00:02:01.320> impressions<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:02.460> takes<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.909> lot<00:02:03.119> to

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
first impressions it takes a lot to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.289 
first impressions it takes a lot to
impress<00:02:03.420> me<00:02:03.840> but<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.710> will<00:02:05.070> say<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.520> out<00:02:06.149> of

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
impress me but I will say this out of

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.300 
impress me but I will say this out of
the<00:02:06.509> package<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:07.049> actually<00:02:07.350> considered<00:02:08.009> making

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the package I actually considered making

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.669 
the package I actually considered making
this<00:02:08.429> cube<00:02:08.670> my<00:02:08.819> main<00:02:09.060> right<00:02:09.660> away<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.140> right

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
this cube my main right away and right

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.750 
this cube my main right away and right
now<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:10.979> still<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.190> huge<00:02:11.459> consideration

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
now it's still a huge consideration

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.020 
now it's still a huge consideration
obviously<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.569> have<00:02:12.720> to

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
obviously I have to

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.910 
obviously I have to
play<00:02:13.150> with<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.420> more<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:14.200> will<00:02:14.290> eventually

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
play with it more and I will eventually

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.770 
play with it more and I will eventually
do<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.069> review<00:02:15.459> but<00:02:16.060> still<00:02:16.300> for<00:02:16.540> first

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
do a review but still for first

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.050 
do a review but still for first
impressions<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.560> could<00:02:18.250> not<00:02:18.400> be<00:02:18.580> happier<00:02:19.030> with

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
impressions I could not be happier with

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.000 
impressions I could not be happier with
this<00:02:19.330> puzzle<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.810> think<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.319> perfect<00:02:20.590> fit

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
this puzzle I think it is a perfect fit

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.670 
this puzzle I think it is a perfect fit
for<00:02:21.040> my<00:02:21.310> turn<00:02:21.550> style<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.209> I<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.230> really

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
for my turn style and I just really

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.590 
for my turn style and I just really
really<00:02:23.920> like<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.250> cube<00:02:24.490> now<00:02:25.120> as<00:02:25.240> far<00:02:25.420> as<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
really like the cube now as far as the

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.910 
really like the cube now as far as the
sound<00:02:25.750> goes<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.020> lot<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.350> people<00:02:26.560> don't<00:02:26.740> like

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
sound goes a lot of people don't like

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.530 
sound goes a lot of people don't like
loud<00:02:27.100> cubes<00:02:27.520> or<00:02:27.730> they<00:02:27.910> don't<00:02:28.090> like<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.330> sound

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
loud cubes or they don't like the sound

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.880 
loud cubes or they don't like the sound
of<00:02:28.600> this<00:02:28.780> cube<00:02:29.050> sound<00:02:29.470> doesn't<00:02:29.650> actually

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
of this cube sound doesn't actually

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.110 
of this cube sound doesn't actually
bother<00:02:30.220> me<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.520> much<00:02:30.700> since<00:02:31.000> I've

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
bother me that much since I've

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.000 
bother me that much since I've
headphones<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.660> anyway<00:02:31.959> when<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.140> cube<00:02:32.470> this

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
headphones on anyway when I cube this

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.500 
headphones on anyway when I cube this
cube<00:02:33.250> is<00:02:33.400> pretty<00:02:33.670> loud<00:02:33.850> but<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.180> really

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
cube is pretty loud but it really

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.180 
cube is pretty loud but it really
doesn't<00:02:34.900> bother<00:02:35.110> me<00:02:35.260> overall<00:02:35.920> first

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
doesn't bother me overall first

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.350 
doesn't bother me overall first
impressions<00:02:36.670> if<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:36.880> couldn't<00:02:37.180> tell<00:02:37.300> already

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
impressions if you couldn't tell already

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.650 
impressions if you couldn't tell already
I<00:02:37.900> absolutely<00:02:38.590> loved<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.520> cube<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.180> I

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
I absolutely loved this cube and I

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.090 
I absolutely loved this cube and I
expect<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:40.959> get<00:02:41.110> really<00:02:41.350> good<00:02:41.500> times<00:02:41.739> on<00:02:41.950> it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
expect to get really good times on it

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.190 
expect to get really good times on it
I'm<00:02:42.730> not<00:02:43.000> really<00:02:43.180> sure<00:02:43.450> yet<00:02:43.690> if<00:02:43.720> I'm<00:02:43.930> gonna<00:02:44.050> be

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
I'm not really sure yet if I'm gonna be

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.199 
I'm not really sure yet if I'm gonna be
using<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:44.530> at<00:02:44.770> Worlds<00:02:45.250> but<00:02:45.610> there's<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.030> really

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
using it at Worlds but there's a really

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.460 
using it at Worlds but there's a really
good<00:02:46.420> chance<00:02:46.600> that<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:46.840> will<00:02:46.900> but<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.320> course

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
good chance that I will but of course

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.930 
good chance that I will but of course
this<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.709> still<00:02:47.920> first<00:02:48.220> impression<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:48.730> I

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
this is still first impression so I

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.310 
this is still first impression so I
don't<00:02:49.180> want<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.360> hype<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.600> up<00:02:49.720> too<00:02:49.900> much

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
don't want to hype it up too much

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.990 
don't want to hype it up too much
aside<00:02:51.010> from<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:51.220> just<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.610> couple<00:02:51.700> notes

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
aside from that just a couple notes

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.160 
aside from that just a couple notes
about<00:02:52.120> what<00:02:52.420> I'm<00:02:52.510> going<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.720> be<00:02:52.780> doing<00:02:52.930> with

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
about what I'm going to be doing with

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.050 
about what I'm going to be doing with
this<00:02:53.590> cube<00:02:53.920> obviously<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.760> guys<00:02:54.880> are

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
this cube obviously you guys are

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.400 
this cube obviously you guys are
expecting<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.690> review<00:02:56.019> but<00:02:56.170> I'm<00:02:56.260> also

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
expecting a review but I'm also

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.900 
expecting a review but I'm also
expecting<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.980> mass<00:02:57.130> produced<00:02:57.459> version<00:02:57.640> of

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
expecting a mass produced version of

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.640 
expecting a mass produced version of
this<00:02:58.060> puzzle<00:02:58.269> which<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.690> think<00:02:58.959> has<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.319> couple

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
this puzzle which I think has a couple

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.410 
this puzzle which I think has a couple
changes<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.550> what<00:03:00.670> I'm<00:03:00.760> actually<00:03:00.940> going<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.269> do

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
changes so what I'm actually going to do

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.090 
changes so what I'm actually going to do
I<00:03:01.450> think<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:01.989> second<00:03:02.470> impressions<00:03:02.830> video

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
I think is a second impressions video

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.550 
I think is a second impressions video
with<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.700> prototype<00:03:04.150> cube<00:03:04.630> explaining<00:03:05.470> the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
with this prototype cube explaining the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.380 
with this prototype cube explaining the
things<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:05.890> I<00:03:05.920> like<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.489> don't<00:03:06.790> like<00:03:06.940> you

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
things that I like and don't like you

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.850 
things that I like and don't like you
can<00:03:07.569> actually<00:03:07.720> think<00:03:08.050> of<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.290> as<00:03:08.440> one<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.680> those

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
can actually think of it as one of those

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.380 
can actually think of it as one of those
really<00:03:09.100> long<00:03:09.430> reviews<00:03:09.910> instead<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.300> the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
really long reviews instead of the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.449 
really long reviews instead of the
voiceover<00:03:10.810> ones<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.200> usually<00:03:11.620> do<00:03:11.800> so<00:03:12.340> I'll

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
voiceover ones that I usually do so I'll

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.040 
voiceover ones that I usually do so I'll
just<00:03:12.640> talk<00:03:12.850> about<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.209> in<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.420> lot<00:03:13.569> of<00:03:13.600> detail

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
just talk about it in a lot of detail

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.840 
just talk about it in a lot of detail
and<00:03:14.230> then<00:03:14.620> once<00:03:14.800> I<00:03:14.890> get<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.280> mass<00:03:15.489> produced

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
and then once I get the mass produced

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.250 
and then once I get the mass produced
version<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.300> will<00:03:16.480> do<00:03:16.630> one<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:16.870> my<00:03:16.989> short

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
version I will do one of my short

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.870 
version I will do one of my short

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
one since that's going to be the cube

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.860 
one since that's going to be the cube
that<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.920> guys<00:03:21.100> will<00:03:21.310> be<00:03:21.430> buying<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.030> not
