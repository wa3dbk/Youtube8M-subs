00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:18.310
 hello today arcus gamepad two 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.070
 Immediately apologize to those who first 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.290
 gets acquainted with the arch themselves this is not 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.529
 full review but only a small 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.599
 comparison with the first version of the device and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.489
 superficial acquaintance really 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.140
 unit is out for a long time I was very 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.230
 late with his blah blah blah 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.420
 okay the second version got a test 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.560
 although I think that this should have been 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.630
 first unit 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.170
 not to disgrace the brand and well 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:48.730
 I have sold 8 GB version 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.660
 felled somewhere there are 16 and not seen flooded 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.250
 two games from gameplay and the most basic 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.980
 the most important improvement is of course 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.109
 the screen now this orbeez matrix is ​​nice 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.219
 watch 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.350
 color inversion and degradation 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.020
 picture quality when changing the angle 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.090

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.030

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.630
 tap second is battery yes yes yes 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.980
 put a quality battery and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.770
 optimized firmware regarding 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.970
 power consumption now charge me 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.160
 enough with a vengeance 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.510
 there were no such cases that would have to 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.750
 charge while using third 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.460
 this is our processor now 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.740
 quad won't say this to me 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.150
 especially worried since on two cores 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.990
 hu argus performance problems 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:47.190

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.190

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.430
 Fixed work with memory cards 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.939

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.939
 anabiosis 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.780
 visual comparison do not be intimidated by hair 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.160
 on the back of the 1 gamepad it's sticky 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.560
 I used to put an external battery on it 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.840
 slightly changed the order and location 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.290
 interface sockets but they are all there 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.050

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.030
 the second 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.630
 shift and transferred from the front panel to 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.630
 corners 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.530
 deep from us now whole it is convenient 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.540
 the caps of the sticks became bigger and different 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.359
 the forms, but mystics remained 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.560

 the device is pleasant in all respects 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.040
 comfortable but 7 inches for me 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.290
 this is not portable this stuffing in 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:59.970
 quality and 5 inch gps screen would be 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:03.569
