00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
kind of comparable maybe to the Vaseline

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.010

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
that you use those lip balm now because

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.120 
that you use those lip balm now because
they<00:04:36.300> have<00:04:36.539> a<00:04:36.570> rosy<00:04:37.169> tint<00:04:37.410> I<00:04:37.590> haven't<00:04:37.889> tried<00:04:38.100> it

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
they have a rosy tint I haven't tried it

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.159 
they have a rosy tint I haven't tried it
yet<00:04:38.280> but<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.820> mean<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.270> know<00:04:39.360> Vaseline<00:04:39.900> it's<00:04:40.110> a

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
yet but I mean you know Vaseline it's a

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.170 
yet but I mean you know Vaseline it's a
little<00:04:40.350> stickier<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:40.889> it's<00:04:41.220> very<00:04:41.550> heavy<00:04:41.789> duty

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
little stickier and it's very heavy duty

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.330 
little stickier and it's very heavy duty
and<00:04:42.330> moisturizing<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.229> it<00:04:43.620> gives<00:04:43.830> that<00:04:43.919> rosy

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
and moisturizing and it gives that rosy

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.570 
and moisturizing and it gives that rosy
tint<00:04:44.550> in<00:04:44.820> that<00:04:45.770> change<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:47.220> it's<00:04:47.370> kind<00:04:47.550> of

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
tint in that change so it's kind of

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.640 
tint in that change so it's kind of
comparable<00:04:47.970> those<00:04:48.150> are<00:04:48.270> like<00:04:48.389> two<00:04:48.539> dollars<00:04:48.960> so

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
comparable those are like two dollars so

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.040 
comparable those are like two dollars so
i<00:04:50.070> would<00:04:50.250> say<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.789> price<00:04:51.030> is<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.360> definite<00:04:51.810> turn

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050
