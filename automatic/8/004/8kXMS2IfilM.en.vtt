eye is where I want the brow to finish
so<00:00:51.600> my<00:00:51.840> technique<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.470> simple<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.950> work<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.280> two

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
so my technique is simple I work in two

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.340 
so my technique is simple I work in two
straight<00:00:53.760> lines<00:00:53.970> my<00:00:54.329> first<00:00:54.630> line<00:00:54.810> goes<00:00:55.079> along

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
straight lines my first line goes along

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.200 
straight lines my first line goes along
the<00:00:55.380> bottom<00:00:55.739> row<00:00:56.220> of<00:00:56.250> hairs<00:00:56.700> until<00:00:57.059> that

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the bottom row of hairs until that

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.270 
the bottom row of hairs until that
little<00:00:57.660> line<00:00:58.020> starts<00:00:58.380> to<00:00:58.470> poke<00:00:58.770> through<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
little line starts to poke through the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.819 
little line starts to poke through the
top<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> eyebrow<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:00.870> secondly<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.530> brush

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
top of the eyebrow then secondly I brush

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.369 
top of the eyebrow then secondly I brush
from<00:01:01.950> the<00:01:02.130> top<00:01:02.399> downward<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.540> I<00:01:03.719> create<00:01:04.079> like

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
from the top downward and I create like

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.350 
from the top downward and I create like
a<00:01:04.409> wide<00:01:04.710> check<00:01:05.100> mark<00:01:05.369> look<00:01:05.579> so<00:01:06.149> that's

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
a wide check mark look so that's

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.380 
a wide check mark look so that's
beginning<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.930> establishing<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.390> basically

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
beginning of establishing the basically

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.810 
beginning of establishing the basically
the<00:01:09.509> shape<00:01:09.690> of<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:09.900> brow<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:10.860> i<00:01:10.890> come<00:01:11.280> back<00:01:11.460> i

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the shape of the brow now i come back i

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.120 
the shape of the brow now i come back i
take<00:01:12.270> my<00:01:12.720> same<00:01:13.260> brush<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.799> I'm<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
take my same brush and I'm going to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.870 
take my same brush and I'm going to
fluff<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.760> product<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.420> into<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.320> brow<00:01:16.530> I

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
fluff this product up into the brow I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.800 
fluff this product up into the brow I
think<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:17.970> important<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.390> always

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
think it's important that you always

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.360 
think it's important that you always
remember<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.260> fluff<00:01:19.620> up<00:01:19.799> words<00:01:20.159> remember

remember to fluff up words remember

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.590 
remember to fluff up words remember
we're<00:01:20.549> trying<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> create<00:01:20.940> height<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
we're trying to create height and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.719 
we're trying to create height and
distance<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> brow<00:01:22.680> if<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.490> start<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
distance with the brow if you start to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.730 
distance with the brow if you start to
brush<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.360> only<00:01:24.600> flatten<00:01:25.140> out<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.320> shape

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
brush out you only flatten out the shape

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.190 
brush out you only flatten out the shape
and<00:01:25.950> ultimately<00:01:26.760> her<00:01:26.970> eyebrow<00:01:27.420> will<00:01:28.020> look

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
and ultimately her eyebrow will look

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.410 
and ultimately her eyebrow will look
like<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.530> pulling<00:01:28.680> her<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.950> down<00:01:29.340> instead<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
like it's pulling her I down instead of

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.020 
like it's pulling her I down instead of
giving<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.290> nice<00:01:31.440> gentle<00:01:32.100> arching<00:01:32.520> shape<00:01:32.760> I

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
giving it a nice gentle arching shape I

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.380 
giving it a nice gentle arching shape I
try<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.810> very<00:01:34.350> softly<00:01:35.070> round<00:01:35.729> out<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.180> these

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
try to very softly round out with these

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.440 
try to very softly round out with these
two<00:01:36.720> where<00:01:37.380> these<00:01:37.500> two<00:01:37.680> colors<00:01:37.860> meet<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.400> here

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
two where these two colors meet out here

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.039 
two where these two colors meet out here
so<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> don't<00:01:39.869> get<00:01:39.960> too<00:01:40.290> much<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.860> sharp<00:01:41.130> edge

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
so I don't get too much of a sharp edge

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.300 
so I don't get too much of a sharp edge
so<00:01:43.049> balance<00:01:43.380> at<00:01:43.470> night<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.920> notice<00:01:44.220> with

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
so balance at night so you notice with

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.980 
so balance at night so you notice with
feras<00:01:44.670> brows<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.659> know<00:01:45.750> she's<00:01:45.960> a

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
feras brows that you know she's a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.140 
feras brows that you know she's a
tweezer<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.560> she<00:01:47.340> gets<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.700> there<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:47.939> so

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
tweezer and she gets in there and so

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.359 
tweezer and she gets in there and so
they're<00:01:48.330> not<00:01:48.450> completely<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.350> together<00:01:49.770> so

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
they're not completely all together so

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.460 
they're not completely all together so
you<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.090> want<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> get<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.509> soft<00:01:51.840> template<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
you just want to get a soft template and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.050 
you just want to get a soft template and
you<00:01:52.560> kind<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.830> want<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.009> superimpose<00:01:53.520> that

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you kind of want to superimpose that

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.670 
you kind of want to superimpose that
through<00:01:54.689> her<00:01:54.840> eye<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> don't<00:01:55.470> want<00:01:55.619> to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
through her eye but you don't want to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.469 
through her eye but you don't want to
overdraw<00:01:56.220> her<00:01:56.400> brow<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:56.939> once<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.330> do

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
overdraw her brow because once you do

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.300 
overdraw her brow because once you do
that<00:01:57.509> people<00:01:58.320> will<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.650> drawn<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> wrong

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that people will be drawn to the wrong

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.340 
that people will be drawn to the wrong
part<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.729> her<00:01:59.820> eye<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.229> want

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
