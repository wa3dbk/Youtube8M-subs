00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
blue I know it looks terrifying I'm not

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.569 
blue I know it looks terrifying I'm not
putting<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.430> in<00:02:42.959> with<00:02:43.959> any<00:02:44.410> conditioner<00:02:45.370> or

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
putting it in with any conditioner or

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
so I'm a little bit afraid of what it's

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.460 
so I'm a little bit afraid of what it's
going<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.519> look<00:02:51.579> like<00:02:51.730> no<00:02:52.540> really<00:02:52.959> it's<00:02:53.260> over

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
going to look like no really it's over

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.360 
going to look like no really it's over
here<00:02:53.650> at<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.859> end<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.129> day<00:02:54.329> so<00:02:55.709> yeah<00:02:56.709> i'll

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
here at the end of the day so yeah i'll

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.970 
here at the end of the day so yeah i'll
show<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.730> what<00:02:57.879> it<00:02:57.970> looks<00:02:58.000> like<00:02:58.709> once<00:02:59.709> a<00:02:59.829> good

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
show you what it looks like once a good

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.339 
show you what it looks like once a good
all<00:03:00.190> on<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:01.540> can<00:03:01.720> see<00:03:01.900> whether<00:03:02.140> it

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
all on and so you can see whether it

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.530 
all on and so you can see whether it
changes<00:03:02.709> color<00:03:02.920> or<00:03:03.069> ever<00:03:03.280> just<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.150> case<00:03:04.329> you

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
changes color or ever just in case you

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.780 
changes color or ever just in case you
do<00:03:04.750> think<00:03:05.079> that<00:03:05.140> this<00:03:05.409> county<00:03:06.280> thing<00:03:06.459> would<00:03:06.640> be

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
do think that this county thing would be

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.649 
do think that this county thing would be
terrified<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:07.750> then<00:03:08.700> after<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.849> I<00:03:10.180> suppose

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
terrified and then after that I suppose

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.380 
terrified and then after that I suppose
our<00:03:11.019> film<00:03:11.379> once<00:03:11.680> I've<00:03:11.920> washed<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:13.000> off<00:03:13.120> and

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
our film once I've washed it off and

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.150 
our film once I've washed it off and
dryer<00:03:13.569> and<00:03:13.810> strained<00:03:14.139> it<00:03:14.319> and<00:03:14.470> let<00:03:14.829> it<00:03:14.859> daily

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
dryer and strained it and let it daily

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.030 
dryer and strained it and let it daily
labor<00:03:15.459> yet<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:16.290> you'll<00:03:17.290> get<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.620> see<00:03:17.799> like

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
labor yet so you'll get to see like

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.420 
labor yet so you'll get to see like
everything<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.959> then<00:03:20.680> after<00:03:21.040> that<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.310> can

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
everything and then after that you can

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.650 
everything and then after that you can
make<00:03:21.579> up<00:03:21.730> your<00:03:21.760> own<00:03:21.880> mind<00:03:22.030> whether<00:03:22.329> you're

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
make up your own mind whether you're

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.780 
make up your own mind whether you're
going<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.870> use<00:03:23.019> this<00:03:23.319> stuff<00:03:23.620> because<00:03:24.489> I<00:03:24.730> know

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
going to use this stuff because I know

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.440 
going to use this stuff because I know
it<00:03:25.540> might<00:03:25.750> go<00:03:26.019> grey<00:03:26.379> or<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:27.129> might<00:03:27.280> go<00:03:27.489> why<00:03:27.730> or<00:03:28.090> I

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
it might go grey or it might go why or I

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.030 
it might go grey or it might go why or I
don't<00:03:28.750> even<00:03:29.019> know<00:03:29.319> what<00:03:29.440> color<00:03:29.680> is<00:03:29.799> going<00:03:29.980> to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
don't even know what color is going to

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.440 
don't even know what color is going to
grow<00:03:30.160> as<00:03:30.310> long<00:03:30.459> as<00:03:30.579> it's<00:03:30.730> not<00:03:30.760> yellow<00:03:31.030> anymore

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
grow as long as it's not yellow anymore

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.500 
grow as long as it's not yellow anymore
I<00:03:31.480> don't<00:03:31.629> really<00:03:31.780> care<00:03:31.989> so<00:03:32.349> I<00:03:33.000> guess<00:03:34.000> I'll<00:03:34.269> see

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
I don't really care so I guess I'll see

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:42.809 
I don't really care so I guess I'll see
you<00:03:34.569> in<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.750> bit<00:03:38.220> so<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.400> is<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.730> with<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.269> on<00:03:41.819> it

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819

at<00:03:47.199> my<00:03:47.319> room's<00:03:48.480> swiveling<00:03:49.480> around<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:50.500> looks

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
at my room's swiveling around it looks

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.470 
at my room's swiveling around it looks
like<00:03:51.010> I've<00:03:51.250> missed<00:03:51.519> them<00:03:51.849> like<00:03:52.120> they<00:03:52.269> look

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
it's just kind of like kind of going

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.619 
it's just kind of like kind of going
into<00:03:58.810> my<00:03:59.109> hair<00:03:59.349> so<00:03:59.680> I'm<00:04:00.150> I'm<00:04:01.150> actually<00:04:01.329> looking

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
into my hair so I'm I'm actually looking

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.330 
into my hair so I'm I'm actually looking
forward<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:02.169> how<00:04:02.290> this<00:04:02.440> is<00:04:02.590> gonna<00:04:02.709> turn<00:04:03.069> out

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
forward to how this is gonna turn out

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.470 
forward to how this is gonna turn out
and<00:04:03.669> i<00:04:04.049> only<00:04:05.049> had<00:04:05.290> one<00:04:05.530> part<00:04:06.030> so<00:04:07.030> i<00:04:07.060> put<00:04:07.269> it<00:04:07.359> on

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
and i only had one part so i put it on

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.869 
and i only had one part so i put it on
and<00:04:07.780> put<00:04:08.290> it<00:04:08.379> in<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.680> problem<00:04:09.069> areas<00:04:09.370> first<00:04:09.609> so

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
and put it in the problem areas first so

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.650 
and put it in the problem areas first so
that<00:04:10.090> if<00:04:11.069> it<00:04:12.069> doesn't<00:04:12.549> turn<00:04:12.730> out<00:04:12.879> amazingly

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
that if it doesn't turn out amazingly

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.809 
that if it doesn't turn out amazingly
like<00:04:14.319> if<00:04:14.470> you<00:04:14.530> doesn't<00:04:14.799> go<00:04:14.919> gray<00:04:15.310> or<00:04:15.669> if<00:04:15.760> you

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
like if you doesn't go gray or if you

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.670 
like if you doesn't go gray or if you
didn't<00:04:16.060> go<00:04:16.150> silver<00:04:16.419> all<00:04:16.599> ever<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:18.030> at<00:04:19.030> least<00:04:19.239> I

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
didn't go silver all ever and at least I

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.849 
didn't go silver all ever and at least I
will<00:04:20.680> have<00:04:20.829> toned<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.519> bit

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
will have toned the bit

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.589 
will have toned the bit
that<00:04:22.069> were<00:04:22.189> the<00:04:22.310> problem<00:04:22.340> bit<00:04:23.000> so<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.240> did<00:04:23.449> all

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
that were the problem bit so I did all

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.510 
that were the problem bit so I did all
the<00:04:23.780> yellow<00:04:24.080> bits<00:04:24.530> that<00:04:24.710> were<00:04:24.860> really<00:04:25.219> bugging

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
the yellow bits that were really bugging

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.080 
the yellow bits that were really bugging
