00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.700
 yo guests of theo gamersnl again today 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.500
 a new video 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.379
 in this movie is I like a 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.220
 new new series 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.310
 and yes we start in that vision 5 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.730
 I decided that because yes I was 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.400
 of course already in that vision 5 and yes one 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.059
 divisions 7 and difficile 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.260
 6 6 is about the vision behind that is not 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.059
 so very interesting 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.460
 yes most of you are one there is not 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.160
 real tension from that vision 5 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.739
 it's nice also by the rewards and yes 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.600
 that I am the kon that you can win 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.670
 write from the beginning in the divi 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.440
 I have twelve points and yes I am now 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.550
 again winds have five points and then am 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.430
 I am the closer to the promotion 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:03.690
 and the championship so you start 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.380
 I play against it 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.650
 and bpl team with shirley sterling 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.590
 nice bush so own tendon in the front and 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.380
 in the back have mancala deep so did 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.080
 many millionaires on purpose 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.939
 rafael right back and that is left back 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.259
 according to mars got it right 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.259
 henrike but i am not sure 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.229
 so we start the kickoff and yes here 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.939
 I then immediately scoop the ball and you 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.280
 he does this really wrong 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.439
 I shouldn't have done that but not 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.850
 from he comes back and then he gives up 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.520
 on william 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.350
 Clients drag her throws him for it 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.570
 and who have used costs if they 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.479
 power but he just headed it to the post 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.740
 and if it says attack then the game 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:57.960
 is over and he has a goal kick 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.060
 well then i am going to be a bit offensive 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.280
 but in the 8th minute he gets 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.619
 quite a big chance 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.800
 he goes running but pours sns 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.170
 just missed him but yes it does not matter 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.540
 j koster loses here you will come and 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.750
 that is 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.180
 and there as you see that 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.870
 punished bad defends bad gibt 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.000
 and he scores the 1010 behind that 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.269
 means that I am not winning yet 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.280
 and that makes sense so that I too 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.079
 not those three point channels and that week 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.359
 I really really like it so I am fine 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.220
 do green best hazar with his solo he 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.950
 enjoyed 3 moon turns 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.079
 shoot him on the inside of the pole 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.220
 and just scores him 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.349
 and a beautiful goal belongs of course 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.569
 a nice federation 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.900
 courtois also think it is nice and so 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:53.470
 yes then stood again and one so I had 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.680
 motivation to win again and yes keeper 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.090
 he just completely reverses it too 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.090
 to the right and I shot him left 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.599
 so then it was a one and with still 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:14.319
 more than a full game 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:16.060
 so yes then in the 42nd minute 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.359
 comes her son who fits him completely 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.599
 wrong and company's i also really one 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:26.280
 beast he plays him on costa ramires 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.239
 and costs run away he becomes it then 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.319
 overpowered rooney 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.299
 fake shot ship and escort and he makes 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.349
 nevertheless the two one and that is really quite 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.659
 tidy because yes I do not always and he 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:44.409
 come in and really neat and now bag 2 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:46.479
 for naturally very nose and yes here 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:51.579
 offense that is not that interesting 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:56.169
 but yes 5 inch minute so you can say 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.609
 someone with blowing and yes it happens 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.500
 almost 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:02.769
 I get another corner because window earlier 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.060
 Shoot here and the keeper managed 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.060
 just tidy and you get whole wheat 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.269
 so yes then we are still in it 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:13.329
 injury time busy 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:16.030
 which, incidentally, takes a long time 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.370
 and yes if you look too you will see the difference 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.400
 is great that she just says that already 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.400
 enough 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.940
 well and then i expect the match 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.520
 the first half is almost over 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.200
 as now in precisely that would be the one for that 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.960
 at rest is of course very neat 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.910
 stand for and another half to go and 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.860
 if we win it then the 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.860
 yes how to put 3 points in the pocket 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.670
 the two one and in 72 minutes it is 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.010
 then finally a bit of sensation 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.600
 in the match and nice cross 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.420
 opera is more and more gives him off and on 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.260
 who we costa ticks him in peace 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.410
 within 83rd minute well I think the 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.080
 game about here not 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.570
 played while it actually is 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.520
 very pretty purple and then here over the tot 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.470
 ruble then william 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.670
 now I don't really understand how much individually 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.950
 could win by actually putting them in between 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.140
 length this too he dragged me to win 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.390
 between two men by shooting team on the 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.690
 inside of the pole and he shoots him 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:22.830
 inside and then the competition is decided 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.410
 So yes 20 minutes, a fine pitch 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.940
 ball on costs to costs yes I know 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.790
 not why I have a dot 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.070
 demer yes i thought i would try 4th before 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.590
 how pretty she was but i was too soft and 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.770
 then the match is closed 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.490
 and i just four a 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.970
 natural beautiful 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.470
 yes i needed it after 16 points 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.750
 now that also means the same 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.550
 have promoted 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.040
 and put us in a game now then am 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.160
 I am also champion 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.630
 Thomas yes really some more points 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.410
 earned is me as you can see that 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.940
 who also choose me brewers from it 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.910
 would join the channel 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:07.020
 And yes then we are going to the next game 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.220
 and of course I hope this one 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.960
 again you should be nice if me 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.540
 becomes champion then I have something 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.020
 more coins the neighborhood 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.520
 so he's looking for an opponent 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.340
 I am looking for an opponent who becomes 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.700
 found naturally takes a long time and 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.940
 start do we select the 10 is 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.230

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.900

 play in a match 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.190
