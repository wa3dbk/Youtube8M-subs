00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
you're actually spinning the thumb will

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.240 
you're actually spinning the thumb will
come<00:01:10.840> off<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.200> skip<00:01:11.440> and<00:01:11.740> we<00:01:11.830> won't<00:01:12.010> use<00:01:12.220> that

come off the skip and we won't use that

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.210 
come off the skip and we won't use that
at<00:01:12.520> all<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.780> when<00:01:14.410> just<00:01:14.770> before<00:01:14.860> we're

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
at all so when just before we're

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.360 
at all so when just before we're
spinning<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:16.570> put<00:01:16.870> our<00:01:17.080> fingers<00:01:17.440> on<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:18.100> side

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
spinning we put our fingers on the side

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.230 
spinning we put our fingers on the side
like<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.570> we<00:01:22.750> have<00:01:22.900> this<00:01:23.020> finger<00:01:23.380> here

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
like that and we have this finger here

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.330 
like that and we have this finger here
just<00:01:25.240> on<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.780> front<00:01:26.080> of<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.500> stick<00:01:26.740> other<00:01:27.070> two

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
just on the front of the stick other two

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.360 
just on the front of the stick other two
three<00:01:27.940> fingers<00:01:28.630> along<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.320> solder<00:01:29.860> at<00:01:30.250> the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
three fingers along the solder at the

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.200 
three fingers along the solder at the
back<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.960> when<00:01:32.290> we're<00:01:32.410> about<00:01:32.500> has<00:01:32.800> been<00:01:33.210> we

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
back so when we're about has been we

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.650 
back so when we're about has been we
take<00:01:35.170> our<00:01:35.350> thumb<00:01:35.530> off<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.250> these<00:01:37.240> three

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
take our thumb off and these three

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.280 
take our thumb off and these three
fingers<00:01:37.900> come<00:01:38.260> out<00:01:38.520> all<00:01:39.520> right

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
fingers come out all right

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.130 
fingers come out all right
so<00:01:41.290> thumb<00:01:41.800> is<00:01:41.950> being<00:01:42.460> released<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:43.140> just

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
so thumb is being released and just

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.850 
so thumb is being released and just
rolls<00:01:44.380> over<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.740> finger<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:47.170> first<00:01:47.380> finger

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
rolls over the finger the first finger

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.230 
rolls over the finger the first finger
all<00:01:48.310> right<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.960> next<00:01:50.230> finger<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:51.580> the

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
all right in the next finger and the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.800 
all right in the next finger and the
pinkie<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:54.280> when<00:01:54.400> we<00:01:54.550> come<00:01:54.820> up<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.600> grab

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
pinkie and then when we come up and grab

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.730 
pinkie and then when we come up and grab
it<00:01:55.870> like<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.910> so<00:01:57.910> truth<00:01:58.480> the<00:01:59.110> bottom<00:01:59.380> finger

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
it like that so truth the bottom finger

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.910 
it like that so truth the bottom finger
your<00:01:59.980> pinkie<00:02:00.280> can<00:02:00.430> get<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:00.670> there<00:02:00.790> top<00:02:00.970> finger

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
your pinkie can get in there top finger

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.760 
your pinkie can get in there top finger
gripping<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.610> stick<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.200> two<00:02:05.410> fingers

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
gripping the stick and the two fingers

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.230 
gripping the stick and the two fingers
here<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.280> middle<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.550> pressing<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.090> other

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
here in the middle I pressing the other

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.699 
here in the middle I pressing the other
way<00:02:07.450> against<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:08.020> so<00:02:08.440> then<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.679> doesn't

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
way against it so then it doesn't

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.240 
way against it so then it doesn't
actually<00:02:09.129> fall<00:02:09.489> there<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:11.140> both<00:02:11.590> fingers<00:02:12.040> are

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
actually fall there so both fingers are

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.740 
actually fall there so both fingers are
on<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.579> same<00:02:12.760> side

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
on the same side

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.000 
on the same side
I<00:02:13.780> caught<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.860> side<00:02:15.240> furthest<00:02:16.240> away<00:02:16.390> from<00:02:16.540> me

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
I caught the side furthest away from me

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.560 
I caught the side furthest away from me
then<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.100> spin<00:02:18.370> back<00:02:18.580> up<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.240> can<00:02:19.420> go

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
then you spin back up and you can go

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.560 
then you spin back up and you can go
into<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.990> again<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:21.160> that's<00:02:21.880> really<00:02:22.030> can<00:02:22.330> Harry

right<00:02:33.160> one<00:02:33.760> last<00:02:33.910> hunt<00:02:38.580> grew<00:02:39.580> up<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.960> then<00:02:41.110> you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
right one last hunt grew up and then you

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.199 
right one last hunt grew up and then you
back<00:02:41.410> into<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:43.710> alright<00:02:44.880> that's<00:02:45.880> pretty<00:02:46.030> much

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
back into it alright that's pretty much

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.699 
back into it alright that's pretty much
how<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.780> do<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.820> drumstick<00:02:48.820> spin<00:02:49.500> once<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.590> get

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
how you do a drumstick spin once you get

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.770 
how you do a drumstick spin once you get
there<00:02:50.920> if<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.160> have<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.340> do<00:02:51.520> far<00:02:51.760> bit<00:02:52.209> faster

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
there if you have to do far bit faster

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.580 
there if you have to do far bit faster
over<00:02:53.650> time<00:02:53.920> your<00:02:54.100> hand<00:02:54.340> will<00:02:54.490> get<00:02:54.610> stronger

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
over time your hand will get stronger

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.980 
over time your hand will get stronger
muscles<00:02:56.590> will<00:02:56.770> build<00:02:56.980> up<00:02:57.100> in<00:02:57.280> there<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.990> you

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
muscles will build up in there so you

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.570 
muscles will build up in there so you
better<00:02:59.260> do<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.470> lot<00:02:59.680> faster<00:03:00.100> it<00:03:00.190> takes<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.490> little

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
better do a lot faster it takes a little

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.020 
better do a lot faster it takes a little
bit<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.760> practice<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.470> mean<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.950> learnt<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.880> do

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
bit of practice I mean I learnt to do

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.949 
bit of practice I mean I learnt to do
that<00:03:04.240> just<00:03:04.570> in<00:03:04.720> less<00:03:05.200> than<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:05.440> day<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:07.450> it's<00:03:07.810> not

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
that just in less than a day so it's not

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.220 
that just in less than a day so it's not
too<00:03:08.170> high<00:03:08.380> so<00:03:09.130> as<00:03:09.910> long<00:03:10.060> as<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.330> follow<00:03:10.690> those

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
too high so as long as you follow those

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.710 
too high so as long as you follow those
steps<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:12.610> should<00:03:12.940> be<00:03:13.030> able<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.209> do<00:03:13.360> it<00:03:13.480> so

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
steps you should be able to do it so

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:21.840 
steps you should be able to do it so
just<00:03:16.980> simple<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:20.170> also<00:03:20.610> if<00:03:21.610> you're

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
just simple and also if you're

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.590 
just simple and also if you're
struggling<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.910> might<00:03:25.090> be<00:03:25.269> really<00:03:25.390> cool

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
struggling it it might be really cool

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.340 
struggling it it might be really cool
the<00:03:25.810> slice<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.320> stick<00:03:26.769> drumstick<00:03:27.700> using

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
the slice it you stick drumstick using

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.170 
the slice it you stick drumstick using
you<00:03:29.350> want<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.709> use<00:03:29.950> about<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.250> 10<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.730> 12

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
you want to use about a 10 to 12

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.100 
you want to use about a 10 to 12
millimeters<00:03:31.750> thick<00:03:32.080> and<00:03:32.790> stick<00:03:33.790> any<00:03:34.720> bigger

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
millimeters thick and stick any bigger

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.880 
millimeters thick and stick any bigger
than<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:37.410> especially<00:03:38.410> if<00:03:38.470> you're<00:03:38.620> just

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
than that especially if you're just

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.090 
than that especially if you're just
starting<00:03:39.550> off<00:03:39.850> like<00:03:40.720> just<00:03:41.140> being<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.590> drumstick

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
starting off like just being a drumstick

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.990 
starting off like just being a drumstick
just<00:03:43.060> it's<00:03:43.480> just<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.720> bit<00:03:43.870> too<00:03:44.019> big<00:03:44.290> slow<00:03:45.160> that

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
just it's just a bit too big slow that

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.620 
just it's just a bit too big slow that
once<00:03:46.299> you<00:03:47.049> have<00:03:47.260> mastered<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:51.360> you'll<00:03:52.360> be<00:03:52.480> able

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
once you have mastered it you'll be able

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.410 
once you have mastered it you'll be able
to<00:03:52.989> use<00:03:53.500> bigger<00:03:53.799> sticks<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:54.910> a<00:03:55.030> lot<00:03:55.180> cooler

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
to use bigger sticks and a lot cooler

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.390 
to use bigger sticks and a lot cooler
sticks<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:56.080> found<00:03:56.590> out<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:56.890> show<00:03:57.100> you<00:03:59.370> so<00:04:00.370> here

sticks<00:04:04.360> which<00:04:05.140> are<00:04:05.350> actually<00:04:06.190> really<00:04:06.519> cool<00:04:07.830> so

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
sticks which are actually really cool so

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:17.539 
sticks which are actually really cool so
I'll<00:04:09.160> do<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.489> move<00:04:09.670> again<00:04:11.040> drumstick<00:04:13.320> skin

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:26.570 

at<00:04:18.000> one<00:04:18.239> time<00:04:21.500> there<00:04:22.500> we<00:04:22.620> go<00:04:24.800> as<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:25.860> can<00:04:26.099> see

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
at one time there we go as you can see

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.540 
at one time there we go as you can see
they<00:04:27.060> just<00:04:27.090> see<00:04:27.479> through<00:04:28.190> drumsticks<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.340> bit

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
they just see through drumsticks a bit

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.240 
they just see through drumsticks a bit
thickness<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.330> dollar<00:04:30.569> a<00:04:30.990> little<00:04:31.830> bit<00:04:31.919> harder

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
thickness a dollar a little bit harder

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.480 
thickness a dollar a little bit harder
to<00:04:32.430> do<00:04:32.699> it<00:04:33.169> they're<00:04:34.169> not<00:04:34.259> to<00:04:34.440> that<00:04:37.220> so<00:04:38.220> that's

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
to do it they're not to that so that's

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.029 
to do it they're not to that so that's
alright<00:04:38.930> if<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.050> want<00:04:40.199> to<00:04:40.259> get<00:04:40.409> a<00:04:40.440> pair<00:04:40.710> and

especially in Tasmania so Marin County

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.710 
especially in Tasmania so Marin County
