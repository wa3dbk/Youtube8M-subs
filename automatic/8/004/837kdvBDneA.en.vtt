 to a new edition turner and news 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.140
 a lot has happened again in the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.300
 world of technology therefore fits meshes 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.519
 on youtube creates for clarity 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.650
 Music upload and recognizable throughout 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.960
 daily wlan it should now also soon 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:22.289
 at 400 kilometers per hour give and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.580
 There is news on the music as well as on the back 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.769
 and youtube is always such a thing 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.119
 especially in Germany youtube and the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.920
 Unfortunately, gema can still 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.480
 not now has the video portal 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.250
 but at least the use of 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.930
 protected music made more transparent 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.969
 so that you can already before the upload 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.860
 can check if the video is locked 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.480
 could or could not be there for it 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.890
 Now in the audio library in the man 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.840
 By the way, also a lot of free 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.360
 Music can download a rider 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.770
 the music with ads takes here 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.309
 you will find popularity listed 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.590
 popular titles like oh happy day or may 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.360
 Anaconda there and a vaccine and 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.219
 which countries that will be shown 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.420
 may and if the rights owner the video 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.489
 would monetize 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.469
 By the way, there are a few miracles 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.159
 The songs are even available in Germany 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.630
 be slow style for example it 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.100
 also gives a cool translation 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.710
 youtube.com recognizes that you are sitting in the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.390
 train and is actually just a bit 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.100
 catchy thinks surf a music video 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.600
 look at youtube or at least with 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.070
 Write tiny little message 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.979
 but if anything then dive once 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.030
 it would be understood here to on 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.650
 luck, the German train seems that 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.560
 to have recognized the problem and now plans 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.430
 until 2016 all trains with free wifi 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.479
 equip 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.860
 231 of the total of 255 ic trains are planned 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.909
 already with the new technology 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.770
 be equipped 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.060
 so far so good now, though 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.340
 still be taken care that the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.439
 Connection also remains stable when 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.060
 Almost 900 train yesterday, the wifi 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.520
 want to dial in during the train across 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.110
 across the country solves advertising technology in the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.970
 German railway indeed be otherwise getting everything 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.509
 to the draw news again no 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.509
 thoughts 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.820
 and if that works with the wlan in the ic 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.760
 So you could finally without 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.440
 he knew problems writing 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.090
 Scientist is study 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.740
 it clearly shows what you do 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.569
 Everything is so even if you even 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.730
 not writing it is possible 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.920
 just by reading the online status that 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.260
 to create complete statistics when you are 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.330
 how long online asked and needed 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.560
 just your mobile number scientist 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.319
 at the friedrich alexander university 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.209
 gain Nuremberg have 1000 for it 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.310
 randomly selected users observed 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.170
 and logs as soon as they are online 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.910
 they could then be frightening 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.100
 Detailed conclusions are drawn to 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.420
 Example who got up and when 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.610
 who went during the bed 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.959
 working time was online and if anyone in 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.610
 maybe one more week 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.840
 was a little too long on the way 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.400
 because the usage behavior of 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.500
 Scientist through the permanent 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.450
 be online and contact the many 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.550
 unusually many users very much of the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.870
 normal use deviates so one should 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.880
 Actually relatively easy 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.800
 be recognized and also prevented 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.940
 what do you think you are doing something like that 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.940
 take care of your privacy 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.370
 Last week we already have the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.140
 hacker attack on sony pictures 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.910
 reported and since then there are daily 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.690
 new messages about who is behind it 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.550
 could be stuck 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.470
 and everything in the hands of the 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.090
 hacker much trace search shows probably always 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.950
 clearer to north korea 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.680
 that is at least from a droh-mail 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.150
 North Korea clearly denies this 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.290
 has something to do with the attack 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.940
 However, have the try 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.770
 Hackers also like the movies 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.970
 interview by seth rogen and james 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.860
 to restrain franco 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.750
 because here came in a scene young 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.060
 is killed and after several 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.680
 terabyte footage from sony copied 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.450
 were are now beside cover names of 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.370
 some celebrities with whom they are 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.050
 among others in hotels unknown 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.090
 You can also check in private 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.160
 mobile number a network surfaced tom 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.290
 hanks brad pitt and julia roberts were 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:48.680
 here among other things, what else is there 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.840
 so everything comes naturally, it is just 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.010
 kickstarter going on and there is the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.200
 Example of a small robot 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.000
 collected he claims the smartest 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.620
 router ever to be 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.540
 you need to be in the first place 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.130
 wlan no eternal country network key 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.540
 more is enough if you agree 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.910
 connecting device so your smartphone 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.010
 or tablet against the route and stops 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.049
 Zack is your device authenticated and 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.940
 you can connect and be small and 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.739
 it sends the part also makes one 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.420
 a little bit more ago but all fritz box 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.190
 or and for the fans of analog 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.260
 images to take in the hand have the 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.750
 not to confuse people of snap jet 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.180
 with chat was very similar or 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.300
 and that's how marketing technically dies 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.860
 maybe that's what it belongs too 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.510
 So snap jet is definitely one 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.340
 little gadget with the man inside 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.150
 from seconds a picture of the smartphone 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.470
 can print 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.300
 but it is not necessary for that yet 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.030
 merry and the printer so to connect 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.800
 no cable no app no ​​wifi or something 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.440
 here simply the screen is scanned 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.479
 then printed a kind of mini one 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.190
 copier looks quite handy 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.500
 and the printed photos can also 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.970
 not be stolen by hackers the 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.860
 you have long since come to the two campaigns 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.030
 By the way, in the video description and 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.560
 There you will also find the links to 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.850

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.870
