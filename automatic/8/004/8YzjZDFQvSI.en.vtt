00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:05.820
 moron. 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.470
 we continue to answer your questions 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.519
 that come through various channels 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.850
 Communication today is a missed topic . hitting 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:39.760
 when hitting the right when hitting the right with 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.860
 bounce Andrei will consider from the point 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.379
 view practice coach I'm in terms of 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.750
 biomechanics 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.729
 very often and very characteristic such 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.550
 error when hitting the right as missing 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:53.199
 . hitting many tennis players and coach 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.479
 play meet the ball in front of you you 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.559
 are trying 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.619
 straining your attention trying 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.689
 meet the ball in front of you and you 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.549
 manage two or three times and then in the next 

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:06.939
 Once again, the point of impact is missed again in 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.500
 2 2-3 times going to choose now 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.810
 your attention willpower flag you 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.880
 meet the ball in front of you and then how 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.600
 . blow again missed and this under this 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.060
 the cycle repeats indefinitely why 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.759
 does this happen of course options 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.439
 maybe several but one of them 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.140
 the most typical except that 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:29.530
 you do late for nah is a mistake 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.140
 in at the moment you are us and the racket and so after 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.780
 of how you made a swing and started 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:40.290
 put the racket under the ball you must 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.970
 must carry the racket cap forward 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.820
 if at that moment you start 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.159
 lead the head forward then your speed 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.150
 the heads will be very small and you 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.940
 just slap the ball behind you when 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.890
 pull the cap forward then your 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.970
 the head at the point of impact is under 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.990
 ball and ahead of yourself and the second is very 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.659
 important point is passive or active 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.909
 turn of the thigh of the same name 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.680
 if you do not turn the same 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.060
 hip and now slightly open the rack 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.760
 so you you can see it 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.349
 you do not turn the same thigh a 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.230
 so many people do 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.180
 you simply women do not reach 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.129
 even to the point of impact that you should 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.890
 be ahead of yourself she is with you 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.459
 behind the case if you turned the thigh 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.599
 so your knee is looking to the court 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.749
 respectively. hitting advance 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.880
 forward and you can safely with this 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:39.220
 places to do your graduation 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.740
 so I once again let you down 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.380
 racket down and 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.260
 racket cap you start you us up 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.190
 points of impact with such a technique you will 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.380
 very rarely miss the moment of impact 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.440
 empty in terms of mechanics this one 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.250
 the moment and which Andrei says 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:04.020
 this is the moment of passage of the projection body here 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.090
 racket gets the highest acceleration 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.690
 as the same as the same, it has an objective 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.750
 value u lovers who are engaged 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.210
 about a year from where the racket 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.290
 when enrolling the soup is not handled and 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.710
 contact 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.940
 this time is about two tenths of a second 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.820
 that is, this is the lover who 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.920
 principle takes first steps 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.170
 good strong batter amateur there 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.450
 who play about five years old it 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:39.250
 about 15 one and a half 15 hundredths of a second 15 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.350
 hundred seconds to a half tenth such 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.900
 lovely girl like carolyn 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.760
 scribblers up when they hit the right take out 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.340
 racket in one and two tenths of a second in 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.990
 12 hundredths of a second is not for 12 hundredths 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.250
 seconds that is 000 1200 12 and 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.870
 he's not okay with a forehand 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.020
 that's why because here 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.400
 energy is gained but such comrades 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.860
 as figures sharapova model indicator 08 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.360
 straight stable than stable 08 racket 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.550
 During this time, it comes about 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.120
 meter meter twenty and speed they 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.000
 approximately 08 by the world's leading players to 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.410
 what is all this i say and through time in 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.590
 that time it was very very fast 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.710
 time to all this whole speech to the fact that 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:35.050
 during this period and this 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:38.530
 something like blinking your eyes is very difficult 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.020
 something to change the wrist in the design 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.810
 at such speeds at the final phases 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.430
 already taking out the racket the system should be 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.260
 very simple that is if you on 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.930
 contact on racket contact somehow 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.320
 formed a slide 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.740
 then one tenth before the strike naturally 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.400
 all corners should try to bring already in 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.979
 this. 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.930
 Here's your own point in this supination 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.820
 recording the naturalness of you rocket coming out 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.889
 so that respectively in these overclocking 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.570
 it should be a rowan well that's it 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.030
 actually here's an idea if you start 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.280
 do some extra movement you 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.090
 just spend a little on this move 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.100
 more time 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.530
 from because of the ball test during this time 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.410
 fly there still a few dozen 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.570
 centimeters and will be behind the point of impact 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.789
 that's it right here you will lose 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.550
 time like this you will come to the sword 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.410
 much faster yes sasha I probably 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.470
 I hope we answered today to your 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.910
 The question with you was Andrei Mironov and 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.910
 Sergey Podolyak thanks
