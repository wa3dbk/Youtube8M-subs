00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.850
 but all 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.370
 ah 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.370
 now 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.990
 each goal 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.730
 how about friends this is the pool of 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.350
 goal to 190 and to try the 17 06 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.079
 here in the ghana goal to the first 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.179
 part from mexico against honduras 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.660
 and I believe that Mexico will be fixed 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:51.640
 local 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.649
 when you are with a tie 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.260
 here against rick so it's going to be a 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.960
 tie 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.690
 on the ground is veracruz 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.850
 veracruz I think that 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.860
 I do not judge so bad against tigers but I 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.930
 I think it's not going to lift 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.640
 the boy I stay with him is only crime 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.530
 to lose equal 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.470
 here in the monte radio america asked 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:20.290
 Circus method with america 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:22.620
 in the tigers chivas chivas did not lose with 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.960
 toluca because it seems that 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.820
 that they paid the toluca to leave 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.950
 win files but then neither so nor everything 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.740
 of land with with tigers 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.219
 in the atlante morelia I will live with the 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.689
 morelia although they are managing 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.789
 technician the atlante and the one that premieres 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.020
 technical wins but then here in this case 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.030
 I do not think 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.820
 equal and it took a better tie was not left 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.470
 with a draw here in the lion against 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.140
 jaguars the man ni 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.920
 comes from not losing I do not know how many 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.799
 matches 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.799
 and from home I think if you take a 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.310
 I think if you beat the jaguars the 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.789
 flowers also walks one lifting a 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.269
 little the saints class 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.359
 not because they follow the saints visiting from 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.670
 visit plays plays well in saints comes 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:21.370
 to lose the same here in the toluca that 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.290
 it seems that he played to lose against files 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.510
 the blue cross counter that also comes from 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.760
 lose with the querétaro 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.760
 I believe that I 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.790
 alone here 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.520
 to whom I'm not going against venezuela 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.640
 better with the local and the local of usa 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.000
 against mexico 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.650
 and pro bowl scale on 17 06 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.620
 in america monterrey then I stay 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.520
 so fixed with the america's local 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.300
 fixed with the local tiger 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.810
 and here I because I made a draw 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.290
 plus 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.810
 tigers against 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.990
 when they treat it all because it wins 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.960
 saints or tie 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.240
 for what 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.100
 here I have put him in the work of the consul 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.490
 proactive to put a tie 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.490
 toluca 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.980
 in dallas vancouver I prefer the 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.160
 oscar 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.920

 in san josé against philadelphia me 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.650
 I stay with San Jose 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.920
 to whom African migrant 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.659
 men from Kenya against Nambia had not 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.500
 won no match in the tie 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:04.600
 african 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.980
 and Namibia won at home in a first 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.470
 part in the first game that is 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.520
 they faced so I still stay with 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.520
 the tie here 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.370
 in the Burkina Faso against Gabon 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.370
 I stay with the local Burkina Faso 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.360
 and in Angola against liberia I'm left with 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.360
 the tie 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.639
 since angola more local cattle the 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:35.729
 Liberian has won a visitor with a 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.550
