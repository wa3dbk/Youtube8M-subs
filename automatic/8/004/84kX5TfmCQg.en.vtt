the<00:01:43.409> City<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.710> Vancouver<00:01:43.799> has<00:01:44.310> had<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.579> much

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
okay two each and can you believe that

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.080 
okay two each and can you believe that
I<00:01:51.149> mean<00:01:51.810> Vancouver<00:01:52.409> has<00:01:52.590> made<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.430> top

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
I mean Vancouver has made the top

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.780 
I mean Vancouver has made the top
liveable<00:01:54.630> cities<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.680> world<00:01:55.920> list

liveable cities in the world list

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.090 
liveable cities in the world list
they<00:01:57.420> were<00:01:57.479> probably<00:01:57.899> number<00:01:58.110> one<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> few

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
they were probably number one for a few

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.789 
they were probably number one for a few
years<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.780> their<00:02:00.780> top<00:02:00.960> probably<00:02:01.290> top<00:02:01.409> 10<00:02:01.649> or

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
years and their top probably top 10 or

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.940 
years and their top probably top 10 or
less<00:02:01.829> last<00:02:02.430> five<00:02:02.640> years

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
less last five years
