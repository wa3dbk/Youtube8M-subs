some<00:00:44.850> major<00:00:45.059> flooding<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:46.079> as<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.410> see<00:00:46.469> I

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
some major flooding but as you can see I

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.770 
some major flooding but as you can see I
was<00:00:46.890> stopped<00:00:47.190> along<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.579> way<00:00:47.730> by<00:00:48.120> some<00:00:48.480> major

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
was stopped along the way by some major

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.490 
was stopped along the way by some major
flooding<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:51.570> water<00:00:51.780> was<00:00:51.930> rising<00:00:52.110> quite

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
flooding the water was rising quite

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.439 
flooding the water was rising quite
quickly<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.160> turned<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> car<00:00:54.000> around<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
quickly so I turned the car around to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.209 
quickly so I turned the car around to
find<00:00:54.660> another<00:00:54.960> route<00:00:55.230> around<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> other

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
find another route around to the other

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.950 
find another route around to the other
side<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> valley<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
side of the valley you can see on the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.680 
side of the valley you can see on the
weather<00:00:58.170> map<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> car<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.699> orange<00:01:00.420> bands

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.439 
weather map in the car the orange bands
are<00:01:00.899> actually<00:01:01.289> where<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.649> are<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.489> sure

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
are actually where we are and sure

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.060 
are actually where we are and sure
enough<00:01:03.480> ran<00:01:03.989> right<00:01:04.199> into<00:01:04.350> another<00:01:04.710> roadblock

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
enough ran right into another roadblock

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.219 
enough ran right into another roadblock
that<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.090> caused<00:01:06.299> by<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.570> small<00:01:06.840> little

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
that was caused by this small little

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.539 
that was caused by this small little
puddle<00:01:07.560> down<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> bottom<00:01:08.070> here

puddle down at the bottom here

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.330 
puddle down at the bottom here
I<00:01:08.580> stuck<00:01:08.939> my<00:01:08.970> camera<00:01:09.630> through<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.960> sunroof<00:01:10.560> in

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
I stuck my camera through the sunroof in

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.920 
I stuck my camera through the sunroof in
order<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> get<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:11.970> footage<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.720> lens

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
order to get this footage and the lens

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.570 
order to get this footage and the lens
started<00:01:13.350> fogging<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:13.860> almost<00:01:14.189> immediately

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
started fogging up almost immediately

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.820 
started fogging up almost immediately
that<00:01:15.450> will<00:01:15.600> happen<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:15.990> any<00:01:16.259> camera<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that will happen with any camera if you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.440 
that will happen with any camera if you
keep<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> cool<00:01:17.520> car<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:18.119> stick<00:01:18.420> it

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
keep it in a cool car and then stick it

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.929 
keep it in a cool car and then stick it
out<00:01:18.659> into<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> very<00:01:19.710> moist<00:01:20.040> air<00:01:20.460> from<00:01:20.640> this

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
out into the very moist air from this

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.080 
out into the very moist air from this
hurricane<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:22.100> had<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.250> much<00:01:23.400> fun<00:01:23.640> doing<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
hurricane I had so much fun doing it the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.609 
hurricane I had so much fun doing it the
first<00:01:24.119> time<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.750> turned<00:01:25.020> around<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
first time that I turned around to do it

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
first time that I turned around to do it
again<00:01:25.920> actually<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> road<00:01:26.909> was<00:01:27.119> blocked<00:01:27.270> in

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
again actually the road was blocked in

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.450 
again actually the road was blocked in
the<00:01:27.570> other<00:01:27.750> direction<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.829> time<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> kept<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the other direction this time I kept the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.730 
the other direction this time I kept the
camera<00:01:29.729> inside<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> car<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.229> clearer

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
camera inside the car to get a clearer

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.880 
camera inside the car to get a clearer
shot<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.250> less<00:01:32.520> fogging

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.730 

I<00:01:39.720> finally<00:01:40.720> made<00:01:40.900> my<00:01:40.930> way<00:01:41.200> over<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.500> the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.380 
long before this footage was shot I
couldn't<00:01:57.340> have<00:01:57.430> even<00:01:57.490> stood<00:01:57.910> where<00:01:58.119> I<00:01:58.150> was

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
couldn't have even stood where I was

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.940 
couldn't have even stood where I was
because<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.840> water<00:01:58.990> was<00:01:59.170> another<00:01:59.470> six<00:01:59.770> feet

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
because the water was another six feet

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.260 
because the water was another six feet
higher<00:02:00.190> than<00:02:00.220> what<00:02:00.820> you're<00:02:00.970> seeing<00:02:01.180> right

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
higher than what you're seeing right

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.070 
higher than what you're seeing right
here

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.600 

Hurricane<00:02:08.080> Irene<00:02:08.259> caused<00:02:08.739> very<00:02:09.009> little<00:02:09.369> wind

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
Hurricane Irene caused very little wind

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.910 
Hurricane Irene caused very little wind
damage<00:02:10.090> in<00:02:10.239> our<00:02:10.330> area<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:11.140> was<00:02:11.290> really<00:02:11.560> more<00:02:11.739> to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
damage in our area it was really more to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.330 
damage in our area it was really more to
the<00:02:12.069> heavy<00:02:12.400> rains<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.060> flooding<00:02:13.500> such<00:02:14.500> as<00:02:14.680> as

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
the heavy rains and flooding such as as

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.180 
the heavy rains and flooding such as as
you<00:02:15.580> see<00:02:15.760> here<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.300> caused<00:02:17.010> creeks<00:02:18.010> to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
you see here that caused creeks to

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.449 
you see here that caused creeks to
overflow<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.000> dams<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.720> break<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.250> lots<00:02:21.250> of

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
overflow and dams to break and lots of

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.970 
overflow and dams to break and lots of
flooding<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.569> occur<00:02:22.629> on<00:02:22.900> major<00:02:23.140> roads<00:02:23.260> think

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
flooding to occur on major roads think

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.289 
flooding to occur on major roads think
it's<00:02:24.160> going<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.400> take<00:02:24.519> us<00:02:24.640> up<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.910> base<00:02:25.150> to

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
it's going to take us up a base to

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:42.780 
it's going to take us up a base to
recover<00:02:25.629> from<00:02:25.810> all<00:02:25.959> of<00:02:26.110> this<00:02:26.879> if<00:02:27.879> not<00:02:28.150> weeks

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.940 

standing<00:02:43.790> next<00:02:43.939> to<00:02:44.060> this<00:02:44.299> Creek<00:02:44.689> it's<00:02:45.469> hard<00:02:45.859> to

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
standing next to this Creek it's hard to

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.500 
standing next to this Creek it's hard to
believe<00:02:46.249> how<00:02:46.579> much<00:02:46.790> water<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.299> actually

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
believe how much water is actually

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.569 
believe how much water is actually
flowing<00:02:47.689> through<00:02:48.079> here<00:02:48.469> as<00:02:49.069> I<00:02:49.249> said<00:02:49.430> it's

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
flowing through here as I said it's

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:58.180 
flowing through here as I said it's
usually<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:49.999> very<00:02:50.239> very<00:02:50.540> calm<00:02:50.840> Creek

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.500 

at<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.370> point<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.700> was<00:02:59.849> wondering<00:03:00.180> what<00:03:00.360> else

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
at this point I was wondering what else

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.290 
at this point I was wondering what else
Hurricane<00:03:01.200> Irene<00:03:01.410> had<00:03:01.800> in<00:03:01.980> store<00:03:02.280> because<00:03:03.150> it

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
Hurricane Irene had in store because it

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.509 
Hurricane Irene had in store because it
by<00:03:04.080> all<00:03:04.440> predictions<00:03:04.800> we<00:03:05.040> were<00:03:05.129> only<00:03:05.220> halfway

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
by all predictions we were only halfway

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.089 
by all predictions we were only halfway
through<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.940> storm<00:03:06.269> so<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.140> taken<00:03:07.860> this

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
through the storm so I taken this

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.309 
through the storm so I taken this
footage<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.610> it's<00:03:09.360> just<00:03:09.569> about<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.930> back<00:03:10.110> off

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
footage and it's just about to back off

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.630 
footage and it's just about to back off
from<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.620> bridge<00:03:10.800> I<00:03:10.920> want<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.250> note<00:03:11.459> the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
from the bridge I want you to note the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.759 
from the bridge I want you to note the
metal<00:03:11.970> fence<00:03:12.450> it's<00:03:12.690> there<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.140> exactly<00:03:13.560> where

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
metal fence it's there and exactly where

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.050 
metal fence it's there and exactly where
I<00:03:13.800> am<00:03:13.890> standing<00:03:14.220> when<00:03:14.519> I'm<00:03:14.610> taking<00:03:14.940> this

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
I am standing when I'm taking this

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.820 
I am standing when I'm taking this
footage<00:03:15.390> because<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.349> is<00:03:16.410> what<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.650> looked

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
footage because this is what it looked

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.530 
footage because this is what it looked
like<00:03:16.860> as<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.220> approached<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.580> bridge<00:03:18.030> only<00:03:18.360> a

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
like as I approached the bridge only a

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.330 
like as I approached the bridge only a
few<00:03:18.750> seconds<00:03:19.170> before<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:20.040> few<00:03:20.220> minutes

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
few seconds before and a few minutes

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.860 
few seconds before and a few minutes
later<00:03:20.550> this<00:03:20.970> is<00:03:21.120> what<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.360> looked<00:03:21.510> like<00:03:21.599> when<00:03:21.810> a

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
later this is what it looked like when a

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.630 
later this is what it looked like when a
tree<00:03:22.170> came<00:03:22.349> down<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.860> landed<00:03:23.190> in<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.310> exact

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
tree came down and landed in the exact

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.369 
tree came down and landed in the exact
same<00:03:23.819> spot<00:03:24.000> where<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:24.420> had<00:03:24.629> been<00:03:24.660> standing<00:03:24.989> five

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
same spot where I had been standing five

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.270 
same spot where I had been standing five
minutes<00:03:25.680> before

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
minutes before

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.880

this<00:03:40.290> in<00:03:41.010> fact<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.640> what<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:41.849> looked<00:03:42.000> like

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
this in fact this is what it looked like

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.460 
this in fact this is what it looked like
last<00:03:42.180> spring<00:03:47.180> so<00:03:48.180> as<00:03:48.299> you<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.540> see<00:03:48.780> this<00:03:49.049> the
