00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.360
 how 

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.360
 ah 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.570
 very good everything goes up here as always 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.610
 with more but i feel 4 and today I'm playing 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.020
 once again a little bit of end are but 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.520
 this time I did not just decide 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.160
 try some other game modes like 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.869
 they will see me playing here what is everything 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.550
 against all teams and domination that a 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.560
 Although many will already know that I do not 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.939
 like I'm not the biggest fan these 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.019
 game mode I found that 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.090
 they work in a pretty way 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.679
 pretty good in even some of 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.809
 the maps that I had the opportunity to 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.760
 try it but on top of that and how 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.040
 says what is the title of the video 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.500
 I was probably unlocking the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.870
 two new accessories or equipment 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.570
 that come with the new end dlc 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.640
 are and what are the decoy and the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.280
 detector of objectives that I have here 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.629
 I will also obviously leave you in 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.370
 a part of the screen how 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.660
 unlock everything I did but it 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.149
 I'm going to count it the same as the detector 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.699
 you need to first reach the level level 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.210
 10 the level 10 tron play on a map of 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.589
 final stand have final are obviously 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.660
 get two gallons of sighting at 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.149
 which they do squeezing the cv and 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.130
 marking enemies I think eight times 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.270
 ten times for a game not even 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.040
 says that it has to be true in a 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.720
 game can get both 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.120
 need to be the same departure 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.950
 besides that they need to get 20 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.890
 Eliminations with a rifle deterioration 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.480
 designated or a carbine and that's it 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.280
 with that they are going to have their detector 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.410
 target a new accessory that detects 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.110
 objectives automatically and that you 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.940
 instant I think and they can equip it in 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.260
 everything they are carbines and rifles 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.140
 shooter designated as is what 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.760
 they need as part of the mission what 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.460
 are the advantages of this accessory 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.890
 first that is better than humans 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.830
 say you can not escape them from 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.290
 sight is a 1 a human can commit a 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.940
 error, I can not see it once 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.890
 I'm looking at the screen around the 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.270
 look, I may be covering the objective 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.550
 I can be looking in another part of the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.220
 screen as a lot has happened to us or 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.560
 whatever it is to the target detector that 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.229
 that's not going to happen to you, it's part of a 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.060
 computer is perfect let's say as 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.770
 is programmed how it's going to work and it's going 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.239
 unless you have a bug or some 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.700
 problem that I have not yet 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.140
 found will detect all the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.430
 objectives that have in front of you 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.110
 when they pass with their sights set 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.610
 obviously they are just running 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.680
 It does not work but if you have your sights set 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.400
 he will detect them in a 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.780
 automatically the truth 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.459
 good and many people say that it is also 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.739
 very good for consoles for what it is 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.200
 the control by how the buttons are on 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.510
 control but for pc it also serves a 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.340
 not too much but let's move on to what 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.010
 is the decoy we have complete the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.480
 misinformation mission we have again 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.609
 that reach rank 10 play in a 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.470
 final map are played to have final 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.359
 they are obviously not sure why they put it 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.739
 to that but good will affect 10 enemies 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.049
 with stun grenades 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.200
 m84 these are the flashbacks the only thing 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.760
 they need is the hit marker to appear 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.069
 Once you have a go when the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.659
 there is an enemy and that way and they're doing 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.190
 to tell is not not that it has to be 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.690
 Super Arrowhead is not that they have to 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.489
 kill once they are affected by the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.290
 Granada simply has to 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.790
 affect with the grenade it seems to me that 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.730
 game modes all against all teams 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.500
 domination and Russian assault are the best 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.950
 for this since they are going to find a 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.750
 greater let's say quantity of players in 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.129
 certain areas no no do not ask me for 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.799
 what did I shoot at the door and I do not have 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.780
 idea but as I already say probably 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.340
 if they are attacking in Russian game mode 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.170
 assault they will find a large amount 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.760
 of defenders in certain parts of the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.099
 new maps in which they will be 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.199
 all accumulated behind bits 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.819
 I do not know from somewhere in some corner 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.319
 for example they can have a flash panel 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.510
 and maybe 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.769
 stun 5 or 10 enemies of a 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.720
 simply according to the amount of 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.280
 players that are on the server or in 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.319
 a game of everything against all teams 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.810
 or domination already know they come out of 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.819
 responses together there is a great shooting 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.169
 they throw one and the middle throw they have three 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.849
 throw three everywhere 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.280
 that's probably the part 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.780
 very simple mission and in addition to 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.159
 that they need to get three 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.370
 melee eliminations 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.680
 basically they are kills or low with 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.569
 very simple knife have to play 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.040
 a little children can play 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.349
 there and can play any mode of 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.519
 game I played everything with all two 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.500
 equipment but I had a bit of luck 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.659
 because I managed to find people in the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.400
 minimap and it was a lot that's why people in 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.019
 the mini map I looked for what what 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.479
 they were watching me hit the back and the 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.489
 I killed from behind very, very easy and 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.560
 get the decoy which serves as 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.209
 in what was the harlem sale you 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.250
 it leaves it in a place like an ace 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.830
 4 but it creates a false image in the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.570
 enemy minimap and to think that good 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.090
 is to distract us simply for 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.110
 create fake false front-end images 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.880
 what is the minimum 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.740
 to distract a little they can throw it 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.480
 on the one hand, run for the other and go and 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.100
 you come from behind and stabbed one 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.140
 new person can do it now with 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.330
 him with his new knife Colonel 100 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.250
 with the power beat that unfortunately not 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.660
 we can put the floor but good and 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.040
 as always that has been all for today 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.600
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.100
 probably during this week they 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.150
 I will be bringing more this and all 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.740
 the videos putting together a little more 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.990
 varied gameplay to bring them 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.880
 different things and aspects of the dlc in 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.500
 general, but as I'm telling you, I'm going 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.030
 to try to bring as much of 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.560
 possible content during this week 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.390
 I hope you liked this video 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.740
 as always do not forget to follow me 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.270
 in everything that is the social networks of 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.770
 facebook and twitter down on the 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.390
 description is in the links for them 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.390
 and see you next time
