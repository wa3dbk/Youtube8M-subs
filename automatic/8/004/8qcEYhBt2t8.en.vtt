00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
know this can't draw a Spiker but here

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.190 
know this can't draw a Spiker but here
it<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> few<00:01:36.450> items<00:01:37.020> I

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it is I this is one of the few items I

it is I this is one of the few items I

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
do not have the treated your counterpart

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.700 
do not have the treated your counterpart
for<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.020> that's<00:01:40.170> why<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.650> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
for it so that's why it's not a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.130 
for it so that's why it's not a
comparison<00:01:41.159> review<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.119> don't<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.689> the

all right and that is all she wrote
through<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.830> now<00:02:32.580> we'll<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:32.850> set<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.060> aside

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
through that now we'll just set it aside

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.309 
through that now we'll just set it aside
briefly<00:02:33.630> because<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:33.900> are<00:02:33.959> going<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.230> be

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
briefly because we are going to be

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.340 
briefly because we are going to be

needing it crunch yep that's it dinosaur
okay<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.430> here's<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.700> weapon<00:02:39.090> as<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.360> mentioned

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
okay so here's the weapon as I mentioned

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.750 
okay so here's the weapon as I mentioned
this<00:02:39.959> is<00:02:40.170> supposed<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.920> be<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.190> main<00:02:41.370> combined

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
this is supposed to be the main combined

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.460 
this is supposed to be the main combined
weapon<00:02:42.120> from<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.330> year<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:42.989> they<00:02:43.080> decided<00:02:43.350> to

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
weapon from the year but they decided to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.780 
weapon from the year but they decided to
do<00:02:43.709> things<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.010> little<00:02:44.069> bit<00:02:44.220> differently<00:02:44.640> which

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
do things a little bit differently which

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.120 
do things a little bit differently which
I'm<00:02:44.940> sure<00:02:45.120> upsets<00:02:45.480> some<00:02:45.569> people<00:02:45.830> now<00:02:46.830> on<00:02:46.950> its

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
I'm sure upsets some people now on its

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.620 
I'm sure upsets some people now on its
own<00:02:47.280> honestly<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.819> doesn't<00:02:48.060> look<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.269> bad

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
own honestly it doesn't look that bad

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.710 
own honestly it doesn't look that bad
it's<00:02:49.170> not<00:02:49.350> 100%<00:02:49.709> show<00:02:50.069> accurate<00:02:50.280> as<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:51.239> have

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
it's not 100% show accurate as you have

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.690 
it's not 100% show accurate as you have
this<00:02:51.870> lining<00:02:52.350> here<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.739> whatnot<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.610> you

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
this lining here and whatnot that you

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.340 
this lining here and whatnot that you
wouldn't<00:02:54.030> have<00:02:54.120> with<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.390> combined<00:02:54.690> mode<00:02:54.930> and

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
wouldn't have with the combined mode and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.840 
wouldn't have with the combined mode and
I<00:02:55.470> know<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.739> Japanese<00:02:55.890> toy<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.400> essentially

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
I know the Japanese toy is essentially

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.110 
I know the Japanese toy is essentially
just<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.120> series<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.450> small<00:02:57.780> little<00:02:57.989> toys<00:02:59.120> you

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
just a series of small little toys you

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.330 
just a series of small little toys you
know<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:01.260> combined<00:03:01.650> weapon<00:03:02.100> for<00:03:02.250> this

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
know the the combined weapon for this

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.949 
know the the combined weapon for this
year<00:03:02.549> is<00:03:02.640> very<00:03:02.819> interesting<00:03:03.480> in<00:03:03.600> terms<00:03:03.630> of<00:03:03.870> the

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
year is very interesting in terms of the

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.080 
year is very interesting in terms of the
weapons<00:03:04.350> there<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.650> think<00:03:04.830> it's<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.069> very<00:03:05.250> unique

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
weapons there I think it's a very unique

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.420 
weapons there I think it's a very unique
and<00:03:06.269> slightly<00:03:06.540> weird<00:03:06.840> style<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.319> do<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:08.340> to

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
and slightly weird style to do it so to

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.710 
and slightly weird style to do it so to
be<00:03:08.549> honest<00:03:08.790> I'm<00:03:08.910> not<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.090> hundred<00:03:09.239> percent<00:03:09.360> mad

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
be honest I'm not a hundred percent mad

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.120 
be honest I'm not a hundred percent mad
we<00:03:09.930> didn't<00:03:10.170> get<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> traditional<00:03:10.769> version

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
we didn't get a traditional version

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.410 
we didn't get a traditional version
because<00:03:11.340> if<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.579> just<00:03:11.700> ended<00:03:11.910> up<00:03:11.940> being<00:03:12.000> all

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
because if it just ended up being all

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.710 
because if it just ended up being all
these<00:03:13.049> really<00:03:13.380> small<00:03:13.769> weapons<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.540> think

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
these really small weapons and I think

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.210 
these really small weapons and I think
they<00:03:15.780> did<00:03:15.900> something<00:03:15.930> cool<00:03:16.260> here<00:03:16.530> but<00:03:16.560> it's

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
they did something cool here but it's

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.280 
they did something cool here but it's
not<00:03:17.400> 100%<00:03:17.670> as<00:03:18.329> accurate<00:03:18.720> as<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.019> other<00:03:19.140> toy

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
not 100% as accurate as the other toy

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.140 
not 100% as accurate as the other toy
would<00:03:19.500> be<00:03:19.620> or<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:20.190> as<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.489> is<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:20.700> show<00:03:20.880> as<00:03:21.060> you

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
would be or it as it is to show as you

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.390 
would be or it as it is to show as you
saw<00:03:21.299> on<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.570> back<00:03:21.780> but<00:03:22.260> it's<00:03:22.410> still<00:03:22.709> for<00:03:23.310> the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
saw on the back but it's still for the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.770 
saw on the back but it's still for the
most<00:03:23.579> part<00:03:23.790> captures<00:03:24.180> what<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.420> looks<00:03:24.600> like

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
most part captures what it looks like

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.479 
most part captures what it looks like
and<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.230> paint<00:03:25.500> looks<00:03:25.709> good<00:03:25.829> it's<00:03:26.100> nice<00:03:26.250> and

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
and the paint looks good it's nice and

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.509 
and the paint looks good it's nice and
vibrant<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:27.450> really<00:03:27.959> don't<00:03:28.140> mind<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.530> at<00:03:28.650> all<00:03:28.799> in

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
vibrant I really don't mind it at all in

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.650 
vibrant I really don't mind it at all in
that<00:03:29.700> respect<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.209> can<00:03:30.299> see<00:03:30.420> there's<00:03:30.600> a

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
that respect you can see there's a

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.819 
that respect you can see there's a
different<00:03:30.959> thing<00:03:31.109> on<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.290> side<00:03:31.470> there<00:03:31.680> for

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
different thing on the side there for

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.410 
different thing on the side there for
what<00:03:31.920> its<00:03:32.040> gonna<00:03:32.100> function<00:03:32.370> as<00:03:32.640> there's<00:03:33.299> gonna

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
what its gonna function as there's gonna

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.199 
what its gonna function as there's gonna
be<00:03:33.540> an<00:03:33.630> LED<00:03:33.930> there<00:03:34.730> now<00:03:35.730> there's<00:03:35.910> an<00:03:36.030> off

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
be an LED there now there's an off

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.430 
be an LED there now there's an off
switch<00:03:36.299> right<00:03:36.420> here<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:36.930> let's<00:03:36.989> go<00:03:37.200> ahead<00:03:37.290> and

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
switch right here so let's go ahead and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.360 
switch right here so let's go ahead and
do<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.320> get<00:03:40.410> activation<00:03:40.859> noises

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
do that so you get activation noises

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.460 
do that so you get activation noises
alright<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.269> you'll<00:03:42.450> you'll<00:03:42.750> have<00:03:42.959> some

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
alright so you'll you'll have some

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.740 
alright so you'll you'll have some
noises<00:03:43.650> without<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> battery<00:03:44.519> in<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:44.940> so

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.940 

so<00:03:49.750> make<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:49.989> noise<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:50.560> saw<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.739> light

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
so make that noise and you saw the light

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.780 
so make that noise and you saw the light
right<00:03:51.129> there<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:57.010> you<00:03:57.040> keep<00:03:57.459> getting<00:03:57.580> that

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
right there so you keep getting that

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.900 
right there so you keep getting that
noise<00:03:59.910> over<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.090> over<00:04:01.269> again<00:04:02.700> now<00:04:03.700> what's

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
noise over and over again now what's

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.550 
noise over and over again now what's
cool<00:04:04.090> about<00:04:04.150> this<00:04:04.569> which<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.019> different<00:04:05.440> is

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
cool about this which is different is

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.470 
cool about this which is different is
when<00:04:05.769> you<00:04:05.830> pull<00:04:06.040> this<00:04:06.160> lever<00:04:06.340> here<00:04:06.760> these<00:04:07.180> will

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
when you pull this lever here these will

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.150 
when you pull this lever here these will
like<00:04:07.780> swing<00:04:08.200> around<00:04:08.319> and<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:08.800> almost<00:04:08.920> becomes

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
like swing around and it almost becomes

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.650 
like swing around and it almost becomes
like<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.519> different<00:04:09.880> toy<00:04:10.060> I'm<00:04:10.269> gonna<00:04:10.390> try<00:04:10.630> to

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
like a different toy I'm gonna try to

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.449 
like a different toy I'm gonna try to
get<00:04:10.870> this<00:04:11.019> on<00:04:11.200> camera<00:04:11.440> so<00:04:11.590> bit<00:04:12.130> of<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.280> tight

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
get this on camera so bit of a tight

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.770 
get this on camera so bit of a tight
squeeze<00:04:12.700> without<00:04:13.060> trying<00:04:13.330> to<00:04:13.390> knock<00:04:13.510> over<00:04:13.660> the

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
squeeze without trying to knock over the

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.920 
squeeze without trying to knock over the
camera<00:04:14.099> that<00:04:15.099> works<00:04:15.370> perfectly<00:04:15.760> so<00:04:16.239> as<00:04:16.840> you

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
camera that works perfectly so as you

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.310 
camera that works perfectly so as you
can<00:04:17.019> see<00:04:17.079> boom<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:19.180> it<00:04:19.359> makes<00:04:19.540> that<00:04:19.750> chopping

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
can see boom and it makes that chopping

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.569 
can see boom and it makes that chopping
noise<00:04:20.500> if<00:04:20.650> you<00:04:20.709> do<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:20.889> five<00:04:21.040> times<00:04:21.070> so<00:04:21.489> I<00:04:21.549> have

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
noise if you do it five times so I have

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.590 
noise if you do it five times so I have
three<00:04:21.850> more<00:04:23.850> good<00:04:24.850> to<00:04:24.970> do<00:04:25.060> this<00:04:25.150> Accession<00:04:25.510> I

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
three more good to do this Accession I

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.550 
three more good to do this Accession I
guess<00:04:27.120> there<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.210> go<00:04:28.330> it's<00:04:29.139> usually<00:04:29.229> five

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
guess there you go it's usually five

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.030 
guess there you go it's usually five
times<00:04:29.860> so<00:04:34.410> you'll<00:04:35.410> get<00:04:35.560> a<00:04:35.620> growling<00:04:35.889> noise

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
times so you'll get a growling noise

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.520 
times so you'll get a growling noise
like<00:04:36.430> that<00:04:36.639> but<00:04:36.820> it<00:04:36.910> just<00:04:36.940> once<00:04:37.360> it'll<00:04:38.320> be<00:04:38.410> like

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
like that but it just once it'll be like

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.900 
like that but it just once it'll be like
that<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:39.040> of<00:04:39.130> course<00:04:39.190> it's<00:04:39.490> supposed<00:04:39.700> to<00:04:39.760> be

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
that and of course it's supposed to be

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.820 
that and of course it's supposed to be
more<00:04:40.090> so<00:04:40.240> seen<00:04:40.450> from<00:04:40.600> this<00:04:40.750> angle<00:04:40.960> I<00:04:41.290> was<00:04:41.710> just

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
more so seen from this angle I was just

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.170 
more so seen from this angle I was just
trying<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.100> do<00:04:42.220> it<00:04:42.310> on<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:42.430> better<00:04:42.639> angle<00:04:42.970> that<00:04:43.150> I

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
trying to do it on a better angle that I

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.530 
trying to do it on a better angle that I
was<00:04:43.710> chomping<00:04:44.710> for<00:04:44.889> chomping<00:04:45.550> for<00:04:45.760> WoW<00:04:46.060> but

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
was chomping for chomping for WoW but

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.390 
was chomping for chomping for WoW but
yeah<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:47.080> becomes<00:04:47.440> almost<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.860> different<00:04:47.979> toy

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
yeah it becomes almost a different toy

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.450 
yeah it becomes almost a different toy
has<00:04:48.729> like<00:04:48.940> this<00:04:49.090> totally<00:04:49.840> different<00:04:50.460> like

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
has like this totally different like

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.190 
has like this totally different like
clamping<00:04:52.000> toy<00:04:52.180> here<00:04:52.479> this<00:04:52.660> whole<00:04:53.110> other

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
clamping toy here this whole other

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.080 
clamping toy here this whole other
dinosaur<00:04:53.770> face<00:04:53.979> on<00:04:54.250> it

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
dinosaur face on it

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.520 
dinosaur face on it
which<00:04:55.330> comes<00:04:55.630> from<00:04:55.840> and<00:04:56.020> obviously<00:04:56.350> what's

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
which comes from and obviously what's

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.350 
which comes from and obviously what's
kind<00:04:56.710> of<00:04:56.740> funny<00:04:56.979> on<00:04:57.160> that<00:04:57.340> side<00:04:57.580> but<00:04:58.090> I<00:04:58.150> think

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
kind of funny on that side but I think

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.360 
kind of funny on that side but I think
that's<00:04:58.479> kind<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.750> neat<00:04:58.960> obviously<00:04:59.710> that's<00:05:00.250> not

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
that's kind of neat obviously that's not

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.879 
that's kind of neat obviously that's not
what<00:05:00.669> it<00:05:00.789> does<00:05:00.940> in<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.180> show<00:05:01.560> but<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:02.590> think

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
what it does in the show but I think

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.650 
what it does in the show but I think
it's<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.070> really<00:05:03.639> fun<00:05:03.669> feature<00:05:04.150> I<00:05:04.300> think<00:05:04.570> in

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
it's a really fun feature I think in

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.510 
it's a really fun feature I think in
particular<00:05:05.110> for<00:05:05.289> kids<00:05:05.560> that'll<00:05:06.250> be<00:05:06.370> pretty

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
particular for kids that'll be pretty

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.250 
particular for kids that'll be pretty
fun<00:05:06.850> it's<00:05:07.030> like<00:05:07.180> hell<00:05:07.389> I<00:05:07.600> even<00:05:07.630> thought<00:05:08.229> that

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
fun it's like hell I even thought that

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.290 
fun it's like hell I even thought that
was<00:05:08.560> just<00:05:08.740> fun<00:05:08.860> just<00:05:09.130> doing<00:05:09.370> that<00:05:09.520> it's<00:05:10.120> just

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
was just fun just doing that it's just

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.920 
was just fun just doing that it's just
fun<00:05:10.600> to<00:05:10.630> do<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:12.550> it<00:05:13.030> works<00:05:13.210> pretty<00:05:13.450> well<00:05:13.570> there

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
fun to do and it works pretty well there

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.510 
fun to do and it works pretty well there
are<00:05:13.990> times<00:05:14.169> sometimes<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.979> alignments<00:05:15.460> and

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
are times sometimes the alignments and

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.330 
are times sometimes the alignments and
the<00:05:15.610> mechanism<00:05:16.090> will<00:05:16.240> will<00:05:16.810> go<00:05:17.800> off<00:05:18.010> and

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
the mechanism will will go off and

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.790 
the mechanism will will go off and
you'll<00:05:18.430> have<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:18.760> reset<00:05:19.150> it<00:05:19.380> but<00:05:20.380> when<00:05:20.680> it

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
you'll have to reset it but when it

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.379 
you'll have to reset it but when it
works<00:05:20.979> it<00:05:21.310> feels<00:05:21.580> really<00:05:21.789> good<00:05:22.030> you<00:05:22.090> know<00:05:22.330> you

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
works it feels really good you know you

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.060 
works it feels really good you know you
can<00:05:22.570> clamp<00:05:22.780> it<00:05:22.900> together<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.590> when<00:05:23.830> you<00:05:23.889> pull

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
can clamp it together and when you pull

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.070 
can clamp it together and when you pull
it<00:05:24.190> back<00:05:24.220> it<00:05:24.490> snaps<00:05:24.760> right<00:05:25.000> into<00:05:25.180> place<00:05:25.300> so

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
it back it snaps right into place so

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.770 
it back it snaps right into place so
long<00:05:26.229> as<00:05:26.350> you<00:05:26.470> have<00:05:26.680> everything<00:05:26.919> in<00:05:27.160> alignment

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
long as you have everything in alignment

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.000 
long as you have everything in alignment
no<00:05:28.780> you<00:05:28.840> do<00:05:29.050> get<00:05:29.200> sounds<00:05:29.530> once<00:05:29.710> you<00:05:29.770> put<00:05:29.919> the

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
no you do get sounds once you put the

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.260 
no you do get sounds once you put the
charger<00:05:30.340> in<00:05:30.490> so<00:05:31.120> let's<00:05:31.270> go<00:05:31.389> ahead<00:05:31.479> and<00:05:31.690> do<00:05:31.780> that

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
charger in so let's go ahead and do that

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.460 
charger in so let's go ahead and do that
so<00:05:34.270> you<00:05:34.330> get<00:05:34.450> some<00:05:34.570> nice<00:05:34.690> activation<00:05:35.289> sounds

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
so you get some nice activation sounds

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.110 
so you get some nice activation sounds
which<00:05:35.740> is<00:05:35.860> really<00:05:36.099> nice<00:05:36.280> it<00:05:36.550> makes<00:05:36.729> it<00:05:36.910> feel

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
which is really nice it makes it feel

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.150 
which is really nice it makes it feel
more<00:05:37.840> mechanical<00:05:38.410> and<00:05:38.590> you<00:05:38.650> get<00:05:38.770> a<00:05:38.800> different

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
more mechanical and you get a different

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.990 
more mechanical and you get a different
noise<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.430> you<00:05:39.490> press<00:05:39.669> this<00:05:39.820> button

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.040 

do<00:05:46.000> it<00:05:46.060> one<00:05:46.180> more<00:05:46.210> time<00:05:51.420> okay<00:05:52.420> and<00:05:52.660> now<00:05:52.990> you

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
do it one more time okay and now you

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.150 
do it one more time okay and now you
will<00:05:53.200> also<00:05:53.440> get<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.590> different<00:05:53.890> noise<00:05:54.010> than<00:05:54.100> you

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
will also get a different noise than you

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.210 
will also get a different noise than you
do<00:05:54.280> this<00:05:55.320> so<00:05:56.320> let's<00:05:56.500> do<00:05:56.620> it<00:05:56.710> from<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:56.890> proper

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
do this so let's do it from the proper

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:08.460 
do this so let's do it from the proper
angle<00:05:57.460> this<00:05:57.580> time<00:05:59.940> if<00:06:00.940> you<00:06:07.080> get<00:06:08.080> a<00:06:08.140> slightly

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
angle this time if you get a slightly

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:15.870 
angle this time if you get a slightly
different<00:06:08.860> noise<00:06:09.580> there<00:06:14.700> so<00:06:15.700> you<00:06:15.760> get<00:06:15.850> a

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
different noise there so you get a

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.040 
different noise there so you get a
slightly<00:06:16.090> different<00:06:16.180> more<00:06:16.540> noise<00:06:16.750> and<00:06:16.780> some

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
slightly different more noise and some

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.440 
slightly different more noise and some
slightly<00:06:17.290> different<00:06:17.410> noises<00:06:17.850> if<00:06:18.850> you<00:06:19.030> have<00:06:19.300> it

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
slightly different noises if you have it

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.940 
slightly different noises if you have it
in<00:06:19.570> this<00:06:19.720> mode<00:06:19.990> and<00:06:20.320> press<00:06:21.160> this<00:06:21.370> clash<00:06:21.790> button

whether you have a dino charger in or

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.630 
whether you have a dino charger in or
not<00:06:26.110> we'll<00:06:26.260> make<00:06:26.350> the<00:06:26.500> same<00:06:26.650> noise<00:06:26.890> all<00:06:27.400> the

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
not we'll make the same noise all the

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.920 
not we'll make the same noise all the
noises<00:06:27.820> that<00:06:28.000> come<00:06:28.210> from<00:06:28.330> this<00:06:28.540> mode<00:06:28.720> come

noises that come from this mode come

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.470 
noises that come from this mode come
from<00:06:29.080> the<00:06:29.170> chopping<00:06:29.590> well<00:06:30.580> so<00:06:30.670> yeah<00:06:30.820> that's<00:06:31.060> me

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
from the chopping well so yeah that's me

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.330 
from the chopping well so yeah that's me
slides<00:06:31.780> right<00:06:31.870> back<00:06:31.990> into<00:06:32.290> place<00:06:32.500> and<00:06:32.770> then<00:06:33.220> to

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
slides right back into place and then to

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.560 
slides right back into place and then to
take<00:06:33.520> out<00:06:33.640> the<00:06:33.790> charger<00:06:34.150> there's<00:06:34.330> a<00:06:34.360> little

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
take out the charger there's a little

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.880 
take out the charger there's a little
button<00:06:34.810> right<00:06:34.840> under<00:06:35.200> here<00:06:35.410> and<00:06:35.590> just<00:06:35.770> press

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
button right under here and just press

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.280 
button right under here and just press
it<00:06:36.130> and<00:06:36.430> it<00:06:37.090> actually<00:06:37.240> makes<00:06:37.570> an<00:06:37.900> exiting

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
it and it actually makes an exiting

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.810 
it and it actually makes an exiting
sound<00:06:38.560> which<00:06:38.740> also<00:06:39.130> I<00:06:39.370> think<00:06:39.430> is<00:06:39.640> just<00:06:39.760> a

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
sound which also I think is just a

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.100 
sound which also I think is just a
really<00:06:40.000> nice<00:06:40.120> touch<00:06:40.390> like<00:06:40.600> I<00:06:40.690> said<00:06:40.870> it<00:06:40.990> makes

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
really nice touch like I said it makes

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.410 
really nice touch like I said it makes
it<00:06:41.290> feel<00:06:41.460> I'm<00:06:42.460> gonna<00:06:42.610> redo<00:06:42.850> it<00:06:42.970> because<00:06:43.210> it's

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.420 
it feel I'm gonna redo it because it's

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.870 
it feel I'm gonna redo it because it's
stuck<00:06:43.930> in<00:06:44.050> there<00:06:44.280> it<00:06:45.280> can<00:06:45.370> be<00:06:45.520> a<00:06:45.550> smidgen

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
stuck in there it can be a smidgen

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.790 
stuck in there it can be a smidgen
nothing<00:06:46.060> to<00:06:46.150> get<00:06:46.270> out<00:06:46.420> exciting<00:06:47.140> out<00:06:47.230> but<00:06:47.770> I

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
nothing to get out exciting out but I

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.680 
nothing to get out exciting out but I
love<00:06:47.920> that<00:06:48.340> it<00:06:48.460> has<00:06:48.490> activation<00:06:49.270> and<00:06:49.480> like

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
love that it has activation and like

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.510 
love that it has activation and like
deactivation<00:06:50.380> noises<00:06:50.770> it's<00:06:51.130> just<00:06:51.280> kind<00:06:51.430> of

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
deactivation noises it's just kind of

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.680 
deactivation noises it's just kind of
like<00:06:51.730> I<00:06:51.850> said<00:06:51.910> it<00:06:52.120> gives<00:06:52.210> us<00:06:52.420> a<00:06:52.510> more

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
like I said it gives us a more

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.440 
like I said it gives us a more
mechanical<00:06:53.260> feel<00:06:53.500> it<00:06:53.860> just<00:06:54.100> makes<00:06:54.280> it<00:06:54.430> feel

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450 
mechanical feel it just makes it feel

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.850 
mechanical feel it just makes it feel
I<00:06:55.480> don't<00:06:55.960> know<00:06:56.020> nicer<00:06:56.350> somehow<00:06:56.680> I'm<00:06:56.830> not

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:56.860 
I don't know nicer somehow I'm not

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.830 
I don't know nicer somehow I'm not
entirely<00:06:57.700> sure<00:06:57.880> how<00:06:57.970> to<00:06:58.090> describe<00:06:58.480> it<00:06:58.540> but

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
entirely sure how to describe it but

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.200 
entirely sure how to describe it but
overall<00:06:59.710> I<00:06:59.980> ended<00:07:00.190> up<00:07:00.250> liking<00:07:00.520> this<00:07:00.790> toy<00:07:00.940> more

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
overall I ended up liking this toy more

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.760 
overall I ended up liking this toy more
than<00:07:01.360> I<00:07:01.450> thought<00:07:01.660> I<00:07:01.720> would<00:07:01.870> I<00:07:02.260> can<00:07:02.620> definitely

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
than I thought I would I can definitely

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.530 
than I thought I would I can definitely
see<00:07:03.220> people<00:07:03.520> being<00:07:03.700> disappointed<00:07:04.360> that

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:04.540 
see people being disappointed that

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.420 
see people being disappointed that
you're<00:07:05.410> not<00:07:05.500> getting<00:07:05.650> it<00:07:05.950> true<00:07:06.100> to<00:07:06.250> show

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430 
you're not getting it true to show

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.540 
you're not getting it true to show
version<00:07:07.140> but<00:07:08.140> you<00:07:08.410> know<00:07:08.530> go<00:07:08.890> for<00:07:09.100> the<00:07:09.190> control

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
version but you know go for the control

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.160 
version but you know go for the control
Spiker<00:07:09.760> if<00:07:09.970> you're<00:07:10.120> really<00:07:10.300> about<00:07:10.510> that<00:07:10.720> but<00:07:10.990> I

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.170 
Spiker if you're really about that but I

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.630 
Spiker if you're really about that but I
don't<00:07:11.530> think<00:07:11.650> this<00:07:11.830> is<00:07:11.860> that<00:07:12.130> bad

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:12.640 
don't think this is that bad

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.970 
don't think this is that bad
certainly<00:07:12.940> not<00:07:13.180> the<00:07:13.480> best<00:07:13.900> maybe<00:07:14.410> collector's

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:14.980 
certainly not the best maybe collector's

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.500 
certainly not the best maybe collector's
piece<00:07:15.220> but<00:07:15.400> like<00:07:15.550> I<00:07:15.670> mentioned<00:07:16.000> I<00:07:16.060> think<00:07:16.090> kids

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:16.510 
piece but like I mentioned I think kids

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.580 
piece but like I mentioned I think kids
will<00:07:16.600> have<00:07:16.690> a<00:07:16.750> lot<00:07:16.900> of<00:07:16.930> fun<00:07:17.140> with<00:07:17.290> this<00:07:17.410> because

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590 
will have a lot of fun with this because

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.350 
will have a lot of fun with this because
an<00:07:17.890> adult<00:07:18.250> I<00:07:18.430> thought<00:07:18.640> it<00:07:18.760> was<00:07:18.850> a<00:07:18.880> really<00:07:19.150> fun

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 
an adult I thought it was a really fun

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.030 
an adult I thought it was a really fun
toy<00:07:19.540> so<00:07:20.110> I<00:07:20.140> think<00:07:20.260> that<00:07:20.500> could<00:07:20.590> be<00:07:20.650> fun<00:07:20.890> for

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.040 
toy so I think that could be fun for

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.860 
toy so I think that could be fun for
kids<00:07:21.190> and<00:07:21.400> even<00:07:21.790> for<00:07:22.090> collectors<00:07:22.480> I<00:07:22.630> think

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870 
kids and even for collectors I think

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.750 
kids and even for collectors I think
it's<00:07:23.260> worth<00:07:23.500> at<00:07:23.680> least<00:07:23.710> checking<00:07:24.400> out<00:07:24.550> if

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:24.760 
it's worth at least checking out if

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.880 
it's worth at least checking out if
you're<00:07:24.910> not<00:07:24.940> that<00:07:25.360> upset<00:07:25.540> about<00:07:25.900> the

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:26.890 
you're not that upset about the

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.550 
you're not that upset about the
different<00:07:27.870> slightly<00:07:28.870> different<00:07:29.170> look<00:07:29.320> just

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 
different slightly different look just

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.050 
different slightly different look just
cuz<00:07:29.710> it's<00:07:29.830> got<00:07:29.980> kind<00:07:30.130> of<00:07:30.250> a<00:07:30.370> unique<00:07:30.580> flair<00:07:30.850> to

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 
cuz it's got kind of a unique flair to

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.000 
cuz it's got kind of a unique flair to
it<00:07:31.090> and<00:07:31.420> you<00:07:31.840> get<00:07:31.960> the<00:07:32.110> charger<00:07:32.500> there<00:07:32.680> but<00:07:32.860> so

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.010 
it and you get the charger there but so

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.070 
it and you get the charger there but so
it's<00:07:33.340> not<00:07:33.460> an<00:07:33.580> absolute<00:07:34.030> must-have<00:07:34.360> but<00:07:35.050> I

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.080 
it's not an absolute must-have but I

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.110 
it's not an absolute must-have but I
think<00:07:35.290> it's<00:07:35.410> a<00:07:35.500> pretty<00:07:35.680> fun<00:07:35.920> toy<00:07:36.130> but<00:07:36.850> anyway

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 
think it's a pretty fun toy but anyway

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.400 
think it's a pretty fun toy but anyway
that's<00:07:37.270> about<00:07:37.510> it<00:07:37.660> until<00:07:37.870> next<00:07:37.990> time<00:07:38.200> make<00:07:38.350> you
