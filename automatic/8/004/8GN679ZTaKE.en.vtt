it's easy money and yeah so yeah when

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.999 
it's easy money and yeah so yeah when
you're<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.049> do<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.560> best<00:02:01.799> thing

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
you're going to do this the best thing

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.940 
you're going to do this the best thing
is<00:02:02.130> obviously<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.820> try<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.290> busy<00:02:04.290> world<00:02:04.530> where

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
is obviously to try a busy world where

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.550 
is obviously to try a busy world where
people<00:02:05.219> are<00:02:05.460> probably<00:02:06.210> luring<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.380> can

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
people are probably luring and you can

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.369 
people are probably luring and you can
stand<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.610> bank<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:09.209> there<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.690> usually

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
stand the bank just there and usually

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.430 
stand the bank just there and usually
they're<00:02:10.560> asking<00:02:11.160> people<00:02:11.489> around<00:02:11.700> for

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
they're asking people around for

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.890 
they're asking people around for
beyond<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.190> video<00:02:13.460> or<00:02:13.820> something<00:02:13.970> or<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.750> come

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
beyond the video or something or to come

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.600 
beyond the video or something or to come
into<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.140> portal<00:02:15.530> or<00:02:15.710> to<00:02:16.040> sell<00:02:16.280> them<00:02:16.400> some

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
into the portal or to sell them some

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.850 
into the portal or to sell them some
cool<00:02:16.820> item<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.480> usually<00:02:18.380> those<00:02:18.500> people

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
cool item and usually those people

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.530 
cool item and usually those people
follow<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.550> if<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.820> can<00:02:20.000> see<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.180> they're

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
follow and if you can see that they're

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.200 
follow and if you can see that they're
talking<00:02:21.050> him<00:02:21.260> or<00:02:21.740> her<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.460> through<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.730> portal

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
talking him or her in through the portal

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.940 
talking him or her in through the portal
then<00:02:23.480> it's<00:02:23.810> obviously<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.500> they're<00:02:24.650> luring

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
then it's obviously that they're luring

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.460 
then it's obviously that they're luring
so<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.430> can<00:02:25.850> grab<00:02:26.060> some<00:02:26.270> gear<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.750> go<00:02:27.230> check

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
so you can grab some gear and go check

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.620 
so you can grab some gear and go check
it<00:02:27.620> out<00:02:27.740> but<00:02:28.370> obviously<00:02:28.580> don't<00:02:29.150> make<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.450> too

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
it out but obviously don't make it too

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.130 
it out but obviously don't make it too
obvious<00:02:29.660> because<00:02:30.640> then<00:02:31.640> they'll<00:02:32.000> run<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.690> if

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
obvious because then they'll run and if

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.270 
obvious because then they'll run and if
you're<00:02:33.290> just<00:02:33.410> going<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.680> go<00:02:33.800> there<00:02:34.010> with<00:02:34.160> the

you're just going to go there with the
whole<00:02:34.400> team<00:02:34.700> then<00:02:35.090> obviously<00:02:35.390> there<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.930> going

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
whole team then obviously there is going

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.110 
whole team then obviously there is going
to<00:02:36.260> log<00:02:36.440> out<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.820> you're<00:02:37.820> not<00:02:37.880> going<00:02:38.060> to

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.700 
getting any kill so be smart thing about
what<00:02:41.090> you're<00:02:41.240> doing<00:02:41.270> realize<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.170> they<00:02:42.500> know

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
what you're doing realize that they know

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.300 
that you're there and you're going to
try<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.510> take<00:02:44.630> them<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:45.410> yeah<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.740> requires<00:02:46.160> a

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
try to take them so yeah it requires a

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.340 
try to take them so yeah it requires a
little<00:02:46.460> bit<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.730> luck<00:02:47.030> but<00:02:47.480> if<00:02:47.840> you're<00:02:48.050> smart

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
little bit of luck but if you're smart

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.440 
little bit of luck but if you're smart
then<00:02:48.620> you're<00:02:48.800> able<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.160> do<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:49.760> don't<00:02:50.180> just

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
then you're able to do it so don't just

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.120 
then you're able to do it so don't just
run<00:02:50.780> in<00:02:50.930> there<00:02:50.960> and<00:02:51.230> hope<00:02:51.830> that<00:02:52.070> you

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
run in there and hope that you

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.340 
run in there and hope that you
automatically<00:02:53.000> get<00:02:53.210> a<00:02:53.270> kill<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:53.960> it's

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
automatically get a kill and that it's

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.590 
automatically get a kill and that it's
really<00:02:54.680> easy<00:02:54.890> because<00:02:55.490> really<00:02:56.330> does

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
really easy because really does

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.560 
really easy because really does
sometimes<00:02:57.410> required<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.310> bit<00:02:58.460> of<00:02:58.610> tactic

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
sometimes required a bit of tactic

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.570 
sometimes required a bit of tactic
rather<00:03:00.200> than<00:03:00.440> actual<00:03:00.950> peak<00:03:01.100> aiding<00:03:01.400> because

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
rather than actual peak aiding because

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.610 
rather than actual peak aiding because
usually<00:03:01.730> don't<00:03:02.060> have<00:03:02.600> much<00:03:02.840> food<00:03:02.870> it's<00:03:03.410> also

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
usually don't have much food it's also

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.010 
usually don't have much food it's also
possible<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.190> just<00:03:04.490> count<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.270> just<00:03:05.480> check<00:03:05.870> if

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
possible to just count and just check if

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.900 
possible to just count and just check if
there's<00:03:06.230> anyone<00:03:06.590> there<00:03:06.650> without<00:03:07.100> armor<00:03:07.670> and

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
there's anyone there without armor and

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.520 
there's anyone there without armor and
then<00:03:08.150> they<00:03:08.450> probably<00:03:08.720> won't<00:03:08.960> realize<00:03:09.350> that

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
then they probably won't realize that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.320 
then they probably won't realize that

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.350 
you're on tailoring so then you go to
