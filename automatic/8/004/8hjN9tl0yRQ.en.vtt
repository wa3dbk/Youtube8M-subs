00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
experience with it and just was really

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
2.5% and I have the directions here 5 to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.890 
2.5% and I have the directions here 5 to
10<00:01:06.630> drops<00:01:07.070> per<00:01:08.070> liter<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.490> water<00:01:08.820> leave<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
10 drops per liter of water leave it to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.899 
10 drops per liter of water leave it to
sit<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.110> 30<00:01:10.500> minutes<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.610> will

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
sit for 30 minutes so that will

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.690 
sit for 30 minutes so that will
disinfect<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.659> water<00:01:12.979> from<00:01:13.979> most<00:01:14.220> bacteria

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
disinfect your water from most bacteria

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.700 
disinfect your water from most bacteria
and<00:01:14.790> viruses<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.360> believe<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.320> probably

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and viruses I believe and it's probably

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.050 
and viruses I believe and it's probably
gonna<00:01:16.830> make<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.040> taste<00:01:17.159> pretty<00:01:17.580> horrible<00:01:17.850> on

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
gonna make it taste pretty horrible on

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.109 
gonna make it taste pretty horrible on
asleep<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:19.470> will<00:01:19.590> work<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.400> also<00:01:20.549> works<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
asleep but it will work it also works to

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.760 
asleep but it will work it also works to
disinfect<00:01:21.509> wounds<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.290> multi-purpose

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
disinfect wounds so it's a multi-purpose

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
disinfect wounds so it's a multi-purpose
item<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.310> keep<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.150> my<00:01:24.240> first-aid<00:01:24.540> kit

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
chemical disinfection method also I

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.139 
chemical disinfection method also I
think<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.130> want<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.340> increase<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.640> contact

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
think you want to increase the contact

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.789 
think you want to increase the contact
time<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> water<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.869> especially<00:01:46.170> cold<00:01:46.560> or

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
time if the water is especially cold or

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.980 
time if the water is especially cold or
especially<00:01:47.130> murky<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> smell<00:01:48.930> it

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
especially murky you want to smell it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.660 
especially murky you want to smell it
afterwards<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.649> should<00:01:49.799> smell<00:01:50.009> faintly

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
afterwards and it should smell faintly

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.429 
afterwards and it should smell faintly
of<00:01:50.970> chlorine<00:01:51.390> you'll<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.290> worked

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
of chlorine you'll know that it worked

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.100 
of chlorine you'll know that it worked
that<00:01:52.530> way<00:01:53.240> also<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.299> should<00:01:54.600> pre-filter

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
that way also you should pre-filter

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.200 
that way also you should pre-filter
right<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.219> you're<00:01:56.549> filtering<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.090> like

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
right so if you're filtering it of like

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.719 
right so if you're filtering it of like
a<00:01:57.270> pond<00:01:57.540> or<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.710> river<00:01:59.369> or<00:01:59.549> something

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
a pond or you know a river or something

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.179 
a pond or you know a river or something
like<00:01:59.909> that<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.329> would<00:02:00.930> use<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> bandanna<00:02:01.619> to

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
like that I would use the bandanna to

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.780 
like that I would use the bandanna to
filter<00:02:02.520> out<00:02:02.670> any<00:02:02.930> large<00:02:03.930> particulates<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.729> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
filter out any large particulates just a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.100 
filter out any large particulates just a
little<00:02:06.000> dust<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.450> things<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.750> they're

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
little dust and things like that they're

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.680 
little dust and things like that they're
in<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> water<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:09.270> you'll<00:02:09.390> have<00:02:09.509> at

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
in the water so that what you'll have at

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.999 
in the water so that what you'll have at
the<00:02:09.780> end<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.050> day<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.590> clearer

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the end of the day is like a clearer

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.440 
the end of the day is like a clearer
water<00:02:11.250> you'll<00:02:11.580> take<00:02:11.760> out<00:02:11.879> all<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.090> big<00:02:12.239> stuff

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
water you'll take out all the big stuff

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.340 
water you'll take out all the big stuff
with<00:02:12.599> that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
with that

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.450 
with that
then<00:02:13.440> you'll<00:02:13.560> filter<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:13.980> chemically<00:02:14.280> with

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
then you'll filter it chemically with

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.680 
then you'll filter it chemically with
that<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.940> you'll<00:02:15.180> end<00:02:15.300> up<00:02:15.390> with<00:02:15.540> something

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
that and you'll end up with something

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.200 
that and you'll end up with something
that's<00:02:15.900> pretty<00:02:16.050> good<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.290> drink<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.910> also<00:02:17.910> have

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
that's pretty good to drink I also have

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.350 
that's pretty good to drink I also have
the<00:02:18.930> LifeStraw<00:02:19.710> here<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.550> haven't<00:02:21.000> tested<00:02:21.090> this

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
the LifeStraw here I haven't tested this

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.240 
the LifeStraw here I haven't tested this
yet<00:02:21.570> actually<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:22.560> it's<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.770> pretty<00:02:22.980> amazing

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
yet actually but it's a pretty amazing

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.280 
yet actually but it's a pretty amazing
thing<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:24.240> can<00:02:24.360> basically<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:24.780> stick<00:02:25.080> this

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
thing you can basically just stick this

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.010 
thing you can basically just stick this
in<00:02:25.500> any<00:02:25.650> water<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.300> drink<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.570> mean<00:02:27.900> it

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
in any water and drink it I mean it

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.140 
in any water and drink it I mean it
won't<00:02:28.200> protect<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.620> from<00:02:28.770> chemicals<00:02:29.370> or

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
won't protect you from chemicals or

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.180 
won't protect you from chemicals or
viruses<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.750> believe<00:02:30.990> but<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.740> will<00:02:31.830> filter<00:02:32.070> out

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
viruses I believe but it will filter out

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.050 
viruses I believe but it will filter out
like<00:02:32.490> 99.9<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.420> mean<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.200> know<00:02:34.320> etc<00:02:34.970> percent<00:02:35.970> of

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
like 99.9 I mean you know etc percent of

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.700 
like 99.9 I mean you know etc percent of
like<00:02:36.210> bacteria<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.290> sort<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.530> thing

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
like bacteria and that sort of thing

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.740 
like bacteria and that sort of thing
super<00:02:38.550> lightweight<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.300> good<00:02:39.510> for<00:02:39.720> a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
super lightweight and it's good for a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.260 
super lightweight and it's good for a
thousand<00:02:40.230> liters<00:02:40.820> I've<00:02:41.820> heard<00:02:42.000> people<00:02:42.120> say

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
thousand liters I've heard people say

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.870 
thousand liters I've heard people say
they<00:02:42.540> can<00:02:42.720> get<00:02:42.840> clogged<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.580> way<00:02:44.670> that

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
they can get clogged and the way that

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.400 
they can get clogged and the way that
you<00:02:44.970> unclog<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.660> blow<00:02:45.840> out<00:02:46.020> of<00:02:46.110> it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
you unclog is to blow out of it

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.290 
you unclog is to blow out of it
we'll<00:02:46.920> see<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.220> don't<00:02:47.640> know<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:48.060> an<00:02:48.150> option

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
we'll see I don't know it's an option

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.650 
we'll see I don't know it's an option
super<00:02:48.900> light<00:02:49.050> it's<00:02:49.470> coming<00:02:49.740> with<00:02:49.830> for<00:02:50.100> sure

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
super light it's coming with for sure

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.290 
super light it's coming with for sure
also<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:52.590> have<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:52.980> pot<00:02:53.250> here<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.760> think<00:02:54.180> it's

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
also I have a pot here I think it's

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.060 
also I have a pot here I think it's
fairly<00:02:54.570> important<00:02:55.020> for<00:02:55.170> water<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.950> have

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
fairly important for water to have

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.010 
fairly important for water to have
containers<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:57.210> I've<00:02:57.300> got<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.540> Nalgene<00:02:57.900> of

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
containers so I've got the Nalgene of

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.810 
containers so I've got the Nalgene of
course<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.380> I've<00:02:58.440> got<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> pot<00:02:58.920> each<00:02:59.490> of<00:02:59.730> those

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
course and I've got a pot each of those

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.600 
course and I've got a pot each of those
will<00:03:00.060> hold<00:03:00.300> one<00:03:00.630> liter<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.930> water<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.430> pot

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
will hold one liter of water and the pot

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.600 
will hold one liter of water and the pot
can<00:03:02.940> be<00:03:02.970> used<00:03:03.330> over<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.750> fire<00:03:04.170> right<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.130> fire

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
can be used over a fire right so fire

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.480 
can be used over a fire right so fire
and<00:03:06.030> heating<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:07.410> boiling<00:03:07.650> your<00:03:07.950> water<00:03:08.130> will

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
and heating just boiling your water will

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.130 
and heating just boiling your water will
disinfect<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.120> from<00:03:09.360> all<00:03:09.510> viruses<00:03:09.780> and

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
disinfect it from all viruses and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.810 
disinfect it from all viruses and
bacteria

you<00:03:12.030> know<00:03:12.120> there's<00:03:12.810> debate<00:03:13.350> about<00:03:13.470> how<00:03:13.680> long

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
you know there's debate about how long

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.190 
you know there's debate about how long
to<00:03:14.010> boil<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.310> for<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:15.420> guess<00:03:15.570> if<00:03:15.720> you're<00:03:15.900> in

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
to boil it for and I guess if you're in

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.080 
to boil it for and I guess if you're in
doubt<00:03:16.410> let<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:17.430> boil<00:03:17.550> for<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.760> couple<00:03:17.970> minutes

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
doubt let it boil for a couple minutes

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.160 
doubt let it boil for a couple minutes
right<00:03:18.360> but<00:03:18.570> you're<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.870> going<00:03:18.960> to<00:03:19.050> waste

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
right but you're just going to waste

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.050 
right but you're just going to waste
fuel<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.800> you're<00:03:20.040> going<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.220> waste<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.910> water

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
fuel and you're going to waste the water

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.240 
fuel and you're going to waste the water
it's<00:03:21.330> going<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.510> evaporate<00:03:22.020> as<00:03:22.830> far<00:03:23.040> as<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.190> know

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
it's going to evaporate as far as I know

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.190 
it's going to evaporate as far as I know
as<00:03:23.850> soon<00:03:23.910> as<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.270> reaches<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.690> boiling<00:03:25.050> point

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
as soon as it reaches a boiling point

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.500 
as soon as it reaches a boiling point
it's<00:03:25.590> good<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.920> go<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.730> can<00:03:26.850> also<00:03:26.970> pass<00:03:27.240> your

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
it's good to go you can also pass your

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.470 
it's good to go you can also pass your
eyes<00:03:27.570> water<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.830> leave<00:03:29.070> it<00:03:29.100> at<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.910> high<00:03:30.180> heat

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
eyes water so leave it at a high heat

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.840 
eyes water so leave it at a high heat
not<00:03:30.750> quite<00:03:30.990> boiling<00:03:31.250> for<00:03:32.250> an<00:03:32.370> extended<00:03:32.760> period

not quite boiling for an extended period
of<00:03:33.030> time<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.510> say<00:03:33.780> like<00:03:33.990> 30<00:03:34.290> minutes<00:03:34.500> or<00:03:34.800> 40

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
of time so say like 30 minutes or 40

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.710 
of time so say like 30 minutes or 40
minutes<00:03:35.190> or<00:03:35.370> something<00:03:35.430> like<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:35.730> just<00:03:36.390> get

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
minutes or something like that just get

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.200 
minutes or something like that just get
it<00:03:36.900> super<00:03:37.350> hot<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:38.160> doesn't<00:03:38.190> have<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:38.640> boil<00:03:38.820> and

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
it super hot it doesn't have to boil and

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.750 
it super hot it doesn't have to boil and
and<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.660> will<00:03:39.810> disinfect<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.380> as<00:03:40.470> well<00:03:40.760> I

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
and that will disinfect it as well I

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.330 
and that will disinfect it as well I
have<00:03:42.150> my<00:03:42.450> stove<00:03:42.840> here<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.260> MSR<00:03:43.650> pocket<00:03:44.040> rocket

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
have my stove here the MSR pocket rocket

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.700 
have my stove here the MSR pocket rocket
with<00:03:44.520> a<00:03:44.760> fuel<00:03:45.360> cartridge<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.260> fuel<00:03:46.500> will<00:03:46.680> run

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
with a fuel cartridge the fuel will run

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.370 
with a fuel cartridge the fuel will run
out<00:03:46.950> of<00:03:47.100> course<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.910> that's<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.240> limited<00:03:48.630> sort

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
out of course so that's a limited sort

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.170 
out of course so that's a limited sort
of<00:03:49.440> resource<00:03:49.770> I'm<00:03:50.430> over<00:03:50.670> brought<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:50.970> for

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
of resource I'm over brought it for

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.880 
of resource I'm over brought it for
cooking<00:03:51.510> than<00:03:51.630> anything<00:03:51.810> else<00:03:52.050> but<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.860> know

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
cooking than anything else but you know

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.740 
cooking than anything else but you know
it<00:03:53.310> will<00:03:53.550> disinfect<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.180> water<00:03:54.270> if<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.600> heat

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
it will disinfect the water if you heat

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.170 
it will disinfect the water if you heat
it<00:03:54.780> up<00:03:54.960> right<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.470> have<00:03:56.220> some<00:03:56.610> fire<00:03:56.970> making

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
it up right I have some fire making

it up right I have some fire making
tools<00:03:57.510> here<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.890> various<00:03:59.190> ignition<00:03:59.550> sources

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
tools here the various ignition sources

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.480 
tools here the various ignition sources
lighter<00:04:00.240> matches<00:04:00.900> fire<00:04:01.380> steel<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.890> I've<00:04:02.310> got

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
lighter matches fire steel and I've got

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.010 
lighter matches fire steel and I've got
a<00:04:02.520> couple<00:04:02.700> kinds<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.120> tinder<00:04:03.360> inside<00:04:03.510> there<00:04:03.840> so

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
a couple kinds of tinder inside there so

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.840 
a couple kinds of tinder inside there so
I've<00:04:04.110> got<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.650> capability<00:04:04.800> to<00:04:05.340> start<00:04:05.610> fires

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
I've got the capability to start fires

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.120 
I've got the capability to start fires
and<00:04:06.150> repeatedly<00:04:07.080> boil<00:04:07.440> water<00:04:07.650> in<00:04:07.830> that

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
and repeatedly boil water in that

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.820 
and repeatedly boil water in that
container<00:04:08.460> that<00:04:08.700> I<00:04:08.760> have<00:04:08.910> with<00:04:09.030> me<00:04:09.210> so<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.650> is

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
container that I have with me so that is

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.850 
container that I have with me so that is
basically<00:04:11.130> my<00:04:11.220> water<00:04:11.520> system<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:12.150> mean<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.870> think

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
basically my water system I mean I think

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.320 
basically my water system I mean I think
it's<00:04:14.070> really<00:04:14.370> good<00:04:14.490> to<00:04:14.610> have<00:04:14.700> options<00:04:14.910> if

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
it's really good to have options if

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.479 
it's really good to have options if
you're<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:15.540> an<00:04:15.630> urban<00:04:15.810> environment<00:04:16.400> you<00:04:17.400> know

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
you're in an urban environment you know

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.940 
you're in an urban environment you know
the<00:04:17.609> chemical<00:04:18.000> methods<00:04:18.299> could<00:04:18.420> work<00:04:18.600> well<00:04:18.950> but

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
the chemical methods could work well but

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.830 
the chemical methods could work well but
it'll<00:04:20.640> serve<00:04:20.850> you<00:04:20.880> well<00:04:21.120> anywhere<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.690> have<00:04:21.810> a

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
it'll serve you well anywhere to have a

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.230 
it'll serve you well anywhere to have a
variety<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.440> options<00:04:22.919> some<00:04:23.400> redundancy<00:04:24.000> in

your<00:04:24.390> system<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.740> disinfect<00:04:26.160> water

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
your system to disinfect water

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.210
