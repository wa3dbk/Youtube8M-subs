00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.050
 competition of heracles almelo de 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.640

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.629

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.000
 it all we just go and watch 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.829
 how this app a kind of loop and yes like 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.510
 those brands there is therefore a change 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.309
 Looked like the last time the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.059

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.010

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.440
 Google 3x choir and I was entering the field 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.059
 haylands music and yes it is just 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.290

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.330
 match of the games also for the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.460
 first time in the snow here see here 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.960
 the through wit competively completes while 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.090

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.000
 easy attacks go for pec zwolle 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.380

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.299

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.790
 we needed to quietly own ourselves 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.680
 fame was for ridicule 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.810
