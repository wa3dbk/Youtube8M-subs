this kind of our is a little bit

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.600 
this kind of our is a little bit
difficult<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.500> work<00:02:08.650> with<00:02:08.710> but<00:02:09.100> with<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.369> fluffy

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
difficult to work with but with a fluffy

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.610 
difficult to work with but with a fluffy
brush<00:02:09.850> gradual<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.479> just<00:02:10.690> kind<00:02:10.930> of<00:02:11.080> start

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
brush gradual you just kind of start

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.530 
brush gradual you just kind of start
applying<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.250> outer<00:02:12.430> V<00:02:12.910> I<00:02:12.940> like<00:02:13.330> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
applying it to the outer V I like the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.210 
applying it to the outer V I like the
look<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:14.110> gives<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.560> my<00:02:14.680> eyes<00:02:14.890> if<00:02:15.190> you

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
look that this gives to my eyes if you

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.740 
look that this gives to my eyes if you
have<00:02:15.400> smaller<00:02:15.640> eyes<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:16.090> really<00:02:16.420> adds<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.690> lot

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
have smaller eyes it really adds a lot

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.280 
have smaller eyes it really adds a lot
of<00:02:16.900> depth<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.530> makes<00:02:17.980> them<00:02:18.070> look<00:02:18.280> very<00:02:18.490> like

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
of depth it makes them look very like

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.510 
of depth it makes them look very like
wing-like<00:02:20.290> out<00:02:20.860> i'll<00:02:21.040> just<00:02:21.190> gives<00:02:21.340> them<00:02:21.460> a

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
wing-like out i'll just gives them a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.160 
wing-like out i'll just gives them a
really<00:02:21.760> nice<00:02:21.910> shape<00:02:22.150> i<00:02:22.330> think<00:02:22.570> in<00:02:22.690> general<00:02:22.840> and

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
really nice shape i think in general and

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.050 
really nice shape i think in general and
really<00:02:23.380> frames<00:02:23.770> them<00:02:24.040> nicely<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.670> just<00:02:24.910> with<00:02:25.030> a

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
really frames them nicely so just with a

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.850 
really frames them nicely so just with a
fluffy<00:02:25.330> brush<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:25.870> find<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.230> fluffy<00:02:26.560> brushes

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
fluffy brush I find that fluffy brushes

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.560 
fluffy brush I find that fluffy brushes
are<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.070> easiest<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.520> work<00:02:27.550> with<00:02:27.760> because<00:02:28.090> I

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
are the easiest to work with because I

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.540 
are the easiest to work with because I
feel<00:02:29.110> like<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.380> used<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.800> blend<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.340> make

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
feel like that used to blend and make

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.700 
feel like that used to blend and make
look<00:02:30.880> like<00:02:31.090> smokey<00:02:31.570> versus<00:02:31.930> using<00:02:32.110> like<00:02:32.470> kind

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
look like smokey versus using like kind

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.960 
look like smokey versus using like kind
of<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.950> pencil<00:02:33.640> like<00:02:33.970> brush<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:35.530> then<00:02:35.620> on<00:02:36.010> the
