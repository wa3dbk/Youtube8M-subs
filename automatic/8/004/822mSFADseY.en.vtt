possible<00:02:12.690> now<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:14.340> great<00:02:14.580> thing<00:02:14.610> about<00:02:14.850> mass

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
possible now the great thing about mass

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.150 
possible now the great thing about mass
terror<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.870> not<00:02:16.140> only<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.530> nice<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:16.950> easy

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
terror is not only is it nice and easy

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160 
terror is not only is it nice and easy
to<00:02:17.460> use<00:02:17.490> it's<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:18.180> cycled<00:02:18.570> left<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.870> right<00:02:19.050> on

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
to use it's just cycled left to right on

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.800 
to use it's just cycled left to right on
your<00:02:19.260> power<00:02:19.470> bars<00:02:19.800> but<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:20.910> you're<00:02:21.090> close

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
your power bars but if you're close

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.710 
your power bars but if you're close
enough<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.440> enemy<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:23.100> will<00:02:23.340> hit<00:02:23.490> them

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
enough to the enemy it will hit them

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.030 
enough to the enemy it will hit them
regardless<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.930> what<00:02:25.080> direction<00:02:25.440> they<00:02:25.740> are<00:02:25.890> in

regardless of what direction they are in

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.830 
regardless of what direction they are in
so<00:02:26.190> they<00:02:26.310> can<00:02:26.460> be<00:02:26.550> pulled<00:02:26.760> all<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.540> way<00:02:27.570> around

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
so they can be pulled all the way around

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.140 
so they can be pulled all the way around
you<00:02:28.290> any<00:02:28.830> which<00:02:29.100> way<00:02:29.130> but<00:02:29.310> loose<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.700> doesn't

basically point and shoot you literally
just<00:02:39.000> stand<00:02:39.330> there<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.810> power<00:02:40.350> will<00:02:40.860> do

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
just stand there and the power will do

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.770 
just stand there and the power will do
everything<00:02:41.250> else<00:02:41.880> for<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.209> don't<00:02:42.540> even<00:02:42.630> have

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
everything else for you don't even have

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.660 
everything else for you don't even have
to<00:02:42.870> target<00:02:43.140> anyone<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.860> will<00:02:44.100> sort<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.520> out<00:02:44.610> for

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
to target anyone it will sort it out for

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.940 
to target anyone it will sort it out for
you<00:02:45.030> now<00:02:45.570> sometimes<00:02:45.870> guys<00:02:46.320> I've<00:02:46.560> noticed<00:02:46.890> that

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
you now sometimes guys I've noticed that

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.370 
you now sometimes guys I've noticed that
DB<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.550> occasionally<00:02:47.880> drops<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.750> believe<00:02:49.140> it's

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
DB you occasionally drops I believe it's

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.690 
DB you occasionally drops I believe it's
menace<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.190> then<00:02:50.730> he<00:02:50.820> puts<00:02:51.060> in<00:02:51.330> mass<00:02:52.170> hysteria

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
menace and then he puts in mass hysteria

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.699 
menace and then he puts in mass hysteria
especially<00:02:53.700> for<00:02:54.080> boss<00:02:55.080> fights<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.680> things

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
especially for boss fights and things

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.470 
especially for boss fights and things
like<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.400> can<00:02:56.520> maximize<00:02:56.730> his<00:02:57.180> damage

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
like that so you can maximize his damage

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.360 
like that so you can maximize his damage
per<00:02:57.630> second<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.230> reckon<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.010> mass<00:02:59.220> hysteria

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
per second I reckon is mass hysteria

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.040 
per second I reckon is mass hysteria
supercharged<00:03:00.150> there's<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.480> little<00:03:00.780> bit<00:03:00.900> more

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
supercharged there's a little bit more

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.020

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
of your attacks from there on out but it

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.160 
of your attacks from there on out but it
is<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.350> one<00:03:10.590> hundred<00:03:10.920> percent<00:03:10.950> cast<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:12.270> if<00:03:12.990> it's

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
is a one hundred percent cast so if it's

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.330 
is a one hundred percent cast so if it's

it's<00:03:14.519> probably<00:03:14.760> not<00:03:14.910> worth<00:03:14.940> having<00:03:15.300> on<00:03:15.690> the

and<00:03:17.880> imagine<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:18.330> is<00:03:18.570> why<00:03:19.080> DBU<00:03:19.530> swaps<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.310> up

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430
