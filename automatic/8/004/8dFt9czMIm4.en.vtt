00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.330
 that a boy psoe that I bring a 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.240
 new update of white and good for 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.869
 those who do not know what is waiting is a 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.249
 project that we are developing 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:16.190
 adrián and me and then it is to have our 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:18.320
 device as similar to 17 then 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.099
 this issue has had many ships and the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.289
 last video if you have seen him talk about 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.660
 that I presenting the white and then 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.509
 what they already know which will already have 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.249
 downloaded from the adrián channel and 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.230
 then those who do not, well, I 'm going to 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.449
 leave the description online with the 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.789
 new update and for those who already 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.350
 have seen them I will talk a little about 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:42.949
 this update and the changes that it has 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.649
 had good if they have realized already I have 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.510
 fixed the book of the battery I have already 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.879
 put the battery when charging it does not 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.430
 be white but now it 's black with 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.710
 the thing in green the stuffing 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.960
 and then also fixed what 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.250
 airplane mode icon there he showed them 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.589
 It is black now 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.770
 arranged or unfortunately not what 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.479
 can test but 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.969
 try to fix what would be 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.979
 the battery when it is less than 20% 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:14.420
 that turns red and they remain 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.399
 under the battery and I think that 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.560
 bus is also fixed I'm not 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.000
 sure because I did not try it because already my 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.700
 battery is then I was had 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.280
 to wait for about 7 hours 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.100
 so that the battery is 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.049
 for almost then I could see if there was 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.090
 some change or not and then obviously 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.490
 I can not wait so long because 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.200
 I already wanted to release the version then 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.720
 about which I also wanted to talk to you 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.030
 reference was that if they have noticed 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.680
 I eliminated enough videos and nothing else 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.659
 left because this channel not only what 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.000
 I will use for what would be 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.759
 publish what would be the white 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.950
 in and future projects that we have there 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.509
 as for example we are right now 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.930
 developing what would be a 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.750
 tweet that allows us to play games 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.570
 high performance and do not run them without 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.550
 both the guided and do not run them well the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.890
 The only problem with this is that obviously 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.640
 this is going to present that is going to 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.500
 grab a little more battery ni but o 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.420
 be the change we have seen is is 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.980
 obviously a change is reasonable 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.350
 quite big because for example for 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.819
 those who want to play pretty game 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.760
 quality as for example the modern 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.560
 Combat 4 already come running without the 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.569
 less laxe will come running very well 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.850
 and that would not only be with him 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.670
 the games but would also come helping 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.120
 to the device that we are trying to 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.190
 the damage because they are like 15 minutes of 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.890
 battery what is current this is 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.290
 consuming and that is not that is not the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.850
 point but we want that with your command 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.590
 consume so much stuff but use 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.830
 so I also wanted to talk to them 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.180
 about that and that that would be so this would be 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.950
 the next project that we have 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.590
 thought of doing we also have other 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.660
 projects like for example would come 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.020
 being 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.120
 what about the color bar but we have 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.690
 there a little problem because as I already 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.780
 you know the subject is dark color is that 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.610
 It goes by if we do but has 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.160
 that they have that they have to wait 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.690
 a little bit because we're a bit tangled 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.020
 with the amount of projects we have 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.310
 launched first let's finish it from 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.860
 thing this tweet thing did not even 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.830
 we have a name we already see in it 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.050
 for example in this version of 4.1 of 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.160
 walking and we could tell you already how 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.920
 be 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.730
 what changes brings itself brings the battery 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.800
 when you charge the battery when it decreases 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.230
 -20% airplane mode and if we get to 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.450
 listen to a song know that it appears 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.210
 the play icon there we have also 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.600
 put this icon in black and 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.340
 so what else could I bring 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.400
 removed a couple of images that 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.160
 defective in the subject that did not 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.000
 missing so that the subject ps - and does not have 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.070
 that grab so many things 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.720
 between that I think it would be 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.730
 everything that I have done in this and 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.500
 obviously I have put a little more 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.800
 quality I've also done a couple of 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.920
 friends improvements 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.690
 not so remarkable improvements but if they are 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.519
 small improvements that I had to 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.950
 make the subject for example a couple of 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.200
 colors there I had to change that 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.280
 kind of things so I'll leave you the 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.930
 link in the video description so that 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.820
 try it as you know my twitter is 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.370
 that what and then there can you tell me 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.840
 hey can you put such a thing on it because if 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.780
 have any idea of something that is 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.580
 can change because good and also what 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.590
 that I will explain was about the battery a 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.800
 little longer and I've already tried 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.260
 make and the compact battery stays very 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.470
 small because the battery space 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.960
 does not give so much and then the 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.100
 battery if you put a battery too 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.360
 long battery what you are going to do is 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.580
 that is going to resize and will be 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.100
 a super small battery and that's not the 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.740
 subject then what I did want what yes 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.510
 we could do there is that I still 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.190
 I will continue to try other alternatives 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.690
 to see if you can go to go if you do not 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.910
 so I sent him to say if 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.920
 I had tried if I did not also want 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.130
 make another alternative theme as a 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.960
 white in but only that is in this 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.820
 case gets dark with white letters 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.620
 and then the whole subject is going to be dark 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.300
 something like that had come out a subject of there 7 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.190
 only 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.400
 but this would be the white ism happens 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.319
 then we are thinking there are also 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.120
 lots of things we can do 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.770
 but we are your support and as 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.379
 on twitter also remember what 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.800
 things I remember that this is a 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:35.389
 beta and that we need you to us 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.389
 say that they lack that wood has 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.340
 because that's what the project is about 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.409
 we help ourselves 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.710
 to keep improving the project so 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.479
 good without saying more then there 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.580
 here finished the video most likely is 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.139
 that is uploading another video about what 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.210
 that would be the pri that this a 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.360
 a little bit later today if I do not upload it 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:00.789
 tomorrow or when you have time and try 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.789
 the white in and you know so it's worth
