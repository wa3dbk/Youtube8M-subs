I<00:00:41.300> usually<00:00:42.300> stretch<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.579> wrist<00:00:44.579> by<00:00:45.210> doing<00:00:45.510> this

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:29.740

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.410 

so<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.140> first<00:01:31.380> thing<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.770> chose<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.760> my<00:01:33.180> desk

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
so the first thing I chose was my desk

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.990 
so the first thing I chose was my desk
because<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> tallest<00:01:34.590> thing<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
because it's the tallest thing and so I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:57.050 
because it's the tallest thing and so I
did<00:01:36.330> my<00:01:36.510> back<00:01:36.720> bend<00:01:37.050> onto<00:01:37.800> it<00:01:55.580> moving<00:01:56.580> on<00:01:56.729> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
did my back bend onto it moving on to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.460 
did my back bend onto it moving on to
the<00:01:57.479> next<00:01:57.630> step<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:59.660> first<00:02:00.660> when<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.170> start

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
the next step so first when you start

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.290 
the next step so first when you start
getting<00:02:01.740> up<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:03.180> might<00:02:04.430> find<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.729> easy<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
getting up you might find it easy to

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.910
