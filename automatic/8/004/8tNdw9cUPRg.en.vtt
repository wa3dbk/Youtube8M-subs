00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:07.510 
back to the shape-up level to the

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.779 
back to the shape-up level to the
African<00:00:08.519> wholesale<00:00:09.519> market<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:11.200> I<00:00:12.190> about<00:00:12.429> two

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:12.789 
African wholesale market and I about two

bad<00:00:13.089> batteries<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.860> is<00:00:15.039> one<00:00:18.960> nasty

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.779 

so<00:00:27.019> pretty<00:00:27.410> and<00:00:29.410> I<00:00:30.410> think<00:00:30.710> for<00:00:30.890> some<00:00:30.949> Pasolini

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
so pretty and I think for some Pasolini

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.410 
so pretty and I think for some Pasolini
or<00:00:32.300> something<00:00:33.340> when<00:00:34.340> I<00:00:34.430> first<00:00:34.730> started<00:00:35.239> it<00:00:35.390> was

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
or something when I first started it was

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.180 
or something when I first started it was
fine<00:00:35.870> it's<00:00:36.470> not<00:00:36.680> fine<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:37.489> color<00:00:37.699> is<00:00:37.940> fine<00:00:39.190> but

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
fine it's not fine the color is fine but

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.700 
fine it's not fine the color is fine but
I<00:00:40.250> know<00:00:40.370> that<00:00:41.559> overly<00:00:42.559> soft<00:00:43.250> compared<00:00:44.089> to<00:00:44.710> when

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
I know that overly soft compared to when

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.020 
I know that overly soft compared to when
I<00:00:45.829> first<00:00:46.100> first<00:00:46.460> got<00:00:46.760> my<00:00:47.829> first<00:00:48.829> Bathsheba<00:00:49.640> I

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
I first first got my first Bathsheba I

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.390 
I first first got my first Bathsheba I
thought<00:00:50.960> maybe<00:00:51.170> they<00:00:51.470> really<00:00:51.800> would<00:00:51.980> date<00:00:52.250> or

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
thought maybe they really would date or

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.189 
thought maybe they really would date or
something

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
something

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.299 
something
so<00:00:54.199> I<00:00:54.230> with<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:54.760> it<00:00:55.760> was<00:00:55.940> fine<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.040> that<00:00:58.040> I<00:00:58.070> want

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
so I with it it was fine so that I want

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.719 
so I with it it was fine so that I want
a<00:00:58.400> smoother<00:00:58.850> texture<00:00:59.360> so<00:01:00.290> I'm<00:01:01.129> melting<00:01:01.430> it

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
a smoother texture so I'm melting it

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.270 
a smoother texture so I'm melting it
down<00:01:01.760> again<00:01:02.299> and<00:01:02.629> let<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:02.900> cool<00:01:03.080> down<00:01:03.320> when<00:01:04.159> you

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
down again and let it cool down when you

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:13.670 
down again and let it cool down when you
turn<00:01:04.580> it<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:05.030> this<00:01:06.610> nastiness

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.679

not<00:02:40.460> in<00:02:40.640> differences<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:42.530> one<00:02:42.740> had<00:02:42.980> some

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
not in differences this one had some

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.059 
not in differences this one had some
left<00:02:43.940> over<00:02:44.150> my<00:02:44.660> very<00:02:44.959> very<00:02:45.080> first<00:02:45.530> batch<00:02:45.890> to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
didn't mix well or not and it just

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.600 
didn't mix well or not and it just
turned<00:02:54.620> like<00:02:54.830> this<00:02:56.709> but<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:57.890> makes<00:02:58.130> them

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
turned like this but it makes them

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:06.010 
turned like this but it makes them
pretty<00:03:00.490> sorry<00:03:01.490> I<00:03:01.820> got<00:03:02.150> cut<00:03:02.450> off<00:03:02.480> but<00:03:04.750> get<00:03:05.750> this
