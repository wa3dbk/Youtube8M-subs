00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
a very very good change and I don't

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.390 
a very very good change and I don't
think<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.720> need<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.960> explain<00:01:19.110> why<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:20.040> gonna

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
think I need to explain why I just gonna

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.510 
think I need to explain why I just gonna
you<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.270> keep<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.530> ladders<00:01:22.920> active<00:01:23.280> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you know keep the ladders active and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.719 
you know keep the ladders active and
stuff<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.229> now<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.680> gear<00:01:26.070> changes

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
stuff like that now to the gear changes

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.569 
stuff like that now to the gear changes
the<00:01:27.630> first<00:01:27.900> thing<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.110> surprised<00:01:28.740> me<00:01:28.950> was

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the first thing that surprised me was

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.679 
the first thing that surprised me was
that<00:01:29.640> 2.2<00:01:30.420> k<00:01:30.810> rating<00:01:31.200> requirements<00:01:31.380> are<00:01:32.040> gone

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
that 2.2 k rating requirements are gone

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:39.350 
that 2.2 k rating requirements are gone
so<00:01:35.119> this<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.150> replaced<00:01:36.900> by<00:01:37.909> 27,000<00:01:38.909> conquest

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
so this is replaced by 27,000 conquest

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.749 
so this is replaced by 27,000 conquest
points<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.170> will<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:41.040> in

so a little here is going to be free for
everyone<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.820> goes<00:02:03.420> over<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.750> point<00:02:04.200> 27<00:02:04.890> k

everyone that goes over that point 27 k
conquest<00:02:05.729> points<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:07.550> can<00:02:08.550> understand<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.619 
conquest points and I can understand you
know<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.050> tier<00:02:10.770> 2<00:02:11.009> weapon<00:02:11.430> because<00:02:12.270> many

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
know the tier 2 weapon because many

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.980 
know the tier 2 weapon because many
people<00:02:12.720> never<00:02:13.200> saw<00:02:13.530> it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
people never saw it

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.840 
people never saw it
to<00:02:14.110> weapon<00:02:14.410> in<00:02:14.560> their<00:02:14.650> lives<00:02:14.920> they<00:02:15.280> never<00:02:15.550> got

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
to weapon in their lives they never got

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.700 
to weapon in their lives they never got
it<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.710> this<00:02:17.710> is<00:02:17.740> good<00:02:18.190> for<00:02:18.220> keeping<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:19.000> gear

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
it so this is good for keeping the gear

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.920 
it so this is good for keeping the gear
the<00:02:20.710> item<00:02:21.070> level<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.520> damage<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.360> same<00:02:22.630> in

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
the item level the damage the same in

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.310 
the item level the damage the same in
keeping<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.920> games<00:02:24.850> more<00:02:25.300> skill-based<00:02:25.660> done

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
keeping the games more skill-based done

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.130 
keeping the games more skill-based done

or<00:02:31.840> something<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.260> but<00:02:33.070> I<00:02:33.370> don't

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
or something like that but I don't

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.580 
or something like that but I don't
really<00:02:33.850> understand<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.570> gear<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:35.140> mean<00:02:35.410> the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
really understand the gear I mean the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.740 
really understand the gear I mean the
gear<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:36.010> actually<00:02:36.460> it<00:02:36.730> just<00:02:36.790> changes<00:02:37.420> color

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
gear is actually it just changes color

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.680 
gear is actually it just changes color
and<00:02:38.110> in<00:02:38.680> my<00:02:38.830> opinion<00:02:38.980> should<00:02:39.460> be<00:02:39.580> kept<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:39.970> 2.2

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
and in my opinion should be kept to 2.2

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.280 
and in my opinion should be kept to 2.2
k<00:02:40.900> just<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.470> tell<00:02:42.250> apart<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.760> people<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.290> put

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:39.589 
so there's no basically this eliminates

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.640 
so there's no basically this eliminates
boost<00:05:40.039> with<00:05:40.580> which<00:05:41.210> makes<00:05:41.509> the<00:05:41.779> ladders<00:05:42.139> even

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
boost with which makes the ladders even

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.050 
boost with which makes the ladders even
more<00:05:42.949> balanced<00:05:43.399> because<00:05:43.580> you<00:05:43.879> will<00:05:44.029> be

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
more balanced because you will be

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.969 
more balanced because you will be
