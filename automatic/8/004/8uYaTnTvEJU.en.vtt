00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
you will see there's a those two teeth

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.260 
you will see there's a those two teeth
wrap<00:01:21.350> around<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:23.229> little<00:01:24.229> peg<00:01:24.530> up<00:01:24.799> top<00:01:25.270> so

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
wrap around a little peg up top so

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.139 
wrap around a little peg up top so
that's<00:01:26.359> what's<00:01:26.630> holding<00:01:26.749> it<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.640> so<00:01:28.640> it's<00:01:28.909> that

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
that's what's holding it in so it's that

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.919 
that's what's holding it in so it's that
way<00:01:29.299> on<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:30.590> side<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.130> up<00:01:32.030> here<00:01:32.389> on<00:01:32.509> this<00:01:32.689> side

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
way on the side and up here on this side

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.940 
way on the side and up here on this side
so<00:01:34.149> that's<00:01:35.149> essentially<00:01:35.719> all<00:01:35.749> you<00:01:35.960> do<00:01:36.109> so<00:01:36.889> you

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
so that's essentially all you do so you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.849 
so that's essentially all you do so you
want<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.189> be<00:01:37.280> careful<00:01:37.490> so<00:01:38.499> because<00:01:39.499> you<00:01:39.649> pull

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
want to be careful so because you pull

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.410 
want to be careful so because you pull
it<00:01:39.979> wrong<00:01:40.189> it's<00:01:40.549> going<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.759> break<00:01:40.969> those<00:01:41.149> teeth

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
it wrong it's going to break those teeth

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.690 
it wrong it's going to break those teeth
off<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:41.899> then<00:01:42.139> you'll<00:01:42.289> really<00:01:43.039> be<00:01:43.130> mad<00:01:43.369> at<00:01:43.549> me

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
off and then you'll really be mad at me

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.080 
off and then you'll really be mad at me
so<00:01:44.649> kind<00:01:45.649> of<00:01:45.740> pry<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:45.979> down<00:01:46.369> from<00:01:46.609> this<00:01:46.850> side

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
so kind of pry it down from this side

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.330 
so kind of pry it down from this side
until<00:01:47.389> you<00:01:47.509> get<00:01:47.689> this<00:01:47.810> side<00:01:48.020> loose<00:01:48.289> and<00:01:48.590> then

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
until you get this side loose and then

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.359 
until you get this side loose and then
do<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.609> same<00:01:49.819> thing<00:01:50.060> from<00:01:50.179> the<00:01:50.270> other<00:01:50.359> side<00:01:51.369> so

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
do the same thing from the other side so

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.039 
do the same thing from the other side so
that<00:01:52.399> way<00:01:53.499> you<00:01:54.499> can<00:01:54.590> get<00:01:54.740> those<00:01:55.100> loose<00:01:56.049> so

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
that way you can get those loose so

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.819 
that way you can get those loose so
there<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.350> go<00:01:58.659> so<00:01:59.659> pop<00:01:59.929> that<00:02:00.139> side<00:02:00.380> off<00:02:00.560> pop

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
there you go so pop that side off pop

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.760 
there you go so pop that side off pop
both<00:02:01.039> sides<00:02:01.310> off<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:02.409> there's<00:02:03.409> your<00:02:03.619> little

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
both sides off and there's your little

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.699 
both sides off and there's your little
bulb<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.279> there<00:02:05.350> so

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.610 

here<00:02:09.129> let's<00:02:10.030> pull<00:02:10.239> it<00:02:10.420> up<00:02:12.269> so<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.470> your
