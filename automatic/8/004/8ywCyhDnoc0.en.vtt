set that because I didn't want to set it
with<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.530> powder<00:00:55.559> then<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.460> could<00:00:56.640> put<00:00:56.820> cream

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
with a powder then we could put cream

with a powder then we could put cream
over<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> top<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.170> we're<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.440> down<00:00:58.800> along

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
over the top so we're going down along

over the top so we're going down along
here<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:00.030> sweeping<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:01.039> across<00:01:02.039> here

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
here and then sweeping up across here

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.149 
here and then sweeping up across here
you<00:01:03.149> really<00:01:03.359> want<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.690> brighten<00:01:03.989> right<00:01:04.860> in

triangle shape so we have the triangle
underneath<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.100> eye<00:01:37.130> they're<00:01:37.970> kind<00:01:38.150> of<00:01:38.210> doing

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
underneath the eye they're kind of doing

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.910 
underneath the eye they're kind of doing
the<00:01:38.480> same<00:01:38.510> thing<00:01:38.960> on<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.200> outer<00:01:39.350> corner<00:01:39.830> as

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
the same thing on the outer corner as

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.700 
the same thing on the outer corner as
well<00:01:40.180> but<00:01:41.180> it's<00:01:41.330> just<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.660> thinner<00:01:42.020> triangle

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
well but it's just a thinner triangle

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.260 
well but it's just a thinner triangle
this<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:43.100> foundational<00:01:43.550> brush<00:01:43.730> that<00:01:43.940> I<00:01:44.000> used

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
this is foundational brush that I used

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.970 
this is foundational brush that I used
earlier<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.720> apply<00:01:45.050> our<00:01:45.110> foundations<00:01:45.650> just

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
earlier to apply our foundations just

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.460 
earlier to apply our foundations just
going<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.490> blend<00:01:46.700> that<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.240> try<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.200> keep

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
going to blend that and try and keep

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.160 
going to blend that and try and keep
within<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.460> space<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:50.150> placed<00:01:50.450> it

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:03.740 

don't<00:01:54.170> blend<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.650> like<00:01:54.800> all<00:01:55.010> over<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.430> base

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.860 

oh<00:02:04.010> just<00:02:05.010> to<00:02:05.190> recap<00:02:05.700> we've<00:02:05.880> gone<00:02:06.120> across<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
oh just to recap we've gone across the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.749 
oh just to recap we've gone across the
straight<00:02:07.110> line<00:02:07.290> across<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.830> jaw<00:02:08.070> and<00:02:08.610> what

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
straight line across the jaw and what

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.310 
straight line across the jaw and what
this<00:02:08.940> will<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.780> will<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:10.110> kind<00:02:10.289> of

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
this will do is it will just kind of

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.870 
this will do is it will just kind of
lift<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.830> face<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.340> little<00:02:11.460> bit<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:11.790> you

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
lift the face up a little bit so if you

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.820 
lift the face up a little bit so if you
have<00:02:12.030> anything<00:02:12.330> that's<00:02:12.540> hanging<00:02:12.900> down<00:02:13.230> if<00:02:13.650> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
have anything that's hanging down if you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.850 
have anything that's hanging down if you
darken<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.600> will<00:02:15.810> lift<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.740> we've

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
darken it and it will lift it and we've

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.700 
darken it and it will lift it and we've
also<00:02:17.040> gone<00:02:17.370> along<00:02:17.970> here<00:02:18.570> which<00:02:18.900> will<00:02:19.140> stand<00:02:19.530> on
