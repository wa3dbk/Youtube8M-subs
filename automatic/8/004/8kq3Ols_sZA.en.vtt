00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
like that and before I remember if I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.900 
like that and before I remember if I
move<00:01:00.180> my<00:01:00.329> camera<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.789> behind<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.810 
delights my camera we can't get pushed
in<00:01:06.180> front<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.869> passed<00:01:07.140> by<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.830> I'm

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
in front as I passed by it like I'm

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.660 
in front as I passed by it like I'm
trying<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> reenact<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.310> which<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.460> kind<00:01:11.549> of

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
trying to reenact it which is kind of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.890 
trying to reenact it which is kind of
annoying<00:01:11.820> because<00:01:12.000> you're<00:01:12.180> all<00:01:12.420> smoothly

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
annoying because you're all smoothly

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.600 
annoying because you're all smoothly
rotating<00:01:13.530> around<00:01:13.619> your<00:01:13.890> tank<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:14.430> all

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
rotating around your tank and then all

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.499 
rotating around your tank and then all
sudden<00:01:15.650> loop<00:01:16.880> it's<00:01:17.880> kind<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.090> zooms<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.450> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
sudden loop it's kind of zooms in and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.640 
sudden loop it's kind of zooms in and
out<00:01:18.630> again<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.049> think<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.380> same<00:01:19.619> thing

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
out again I think it's the same thing

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.410 
out again I think it's the same thing
happen<00:01:20.220> well<00:01:20.580> maybe<00:01:20.729> didn't<00:01:21.000> happen<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
happen well maybe didn't happen with the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.350 
happen well maybe didn't happen with the
stairs<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:21.990> think<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.200> did<00:01:22.320> actually<00:01:23.360> but

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
stairs I don't think it did actually but

stairs I don't think it did actually but

bat i noticed actually this first thing

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.310 
bat i noticed actually this first thing
i<00:01:59.969> noticed<00:02:00.210> with<00:02:00.299> these<00:02:00.450> viewports<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.200> can

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
i noticed with these viewports you can

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.050 
i noticed with these viewports you can
see<00:02:01.439> one's<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.829> one's<00:02:02.130> open<00:02:02.250> one<00:02:02.520> closed<00:02:02.820> i

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
see one's a one's open one closed i

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.929 
see one's a one's open one closed i
don't<00:02:03.509> think<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:04.170> were<00:02:04.229> an<00:02:05.130> eight<00:02:05.430> point<00:02:05.640> 11

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
don't think they were an eight point 11

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.260 
don't think they were an eight point 11
server<00:02:06.149> like<00:02:06.360> that

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
server like that

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.580 
server like that
then<00:02:09.270> again<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.630> not<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.750> tank<00:02:09.990> I<00:02:10.110> play<00:02:10.380> that

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
then again it's not a tank I play that

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.500 
then again it's not a tank I play that
much<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.459> don't<00:02:11.880> know<00:02:12.090> what<00:02:12.239> looks<00:02:12.420> like

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
much so I don't know what looks like

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.960 
much so I don't know what looks like
that<00:02:12.900> well<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.380> also<00:02:14.010> feel<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.580> turret

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
that well I also feel like this turret

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.360 
that well I also feel like this turret
is<00:02:15.120> taller<00:02:15.420> than<00:02:15.650> than<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:16.890> an<00:02:17.040> eight<00:02:17.160> point

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
is taller than than it is an eight point

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.870 
is taller than than it is an eight point
11<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:17.849> maybe<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:18.360> not<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.930> probably<00:02:19.680> isn't

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
11 but maybe it's not it probably isn't

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.870 
11 but maybe it's not it probably isn't
but<00:02:20.880> everything<00:02:21.630> looks<00:02:21.660> quite<00:02:22.110> nice<00:02:22.260> again

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
once again they've got little ripples

spots I think they're going a little bit
crazy<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:31.420> some<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.810> where<00:03:31.959> spots<00:03:33.239> because

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
crazy on some of the where spots because

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.729 
crazy on some of the where spots because
what<00:03:34.450> they<00:03:34.540> wanted<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.780> do<00:03:34.930> is<00:03:35.079> how<00:03:35.200> spots<00:03:35.530> per

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
what they wanted to do is how spots per

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.460 
what they wanted to do is how spots per
se<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.040> commander<00:03:36.459> would<00:03:36.549> always<00:03:36.790> be<00:03:36.910> sitting

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
se the commander would always be sitting

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.990 
se the commander would always be sitting
I<00:03:38.470> think<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.130> we<00:03:39.430> had<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.579> hatch<00:03:39.730> oh<00:03:39.880> but

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
I think it we had the hatch oh but

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.449 
I think it we had the hatch oh but
instead<00:03:40.269> sitting<00:03:40.599> outside<00:03:40.690> or<00:03:41.079> something<00:03:41.459> or

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
instead sitting outside or something or

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.339 
instead sitting outside or something or
were<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:43.299> rub<00:03:43.480> against<00:03:43.780> when<00:03:43.870> he<00:03:43.930> got<00:03:44.049> in<00:03:44.230> and

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
were to rub against when he got in and

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.539 
were to rub against when he got in and
out<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.739> know<00:03:44.829> they<00:03:44.950> wanted<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.250> add<00:03:45.370> wear

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
out you know they wanted to add wear

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.190 
out you know they wanted to add wear
marks<00:03:45.730> like<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.329> they've<00:03:46.510> they've<00:03:46.989> done

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
marks like that and they've they've done

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.900 
marks like that and they've they've done
that<00:03:47.380> but<00:03:47.560> they've<00:03:47.709> added<00:03:48.099> a<00:03:48.190> lot<00:03:48.610> of<00:03:48.790> wear

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
that but they've added a lot of wear

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.420 
that but they've added a lot of wear
marks<00:03:49.150> like<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.950> little<00:03:50.950> more<00:03:51.069> than<00:03:51.220> makes

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
marks like a little more than makes

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.740 
marks like a little more than makes
sense<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:51.940> me<00:03:52.000> personally<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:52.630> think<00:03:53.400> maybe<00:03:54.400> not

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
sense to me personally I think maybe not

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.030 
sense to me personally I think maybe not
the<00:03:55.750> only<00:03:55.900> thing<00:03:56.079> I<00:03:56.200> feel<00:03:56.230> like<00:03:56.560> these<00:03:56.709> tanks

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
the only thing I feel like these tanks

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.509 
the only thing I feel like these tanks
are<00:03:57.130> lacking<00:03:57.430> in<00:03:57.959> HD<00:03:58.959> textures<00:03:59.319> is<00:03:59.470> well<00:04:00.400> they

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
are lacking in HD textures is well they

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.640 
are lacking in HD textures is well they
all<00:04:00.639> look<00:04:00.819> very<00:04:00.850> used<00:04:01.540> but<00:04:02.290> they<00:04:02.410> don't<00:04:02.500> look

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
all look very used but they don't look

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.319 
all look very used but they don't look
like<00:04:02.709> they've<00:04:02.980> seen<00:04:03.250> combat<00:04:03.579> which<00:04:04.030> is<00:04:04.180> what<00:04:04.299> I

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
like they've seen combat which is what I

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.360 
like they've seen combat which is what I
kind<00:04:04.600> of<00:04:04.660> wanted<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:05.019> wanted<00:04:05.139> to<00:04:05.350> see<00:04:05.530> little

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
kind of wanted I wanted to see little

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.740 
kind of wanted I wanted to see little
shell<00:04:06.609> craters<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.180> stuff<00:04:07.389> all<00:04:07.510> over<00:04:07.540> the

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
shell craters and stuff all over the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.930 
shell craters and stuff all over the
tanks<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:08.350> said<00:04:08.560> that<00:04:08.709> before<00:04:08.829> so<00:04:09.730> I<00:04:09.790> won't

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
tanks and I said that before so I won't

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.150 
tanks and I said that before so I won't
dwell<00:04:10.359> on<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.660> thought<00:04:10.810> forever<00:04:11.170> but<00:04:11.440> of

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
dwell on the thought forever but of

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.129 
dwell on the thought forever but of
course<00:04:12.459> this<00:04:12.790> tank<00:04:13.060> looks<00:04:13.239> good<00:04:13.450> side<00:04:13.780> skirts

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
course this tank looks good side skirts

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.750 
course this tank looks good side skirts
are<00:04:14.230> nice<00:04:14.440> scrapes<00:04:15.100> all<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.310> way<00:04:15.400> down<00:04:15.579> them

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
are nice scrapes all the way down them

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.159 
are nice scrapes all the way down them
which<00:04:15.910> is<00:04:15.940> kind<00:04:16.329> of<00:04:16.389> realistic<00:04:16.630> because<00:04:16.989> I

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
which is kind of realistic because I

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.199 
which is kind of realistic because I
imagine<00:04:17.739> they're<00:04:17.859> going<00:04:17.979> to<00:04:18.039> be<00:04:18.209> pushing

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
imagine they're going to be pushing

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.180 
imagine they're going to be pushing
through<00:04:19.510> bushes<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:20.709> stuff<00:04:21.010> like<00:04:21.130> that

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
through bushes and and stuff like that

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.300 
through bushes and and stuff like that
as<00:04:21.609> well<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:22.740> if<00:04:23.740> they're<00:04:23.860> pushing<00:04:24.190> through

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
as well and if they're pushing through

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.890 
as well and if they're pushing through
any<00:04:24.430> trees<00:04:24.729> and<00:04:24.970> knocking<00:04:25.210> trees<00:04:25.389> down<00:04:25.690> then

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
any trees and knocking trees down then

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.420 
any trees and knocking trees down then
they're<00:04:26.380> going<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.590> get<00:04:26.680> some<00:04:26.889> scrapes<00:04:27.190> at<00:04:27.370> the

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
they're going to get some scrapes at the

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.129 
they're going to get some scrapes at the
front

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.959 

and<00:04:30.439> on<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.830> sides<00:04:31.039> and<00:04:31.249> stuff<00:04:31.460> like<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.610> but

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:31.969 
and on the sides and stuff like that but

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:37.629 
and on the sides and stuff like that but
it's<00:04:32.689> very<00:04:33.409> nice<00:04:33.620> looking<00:04:36.400> comparing<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.490> two

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
it's very nice looking comparing the two

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.640 
it's very nice looking comparing the two
turrets<00:04:37.879> here<00:04:38.180> I<00:04:38.240> notice<00:04:38.539> that<00:04:38.990> it's<00:04:39.439> going<00:04:39.590> to

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
turrets here I notice that it's going to

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.189 
turrets here I notice that it's going to
swap<00:04:40.639> my<00:04:40.849> gun<00:04:41.060> here<00:04:41.240> when<00:04:41.330> I<00:04:41.389> do<00:04:41.449> this<00:04:41.659> but<00:04:41.870> the

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
swap my gun here when I do this but the

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.659 
swap my gun here when I do this but the
only<00:04:42.289> real<00:04:42.469> difference<00:04:42.590> is<00:04:42.949> the<00:04:43.069> gun<00:04:43.279> on<00:04:43.310> top

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
only real difference is the gun on top

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.110 
only real difference is the gun on top
and<00:04:43.939> this<00:04:44.870> I<00:04:45.249> don't<00:04:46.249> know<00:04:46.310> what<00:04:46.460> exactly<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.939> be

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
and this I don't know what exactly it be

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.029 
and this I don't know what exactly it be
at<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.300> back<00:04:47.509> and<00:04:48.080> what's<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.710> purpose<00:04:48.889> of

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
at the back and what's the purpose of

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.260 
at the back and what's the purpose of
that<00:04:49.159> is<00:04:49.219> it<00:04:49.460> like<00:04:50.439> storage<00:04:51.439> or<00:04:52.099> III<00:04:52.999> don't

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
that is it like storage or III don't

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.700 
that is it like storage or III don't
know<00:04:53.449> but<00:04:53.749> if<00:04:53.840> i<00:04:53.900> switch<00:04:54.110> back<00:04:54.349> you'll<00:04:54.560> see

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
know but if i switch back you'll see

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.230 
know but if i switch back you'll see
that<00:04:54.830> that's<00:04:55.370> pretty<00:04:55.550> much<00:04:55.639> the<00:04:55.699> only<00:04:55.849> change

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
that that's pretty much the only change

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.279 
that that's pretty much the only change
to<00:04:56.509> it<00:04:56.629> and<00:04:57.129> i<00:04:58.129> just<00:04:58.310> gave<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.759> big<00:04:59.569> hundred
