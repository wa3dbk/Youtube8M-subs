00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:08.337
The miracle of birth approaches silently.

00:00:23.044 --> 00:00:26.599
&lt;i&gt;Dragonfly reaching adult stage&lt;/i&gt;
The larva of a large dragonfly must
spend an entire year under water

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.036
just for this moment alone.

00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:34.131
Tonight, this dragonfly
must overcome the final test

00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:35.947
in order to become an adult.

00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:02.791
It looks very weak.

00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.553
But behold, the final transformation
is about to take place.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.778
The wings determine
the future of the dragonflies.

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:41.597
These two clear sets of wings

00:01:41.597 --> 00:01:45.609
will take this dragonfly
to a whole new world into the sky.

00:01:53.544 --> 00:01:57.389
&lt;i&gt;Davidius Lunatus Bartenef&lt;/i&gt;
This is when the lives of dragonflies
hang in the balance.

00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:02.889
This particular dragonfly
was incredibly unlucky.

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.033
While fluttering its wings,
it was attacked by ants.

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.650
For dragonflies,
fluttering their wings signifies

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.737
the most victorious moment of their lives
but they are also vulnerable.

00:02:33.257 --> 00:02:35.257
This is because until the wings
become completely dried,

00:02:35.257 --> 00:02:38.382
dragonflies cannot move at all.

00:02:50.306 --> 00:02:52.633
It cannot emerge into an adult.

00:03:01.338 --> 00:03:03.306
Before this dragonfly could
even fly into the blue sky,

00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:06.878
its wings became the trophy
of the ant warriors.

00:03:19.538 --> 00:03:24.208
The percentage of dragonflies
that reach adulthood is only about 30%.

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:29.469
7 out of 10 end their short lives before
they are even given a chance to fly.

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.195
Dragonflies eat small insects
all of their lives.

00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:51.111
However, they can be eaten by ants
which are much smaller in size.

00:04:05.292 --> 00:04:09.703
A fierce fight for survival is just
a part of the insects' everyday lives.

00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:31.630
Small and large creatures
exist everywhere here.

00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:43.081
On the earth, humans have lived on
for generations

00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:47.257
and the same can be said
for numerous insects.

00:04:50.613 --> 00:04:55.634
Among them, dragonflies are one of
the earliest species to appear on earth.
