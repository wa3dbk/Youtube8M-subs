I<00:07:08.860> feel<00:07:09.010> I<00:07:09.040> did<00:07:09.280> pretty<00:07:09.460> well<00:07:09.580> you<00:07:10.330> know<00:07:10.420> I

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:10.450 
I feel I did pretty well you know I

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.720 
I feel I did pretty well you know I
didn't<00:07:10.720> camp<00:07:10.900> it<00:07:11.020> up<00:07:11.110> or<00:07:11.230> anything<00:07:11.320> like<00:07:11.530> that

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:11.730 
didn't camp it up or anything like that

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.340 
didn't camp it up or anything like that
but<00:07:12.730> I'm<00:07:13.240> kind<00:07:13.450> of<00:07:13.510> curious<00:07:13.690> right<00:07:14.140> now<00:07:14.320> I

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:14.350 
but I'm kind of curious right now I

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.190 
but I'm kind of curious right now I
think<00:07:14.530> my<00:07:14.770> highest<00:07:15.250> killstreak<00:07:15.930> if<00:07:16.930> you<00:07:17.080> guys

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.200 
think my highest killstreak if you guys

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.020 
think my highest killstreak if you guys
look<00:07:17.380> at<00:07:17.470> your<00:07:17.590> stats<00:07:17.800> killstreaks<00:07:18.310> go<00:07:18.520> by<00:07:18.730> gun

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.030 
look at your stats killstreaks go by gun

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.150 
look at your stats killstreaks go by gun
kills<00:07:19.300> and<00:07:19.540> not<00:07:19.660> actually<00:07:20.320> by<00:07:20.470> using<00:07:20.800> kill

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 
kills and not actually by using kill

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.280 
kills and not actually by using kill
streaks<00:07:21.460> and<00:07:21.670> stuff<00:07:21.850> like<00:07:22.000> that<00:07:22.060> your<00:07:22.810> your

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.290 
streaks and stuff like that your your

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.960 
streaks and stuff like that your your
kill<00:07:23.560> streaks<00:07:23.860> on<00:07:24.100> black<00:07:24.490> ops<00:07:24.700> and

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:24.970 
kill streaks on black ops and

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.240 
kill streaks on black ops and
straight-up<00:07:25.270> gun<00:07:25.630> kills<00:07:25.930> and<00:07:26.230> so<00:07:26.830> I<00:07:26.860> think<00:07:27.160> it

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.250 
straight-up gun kills and so I think it

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.710 
straight-up gun kills and so I think it
takes<00:07:27.280> a<00:07:27.550> lot<00:07:27.700> more<00:07:27.730> skill<00:07:28.120> to<00:07:28.270> actually<00:07:28.570> get

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 
takes a lot more skill to actually get

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.930 
takes a lot more skill to actually get
that<00:07:28.900> kill<00:07:29.200> streak<00:07:29.500> up<00:07:29.680> high<00:07:29.950> and<00:07:30.280> I'm<00:07:30.700> kind<00:07:30.880> of

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:30.940 
that kill streak up high and I'm kind of

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.370 
that kill streak up high and I'm kind of
curious<00:07:31.060> what<00:07:31.420> is<00:07:31.510> your<00:07:31.690> guys's<00:07:31.990> killstreak

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.380 
curious what is your guys's killstreak

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.350 
curious what is your guys's killstreak
currently<00:07:32.740> sitting<00:07:32.980> at<00:07:33.100> mine<00:07:33.370> right<00:07:33.640> now<00:07:33.670> for
