create<00:00:00.989> a<00:00:01.020> set<00:00:01.260> of<00:00:01.350> data<00:00:01.589> with<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:02.040> function

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
create a set of data with this function

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.180 
create a set of data with this function
graph<00:00:03.360> this<00:00:03.600> data<00:00:03.870> set<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.380> what<00:00:04.890> kind<00:00:05.100> of

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
graph this data set and what kind of

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.980 
graph this data set and what kind of
transformation<00:00:05.910> should<00:00:06.150> be<00:00:06.330> done<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.839> make

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
transformation should be done to make

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.980 
transformation should be done to make
this<00:00:07.170> data<00:00:08.099> more<00:00:08.340> linear<00:00:08.550> well<00:00:09.389> already<00:00:09.719> we

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
this data more linear well already we

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.600 
this data more linear well already we
could<00:00:10.170> see<00:00:10.410> from<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:10.889> this<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.429> an

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
could see from this that this is an

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
could see from this that this is an
example<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.210> y<00:00:12.450> equals<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.139> X<00:00:13.969> to<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.120> B<00:00:15.150> power

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
example of y equals a X to the B power

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.750 
example of y equals a X to the B power
right<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.710> that's<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.160> case<00:00:17.369> where<00:00:17.640> we're

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
right so that's the case where we're

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.950 
right so that's the case where we're
going<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.940> need<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.210> do<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> log<00:00:18.690> log

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
going to need to do a log log

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.260 
going to need to do a log log
transformation<00:00:19.640> we're<00:00:20.640> going<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> need<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.119> do

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
transformation we're going to need to do

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.380 
transformation we're going to need to do
transformations<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.170> both<00:00:22.470> x<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.460> y<00:00:23.730> but

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
transformations to both x and y but

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.230 
transformations to both x and y but
let's<00:00:24.990> first<00:00:25.289> look<00:00:25.529> at<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.830> shape<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.490> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
let's first look at the shape of it to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.569 
let's first look at the shape of it to
see<00:00:27.859> to<00:00:28.859> see<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.269> excuse<00:00:30.269> me<00:00:31.219> to<00:00:32.219> see<00:00:32.399> what

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
see to see what excuse me to see what

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.420 
see to see what excuse me to see what
this<00:00:33.480> data<00:00:33.690> looks<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:35.989> okay<00:00:37.219> so<00:00:38.219> if<00:00:38.309> you

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
this data looks like okay so if you

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.670 
this data looks like okay so if you
download<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.030> examples<00:00:40.430> let's<00:00:41.430> put<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.350> it<00:00:43.350> it

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
download the examples let's put in it it

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.130 
download the examples let's put in it it
has<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.610> example<00:00:45.030> one<00:00:45.180> I've<00:00:45.390> already<00:00:45.809> put<00:00:46.050> in

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
has for example one I've already put in

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.220 
has for example one I've already put in
the<00:00:46.170> function<00:00:46.710> y<00:00:47.100> equals<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.640> X<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> power<00:00:48.870> B

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the function y equals a X to the power B

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.700 
the function y equals a X to the power B
let's<00:00:50.219> put<00:00:50.489> an<00:00:50.610> A<00:00:50.910> which<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.420> 10<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.199> B

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
let's put an A which is 10 and B

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.119 
let's put an A which is 10 and B
negative<00:00:53.399> point<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.170> 10<00:00:55.370> negative<00:00:56.370> point<00:00:56.940> for

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
negative point for 10 negative point for

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.799 
negative point for 10 negative point for
now<00:00:59.129> i've<00:00:59.370> already<00:00:59.489> seated<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
now i've already seated this with just a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.110 
now i've already seated this with just a
whole<00:01:00.960> bunch<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.440> positive<00:01:01.800> integers<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:02.879> x

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
whole bunch of positive integers for x

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.450 
whole bunch of positive integers for x
that<00:01:03.449> are<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.750> steadily<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.229> up<00:01:04.619> all<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
that are just steadily going up all the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.060 
that are just steadily going up all the
way<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.880> 33<00:01:08.689> so<00:01:09.689> now<00:01:09.900> let's<00:01:10.260> find<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
way up to 33 so now let's find the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.820 
way up to 33 so now let's find the
corresponding<00:01:11.400> Y<00:01:11.790> values<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.560> order<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
corresponding Y values so in order to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.700 
corresponding Y values so in order to
find<00:01:14.040> Y<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> follow<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:16.140> this

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
find Y we just have to follow this this

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:26.899 
find Y we just have to follow this this
formula<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.049> y<00:01:19.830> equals<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:22.009> times<00:01:24.080> X<00:01:25.909> to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
formula up here so y equals a times X to

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.130 
formula up here so y equals a times X to
the<00:01:26.939> power<00:01:27.740> B<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.280> remember<00:01:29.869> Excel<00:01:30.869> knows

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the power B and remember Excel knows

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.080 
the power B and remember Excel knows
order<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.590> operations<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.520> should<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
order of operations so it should do the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.090 
order of operations so it should do the
power<00:01:33.540> before<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.259> does<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> multiplication

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
power before it does the multiplication

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.890 
power before it does the multiplication
now<00:01:38.100> once<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.549> that

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.830 

I'm<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:44.160> going<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.400> drag<00:01:44.730> all<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.690> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
I'm just going to drag all this all the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.040 
I'm just going to drag all this all the
way<00:01:45.930> down<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.940> get<00:01:48.300> a<00:01:48.330> whole<00:01:48.570> set<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.960> data<00:01:49.850> oh

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
way down and get a whole set of data oh

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.650 
way down and get a whole set of data oh
I<00:01:52.050> think<00:01:52.830> I<00:01:53.040> forgot<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.430> lock<00:01:53.880> down<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.390> yes<00:01:54.540> I

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
I think I forgot to lock down and yes I

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.650 
I think I forgot to lock down and yes I
did<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.410> I<00:01:55.470> forgot<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.130> lock<00:01:56.340> down<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.940> and<00:01:57.000> B<00:01:57.300> so

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
did so I forgot to lock down a and B so

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.090 
did so I forgot to lock down a and B so
that's<00:01:57.990> why<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.380> giving<00:01:58.710> me<00:01:58.740> all<00:01:58.950> this

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that's why it's giving me all this

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.020 
that's why it's giving me all this
craziness

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
craziness

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:10.980 
craziness
so<00:02:00.660> let's<00:02:00.870> lock<00:02:01.170> down<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.840> lock<00:02:04.260> down<00:02:04.290> B

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.590 

so<00:02:11.530> once<00:02:11.770> we<00:02:11.950> have<00:02:12.100> that<00:02:12.130> then<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.760> can<00:02:15.600> alright

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
so once we have that then I can alright

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.530 
so once we have that then I can alright
uh<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.530> now<00:02:17.830> we<00:02:17.890> see<00:02:18.190> we<00:02:18.340> have<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.700> nice<00:02:19.030> curb

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
uh and now we see we have this nice curb

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.170 
uh and now we see we have this nice curb
if<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.710> remember<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.340> sort<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.580> like<00:02:21.640> the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
if you remember this is sort of like the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.530 
if you remember this is sort of like the
like<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.010> second<00:02:24.240> type<00:02:25.240> of<00:02:25.350> curve<00:02:26.350> or<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.540> so

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
like the second type of curve or so so

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.370 
like the second type of curve or so so
we<00:02:28.720> know<00:02:28.900> we<00:02:29.080> need<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.380> do<00:02:29.560> both<00:02:30.960> both<00:02:31.960> kinds<00:02:32.320> of

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
we know we need to do both both kinds of

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.940 
we know we need to do both both kinds of
transformations<00:02:33.250> already<00:02:33.960> right<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:37.950> it

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
transformations already right and it

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.160 
transformations already right and it
would<00:02:39.130> be<00:02:39.310> helpful<00:02:39.490> for<00:02:39.880> us<00:02:40.030> if<00:02:40.270> we<00:02:40.900> could

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
would be helpful for us if we could

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.590 
would be helpful for us if we could
actually<00:02:41.940> sort<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.090> shrink<00:02:43.930> shrink<00:02:44.670> Y<00:02:45.670> but

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
actually sort of a shrink shrink Y but

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.130 
actually sort of a shrink shrink Y but
also<00:02:46.780> maybe<00:02:47.110> shrink<00:02:47.710> X<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.580> log<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> way<00:02:50.110> of

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
also maybe shrink X and log is a way of

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.580 
also maybe shrink X and log is a way of
shrinking<00:02:51.000> shrinking<00:02:52.000> both<00:02:52.600> of<00:02:52.780> them<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.080> so

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
shrinking shrinking both of them and so

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.230 
shrinking shrinking both of them and so
why<00:02:54.550> don't<00:02:54.700> we<00:02:54.760> try<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.210> log<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:57.550> let's<00:02:57.790> do<00:02:57.970> log

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
why don't we try and log so let's do log

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.740 
why don't we try and log so let's do log
transform<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.080> get<00:02:59.410> log<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.680> X<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.490> get<00:03:01.180> log<00:03:01.480> of

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
transform so get log of X and get log of

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.000 
transform so get log of X and get log of
Y<00:03:01.960> you<00:03:02.650> feel<00:03:02.950> free<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.220> also<00:03:03.460> use<00:03:03.820> natural<00:03:04.240> log

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
Y you feel free to also use natural log

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.360 
Y you feel free to also use natural log
I'm<00:03:06.010> gonna<00:03:06.250> assume<00:03:06.550> log<00:03:06.910> base<00:03:07.180> ten<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.370> Excel

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
I'm gonna assume log base ten and Excel

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.180 
I'm gonna assume log base ten and Excel
thankfully<00:03:09.910> has<00:03:10.120> log<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.930> I'm<00:03:11.740> going<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.010> use

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
thankfully has log and I'm going to use

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.880 
thankfully has log and I'm going to use
log<00:03:12.430> 10<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.670> I'm<00:03:16.150> going<00:03:16.270> to<00:03:16.330> put<00:03:16.630> in<00:03:16.900> my<00:03:17.200> X

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
log 10 and I'm going to put in my X

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.720 
log 10 and I'm going to put in my X
right<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:20.140> it's<00:03:20.320> going<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.560> change<00:03:20.920> X<00:03:21.310> from

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
right and so it's going to change X from

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.320 
right and so it's going to change X from
this<00:03:22.260> into<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:24.810> sort<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:25.870> exponent<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:26.740> ten<00:03:27.490> to

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
this into the sort of exponent so ten to

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.610 
this into the sort of exponent so ten to
the<00:03:28.360> zero<00:03:28.660> power<00:03:29.440> will<00:03:30.220> give<00:03:30.400> us<00:03:30.580> one<00:03:30.910> right

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
the zero power will give us one right

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.870 
the zero power will give us one right
and<00:03:32.620> I'm<00:03:32.830> going<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.010> do<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.250> same<00:03:33.490> thing<00:03:33.700> to

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
and I'm going to do the same thing to

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:43.920 
and I'm going to do the same thing to
why<00:03:36.510> okay<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:38.100> 10<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:41.520> first<00:03:42.520> power<00:03:42.640> 1<00:03:43.330> to

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
why okay so 10 to the first power 1 to

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.850 
why okay so 10 to the first power 1 to
the<00:03:43.990> power<00:03:44.140> 1<00:03:44.230> will<00:03:44.950> give<00:03:45.100> us<00:03:45.280> 10<00:03:45.550> right<00:03:46.210> and<00:03:46.860> so

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
the power 1 will give us 10 right and so

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.360 
the power 1 will give us 10 right and so
I'm<00:03:48.160> gonna<00:03:48.310> take<00:03:48.580> that<00:03:49.050> and<00:03:50.050> copy<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.100> paste

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
I'm gonna take that and copy and paste

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.090 
I'm gonna take that and copy and paste
that<00:03:51.490> all<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:51.940> way<00:03:52.030> down<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:53.380> get<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.590> nice<00:03:53.830> log

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
that all the way down and get a nice log

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.930 
that all the way down and get a nice log
transform<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:54.910> here<00:03:55.780> I've<00:03:56.050> already<00:03:56.380> made<00:03:57.310> put

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
transform and here I've already made put

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.540 
transform and here I've already made put
this<00:03:58.090> graph<00:03:58.990> and<00:03:59.230> set<00:03:59.410> this<00:03:59.530> up<00:03:59.740> so<00:03:59.920> that<00:04:00.400> it'll

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
this graph and set this up so that it'll

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.870 
this graph and set this up so that it'll
actually<00:04:01.360> get<00:04:01.990> this<00:04:02.200> data<00:04:02.530> so<00:04:03.460> if<00:04:03.550> you<00:04:03.640> click

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
actually get this data so if you click

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.460 
actually get this data so if you click
on<00:04:04.060> those<00:04:04.270> it<00:04:04.330> will<00:04:04.600> show<00:04:04.810> you<00:04:04.870> which<00:04:05.110> data

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
on those it will show you which data

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.530 
on those it will show you which data
that<00:04:05.740> it's<00:04:05.890> using<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.430> I've<00:04:07.030> already<00:04:07.180> labeled

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
that it's using and I've already labeled

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.920 
that it's using and I've already labeled
it<00:04:07.840> as<00:04:07.990> log<00:04:08.350> Y<00:04:08.650> instead<00:04:09.250> of<00:04:09.340> just<00:04:09.520> Y<00:04:09.730> and<00:04:10.090> log<00:04:10.570> X

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
it as log Y instead of just Y and log X

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.200 
it as log Y instead of just Y and log X
instead<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.410> just<00:04:11.710> X<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.310> what<00:04:12.850> do<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:13.030> notice

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
instead of just X and what do you notice

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.430 
instead of just X and what do you notice
this<00:04:13.720> data<00:04:14.200> that<00:04:14.530> has<00:04:14.740> once<00:04:15.070> been<00:04:15.280> curved<00:04:16.090> is

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
this data that has once been curved is

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.740 
this data that has once been curved is
now<00:04:17.440> sort<00:04:17.710> of<00:04:17.799> straightened<00:04:18.520> out<00:04:18.820> right<00:04:19.330> and

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
now sort of straightened out right and

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.390 
now sort of straightened out right and
so<00:04:20.440> this<00:04:21.400> is<00:04:21.640> one<00:04:22.000> way<00:04:22.240> where<00:04:22.540> transformation

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
so this is one way where transformation

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.180 
so this is one way where transformation
can<00:04:23.610> be<00:04:23.699> useful<00:04:24.060> because<00:04:24.360> now<00:04:24.780> we<00:04:25.350> could<00:04:25.590> use

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
can be useful because now we could use

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.480 
can be useful because now we could use
log<00:04:26.580> X<00:04:26.910> &amp;<00:04:27.180> Y<00:04:27.240> instead<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:28.139> x<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.560> y<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.860> put<00:04:29.280> log

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
log X &amp; Y instead of x and y and put log

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.409 
log X &amp; Y instead of x and y and put log
x<00:04:29.729> and<00:04:29.970> y<00:04:30.150> into<00:04:30.570> our<00:04:30.720> regression<00:04:32.419> calculations

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
x and y into our regression calculations

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.030 
x and y into our regression calculations
and<00:04:33.630> into<00:04:33.870> our<00:04:33.960> correlation<00:04:34.320> calculations

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
and into our correlation calculations

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.590 
and into our correlation calculations
and<00:04:35.190> we<00:04:35.520> should<00:04:35.699> be<00:04:35.820> able<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.060> get<00:04:36.300> more

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
and we should be able to get more

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.669 
and we should be able to get more
traction<00:04:36.960> out<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.770> using<00:04:38.130> those<00:04:38.310> tools
