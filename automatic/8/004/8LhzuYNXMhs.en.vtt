junkie dotnet video today we'll be going
through<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:14.070> entire<00:00:14.940> process<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.870> modding<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
through the entire process of modding a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.790 
through the entire process of modding a
PlayStation<00:00:17.820> 1<00:00:19.130> with<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.760> mod<00:00:21.180> chip<00:00:21.390> now<00:00:22.230> we're

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
PlayStation 1 with a mod chip now we're

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.519 
PlayStation 1 with a mod chip now we're
also<00:00:22.949> going<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.250> make<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> no<00:00:23.760> chip<00:00:24.230> so<00:00:25.230> over

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
also going to make the no chip so over

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.769 
also going to make the no chip so over
here<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.660> from<00:00:27.660> element<00:00:28.140> 14<00:00:28.460> Farnell<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
here we have from element 14 Farnell a

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.569 
here we have from element 14 Farnell a
bunch<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.990> microchip<00:00:32.390> so<00:00:33.390> anyone<00:00:33.930> that's<00:00:34.550> fine

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
bunch of microchip so anyone that's fine

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.869 
bunch of microchip so anyone that's fine
we've<00:00:35.880> got<00:00:36.059> some<00:00:36.260> 30<00:00:37.260> AWG<00:00:38.070> wire<00:00:40.250> USB<00:00:41.250> cable<00:00:41.700> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
we've got some 30 AWG wire USB cable and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.229 
we've got some 30 AWG wire USB cable and
a<00:00:42.090> programmer<00:00:42.600> which<00:00:42.930> does<00:00:43.200> pick<00:00:44.239> these

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
a programmer which does pick these

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:53.709 
a programmer which does pick these
particular<00:00:45.660> ones<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:45.930> pic<00:00:46.200> 12<00:00:46.649> C<00:00:47.090> 5:08<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:51.530> 8/10

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
particular ones are pic 12 C 5:08 a 8/10

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.689 
particular ones are pic 12 C 5:08 a 8/10
so<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.960> PlayStation<00:00:55.440> we're<00:00:55.559> working<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.129> is

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so the PlayStation we're working with is

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.920 
so the PlayStation we're working with is
a<00:00:58.070> one<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> last<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.850> these<00:01:00.059> types<00:01:00.570> without

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
a one of the last of these types without

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.330 
a one of the last of these types without
the<00:01:01.320> parallel<00:01:02.160> i/o<00:01:02.370> port<00:01:02.850> there<00:01:06.799> as<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.070> model

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the parallel i/o port there as the model

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.800 
the parallel i/o port there as the model
number<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.790> there<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.970> SC<00:01:12.330> pH<00:01:12.780> 9<00:01:13.320> 0<00:01:13.799> 0<00:01:14.159> 2<00:01:14.810> so

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
number just there so SC pH 9 0 0 2 so

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.179 
number just there so SC pH 9 0 0 2 so
we're<00:01:15.930> gonna<00:01:16.020> go<00:01:16.200> ahead<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.470> fire<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
we're gonna go ahead and fire up the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.620 
we're gonna go ahead and fire up the
program<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:20.299> we'll<00:01:21.299> start<00:01:21.570> there<00:01:23.570> ok<00:01:24.570> so

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
program and we'll start there ok so

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.770 
program and we'll start there ok so
right<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.470> are<00:01:25.650> firing<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.820> chip

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
right now we are firing up the chip

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.969 
right now we are firing up the chip
burner<00:01:28.100> software<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.650> burner<00:01:31.650> I'm<00:01:31.829> using

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
burner software for the burner I'm using

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.190 
burner software for the burner I'm using

microchip<00:01:37.860> there<00:01:38.750> this<00:01:39.750> particular<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
microchip there this particular one is a

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:48.100 
microchip there this particular one is a
12c<00:01:42.329> 5:08<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:45.920> let's<00:01:46.920> go<00:01:47.130> look<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> up<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
12c 5:08 a let's go look it up in the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:02:00.900 
12c 5:08 a let's go look it up in the
devices

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.780 

12c<00:02:03.010> 5:08

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
hell had it picked the wrong one should

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.440 
hell had it picked the wrong one should
overclock<00:02:27.190> my<00:02:27.340> computer<00:02:27.790> isn't<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.240> running

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
overclock my computer isn't it running

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:39.059 
overclock my computer isn't it running
as<00:02:28.570> fast<00:02:28.750> as<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.050> should

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.000 

it's<00:02:39.579> been<00:02:39.790> up<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:41.140> see<00:02:41.319> that<00:02:41.349> manufacturer

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
it's been up you see that manufacturer

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:53.070 
it's been up you see that manufacturer
is<00:02:42.219> microchip<00:02:43.180> very<00:02:43.750> creative

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.130 

there's<00:02:53.740> no<00:02:53.920> that's<00:02:54.100> switched<00:02:54.370> over<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:55.140> over

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
there's no that's switched over and over

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.900 
there's no that's switched over and over
here<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.410> tells<00:02:56.650> us<00:02:56.830> how<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.010> insert<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:57.670> chip

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
here it tells us how to insert the chip

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.050 
here it tells us how to insert the chip
which<00:02:58.210> is<00:02:58.360> very<00:02:58.570> useful<00:02:59.020> so<00:02:59.280> it's<00:03:00.280> somewhere

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
which is very useful so it's somewhere

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.200 
which is very useful so it's somewhere
in<00:03:01.210> the<00:03:01.300> middle<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.780> damn<00:03:01.930> thing<00:03:02.230> that's

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
in the middle of the damn thing that's

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:13.200 
in the middle of the damn thing that's
that's<00:03:04.210> fun<00:03:05.490> not<00:03:06.490> faces<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.300> top<00:03:12.210> 20

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
that's fun not faces to the top 20

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:21.420 
that's fun not faces to the top 20
spaces<00:03:13.420> you<00:03:13.690> reckon<00:03:13.990> are<00:03:14.080> there<00:03:20.430> there's

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
spaces you reckon are there there's

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:31.920 
spaces you reckon are there there's
looks<00:03:21.580> like<00:03:21.760> it's<00:03:26.610> yeah

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.960 

look<00:03:32.590> at<00:03:32.709> that<00:03:32.799> right<00:03:35.340> off

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
look at that right off

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.710 
look at that right off
sort<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.780> five<00:03:39.050> there<00:03:40.210> well<00:03:41.210> we'll<00:03:41.360> see<00:03:41.510> how<00:03:41.660> we

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
sort of five there well we'll see how we

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.510 
sort of five there well we'll see how we
go<00:03:41.900> anyway

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
go anyway

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.950 
go anyway
so<00:03:43.520> next<00:03:43.700> step<00:03:43.820> is<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.180> load<00:03:44.300> up<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.540> code<00:03:44.750> now

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
so next step is to load up the code now

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.240 
so next step is to load up the code now
it<00:03:45.050> was<00:03:45.140> a<00:03:45.200> bit<00:03:45.320> difficult<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.800> choose<00:03:46.040> between

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
it was a bit difficult to choose between

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.770 
it was a bit difficult to choose between
the<00:03:46.670> oh<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:49.280> many<00:03:49.460> options<00:03:49.610> for<00:03:49.880> mod<00:03:50.090> ships<00:03:50.330> so

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
the oh so many options for mod ships so

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.950 
the oh so many options for mod ships so
I've<00:03:50.900> actually<00:03:51.110> gone<00:03:51.440> with<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:52.960> multimode<00:03:53.960> 3

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
I've actually gone with the multimode 3

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:05.230 
I've actually gone with the multimode 3
which<00:03:57.970> seems<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.090> be<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.300> decent<00:03:59.510> one<00:04:04.120> there<00:04:05.120> is

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
which seems to be a decent one there is

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.700 
which seems to be a decent one there is
something<00:04:05.750> wrong<00:04:05.870> with<00:04:06.020> my<00:04:06.170> parallels

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
something wrong with my parallels

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:16.909 
something wrong with my parallels
installation

let's<00:05:04.400> have<00:05:04.520> to<00:05:04.640> go<00:05:04.760> double-check<00:05:05.060> what<00:05:05.390> on

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
let's have to go double-check what on

I've<00:05:07.310> decided<00:05:07.490> to<00:05:07.940> leave<00:05:08.510> these<00:05:08.750> at<00:05:08.930> their

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
I've decided to leave these at their

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.870 
I've decided to leave these at their
default<00:05:09.500> settings<00:05:09.590> because<00:05:10.520> I<00:05:12.610> couldn't<00:05:13.610> find

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
default settings because I couldn't find

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.950 
default settings because I couldn't find
out<00:05:14.320> they<00:05:15.320> are<00:05:17.110> so<00:05:19.180> simple<00:05:20.180> as<00:05:20.390> that<00:05:20.540> you<00:05:20.930> just

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
out they are so simple as that you just

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:29.710 
out they are so simple as that you just
hit<00:05:23.290> right

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:49.790 

you<00:05:30.200> know<00:05:30.260> programming

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
configuration there if I found there you

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
program of all which means I've just

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.790 
program of all which means I've just
thrown<00:06:01.690> out<00:06:01.960> a<00:06:01.990> chip<00:06:03.990> it's<00:06:04.990> funny<00:06:05.350> because<00:06:05.620> I

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
thrown out a chip it's funny because I

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.980 
thrown out a chip it's funny because I
later<00:06:06.130> found<00:06:06.250> out<00:06:06.610> you<00:06:06.850> could<00:06:07.000> use<00:06:07.180> a<00:06:07.210> some

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
later found out you could use a some

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.190 
later found out you could use a some
updated<00:06:08.410> code<00:06:08.620> about<00:06:09.220> mm3<00:06:09.960> awesome<00:06:10.960> flash

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200

chips<00:06:11.560> which<00:06:11.920> are<00:06:12.070> rewritable<00:06:12.790> so<00:06:13.090> I'm<00:06:13.900> going

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
chips which are rewritable so I'm going

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.960 
chips which are rewritable so I'm going
down<00:06:14.260> that<00:06:14.320> path<00:06:14.470> stay<00:06:15.430> tuned<00:06:15.670> we'll<00:06:15.820> have<00:06:15.910> a

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
down that path stay tuned we'll have a

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:16.650 
down that path stay tuned we'll have a
video<00:06:16.270> on<00:06:16.330> it

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660

a proper one thanks for watching I hope
you<00:06:20.560> learned<00:06:20.800> how<00:06:21.070> not<00:06:21.100> to<00:06:21.370> flash<00:06:21.760> a<00:06:21.790> mod<00:06:22.120> chip
