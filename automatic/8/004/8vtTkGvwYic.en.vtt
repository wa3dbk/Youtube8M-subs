00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello today we will prepare a super glass 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.540
 original tequila with a cucumber I'll 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.540
 I explain 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.000
 x 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.610
 in powder like chile piquÃ­n chile with 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.390
 salt chile with lemon whatever it is a 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.580
 teaspoon more or less of this size a 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.850
 cucumber preferably so be it 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.080
 a thick that is chubby and long for 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.140
 what can you 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.840
 work well with him a small knife and 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.970
 a large knife that does not have a saw 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.850
 because then the sierra is like that 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.840
 cucumber and damage is not very well what 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.140
 that we have to do that 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.140
 we cut the cucumber I like to cut 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.190
 first the banks because the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:59.090
 legend that if I cut the edges and 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.910
 carvings the cucumber does not get bitter I do not know if 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.080
 be true, but not my grandmother 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.080
 He said it and now I always do 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.370
 after 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.880
 let's make the glass here we cut like 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.880
 here 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:24.360
 can be the big knife better 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.360
 and around here more or less 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.260
 I leave this part 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.660
 and I'm going to work with this we're going to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.660
 start to take the center 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.940
 if you see that it costs you a little work 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:06.710
 down you can breathe a little bit 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:09.679
 with the knife to remove everything and 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.420
 Of course you have to be careful not to arrive 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.000
 right up down because if not 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.360
 obviously we are going to make the hole and the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.360
 cucumber 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.160
 it's gone, the glass is not going to work 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.190
 ready to help me how we were left there 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.600
 some seeds we can then remove them 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.140
 obviously we have clean hands 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.450
 true 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.560
 and we take out 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:40.950
 the little seeds so that when you put the 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:45.110
 tequila then do not go out there flying 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:49.290
 good floating ready since it looks like this 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:53.400
 you can leave the cucumber like that or peel it 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.849
 everything or make a few 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.450
 there are some small lines so that 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.450
 see father 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.550
 ready 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.810
 since we have it well, we drain well 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:19.310
 well well well well well and in the chile 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:24.010
 we put it once and it remains 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.010
 and now we do empty the tequila 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.870
 ready we have our good tequila 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:41.430
 our glass of tequila does not fall you give yourself 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.470
 account does not fall down and if you want 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.910
 that are fresher you can put them 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.250
 first to the refrigerator to which they are 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.410
 as fresh they are a little hard not 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.090
 the goals to the freezer because what 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.489
 you are going to do is that they will harden and 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.380
 when they start to warm up with him with 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.150
 the environment are going to start saving 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.120
 then it will not come out 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:08.330
 the ideal is to put them like this or leave them at 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.330
 fresh air ready now if health 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.580
 we come back where they are still happy 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.580
 parties
