00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.429
 hello to all and sÃ©bastien live from the block which is the common point 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.049
 today presentation of free holding venturi expensive 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.489
 first hands-free kit all of us 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:18.359
 which will allow you more to receive your calls on the essence of your 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.529
 vehicle 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.249
 who also operates in the world 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.289
 to listen to your mp3s 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.289
 on pleasantly within your vehicle 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.569
 so we'll do a little presentation directly since when 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.570
 a vehicle 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.480
 art nouveau and if this time in the vehicle with the hands-free kit 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.920
 killing for use 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.450
 and a more in-depth presentation of the product 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.990
 so there we can see that the hands-free kits on summer set 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.990
 on the the meaning of radio fm is 92% 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.850
 and we see that we made these comments left on the car radio 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.160
 on the 92 points in addition to world 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.820
 for him who can possibly understand more very well where are 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.200
 your other all radio records a frequency 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.280
 % are not in key plates during their memory we register you the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.250
 venturi so it's very French 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.350
 to have direct access to the hands-free kit 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.830
 so we will do a simulation in the sentence 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.270
 any case typically that I will be called 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.730
 my answering machine 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.470
 the call that starts or not to take bouteflika from there we can hear 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.960
 torres 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.100
 we see that the second is dispatcher for the car radios for the misfortune of 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.380
 the radio 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.820
 so we understand we are always on the call directly from a compromise 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.180
 who could not keep my passage in los angeles so that they will touch them 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.530
 backlit 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.290
 for his club at night it's rather hectic in the water 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.460
 % and backlit keys depending on the circle possibilities 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.590
 atypical world so could that for the fair 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.250
 but hell hang up 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.650
 it is therefore we can not appeal what it is touching side we do that 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.100
 every winters that allowed the room 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.270
 so in fact we then go to the menu 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.950
 a pool menu phone so here we can call the last number 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.750
 so especially you have so the famous more expensive than plays by the cud allows to 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.340
 start the call 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.969
 it is then necessary to have access to his contacts 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.299
 for his lawyer that assumes when we are a small parameterization at the start and 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.269
 phone 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.999
 to access 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:18.029
 for the features of the hands-free kit all this time it takes 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:18.969
 know that the 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.369
 when there is no two external microphone 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:24.669
 % but the microphone that is built into the product is really of a very big 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:25.489
 quality 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.779
 he will even go 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.639
 the road seems nice 130 highway 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.799
 for 100 euros to match a reproduction in perfect 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:35.689
 so then we'll watch that 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.340
 look up the p3 side of the product name so that's really the most fun 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.719
 so notice if we do that 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.819
 we will launch the music so 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.569
 two others I guess you have one for mobiles 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.999
 for those who wish so happy to us all and stereo 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:53.459
 % rolling in fact you can access your most promising one we will launch 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.669
 directly the mp3 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:56.879
 and here 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.999
 and actually be the device laurence europe 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.079
 this relationship with the phone 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.329
 for the handles 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.399
 so the mp3 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.399
 your mobile 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.049
 during this time will also be under the vehicle 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.049
 the product otherwise the driving pleasure 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.259
 it's with the molecule 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.259
 This is understandable 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.989
 hahahahaha 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.989
 see 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:45.770
 during this move a little more his image 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.580
 in summer 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.580
 and to decide in the speakers of the vehicle 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.209
 the club can turn around 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:57.780
 I spotted 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.209
 so to return to the best of us could also receive a 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.589
 call to listen to us 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:06.459
 his clients 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:12.809
 and return to mode 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:16.599
 so that was yesterday at the presentation of the hands-free kit in 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:17.439
 killing 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:19.659
 % a pretty good title and
