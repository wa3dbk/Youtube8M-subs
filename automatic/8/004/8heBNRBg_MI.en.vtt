it doesn't sound out and sometimes she

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.690 
it doesn't sound out and sometimes she
will<00:03:48.170> put<00:03:48.290> their<00:03:48.409> thumb<00:03:48.590> right<00:03:48.829> here<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.159> move

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
will put their thumb right here and move

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.550 
will put their thumb right here and move
that<00:03:49.879> sixth<00:03:50.209> string<00:03:50.450> so<00:03:50.659> you<00:03:50.690> get<00:03:50.900> 5th<00:03:51.170> 4th<00:03:51.470> 3rd

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
that sixth string so you get 5th 4th 3rd

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.559 
that sixth string so you get 5th 4th 3rd
and<00:03:51.950> 2nd<00:03:52.310> sounding<00:03:52.670> out

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.539 

as<00:03:58.569> you<00:03:59.379> can<00:03:59.439> see<00:03:59.590> on<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.799> tabs<00:04:00.010> for<00:04:00.189> the<00:04:00.310> song

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
as you can see on the tabs for the song

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:12.570 
as you can see on the tabs for the song
and<00:04:00.819> plays<00:04:01.000> through<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:01.299> section<00:04:01.810> twice

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.360 

that<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.600> does<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.840> exact<00:04:14.200> same<00:04:14.320> thing<00:04:14.560> you

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
that it does the exact same thing you

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.070 
that it does the exact same thing you
just<00:04:15.580> use<00:04:15.730> an<00:04:15.850> a<00:04:16.090> chord<00:04:16.420> in<00:04:16.570> replace<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.049> e

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
just use an a chord in replace of the e

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.810 
just use an a chord in replace of the e
chord<00:04:17.440> all<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.799> strumming<00:04:18.130> is<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.370> same<00:04:18.580> as

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
chord all the strumming is the same as

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:26.000 
chord all the strumming is the same as
well<00:04:19.030> as<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.150> little<00:04:19.360> lick<00:04:19.600> in<00:04:19.780> between<00:04:20.080> there

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:37.150 

then<00:04:27.010> it<00:04:27.100> goes<00:04:27.220> back<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.610> e<00:04:27.790> one<00:04:28.150> more<00:04:28.360> time

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.260 

so<00:04:38.160> like<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.400> said<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.670> goes<00:04:38.820> through<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.240> e

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
so like I said it goes through the e

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.020 
so like I said it goes through the e
line<00:04:39.660> twice<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.710> line<00:04:41.040> once<00:04:41.340> and<00:04:41.580> then<00:04:41.670> you

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
line twice the a line once and then you

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.270 
line twice the a line once and then you
line<00:04:42.270> one<00:04:42.510> more<00:04:42.630> time<00:04:42.890> altogether<00:04:43.890> that<00:04:44.160> would

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
line one more time altogether that would

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.650 
line one more time altogether that would
look<00:04:44.460> like<00:04:44.640> this

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:05:05.310 

you

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.380 

you
