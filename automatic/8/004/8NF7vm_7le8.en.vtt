00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.020 
guys who are the bane of my existence
well<00:00:50.039> jeez<00:00:50.510> that<00:00:51.510> guy<00:00:51.539> always<00:00:51.809> gets<00:00:51.930> me<00:00:52.850> it's<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
well jeez that guy always gets me it's a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.430 
well jeez that guy always gets me it's a
little<00:00:54.120> tough<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.390> tell<00:00:54.660> if<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> grenade<00:00:55.260> is

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
little tough to tell if the grenade is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.470 
little tough to tell if the grenade is
in<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> background<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.670> foreground<00:00:57.090> so

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
in the background for the foreground so

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.889 
in the background for the foreground so
you<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.050> be<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.949> aware<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.879> where<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
you have to be really aware of where the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.360 
you have to be really aware of where the
enemies<00:01:01.199> are<00:01:01.230> coming<00:01:01.590> from<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:02.219> those

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
enemies are coming from like those

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.740 
enemies are coming from like those
grenades<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.850> only<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.329> background

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
grenades can only be in the background

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.450 
grenades can only be in the background
in<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.049> hitbox<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.769> them<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.010> very<00:01:05.189> annoying

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
in the hitbox on them is very annoying

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.200 
in the hitbox on them is very annoying
so<00:01:07.310> yeah<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.400> looks<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.729> got<00:01:08.760> hit<00:01:09.030> there

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so yeah it looks like I got hit there

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.730 
so yeah it looks like I got hit there
right<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> didn't<00:01:09.990> because<00:01:10.080> those<00:01:10.439> that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
right but I didn't because those that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.649 
right but I didn't because those that
soldiers<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> foreground<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:12.420> also

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
soldiers in the foreground there also

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.270 
soldiers in the foreground there also
seems<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> point<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.650> don't<00:01:13.860> quite

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
seems to be a point and I don't quite

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.190 
seems to be a point and I don't quite
understand<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.939> we're<00:01:15.210> shinobi<00:01:15.540> gains<00:01:15.960> in

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
understand this we're shinobi gains in

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.390 
understand this we're shinobi gains in
max<00:01:16.439> health<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> little

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
max health you can see it's a little

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.609 
max health you can see it's a little
bigger<00:01:17.580> suddenly<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.200> has<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.380> do

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
bigger suddenly I think it has to do

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.990 
bigger suddenly I think it has to do
with<00:01:19.740> points<00:01:20.180> but<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.210> don't<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
with points but I don't know the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.980 
with points but I don't know the
thresholds<00:01:24.000> or<00:01:24.090> anything<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
thresholds or anything like that and the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.210 
thresholds or anything like that and the
score<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.229> only<00:01:25.439> shown<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.860> end<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.009> every

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
score is only shown at the end of every

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.910 
score is only shown at the end of every
stage<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:27.540> sure<00:01:27.810> some<00:01:28.080> industrious<00:01:28.710> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
could also shoot it to make it happen

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.319 
could also shoot it to make it happen
there's<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.219> lot<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.369> little<00:01:56.579> hidden<00:01:56.790> power<00:01:57.060> ups

I don't play to know all them but either
way<00:01:58.710> we're<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> plane<00:01:59.189> now<00:01:59.540> this<00:02:00.540> plane<00:02:00.840> was

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
way we're on a plane now this plane was

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.209 
way we're on a plane now this plane was
built<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:02.250> about<00:02:02.640> 800<00:02:03.390> doors<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.219> pretty

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
built with about 800 doors and pretty

built with about 800 doors and pretty

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
much no rhyme or reason it's a double

much no rhyme or reason it's a double
decker<00:02:07.890> these<00:02:08.610> doors<00:02:08.879> will<00:02:09.060> swing<00:02:09.360> open<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
decker these doors will swing open and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.999 
decker these doors will swing open and
if<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:09.989> touch<00:02:10.200> them<00:02:10.410> when<00:02:10.500> they're<00:02:10.619> open<00:02:10.739> you

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
if you touch them when they're open you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.070 
if you touch them when they're open you
get<00:02:11.129> sucked<00:02:11.400> out<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.700> plane

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
get sucked out of the plane

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.940 
get sucked out of the plane
those<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.290> wondering<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.800> looks

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
those of you wondering that that looks

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.309 
those of you wondering that that looks
like<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.310> looks<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.970> slowly<00:02:15.510> sink

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
like it looks like you slowly sink

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.100 
like it looks like you slowly sink
downward<00:02:16.709> out<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.980> plane<00:02:17.190> anyhow<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.480> suppose

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
downward out of a plane anyhow I suppose

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.240 
downward out of a plane anyhow I suppose
it's<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.319> cargo<00:02:19.650> plane<00:02:19.680> because<00:02:20.010> there's<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> lot

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
it's a cargo plane because there's a lot

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.550 
it's a cargo plane because there's a lot
of<00:02:20.310> elevators<00:02:20.790> everywhere<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.720> guess<00:02:22.410> if

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
of elevators everywhere and I guess if

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.170 
of elevators everywhere and I guess if
you<00:02:22.680> need<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.160> jettison<00:02:23.430> cargo<00:02:23.850> quickly

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
you need to jettison cargo quickly

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.260 
you need to jettison cargo quickly
there's<00:02:24.420> some<00:02:24.600> more<00:02:24.720> doors<00:02:24.930> for<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:26.150> but<00:02:27.150> as

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
there's some more doors for you but as

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.300 
there's some more doors for you but as
you<00:02:27.450> can<00:02:27.540> see<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:28.020> plane<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.040> clearly

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
you can see this plane is clearly

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.790 
you can see this plane is clearly
shipping<00:02:29.730> missiles<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.270> soldiers<00:02:30.930> by<00:02:31.739> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
shipping missiles and soldiers by the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.280 
shipping missiles and soldiers by the
way<00:02:31.950> gunfire<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.760> not<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.360> bad<00:02:33.569> idea<00:02:33.630> on<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.020> plane

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
way gunfire is not a bad idea on a plane

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.650 
way gunfire is not a bad idea on a plane
and<00:02:34.319> neither<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.739> grenades<00:02:35.360> might<00:02:36.360> notice<00:02:36.569> i'm

revenge<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.120> shinobi<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:52.680> we're<00:02:52.769> going<00:02:52.860> to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
revenge of shinobi so we're going to

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.090 
revenge of shinobi so we're going to
come<00:02:53.100> back<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.370> get<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.550> out<00:02:54.000> later<00:02:54.870> but<00:02:55.200> for

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
come back and get that out later but for

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.540 
come back and get that out later but for
now<00:02:56.160> let's<00:02:56.550> just<00:02:56.580> clear<00:02:57.360> out<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.720> plane<00:02:58.550> and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
now let's just clear out this plane and

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.100 
now let's just clear out this plane and
there's<00:02:59.730> time<00:03:00.000> bombs<00:03:00.239> on<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.480> plane<00:03:00.750> also<00:03:00.930> a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
there's time bombs on a plane also a

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
there's time bombs on a plane also a
really<00:03:01.530> smart<00:03:01.980> idea<00:03:02.180> this<00:03:03.180> is<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.450> future<00:03:04.200> so

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
really smart idea this is the future so

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.340 
really smart idea this is the future so
I<00:03:05.459> guess<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.819> plane<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.239> extra<00:03:06.569> strong<00:03:06.840> don't

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
I guess this plane is extra strong don't

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.320 
I guess this plane is extra strong don't
worry<00:03:07.470> about<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.830> we've<00:03:08.790> lost<00:03:08.910> cabin<00:03:09.180> pressure

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
worry about it we've lost cabin pressure

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.970 
worry about it we've lost cabin pressure
a<00:03:09.600> long<00:03:09.810> time<00:03:10.050> ago<00:03:10.200> this<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.500> not<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.769> problem

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
a long time ago this is not a problem

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.790 
a long time ago this is not a problem

call him that's okay now that we've

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.069 
call him that's okay now that we've
mostly<00:03:17.790> clear<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.269> plane<00:03:18.450> out<00:03:18.630> it's<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:18.989> a

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
mostly clear the plane out it's just a

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.199 
mostly clear the plane out it's just a
straight<00:03:19.290> shot<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.709> boss<00:03:19.940> let's<00:03:20.940> get<00:03:21.060> our
