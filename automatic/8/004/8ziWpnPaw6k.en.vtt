00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:42.130
 That seems to have come 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:45.050

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.339

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:38.130
 I wonder where the story is falling 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.130

 If you don't like it, there are more than 1000 stars and 3 stars 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:13.000
 It seems like there are times when it wo n't hit 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.000
 I will do my best to match that way 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.840

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.519
 I was upset 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.830
