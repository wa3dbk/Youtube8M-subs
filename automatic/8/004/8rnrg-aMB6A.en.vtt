this

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
this

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.610 
this
no<00:04:29.270> point<00:04:29.600> in<00:04:29.690> that<00:04:29.780> direction<00:04:29.990> so<00:04:30.260> I<00:04:30.410> can

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
no point in that direction so I can

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.000 
no point in that direction so I can
maybe<00:04:30.770> stay<00:04:31.070> in<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.250> roof<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:33.410> there<00:04:33.770> we<00:04:33.860> go

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
maybe stay in the roof and there we go

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.640 
maybe stay in the roof and there we go
we<00:04:34.190> make<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.520> up<00:04:34.670> here<00:04:34.880> and<00:04:35.060> now<00:04:35.540> we<00:04:36.110> just<00:04:36.440> need

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
we make it up here and now we just need
