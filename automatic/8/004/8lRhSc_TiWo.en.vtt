00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 competition between sporting lokeren and kv 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.730
 and those out of six were 8732 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.710
 spectators and one of the knew 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.759
 ok it was an end of the season game 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.340
 for Oostende 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.029
 but six one that comes quite hard anyway 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.510
 must say to god if you go to lure 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.269
 and comes as a club or as a team have the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.490
 last two weeks with us and 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.230
 also a few boys who are half of those 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.239
 consequently have hubertus rule 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.010
 plus the case did not work with us either 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.899
 100% wars are always the last wigram 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.309
 came had been in a different season than 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.649
 do you know that against sharp eyes 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.510
 dima becomes two things today 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.430
 learn gregorii in an appropriate way and 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.289
 absolutely the final of the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.120
 prostitute yes then you know that evening 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.280
 could have and that was so was the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.110
 first half were not present at all 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.770
 and also just very eager we recovery 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.360
 were nowhere near the first 5 minutes 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.590
 we have brought nothing and then it is 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.480
 case of 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.710
 do not get a double ring 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.390
 numbers because I think like a second 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.739
 half to the attack like the first house 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.869
 that we go home with double digits 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.580
 and if that's the intention 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.680
 must say second half in earlier 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.380
 lower the pace for to peter 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.750
 eyebrows and we have something more 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.790
 try to get to something better 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.650
 Man like them were all too much 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.500
 little it was clear the game the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.540
 fire for us today it was for you too 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.790
 the last match as a cough coach 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.490
 And that too is something on 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.350
 I can imagine a fries man 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.729
 gosh the house in itself not so bad it 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.170
 is especially what has recently disappeared 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.240
 all said and was written 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.460
 which is a bit mental 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.650
 heavy on the staff on me too 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.320
 players because I have players from one 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.000
 certain level or who never thought that 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.680
 we that is able to handle this level or 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.119
 two years apart at this level 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.860
 able to perform 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.530
 he sees that because for some 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.720
 bobijntje again that is on the top 100 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.100
 play one and can really stretch to it 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.460
 a moment a moment 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.080
 jump trigger for certain boys 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.160
 and I can now hear them make the right analysis 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.750
 and it ends today only allowed 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.000
 we can have another dinner 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.440
 modern well and then we see some future 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.020
 have you lived 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.050
 concrete plans to propose oh yes 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.210
 logical then he has already happened 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.210
 marijn devalck fc the champions built 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.950
 No built at the moment 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.560
 I do not thank you so much November 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.510
 Peter him we were paralyzed last week 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.780
 by emotions I had the impression that we are now 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.870
 found strength in the emotions 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.160
 yes you feel while in the group 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:48.680
 after the funeral tons of day of the 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.600
 emotions surely had to point 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.900
 used in a positive way and 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.060
 actually show in their last respects 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.680
 had to bring in the following 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.320
 contest 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.780
 a win for away and guess you 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.180
 saw an enormous amount of eagerness today 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.380
 can also score quickly and the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.930
 everything naturally becomes a piece 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.320
 easier and chop about the group that 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.370
 who still wants to show today 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.640
 has what a unit is that groups 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.220
 you have a nice basically what 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.050
 we actually always show our performance 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.900
 have put on a difficult one 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.300
 circumstances and the wax not today 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.160
 otherwise his chapeau 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.350
 in the 1st half was very satisfied with it 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.300
 do n't play that mark regularly 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.910
 draw with the thumb and the like no 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.390
 you were not always like that in the second half 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.070
 satisfied 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.660
 now as my colleague says 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.190
 we must taboo causes they stood 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.650
 slightly lower I have less space in the back 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.720
 and yes, you should have especially 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.519
 balsoclase yoga and in due time 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.950
 team player was all something in common 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.000
 may also be logical with 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.110
 a 5 0 lead 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.390
 we had the wolves chances what what 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.960
 actually our problem in the past 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.640
 lay in scoring ability 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.690
 today we have a huge number of opportunities 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.800
 decreased 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.480
 then they sometimes went today 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:21.840
 easier within very beautiful 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:24.990
 goals and we now stuff that final 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.340
 I think our endeavor was knitting 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:32.550
 We have two weeks to follow 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.150
 banana season that is in anyway 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.000
 had several different conditions 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.560
 so that is against kv mechelen that op 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.190
 At least not to worry about that 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.930
 to be 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.720
 dime on its side both sides 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.090
 have options 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.430
 Jan beautiful match I always think 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.640
 matches on 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.740
 on the cutting edge so this week 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.430
 I think good people are going well 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.560
 and our objectives 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.020
 we pre-determined him and 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.800
 in play-off 2 still try european 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.110
 to get soccer 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.910
 how was the atmosphere in the dressing room after 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.260
 this victory did not come out that way 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.710
 maybe different 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.690
 Joel relieved everyone had a good one 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.280
 a feeling that they are boys or 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.979
 headlines from the competition 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.950
 use it in the first place for crazy 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.470
 but also for yourself because nobody likes 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.140
 likes to go on holiday with a met 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.700
 actually with that what him with this 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.240
 group happened and then with a whole 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.160
 so on top in that respect 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.530
 taken fantastic but me too 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.790
 say our twelfth man 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.120
 was impressive 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:48.210
 yes the connectedness is huge and the 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.970
 feel unity in the group of players that 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.910
 we also feel with our supporters and that 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.800
 is always accompanied and what 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.169
 what brings you on the field to a he 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.510
 then then you also go great too radiating 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.960
 go the supporters who go on the same 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.190
 then respond in a way 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.840
 also on their own weighing 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.060
 fantastic how they say it 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.580
 have lived with with 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.030
 with the group of players with the family with 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.370
 the situation and in that sense a lot 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.650
 humility a template there rather the 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.120
 people who have participated in our 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.980
 club 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.570
 thank you maybe there are still questions 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.570
 of the people here in the room
