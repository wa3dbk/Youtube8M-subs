00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
up and from here on this is gonna be a

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.990 
up and from here on this is gonna be a
video<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.510> actually<00:01:00.690> nice<00:01:01.020> job<00:01:01.789> I'll<00:01:02.789> have

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000

video it's actually nice job I'll have
to<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> print<00:01:03.420> screen<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.989> show<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.320> from<00:01:04.439> there

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
to a print screen and show up from there

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.160 
to a print screen and show up from there
because<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.670> cannot<00:01:06.140> screenshot<00:01:07.140> a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
because you cannot screenshot a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.250 
because you cannot screenshot a
screenshot<00:01:07.560> utility<00:01:08.100> especially<00:01:09.260> doing

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
screenshot utility especially doing

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.800 
screenshot utility especially doing
Snagit<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.549> from<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:12.060> it'll<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.659> different

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
Snagit so from here it'll be different

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.109 
Snagit so from here it'll be different
when<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> initially<00:01:14.100> start<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> program<00:01:14.970> it

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
when you initially start the program it

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.390 
when you initially start the program it
may<00:01:15.210> look<00:01:15.360> something<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.220> this<00:01:17.220> is

may look something like this and this is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.980 
may look something like this and this is
it<00:01:18.270> seems<00:01:18.570> script<00:01:19.040> picture<00:01:20.040> expanded<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.270> as

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.630 
pushed in so for instance if I took were
to<00:01:57.479> click<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.899> cursor<00:01:58.590> again<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.520> would

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
to click the cursor again it would

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.819 
to click the cursor again it would
exclude<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.240> cursor<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.840> input

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
exclude the cursor in the input

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.889 
exclude the cursor in the input
and<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.119> top<00:02:03.329> there<00:02:03.570> are<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.689> number<00:02:03.719> of

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
and on the top there are a number of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.779 
and on the top there are a number of
features<00:02:04.170> such<00:02:04.530> as<00:02:04.590> input/output<00:02:05.340> I'm<00:02:05.640> just

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
features such as input/output I'm just

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.969 
features such as input/output I'm just
gonna<00:02:05.880> show<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.090> what<00:02:06.179> they<00:02:06.270> do<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:07.619> input

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
gonna show you what they do the input

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.199 
gonna show you what they do the input
option<00:02:08.310> has<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.519> number<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.879> different<00:02:09.119> things

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
option has a number of different things

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.570 
option has a number of different things
for<00:02:10.050> instance<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.410> can<00:02:10.530> did<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.160> record<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
for instance you can did you record the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.910 
for instance you can did you record the
entire<00:02:11.790> screen<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.140> window<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.680> active

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
entire screen just a window and active

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.860 
entire screen just a window and active
window<00:02:14.129> or<00:02:14.370> region<00:02:14.790> or<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.970> fixed<00:02:15.150> region<00:02:15.269> you

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
window or region or a fixed region you

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.360 
window or region or a fixed region you
could<00:02:15.989> experiment<00:02:16.379> with<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.739> if<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.980> want<00:02:17.160> I

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
could experiment with that if you want I

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.400 
could experiment with that if you want I
use<00:02:17.819> screen<00:02:18.299> and<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.540> put<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.780> resolution<00:02:19.260> low

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
use screen and I put the resolution low

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.259 
use screen and I put the resolution low
so<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.340> can<00:02:20.519> see<00:02:20.700> everything<00:02:21.090> I'm<00:02:21.180> doing<00:02:21.209> and

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
so you can see everything I'm doing and

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.420 
so you can see everything I'm doing and
under<00:02:24.269> output<00:02:24.660> outputs<00:02:25.140> really<00:02:25.410> useless<00:02:25.590> just

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
under output outputs really useless just

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.759 
under output outputs really useless just
make<00:02:26.580> sure<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.849> says<00:02:27.030> file<00:02:27.989> is<00:02:28.230> selected<00:02:28.349> and

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
make sure it says file is selected and

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.440 
make sure it says file is selected and
preview<00:02:29.160> window<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.489> selected<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.330> that's

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
preview window is selected and that's

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.960 
preview window is selected and that's
all<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:30.720> need<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.930> do<00:02:31.280> under<00:02:32.280> filters<00:02:32.610> it's<00:02:32.879> as

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
all you need to do under filters it's as

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.000 
all you need to do under filters it's as
a<00:02:33.060> notation<00:02:33.440> basically<00:02:34.440> what<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.620> does<00:02:34.829> is

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
a notation basically what this does is

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.289 
a notation basically what this does is
it<00:02:35.160> puts<00:02:35.640> text<00:02:36.209> on<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:37.410> part<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.220> screen<00:02:38.549> so

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
it puts text on a part of the screen so

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.539 
it puts text on a part of the screen so
for<00:02:39.480> instance<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.900> could<00:02:39.959> say<00:02:40.170> like<00:02:40.380> snag<00:02:41.340> it

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
for instance it could say like snag it

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:42.949 
for instance it could say like snag it
on<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.760> top<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.480> would<00:02:42.569> just<00:02:42.599> state<00:02:42.870> of

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
on the top and it would just state of

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.890 
on the top and it would just state of
the<00:02:43.079> entire<00:02:43.380> turn<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.400> entire<00:02:44.610> film<00:02:44.900> under

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
the entire turn the entire film under

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.949 
the entire turn the entire film under
options<00:02:46.519> there<00:02:47.519> is<00:02:47.760> video<00:02:48.239> preferences<00:02:48.870> and

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
options there is video preferences and

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.949 
options there is video preferences and
program<00:02:49.230> preferences<00:02:49.380> which<00:02:49.829> were<00:02:49.980> both<00:02:50.099> very

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
program preferences which were both very

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.339 
program preferences which were both very
useful<00:02:52.250> features<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:54.260> under<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
useful features and under the

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.949 
useful features and under the
Preferences<00:02:55.890> make<00:02:56.819> sure<00:02:57.060> all<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.510> options

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959
