 hello to all and welcome to the beast and me it goes quickly debated 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.609
 Friday and even if your request appears just before the weekend it's 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.609
 left 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:13.989
 5 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:17.439
 I am very happy 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.630
 he was borrowed convincing the boss of universal music france I 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.550
 named pascal nègre just announced celtic league 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.740
 it will gradually abandon the drm ahead of the commitments made in 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.820
 November 2007 when the olive agreements were signed when the houses of 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.160
 records was promising to get rid of drm in later now now after 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.800
 the vote of the creation and internet law in parliament 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.390
 and now the process will start on November 7th when the pieces 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.590
 of universal fabrics 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.969
 will be exempted unlimited mobile downloads 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.090
 and without drm 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.620
 via the dedicated platform and parks of sfr 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.640
 so it looks cool so do not dream too much 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.700
 with the lifting of drm will still be progressive for other platforms 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.160
 in the campaign bat messina was totally for the planned measures and 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.550
 were discussing and this is a piracy topic because he thinks the 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.950
 law protects the majors it will create some logical trust that 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.880
 will appear 2000 - protect the contributions in bulk the city is waiting for the vote 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.390
 of the law and the state of November 7 why the whole catalog is 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.160
 unlocks patience so and it's well fresh high in my genre 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
 that sticks to their computers here is a keyboard 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.950
 a keyboard capable of blowing cold as well as warm eaton 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.720
 co² creators and as you can see it's a simple hardy keyboard that 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.250
 has three kinds of heat 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.100
 to better silence your wrists 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.270
 while last Saturday date on the site of women like that you 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.680
 will cost 40 euros to see it and if you buy a party anyway goofy 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.300
 apavou freeze or cramer dislocated 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.470
 and Christmas parties are approaching and the weeds boards are animating notes 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.190
 disembark en masse in the shops 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.729
 and I do not know if you are aware 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.829
 the shelters until now was an extremely console that's missed 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.250
 since pirate buses that allow to use products of this range 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.240
 moreover everywhere since the launch of the console and it passes 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.859
 it does not please much to a pain 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.320
 and why are not they found another to protect her baby 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.090
 namely the eysines barbecue 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.109
 in fact mine not to engage installation of a lighting designer 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.359
 by literally and simply drowning the electronic components of his 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.729
 design of the liters of resin he does not know and that they invented the process 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:21.499
 track with microsoft had already done with that of the 360 ​​so here are the 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:23.229
 hackers open the gallery 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:25.730
 google announced Tuesday afp that the cables 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.000
 why look for education theme of the day cybersex 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.629
 last week he cited melbourne technology to lead so 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.749
 a little study on this phenomenon and you know what it was 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.079
 conclusion and ben seemingly unbalanced has grabbed that the 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:40.970
 cybersex 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.850
 would have a dose well taken by depressions in the cities and of 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.260
 stress bar because netizens adept at this kind of stuff 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.810
 erdogan seemingly deserted by day to devote them to this hobby he 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.600
 apart from that the case where you would be interested know that amateurs 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.630
 cybersex are usually people of good education and that he would pass 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.719
 an average exceeding 12 hours 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.189
 per week to satisfy their copy 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.790
 marcus squat and at the meeting of melbourne and digestives 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.190
 that last year by meeting him was worrying bah yeah because 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.409
 still 27% are depressed 30 for 5 and anxiety and 35% are 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.009
 seriously stressed 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.379
 so here's the topo wholesale doing naughty stuff in front of his computer too 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.020
 often 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.509
 and if the level of stress and depression 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.929
 it does not surprise me frankly anyway I always said and if I 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:29.219
 exclaims at the beginning 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:31.760
 because this is particularly valid my theory 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.730
 the virtual it can be interesting is nice 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.900
 but nothing beats the real especially when the real every year places at the 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.500
 looking for a fourth American family party based in annecy 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.929
 super convenient for you 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:47.129
 well yeah because considering the number of job search sites that exist 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.719
 we always know what to have to return proof why we must send 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.210
 a different missile his cv which is still rather annoying 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.510
 it has pronounced points to propose an interesting solution 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.009
 that she calls her wishes 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.879
 after it's just a service that divides his resume on 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.269
 full of affiliate employment sites in a few clicks the partners are the 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.430
 following cadremploi fr en mouth for a gram because when farther than 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:15.609
 usually comes out it's a point fr the point's point fr 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.539
 rookie lax point tarmed the rookies of weight particular to a genie replaces 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:20.190
 not a drama 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.940
 and then in flat points like that and what job should soon be too 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.020
 the part which is rather interesting since it is that the bets 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.500
 will not automatically update on affiliate sites directly 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.490
 since my resume for him in the ball to the story I found it interesting 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.970
 even though families 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.980
 to note that even though it's the call that's still the revenue of the 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.920
 sector they are not in the list but hey we can not have everything 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.289
 I expected 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.930
 and it's not won we're pretty good and the umbrella is part of 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.700
 accessories that we will have with us every day 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.960
 here's a rather idolatrous practical invention the baby walz it's alain who 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.260
 proposes this invention and it's just a machine that dry 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.070
 umbrellas 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.490
 to do this she uses as you see a kind of sponged finally the 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.940
 head with a recuperator tray so just pass the most 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.450
 of its parts in three times to dry them completely 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.630
 barroso has a barbecue it will avoid the puddles in the stores if 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.660
 never his generalization they try to avoid that for example 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:18.999
 politically 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:22.059
 it's up to this mom and I'm full of kisses and tell you that alain surmas 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:23.240
