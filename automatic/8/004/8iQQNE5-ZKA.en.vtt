00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
you how to do that there might be a few

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.820 
you how to do that there might be a few
videos<00:00:30.539> out<00:00:30.900> there<00:00:30.929> somewhat<00:00:31.439> similar<00:00:31.800> to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
videos out there somewhat similar to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.250 
videos out there somewhat similar to
this<00:00:32.040> one<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.780> want<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.989> call<00:00:34.110> this

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
this one and I just want to call this

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.620 
this one and I just want to call this
video<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.950> loop<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:36.360> run

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
video like the loop like you just run

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.690 
video like the loop like you just run
the<00:00:36.870> loop<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.500> don't<00:00:37.829> die<00:00:38.040> all<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.550> gotta

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the loop and you don't die all you gotta

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.670 
the loop and you don't die all you gotta
do<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:39.120> run<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.600> circle<00:00:39.750> around<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
do is just run in a circle around the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.119 
do is just run in a circle around the
map<00:00:41.030> avoiding<00:00:42.030> zombies<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.559> main

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
map avoiding zombies and one of the main

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.520 
map avoiding zombies and one of the main
things<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.730> need<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> strategy

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
things you need to have for the strategy

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.920 
things you need to have for the strategy
is<00:00:46.559> struggling<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.460> since<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.360> will<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:48.660> hit

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
is struggling on since you will get hit

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.600 
is struggling on since you will get hit
quite<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> bit<00:00:49.590> as<00:00:49.739> long<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.340> don't<00:00:50.489> go<00:00:50.579> down

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
quite a bit as long as you don't go down

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.729 
quite a bit as long as you don't go down

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
get stuck in any corners and one of the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.510 
get stuck in any corners and one of the
main<00:00:55.079> ways<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:56.039> stuck<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.370> any

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
main ways to not get stuck in any

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.430 
main ways to not get stuck in any
corners<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.149> definitely<00:00:58.109> definitely

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
corners is definitely definitely

oh<00:01:25.049> did<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.799> get<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.070> ten-dollar<00:01:26.670> ray<00:01:26.909> gun

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
oh did I just get a ten-dollar ray gun

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.200 
oh did I just get a ten-dollar ray gun
yes<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.689> did<00:01:27.950> but<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.220> gun<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.430> very<00:01:29.729> important

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
yes I did but this gun is very important

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.969 
yes I did but this gun is very important
this<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.900> why<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> included<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.619> level

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
this is why I included this level

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.590 
this is why I included this level
instead<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.340> starting<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.390> normal

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
instead of starting it like a normal

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.350 
instead of starting it like a normal
level<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.650> basically<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.790> want<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> start<00:01:36.240> out

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
level so basically you want to start out

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.149 
level so basically you want to start out
every<00:01:37.020> level<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> middle<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.890> stadium

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
every level in the middle of the stadium

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.969 
every level in the middle of the stadium
on<00:01:38.520> top<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.880> little<00:01:39.150> edge<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:40.770> will

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
on top of that little edge and that will
