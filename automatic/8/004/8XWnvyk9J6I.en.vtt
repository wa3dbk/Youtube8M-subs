00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
 What does an empty sky sound like ? 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.300
 eat 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.169
 I could 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.790
 Example that we together 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.710
 maybe a piece of music will develop that 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.410
 really to do with your life 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.730
 had the symphony of her life like 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.730
 That should sound 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.340
 Yes 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.400
 then they are now 91 91 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.130
 It was all about dignity here 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.130
 getting older 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.580
 8th 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:57.610
 oh yes and then with the scream 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.180
 disappears a dead end ends the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.180
 idea
