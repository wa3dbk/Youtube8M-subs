00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.569
 we are the center for research and development of human capacities 6 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.889
 was born from loyola 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.249
 in this opportunity 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:12.979
 let's touch the topic 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.499
 about education 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.039
 our country 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.080
 and I want to talk to you about holbox more complete 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.060
 although obama has specified 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.060
 with the information procedures 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 we have discovered that in another educational system 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.429
 it has been conjectured 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:32.920
 for the visa 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.260
 they take a discussion efe has been rumored has been spoken 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.900
 sector quite the current educational system 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.440
 but 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.640
 few or almost no one is 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.410
 has given a sample of some coherent solution based 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.570
 joooo has searched for the goal 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.470
 true issue of the problem 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.110
 obviously the government is still thinking 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.110
 what but the problem and education are the teachers 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.049
 that is, the drivers that handle this charge 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.110
 called educational system 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.950
 the problem is not the teachers to our understanding not because it changes 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.970
 to all the teachers of Peru and put say teachers x 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.780
 the ideal teacher 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.440
 The education 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.440
 the system will remain the same 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.680
 the students will continue to be prey 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.750
 in the same way 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.810
 of the same model 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.579
 We believe that the real problem lies in the system 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.380
 what we give 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.970
 our students 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.880
 paragraph 1 of October 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.610
 beyond not beyond the information provided or 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.420
 a model that is given to the students 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.740
 There is another problem 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.560
 Tuesday 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.820
 p 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.840
 handle 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.749
 and that problem is the procedural code while the information 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:13.739
 which in turn keeps 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.829
 for what 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:15.599
 we 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.940
 as if the quarter was developed 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.929
 of cups and is human 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.929
 we would like to contribute to the teachers 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.220
 to all knowledgeable specialists feel 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.220
 videos in the educational subject 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:33.559
 do not touch, I'd like to put a little bit of 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.269
 the vision and the objective that our institution has 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.699
 we are a group of people 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.699
 we have developed these layers is human 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.089
 and that we were able to bet 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.089
 in another way this 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:54.049
 simple solutions ingenious practices problem 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.049
 complex 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.319
 specifically education 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.319
 p we have children from 10 to 15 years old 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.429
 through a new model system 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:08.939
 lucrative 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.779
 that we have designed we have developed 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:15.139
 we have managed to make them enter the university 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.139
 as only one 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.149
 for now evaluating our system 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.149
 to see if our system works or does not work 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:28.819
 got these children have been trained only in 32 hours 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.619
 effective 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:31.550
 nothing else 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.259
 that means 15 days before 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:37.449
 I hugo exaggeratedly a month before 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:42.189
 may well be a year before but or only active job choirs can 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.519
 be let's say 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.729
 One hour a week 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:50.069
 or two hours a day that's more or less 15 continuous days 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.479
 the truth is that 32 hours or enough to be able 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:58.489
 train and prepare 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.910
 10 12 years 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.989
 i quietly 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:03.819
 overcome 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.559
 successfully an admission exam model 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:08.499
 available here in Peru 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:12.099
 because because it was the engine of efficiency we are against one 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.690
 a lot of vulnerability 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.579
 the entire education system 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.579
 one of them is the admission exam 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.210
 I did not buy it 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.210
 us on which we have based we have based 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.860
 twenty 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.300
 all the current problem that exists 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.080
 in the education system 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.900
 and socially they lived 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.830
 and the reason also why we continue in a country 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.129
 underdeveloped 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.719
 it's because we have five and other very complicated information environment 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.919
 I would say obsolete 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.809
 not that this delays us and always will continue to lend 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.550
 so let's change all of us be rich that there was no more of this 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:01.789
 that our economy goes like this and everything else is always going to be a country 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.400
 underdeveloped finally 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.479
 polite donoso and sisters of the person you can not go beyond 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.599
 the reason is simple 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.659
 the problem is having coe 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.089
 to explain briefly 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:19.089
 until many years ago 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.770
 get to information our country was very difficult 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.819
 we have been 30 years 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.099
 the only possible channel to get to the information 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.039
 the professors the grandfather teachers all of the other gods that we brought 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.090
 the last thing I know well the last 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.599
 stretched 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.349
 the books 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.680
 the other channel were then 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.360
 library 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.360
 the videographic material books that the snow avalanche buy acquire in the 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.620
 bookstores 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.810
 and the library polls so we do not have resources because we had to go to 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.630
 be long with India wait our turn for that long-awaited book 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.630
 we wanted this let's say plot 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.139
 so 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.139
 all that 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.220
 all that was until 30 or 25 years ago 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:23.319
 because before it was very difficult to get to the information 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:25.580
 today 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.580
 comes the information is no longer a problem 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.350
 because pasta makes this one click 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.139
 they feel 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.979
 victorino chairs in front of a computer connected to the global network 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.279
 and it is that it has all the wealth of information 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:45.550
 it's more the information is so overwhelming that they do not know what to do 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.270
 has the last god you put yourself seriously 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:51.229
 bush 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:52.830
 i 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.830
 netapp 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.399
 by the institutes so then the information is already too overwhelming to 

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:09.759
 will be in real time even 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:13.530
 be this more updated than even what does not open the golden process that we 

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:15.809
 let's find some book 

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:18.669
 Ampo Friday that will carry the information today is no longer a 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.789
 problem although many teachers 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:23.669
 many authorities 

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:26.810
 many specialists still think that it does problem comes the information 

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:30.639
 the Mapuches the real problem 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:31.610
 today 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.779
 present 

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:35.779
 it is no longer arrived 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.909
 the real problem hour has become what I do with so much 

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:40.999
 information 

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:43.399
 not like the processes 

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:46.399
 That's the real problem 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.880
 from our understanding we have discovered a series of and she is the one who should follow 

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.599
 a human being 

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.499
 but good as a student 

00:07:56.499 --> 00:07:59.339
 to be able to adapt this 

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:00.189
 to that requirement
