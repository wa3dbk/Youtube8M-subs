00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:12.540
 rich chicken cultural support an exaggeration of 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.730
 and our tip this week is a 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.560
 cassava recipe gratinada very 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.810
 practice who will teach us is 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.449
 This is Fabiana, that's all. 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.699
 even a practical cassava that can 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.420
 be reused on the barbecue 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.420
 weekend very easy to do 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.300
 So before we start, write down the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.430
 ingredients for this recipe you will 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.410
 need 500 grams of manioc 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.770
 cooked 200 grams of grated mozzarella 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:47.550
 300 grams of mayonnaise a box of 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.140
 cream a spoonful of fine herbs 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.030
 or oregano a small bottle of milk 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.070
 Of coconut 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.780
 the revenue yields approximately eight 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.980
 portions and costs on average 15 reais 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.830
 ingredients and now with the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.439
 first step fabiana passes us 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.390
 Enjoy an already cooked cassava 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.220
 if you do not have a new kitchen you can 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.189
 cooking in the day always leaving her 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.540
 bit firm but will get torn apart 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.460
 too big, not to stay 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.520
 uncomfortable to eat 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.130
 As you can see, I already have some 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.869
 already done here the house folks understand 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.130
 It is rather you season cassava as it is 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.290
 particular of each person has people 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.570
 they like like tempered cassava 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.950
 others not if you prefer 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.409
 cook only with salt 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.240
 otherwise you can use a tempered 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.790
 special August to your liking 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.649
 need not be does not necessarily have 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.530
 a specific standard can cook 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.049
 cassava to customer's taste 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.970
 so remembering that it can not be bits 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.280
 very large because you stay 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.020
 uncomfortable to eat and not very 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.719
 small because it looks like it was sheet 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.009
 will undo all would be pieces 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.079
 standards so that recipe I used some 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.640
 500 grams of manioc 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.190
 now the next step we will do the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.180
 cream to play here on top of the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.180
 mayonnaise 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:42.140
 sour cream coconut milk mix 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:48.980
 well to make a very homogeneous cream 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:52.880
 here ending this you can put the web 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.180
 the thin or oregano to your face in case 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:01.330
 we are using herbs also 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.330
 quantity varies in taste right 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.440
 just get a touch 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.270
 cream is in this consistency 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.990
 we're going to put it on top of the 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.990
 manioc 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.310
 let's just stirred for cream 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.560
 can mix dinho 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.810
 You do not need to cover whole cassava. 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.530
 with this cream is just to give a touch 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.530
 even in 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.470
 this is good to party too right 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.800
 We do very wedding parties. 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.180
 togethers is used much this 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.390
 cassava that is different from the 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.510
 of cooked cassava 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:06.200
 Finishing mixing the cream, we'll go 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:08.510
 put the grated mozzarella cheese with the 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.700
 recipe is now ready to go to the 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.010

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.330
 minutes depending on the time 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.870

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.870

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.150
 is cheap is approximately 15 to 20 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.250
 to make a quantity of this 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.780

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.780
