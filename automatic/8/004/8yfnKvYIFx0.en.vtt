today<00:00:11.639> I'm<00:00:11.790> travelling<00:00:12.269> fairly<00:00:12.750> light<00:00:12.960> and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
today I'm travelling fairly light and

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.189 
today I'm travelling fairly light and
I've<00:00:14.040> got<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.309> new<00:00:14.580> ESP<00:00:15.330> cuivre<00:00:15.660> system<00:00:16.080> to

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
I've got this new ESP cuivre system to

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.160 
I've got this new ESP cuivre system to
show<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.440> which<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.580> testing<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.270> found<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.050> be

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
show you which in testing I found to be

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.439 
show you which in testing I found to be
exceptionally<00:00:19.980> practical<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.240> best

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
exceptionally practical and the best

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.840 
exceptionally practical and the best
I've<00:00:21.660> ever<00:00:21.840> used<00:00:22.279> so<00:00:23.279> I'll<00:00:23.340> go<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.550> drop<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
I've ever used so I'll go and drop the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.310 
I've ever used so I'll go and drop the
gear<00:00:24.029> down<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.570> we'll<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> closer<00:00:25.080> look

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
gear down and we'll have a closer look

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:36.290 
gear down and we'll have a closer look
at<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.130> new<00:00:35.280> ESP<00:00:36.000> cuivre

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
at it so this is the new ESP cuivre

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.139 
at it so this is the new ESP cuivre
system<00:00:36.920> there's<00:00:37.920> three<00:00:38.160> sizes<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> range

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
system there's three sizes in the range

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.729 
system there's three sizes in the range
a<00:00:39.540> 3<00:00:40.410> rod<00:00:40.649> 4<00:00:41.219> rod<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> 5<00:00:42.000> rod<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
a 3 rod 4 rod and a 5 rod this is the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
a 3 rod 4 rod and a 5 rod this is the
full<00:00:43.920> rod<00:00:44.129> obviously<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.640> takes<00:00:44.850> 4<00:00:45.059> made-up

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
full rod obviously it takes 4 made-up

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.860 
full rod obviously it takes 4 made-up
rods<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:47.340> package<00:00:47.670> comes<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.480> base

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
rods and the package comes with the base

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.619 
rods and the package comes with the base
quiver<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:50.550> sleeve<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.000> goes<00:00:51.149> over<00:00:51.510> the

top<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> complete<00:00:52.739> pair<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> let's<00:00:54.809> start<00:00:55.050> at

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
top as a complete pair so let's start at

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.139 
top as a complete pair so let's start at
the<00:00:55.170> bottom<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.620> quiver<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.699> base<00:00:56.910> is

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the bottom of the quiver the base is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.119 
the bottom of the quiver the base is
nicely<00:00:57.360> reinforced<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.379> heavy<00:00:58.739> duty

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
nicely reinforced with heavy duty

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.660 
nicely reinforced with heavy duty
material<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.570> immediately<00:01:01.050> above<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:02.609> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
material and immediately above this is a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.359 
material and immediately above this is a
webbing<00:01:03.090> loop<00:01:03.470> which<00:01:04.470> makes<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.799> easy<00:01:05.040> for

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
webbing loop which makes it easy for

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.219 
webbing loop which makes it easy for
loading<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.180> quiver<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
loading the quiver in and out of the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.230 
loading the quiver in and out of the
vehicle<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.939> also<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.299> an<00:01:09.450> off<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> barrow

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
vehicle and also for an off a barrow

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.109

then<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> all-important<00:01:13.229> rod<00:01:13.380> but<00:01:13.560> pocket

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
then is the all-important rod but pocket

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.399 
then is the all-important rod but pocket
now<00:01:15.119> I've<00:01:15.299> never<00:01:15.450> seen<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> market

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
now I've never seen one on the market

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.740 
now I've never seen one on the market
before<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.520> whole<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> rod<00:01:18.270> handle

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
before with the whole of the rod handle

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.990

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.000 
secure now moving further up the quiver
on<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.860> side<00:02:21.130> is<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.790> padded<00:02:22.090> carry<00:02:22.360> handle

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
on this side is the padded carry handle

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.980 
on this side is the padded carry handle
and<00:02:24.010> also<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.820> adjustable<00:02:25.300> shoulder<00:02:25.510> strap

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
and also the adjustable shoulder strap

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.100 
and also the adjustable shoulder strap
now<00:02:26.530> slightly<00:02:27.400> unusually<00:02:28.030> shoulder<00:02:28.810> straps

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
now slightly unusually shoulder straps

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.750 
now slightly unusually shoulder straps
attached<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.890> main<00:02:30.040> body<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.489> quiver

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
attached to the main body of the quiver

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.979 
attached to the main body of the quiver
with<00:02:31.720> webbing<00:02:32.530> loops<00:02:33.060> now<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.120> convention<00:02:34.870> is

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
with webbing loops now the convention is

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.380 
with webbing loops now the convention is
to<00:02:35.020> use<00:02:35.250> plastic<00:02:36.250> attachments<00:02:36.970> I've<00:02:37.120> sought

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
to use plastic attachments I've sought

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.750 
to use plastic attachments I've sought
plastic<00:02:37.840> loops<00:02:38.140> which<00:02:38.920> are<00:02:39.070> generally<00:02:39.459> fine

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
plastic loops which are generally fine

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.750 
plastic loops which are generally fine
but<00:02:40.450> they<00:02:41.080> can<00:02:41.410> become<00:02:41.650> slightly<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.400> brittle

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
but they can become slightly and brittle

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.199 
but they can become slightly and brittle
with<00:02:42.940> age<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:44.489> sometimes<00:02:45.489> they<00:02:45.610> can<00:02:45.790> break<00:02:45.970> in

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
with age and sometimes they can break in

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.050 
with age and sometimes they can break in
cold<00:02:46.480> weather<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.530> we've<00:02:47.800> got<00:02:48.010> round<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:48.550> by

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
cold weather so we've got round that by

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.690 
cold weather so we've got round that by
using<00:02:49.330> this<00:02:49.540> new<00:02:49.780> system<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:51.010> webbing<00:02:51.430> loops

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
using this new system of webbing loops

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.640 
using this new system of webbing loops
these<00:02:52.390> are<00:02:52.570> stitch<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.020> main<00:02:53.230> body<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.560> the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
these are stitch to the main body of the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.610 
these are stitch to the main body of the
quiver<00:02:54.030> reinforce<00:02:55.030> box<00:02:55.360> stitching<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:56.440> it's<00:02:56.560> a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
quiver reinforce box stitching so it's a

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.840 
quiver reinforce box stitching so it's a
super<00:02:57.070> strong<00:02:57.310> attachment<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.580> now<00:03:00.700> we've

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
super strong attachment and now we've

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.699 
super strong attachment and now we've
got<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.090> protective<00:03:01.570> sleeve<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.140> goes<00:03:02.320> over

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
got the protective sleeve that goes over

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.750 
got the protective sleeve that goes over
the<00:03:02.830> top<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:04.390> again<00:03:04.630> this<00:03:05.470> isn't<00:03:05.760> heavily

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
the top so again this isn't heavily

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.250 
the top so again this isn't heavily
padded<00:03:07.000> or<00:03:07.299> anything<00:03:07.450> it's<00:03:07.720> just<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.989> protect

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
padded or anything it's just to protect

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.539 
padded or anything it's just to protect
its<00:03:08.470> sleeve<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:08.950> if<00:03:09.010> you're<00:03:09.130> walking<00:03:09.220> through

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
its sleeve so if you're walking through

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.729 
its sleeve so if you're walking through
heavy<00:03:10.390> foliage<00:03:10.870> your<00:03:11.140> lines<00:03:11.290> won't<00:03:11.590> get

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
heavy foliage your lines won't get

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.430 
heavy foliage your lines won't get
snagged<00:03:12.010> on<00:03:12.190> brambles<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.360> also<00:03:13.510> protects

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
snagged on brambles and it also protects

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.509 
snagged on brambles and it also protects
your<00:03:14.560> rings<00:03:14.799> when<00:03:15.040> you're<00:03:15.160> putting<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.489> in

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
your rings when you're putting it in

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.160 
your rings when you're putting it in
putting<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.360> quiver<00:03:16.570> in<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:16.870> out<00:03:16.959> of<00:03:17.080> the

now<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:19.180> has<00:03:19.780> got<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:19.989> snip<00:03:20.350> at<00:03:20.500> one<00:03:20.680> side<00:03:20.980> and

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
now this has got a snip at one side and

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.310 
now this has got a snip at one side and
a<00:03:23.590> little<00:03:23.830> velcro<00:03:23.980> strap<00:03:24.870> just<00:03:25.870> straps<00:03:26.140> it

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
a little velcro strap just straps it

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.490 
a little velcro strap just straps it

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.490 
around the back of the sleeve it's
reinforced<00:03:30.130> at<00:03:30.220> this<00:03:30.370> end<00:03:30.610> so<00:03:31.380> where<00:03:32.380> your

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
reinforced at this end so where your

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.680 
reinforced at this end so where your
butt<00:03:32.650> rings<00:03:32.890> are<00:03:33.160> it's<00:03:33.940> got<00:03:34.150> double<00:03:34.510> layered

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
butt rings are it's got double layered

fabric<00:03:35.200> just<00:03:35.350> to<00:03:35.530> reinforce<00:03:35.739> it<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:37.269> just

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
fabric just to reinforce it it just

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.039 
fabric just to reinforce it it just
simply<00:03:37.780> pulls<00:03:38.019> off<00:03:38.200> like<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.870> there's

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
simply pulls off like that so there's

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.360 
simply pulls off like that so there's
the<00:03:41.200> main<00:03:41.380> body<00:03:41.650> of<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.860> quiver<00:03:44.370> webbing

end<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.540> quiver<00:03:49.750> down<00:03:50.739> this<00:03:50.950> side<00:03:51.299> there's

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
end of the quiver down this side there's

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.620 
end of the quiver down this side there's
a<00:03:52.390> full<00:03:52.660> length<00:03:52.930> size<00:03:53.380> 10<00:03:53.769> chunkies<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.630> which

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
a full length size 10 chunkies it which

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.930 
a full length size 10 chunkies it which
makes<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:56.049> easier<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:57.160> get<00:03:57.280> in<00:03:57.430> and<00:03:57.640> out<00:03:57.700> of<00:03:57.880> the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
makes it easier to get in and out of the

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.210 
makes it easier to get in and out of the
main<00:03:58.120> section<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.020> quiver<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.069> when

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
main section of the quiver so when

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.650 
main section of the quiver so when
you're<00:04:00.340> putting<00:04:00.489> a<00:04:00.670> Brawley<00:04:01.450> or<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.750> shelter

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
you're putting a Brawley or a shelter

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.390 
you're putting a Brawley or a shelter
and<00:04:03.080> all<00:04:03.350> you<00:04:03.470> land<00:04:03.680> in<00:04:03.890> there<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.160> what<00:04:04.250> have

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
and all you land in there and what have

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.240 
and all you land in there and what have
you<00:04:04.520> in<00:04:04.640> there<00:04:04.880> it's<00:04:05.270> easy<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.630> get<00:04:05.780> in<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:05.990> out

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
you in there it's easy to get in and out

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.030 
you in there it's easy to get in and out
so<00:04:07.250> I've<00:04:07.340> got<00:04:07.460> Brawley<00:04:08.410> landing<00:04:09.410> that<00:04:09.530> handle

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
so I've got Brawley landing that handle

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.160 
so I've got Brawley landing that handle
landing<00:04:10.670> they're<00:04:10.880> throwing<00:04:11.510> stick<00:04:11.780> in<00:04:11.960> there

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
landing they're throwing stick in there

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.680 
landing they're throwing stick in there
I<00:04:12.410> could<00:04:13.040> also<00:04:13.190> put<00:04:13.520> longer<00:04:13.880> storm<00:04:14.150> poles<00:04:14.450> if

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
I could also put longer storm poles if

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.770 
I could also put longer storm poles if
necessary<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:16.790> that's<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.090> rod<00:04:17.270> side<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.720> the

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
necessary so that's the rod side of the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.750 
necessary so that's the rod side of the
quiver<00:04:17.989> cupboard<00:04:18.350> let's<00:04:18.800> spin<00:04:19.250> it<00:04:19.340> round<00:04:19.489> have

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
quiver cupboard let's spin it round have

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.950
