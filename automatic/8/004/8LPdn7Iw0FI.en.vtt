room<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.070> used<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:47.850> GPS<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.810> it

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
room so I have used it for GPS and it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.630 
room so I have used it for GPS and it
works<00:01:49.560> flawlessly<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:50.100> will<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> lock

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
works flawlessly I will get a lock

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.330 
works flawlessly I will get a lock
within<00:01:51.090> 5<00:01:51.420> seconds<00:01:51.869> or<00:01:52.110> 10<00:01:52.350> seconds<00:01:52.740> maximum

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
within 5 seconds or 10 seconds maximum

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.910 
within 5 seconds or 10 seconds maximum
but<00:01:54.180> yeah<00:01:54.720> that's<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.049> lot<00:01:55.170> option<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.649> there<00:01:55.860> if

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
but yeah that's a lot option is there if

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.580 
but yeah that's a lot option is there if
we<00:01:56.219> go<00:01:56.369> further<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.450> privacy<00:01:58.290> which

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
we go further you have a privacy which

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.730 
we go further you have a privacy which
is<00:01:58.619> self-explanatory<00:01:59.250> again<00:02:00.110> because<00:02:01.110> if<00:02:01.680> you

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
is self-explanatory again because if you

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.380 
is self-explanatory again because if you
don't<00:02:02.130> want<00:02:02.399> any<00:02:02.549> app<00:02:02.729> using<00:02:03.060> any<00:02:03.210> particular

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
don't want any app using any particular

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.679 
don't want any app using any particular

you won't face any root issues your if

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.020 
you won't face any root issues your if
we<00:02:14.990> jump<00:02:15.230> into<00:02:15.380> performance<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:16.430> all<00:02:16.730> about

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
we jump into performance it's all about

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.060 
we jump into performance it's all about
the<00:02:17.240> experience<00:02:17.480> kernel<00:02:18.140> here<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:18.710> can

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
the experience kernel here so you can

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.910 
the experience kernel here so you can
set<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:20.180> maximum<00:02:20.570> and<00:02:20.900> minimum<00:02:20.930> values<00:02:21.740> as

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
set the maximum and minimum values as

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.250 
set the maximum and minimum values as
you<00:02:22.040> can<00:02:22.220> see<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.430> have<00:02:22.940> set<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.510> close<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.960> stock

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
you can see I have set it close to stock

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.920 
you can see I have set it close to stock
but<00:02:24.530> if<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.370> want<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.790> can<00:02:26.000> overclock<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.570> all

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
but if you want you can overclock it all

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.040 
but if you want you can overclock it all
the<00:02:27.170> way<00:02:27.320> up<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.770> 1.6<00:02:28.670> gigahertz<00:02:29.120> quad-core<00:02:29.600> so

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
the way up to 1.6 gigahertz quad-core so

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.530 
the way up to 1.6 gigahertz quad-core so
that<00:02:30.230> is<00:02:30.380> great<00:02:30.710> if<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.580> ask<00:02:31.730> people<00:02:31.940> Sonia<00:02:32.450> is

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
that is great if you ask people Sonia is

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.960 
that is great if you ask people Sonia is
not<00:02:32.780> really<00:02:33.140> required<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.920> have<00:02:34.160> kernel<00:02:34.760> same

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
not really required you have kernel same

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.300 
not really required you have kernel same
pitch<00:02:35.180> mirroring<00:02:35.630> or<00:02:35.870> merging<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.590> polishing

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
pitch mirroring or merging and polishing

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.430 
pitch mirroring or merging and polishing
of<00:02:37.460> assets<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.000> generally<00:02:38.480> I'll<00:02:38.720> advise<00:02:39.230> you

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
of assets so generally I'll advise you

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.760 
of assets so generally I'll advise you
to<00:02:39.590> leave<00:02:39.770> them<00:02:40.100> on<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:42.140> have<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.470> option

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
to leave them on and you have the option

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.680 
to leave them on and you have the option
of<00:02:42.920> editing<00:02:43.070> your<00:02:43.550> reiterate<00:02:43.940> schedulers<00:02:44.450> as

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
of editing your reiterate schedulers as

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.570 
of editing your reiterate schedulers as
well<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.440> generally<00:02:45.770> go<00:02:46.130> with<00:02:46.160> on-demand

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
well so I generally go with on-demand

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.730 
well so I generally go with on-demand

case you're purely interested in numbers

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.270 
case you're purely interested in numbers
then<00:04:13.430> let<00:04:13.970> us

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
then let us

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.039 
then let us
couple<00:04:14.550> of<00:04:14.670> benchmarks<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:15.480> see<00:04:15.870> how<00:04:15.990> that

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
couple of benchmarks and see how that

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.170 
couple of benchmarks and see how that
pans<00:04:16.410> out<00:04:16.650> so<00:04:16.920> I<00:04:16.950> just<00:04:17.250> clear<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.639> recent<00:04:18.000> up

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
pans out so I just clear the recent up

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.120 
pans out so I just clear the recent up
again<00:04:18.570> it's<00:04:18.750> very<00:04:18.870> handy<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.560> clear<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:19.920> from

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
again it's very handy to clear it from

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.390 
again it's very handy to clear it from
here<00:04:20.310> only<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:21.230> first<00:04:22.230> off<00:04:22.440> let's<00:04:22.680> do<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:22.950> quick

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
here only and first off let's do a quick

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.879 
here only and first off let's do a quick
on<00:04:23.639> to<00:04:23.910> do<00:04:24.060> benchmark<00:04:24.540> won't<00:04:25.290> make<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:25.710> sit

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
on to do benchmark won't make you sit

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.409 
on to do benchmark won't make you sit
through<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.220> whole<00:04:26.340> video<00:04:26.550> so<00:04:26.940> I'll<00:04:27.060> be<00:04:27.240> back

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:37.040 
through the whole video so I'll be back
when<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.840> results<00:04:28.260> are<00:04:28.380> out
