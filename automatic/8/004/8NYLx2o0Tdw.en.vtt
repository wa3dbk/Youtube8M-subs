00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
works really well which is what I used

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.960 
works really well which is what I used
to<00:02:42.290> do<00:02:42.530> which<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.250> what<00:02:43.340> I've<00:02:43.489> always<00:02:43.640> done

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
to do which is what I've always done

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.390 
to do which is what I've always done
honestly<00:02:44.660> since<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:44.959> started<00:02:45.200> since<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.190> started

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
honestly since I started since I started

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.060 
honestly since I started since I started
flying<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.880> fail<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:47.350> just<00:02:48.350> don't<00:02:48.500> eat<00:02:48.620> until<00:02:48.799> 2

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
flying to fail I just don't eat until 2

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.610 
flying to fail I just don't eat until 2
o'clock<00:02:49.100> but<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.940> made<00:02:50.570> really<00:02:50.840> bad<00:02:51.080> decisions

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
o'clock but I made really bad decisions

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.570 
o'clock but I made really bad decisions
where<00:02:52.400> he<00:02:52.549> is<00:02:53.060> making<00:02:53.269> really<00:02:53.600> good<00:02:53.720> decisions

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
where he is making really good decisions

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.670 
where he is making really good decisions
so<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.850> think<00:02:55.970> I'd<00:02:56.209> be<00:02:56.360> interested<00:02:56.600> in<00:02:57.049> trying

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
so I think I'd be interested in trying

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.789 
so I think I'd be interested in trying
that<00:02:58.000> maybe<00:02:59.000> not<00:02:59.150> right<00:02:59.330> now

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
that maybe not right now

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.080 
that maybe not right now
or<00:03:00.799> should<00:03:01.010> I<00:03:01.100> see<00:03:01.370> how<00:03:01.430> this<00:03:01.580> current<00:03:01.910> diet

or should I see how this current diet

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.300 
or should I see how this current diet
works<00:03:02.299> out<00:03:02.510> my<00:03:02.959> current<00:03:03.230> diets<00:03:03.500> really<00:03:04.040> really
