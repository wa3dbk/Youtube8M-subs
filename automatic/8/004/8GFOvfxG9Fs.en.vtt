00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
EPA is trying to do now is to measure

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.830 
EPA is trying to do now is to measure
upstream<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.490> downstream<00:02:30.520> how<00:02:31.390> far<00:02:31.690> this

flow has gotten at this point they are

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.870 
flow has gotten at this point they are
even<00:02:33.930> creating<00:02:34.930> fish<00:02:35.290> catchments<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.310> measure

the particles in the fish to see if it's

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
gotten into the fish what they're

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.750 
gotten into the fish what they're
worried<00:02:41.080> about<00:02:41.170> at<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.560> point<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:42.100> the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
worried about at this point is the

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.360 
worried about at this point is the
agriculture<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:44.050> drinking<00:02:44.590> water<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.190> the

recreational water that are accessed

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.800 
recreational water that are accessed
from<00:02:47.800> these<00:02:48.130> from<00:02:48.640> these<00:02:48.790> areas<00:02:49.270> of<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.630> river

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
from these from these areas of the river

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.450 
from these from these areas of the river
and<00:02:50.080> in<00:02:50.200> all<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.560> little<00:02:50.740> tributaries<00:02:51.430> that

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
and in all the little tributaries that

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.220 
and in all the little tributaries that
are<00:02:51.640> feeding<00:02:51.850> off<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.240> it<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.540> they've<00:02:52.960> called

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
are feeding off of it so they've called

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.530 
are feeding off of it so they've called
as<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:53.500> mentioned<00:02:54.070> states<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.820> emergency<00:02:55.000> and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
as you mentioned states of emergency and

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.090 
as you mentioned states of emergency and
they're<00:02:55.660> really<00:02:55.870> keeping<00:02:56.290> people<00:02:56.590> out<00:02:56.740> of<00:02:56.830> the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
they're really keeping people out of the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.830 
they're really keeping people out of the
water<00:02:57.280> away<00:02:57.550> from<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.970> water<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:58.420> they<00:02:58.540> can<00:02:58.690> do

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
water away from the water so they can do

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.930 
water away from the water so they can do
some<00:02:59.050> really<00:02:59.080> in<00:02:59.410> depth<00:02:59.650> measurements<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.400> big

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
some really in depth measurements a big

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.880 
some really in depth measurements a big
worry<00:03:01.150> here<00:03:01.390> for<00:03:01.570> people<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.440> as<00:03:02.620> these

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
worry here for people is that as these

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.220 
worry here for people is that as these
particles<00:03:03.550> settle<00:03:04.270> into<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.720> settlement

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
particles settle into the settlement

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.650 
particles settle into the settlement
it's<00:03:05.440> much<00:03:06.040> harder<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:07.000> get<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.300> out<00:03:07.390> and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
it's much harder to get it out and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.480 
it's much harder to get it out and
that's<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:08.020> real<00:03:08.200> danger<00:03:08.620> because<00:03:08.920> as<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.280> said

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
that's a real danger because as you said

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.340 
that's a real danger because as you said
people<00:03:09.670> are<00:03:09.850> already<00:03:10.060> rationing<00:03:10.750> how<00:03:11.200> do<00:03:11.260> you

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
people are already rationing how do you

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.950 
people are already rationing how do you
go<00:03:11.470> back<00:03:11.590> into<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.890> river<00:03:12.130> in<00:03:12.850> one<00:03:13.420> month<00:03:13.570> two

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
go back into the river in one month two

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.540 
go back into the river in one month two
months<00:03:14.230> time<00:03:14.410> when<00:03:14.710> you've<00:03:14.800> got<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.040> irrigate

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
months time when you've got to irrigate

stuff is in the soil and in the wildlife

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.260 
stuff is in the soil and in the wildlife
it's<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.130> big<00:03:21.310> problem<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.790> as<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.090> said

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
it's a big problem and as you said

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.910 
it's a big problem and as you said
there's<00:03:22.420> rationing<00:03:22.930> going<00:03:23.170> on<00:03:23.290> people<00:03:23.710> can't

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
there's rationing going on people can't

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.100 
there's rationing going on people can't

this all cleared up the damage is
clearly<00:03:36.880> all<00:03:37.090> there<00:03:37.360> but<00:03:37.540> has<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.870> EPA<00:03:38.080> said

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
clearly all there but has the EPA said

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.250 
clearly all there but has the EPA said
anything<00:03:38.800> so<00:03:39.010> far<00:03:39.220> about<00:03:39.730> their<00:03:40.360> specific

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
anything so far about their specific

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.150 
anything so far about their specific
plans<00:03:42.720> yeah<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:44.020> one<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.740> things<00:03:44.980> they're

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
plans yeah the one of the things they're

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.340 
plans yeah the one of the things they're
really<00:03:45.459> trying<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.120> make<00:03:46.209> people<00:03:46.450> aware<00:03:46.660> of<00:03:46.870> is

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
really trying to make people aware of is

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.830 
really trying to make people aware of is
the<00:03:47.740> runoff<00:03:48.130> situation<00:03:49.030> so<00:03:49.209> this<00:03:49.390> didn't<00:03:49.720> just

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
the runoff situation so this didn't just

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.560 
the runoff situation so this didn't just
get<00:03:50.050> into<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:51.100> affluent<00:03:51.760> into<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.150> into<00:03:52.480> the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
get into the affluent into the into the

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.050 
get into the affluent into the into the
river<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:53.080> tributaries<00:03:53.740> runoff<00:03:54.340> from

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
river and the tributaries runoff from

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.050 
river and the tributaries runoff from
this<00:03:55.450> whether<00:03:56.200> it's<00:03:56.320> hit<00:03:56.620> soil<00:03:57.040> around<00:03:57.370> it<00:03:57.820> etc

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
this whether it's hit soil around it etc

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.440 
this whether it's hit soil around it etc
when<00:03:58.959> there<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.320> rain<00:03:59.680> it<00:04:00.010> is<00:04:00.640> going<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.090> impact

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
when there is rain it is going to impact

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.540 
when there is rain it is going to impact
this<00:04:01.780> possibly<00:04:02.260> increase<00:04:02.740> concentrations

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
this possibly increase concentrations

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.800 
this possibly increase concentrations
they're<00:04:03.850> trying<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.270> get<00:04:04.390> in<00:04:04.480> front<00:04:04.660> of<00:04:04.750> the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
they're trying to get in front of the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.020 
they're trying to get in front of the
problem<00:04:05.230> however<00:04:05.830> how<00:04:06.280> do<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.490> do<00:04:06.640> this<00:04:06.760> when

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
problem however how do you do this when

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.520 
problem however how do you do this when
there's<00:04:07.209> so<00:04:07.480> many<00:04:07.570> compounds<00:04:08.020> in<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.320> water

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
there's so many compounds in the water

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.199 
there's so many compounds in the water
so<00:04:09.070> as<00:04:09.190> I<00:04:09.310> said<00:04:09.520> they're<00:04:09.730> trying<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.030> catch

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
so as I said they're trying to catch

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.900 
so as I said they're trying to catch
fish<00:04:10.600> so<00:04:11.320> it's<00:04:11.620> Fisher<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.010> great<00:04:12.370> measurement

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
fish so it's Fisher a great measurement

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.000 
fish so it's Fisher a great measurement
of<00:04:13.060> pollution<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:13.720> water<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.170> they're

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
of pollution and water and they're

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.039 
of pollution and water and they're
trying<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.490> measure<00:04:16.330> the<00:04:16.570> sediment

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
trying to measure the sediment

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.960 
trying to measure the sediment
everything<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:18.310> they've<00:04:18.430> got<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.609> ton<00:04:18.910> of

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
everything and so they've got a ton of

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.490 
everything and so they've got a ton of
scientists<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:19.600> their<00:04:19.720> it's<00:04:19.989> an<00:04:20.140> interagency

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
scientists and their it's an interagency

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.110 
scientists and their it's an interagency
effort<00:04:21.130> there<00:04:21.280> really<00:04:21.520> were<00:04:21.729> they're<00:04:21.880> really

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
effort there really were they're really

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.200 
effort there really were they're really
working<00:04:22.680> through<00:04:23.680> various<00:04:24.130> agencies<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:25.060> get

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
working through various agencies to get

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.680 
working through various agencies to get
in<00:04:25.330> front<00:04:25.510> of<00:04:25.630> this<00:04:25.750> but<00:04:25.930> again<00:04:26.140> it's<00:04:26.320> measure

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
in front of this but again it's measure

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.690 
in front of this but again it's measure
water<00:04:26.990> its<00:04:27.230> measuring<00:04:27.560> soil<00:04:28.070> it's<00:04:28.340> measuring

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
water its measuring soil it's measuring

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.670 
water its measuring soil it's measuring
how<00:04:28.910> far<00:04:29.210> this<00:04:29.420> is<00:04:29.480> traveled<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.140> how<00:04:30.380> deep

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
how far this is traveled and how deep

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.520 
how far this is traveled and how deep
it's<00:04:30.890> gotten<00:04:31.250> into<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.670> sediment<00:04:31.910> so<00:04:32.690> so<00:04:33.320> far

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
it's gotten into the sediment so so far

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.460 
it's gotten into the sediment so so far
the<00:04:33.620> bullet<00:04:33.920> points<00:04:34.220> they're<00:04:34.460> very<00:04:34.760> broad<00:04:35.470> but

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
the bullet points they're very broad but

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.870 
the bullet points they're very broad but
there's<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.770> lot<00:04:36.920> of<00:04:36.950> money<00:04:37.040> being<00:04:37.430> pumped<00:04:37.640> into

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
there's a lot of money being pumped into

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.130 
there's a lot of money being pumped into
this<00:04:38.030> obviously<00:04:38.510> because<00:04:38.840> it's<00:04:38.990> going

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
this obviously because it's going

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.540 
this obviously because it's going
through<00:04:39.260> multiple<00:04:39.740> states<00:04:40.040> and<00:04:40.250> people<00:04:40.460> are

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
through multiple states and people are

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.030 
through multiple states and people are
suffering<00:04:40.790> so<00:04:41.270> it's<00:04:42.170> going<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.530> be<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.680> story

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
suffering so it's going to be a story

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.260 
suffering so it's going to be a story
will<00:04:43.220> be<00:04:43.250> covering<00:04:43.640> for<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.880> next<00:04:44.090> several

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.090

months as they scramble to get ahold of
this<00:04:46.280> situation<00:04:46.490> certainly<00:04:47.360> very<00:04:47.720> costly

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
this situation certainly very costly
