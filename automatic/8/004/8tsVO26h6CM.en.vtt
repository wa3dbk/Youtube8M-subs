00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.680
 another round of my place was I was 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.269
 or a little french martin knows 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.360
 not at all like this but it breaks off 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.700
 also completely no matter how exact location 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.410
 and here you get something interesting to 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.630
 say to the french artis I am 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.880
 First, that alone is the second one 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.500
 but bribe the french artis 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.080
 really by their speed 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.160
 their relatively low damage output and 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.050
 years later also by their accuracy 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.579
 but the whole holds at 45 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.719
 but unfortunately not partial entry comes 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.390
 you feel a bit like one 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.430
 c 92 what the annington and also the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.059
 precision and does not affect the now 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.700
 further bad 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.110
 I'll play around in this relatively 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.969
 because sometimes you just drive 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.559
 only that stands and why I search 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.539
 me first here on yorks 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.140
 directly from the side of the position 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.870
 to about 56 so rather a6 at one 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.149
 still for the following reason 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.789
 then I can speak to the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.109
 position down at h6 and so on 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.899
 shoot where I have always been 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.450
 so right now look very important here 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.920
 before the opponents should be started 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.330
 you really expect that certain 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.790
 scouts like here in the case 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.619
 zdf with his boss makes the goals 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.670
 So before that, please always receive 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.110
 already before to m 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.939
 and then you can hit exactly those 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.070
 This is a very normal hit 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.070
 been a lot for these little places so 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.560
 996 is chef at 13 never at helm 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.210
 never head-on but in the engine compartment 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.950
 in the back you definitely have the possibility 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.470
 pretty much dissecting them at the same time 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.329
 Now it will be me next 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.619
 3 is opened again and I have 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.220
 Of course, again next shot ready 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.509
 which will now too and accordingly 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.509
 but does less harm under the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.369
 panzer lands and if a house 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.840
 partly under the panzer landes leaves 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.759
 also for example with the 30 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.460
 Sometimes I do it very well 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.960
 do not rely on me 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.399
 then it may be that way 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.170
 pretty much everything inside the tank 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.460
 so that's maybe misplaced 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.960
 also a rand information so 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.460
 if you're doing a splash or something 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.659
 But then it can always be 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.009
 So here I come to stop that 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.290
 I can also rent 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.520
 somehow and here there but then 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.899
 to shoot a few goals if you 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.350
 it can be under the armor 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.140
 that here really protect driving report 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.940
 motor and can be without best yet 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.710
 In one shot, it really breaks down 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.090
 and it is certainly a lot of you 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.290
 sometimes even decorated mario you 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.840
 just not directly does not meet many 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.540
 hp subtracts but damn much 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.010
 hurt here I now have a team of 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.050
 so a bit on the hill run is and 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.760
 there is already this somehow 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.080
 unpleasant to meet so it will be real 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.460
 damn close and the goals behind 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.990
 this tank now here again completely 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.880
 Just a quick stop at I aim 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.440
 behind the tank because when I'm on the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.540
 armor myself it may be that one 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.000
 a crosshair jumps back and forth 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.390
 But it is important in every case that 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.430
 point of the center always behind the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.960
 Panzer is because only then you have him 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.910
 in such a shot really in the target field 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.110
 and then even that happens sometimes 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.090
 when I hit the tank now 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.770
 had been during the break 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.390
 could have moved that my 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.340
 Crosshair through the height of the tank 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.600
 shifts and is again 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.240
 therefore no longer with such a high 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.550
 probability hits so that only 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.200
 by the way, I mean it 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.160
 There are relatively many ari tutorials where you can 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.430
 maybe even look at it 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.120
 so now i have a very small one 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.730
 problem 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.800
 I try to delete something with such a thing 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.420
 small like really really hard 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.860
 possible but here are still left 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.240
 times a year on it is so beautiful 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.890
 continue to take mini med observed 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.270
 before he shoots too very important 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.830
 simple normality you have pressed 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.190
 you did not have so much to do as ari 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.330
 do 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.490
 and here I am not full 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.330
 combed through and thought just after me 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:42.170
 but the war seems somehow shining 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.910
 now that's a bit 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.380
 safer way of ours we wait 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.330
 have lost relatively little scouts 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.700
 So it could all work out 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.230
 we feel a bit further and 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.350
 now noticed now comes from quickly 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:58.130
 up from the hill and now I'm seated 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:01.130
 still my final shot only here 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.900
 on the thick max also very rare 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.580
 to see is actually introduced 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.540
 but try now in the case 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.920
 because I know he stays still 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.640
 but now you have seen i have 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.980
 after corrected 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.790
 the whole, so to speak, the height of the tank 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.230
 in that he no longer 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.330
 started after corrected after 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.000
 back in the back so I'm back at the 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.100
 same position country 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.229
 now I push it off but it's too far 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.310
 before, of course, happens in front of everyone 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.570
 things with the aria so she is 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.979
 really not very accurate right now 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.610
 I survey the situation and that 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.039
 does not look good 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.680
 So quite honestly two referred to 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.000
 several t 34 and all still live that 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.919
 nothing will change so I complete 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.289
 The position of the giant advantage of the French 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.669
 martin so if now the 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.409
 speed display is not around 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.259
 I would just spack at 40 km / h 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.430
 that gets even better with the Lorraine 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.610
 and with the bachelet that too will 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.569
 anyway in the dream so the acceleration 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.909
 from the army xxi is not like that now 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:55.550
 intoxicating but at the l'orÃ©al 850 ps 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:57.560
 or so on 30 25 tons or so 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.419
 and there is something right now 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.340
 Change I has the position change 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.539
 on the other flank around here, so to speak 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.699
 to act accordingly 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.529
 So agility is really announced that 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.930
 you have to lose the damage you do 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:11.449
 can not really bring points 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.279
 Member with agility on the way 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.240
 French-style and it goes in pretty much 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.490
 many falls if you are a bit 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.860
 is thinking pretty well here now the iss 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.150
 she is leaving the country again 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.779
 crumble field so sit down 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.150
 even further ahead 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:25.069
 you also look a bit crazy 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.479
 a swing radius of more than 90 the 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:29.479
 kind of more such a legal dispute 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.759
 but maybe not care I put myself 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.349
 now here in the front still stands above 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.060
 at the hill was still not through 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.889
 pressed and they are still there 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.560
 spotted rum so think hey what gives 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.089
 it is just new goals from the hall 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.979
 looking for a position really looks the 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:46.190
 minimap on has a bit with control 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.509
 and so on and just pull it 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.029
 a how that can work can worry 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:52.669
 and now expresses and at the day is 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:54.800
 wonderfully easy position change that 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.949
 exploit whole works actually 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.400
 Perfectly so and in the end must now through 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:04.219
 just a christian hand on e5 stands 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.810
 still the t 34 come and alone through 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:07.129
 the agility how to keep up with the 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.300
 Panzer moves and how you feel 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.650
 partly different with the 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.029
 artillery can bring in the game 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.839
 at the french martini has really 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:14.240
 goes very well through the high 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:16.099
 speed is something like that 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.659
 Actually, I manage it very well as soon as possible 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:19.879
 you have a little bit more control 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:21.319
 It's definitely the one 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:23.240
 French always first choice 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.129
 that does not affect the budget 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.110
 partly creates space also like times 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.360
 somehow 23 damage to the iss three too 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.560
 do with this 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.050
 if you meet directly in bright or 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.230
 Anyway and that brings you then 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.280
 not so much but yes i hope so 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.620
 could show you a little bit like that 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.000
 so it could work and hope a little 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.250
 I also help you with the French style 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.540
 to bring a little closer then a lot 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.540
 fun and see you next time
