00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:02.158
 - Hi everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley, 

00:00:02.158 --> 00:00:04.434
 and I am ready for a new Question &amp; Answer. 

00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:08.242
 So, I asked you all on Twitter, use hastag Ask Tyler, 

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:11.237
 and I will answer as many questions as I can in a new video. 

00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:13.315
 And you have made a trend, number one trending 

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:16.403
 subject in the world, so apparently you have some questions. 

00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:19.306
 So let's get to work. 

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:21.744
 "Describe your trip to Las Vegas in one word." 

00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:23.044
 So, I recently went to Las Vegas 

00:00:23.044 --> 00:00:24.994
 for a birthday, for a weekend. 

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:28.382
 And if I had to describe it in one word ... 

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:34.050
 Los. 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.862
 "Are you gay?" 

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:36.279
 This question is often asked to me. 

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:39.135
 And I know it's hard for you to decipher 

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:43.007
 whether or not I participate in homosexual activities. 

00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:47.157
 I enjoy a man on top of me. 

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:48.666
 (laughs) 

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.702
 Abby would like to know if I am still coming to England. 

00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:53.235
 Very quickly, keep looking. 

00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:56.044
 "" If you could relive a memory or experience it again, 

00:00:56.044 --> 00:00:57.321
 "What would it be?" 

00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.084
 My birth, because look I was there, say 

00:01:00.084 --> 00:01:01.640
 but I don't remember with it. 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.124
 I have some kind of uterus recalls. 

00:01:04.124 --> 00:01:07.757
 I wouldn't actually want to see it, maybe ... 

00:01:08.838 --> 00:01:10.429
 I just realized what I should look at 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:13.354
 to see my own birth. 

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:17.185
 "Describe your style in three words." 

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:21.293
 Well, I'd say elegant, (laughs) 

00:01:22.572 --> 00:01:26.055
 gorgeous, and delicious. 

00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:28.029
 "" What is the first thing you think of? 

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:29.700
 "When you hear pickle?" 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.022
 If you know me, you know that I love Disneyland. 

00:01:32.022 --> 00:01:34.832
 And if you know anything about my love for Disneyland, 

00:01:34.832 --> 00:01:37.084
 do you know i get a pickle 

00:01:37.084 --> 00:01:39.081
 every time I go to Disneyland. 

00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:41.379
 And I don't just get a pickle in Disneyland, 

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:45.814
 but when I get a pickle, I sing a special song. 

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:46.958
 and I turn it into a vine. 

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.676
 So if you know what I'm talking about, 

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:51.695
 this distinguishes the standard, normal viewer 

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:53.576
 from my best, okay? 

00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:55.688
 So if you know the lyrics of the song, put them below. 

00:01:55.688 --> 00:01:57.825
 "What is your favorite place to visit?" 

00:01:57.825 --> 00:01:59.891
 Well, I should say The Food Court, 

00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:04.278
 because I love food, cheap food, and tasting snacks. 

00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:07.066
 I mean, if you are not yet who I was, 

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:08.505
 and you now see this video, 

00:02:08.505 --> 00:02:10.920
 would you think i'm kind of crazy eating 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.776
 creature, and the gossip is true. (laughs) 

00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:16.609
 "What is your ultimate favorite tweet from a celebrity?" 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.907
 Well, I have several options for this. 

00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:21.624
 Obviously a lot of tweets from Cher, not just those to me, 

00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:23.203
 because she has tweeted me in the past. 

00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:24.526
 But all her other tweets are 

00:02:24.526 --> 00:02:27.313
 perfect gold platinum amazing. 

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:31.005
 And of course, a year ago, exactly a year ago, 

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:32.833
 Lindsey Lohan came to one of my live shows 

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:34.319
 and she tweeted 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.270
 And she even became cheeky and asked me 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.079
 if I had learned anything from her past 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.029
 when I was empty drinking a bottle of wine. 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:43.955
 Clearly iconic, but I think my number 1 celebrity tweet 

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.254
 Rihanna's tweet must always be 

00:02:46.254 --> 00:02:48.622
 when she was arguing with Satan. 

00:02:48.622 --> 00:02:51.873
 Because that was clearly iconic. 

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:54.334
 What is the best advice you have ever received? 

00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:56.749
 Well, I'm going to cheat here, because this advice 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.326
 was not given to me directly, but I saw it on my Tumblr dashboard, 

00:02:59.326 --> 00:03:02.066
 which means fate to my eyes 

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:04.455
 brought it, so I think it was given to me. 

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:07.566
 But it is, "No one has ever become poor from giving." 

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:09.122
 And I think that's something that applies to everyone, 

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.467
 everyone's life and how they should live their lives, 

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:14.462
 whether it is psychological or spiritual or emotional. 

00:03:14.462 --> 00:03:17.457
 Be more generous and do what you do 

00:03:17.457 --> 00:03:19.895
 with a mindset "Does this help other people?" 

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:21.521
 I really believe in karma. 

00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:23.332
 So that's the way I try to live my life. 

00:03:23.332 --> 00:03:25.839
 I know I'm not always the best at it. 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.279
 But I do my best. 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:30.158
 If you could advise your 16-year-old yourself 

00:03:30.158 --> 00:03:31.156
 what would that advice be? 

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:32.851
 I would say to my 16 year old self 

00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:34.477
 "" You think it's important how your audition goes 

00:03:34.477 --> 00:03:35.452
 "" for the school play. 

00:03:35.452 --> 00:03:37.936
 "You think it's important how you dance at the school party. 

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:40.839
 "You think it's important how you talk to people. 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:42.882
 "None of this is important, okay? 

00:03:42.882 --> 00:03:45.831
 "All these things, in the grand plan of things 

00:03:45.831 --> 00:03:48.153
 "" in life, none of this is really important. 

00:03:48.153 --> 00:03:51.157
 "And they are not only unimportant, nobody cares. 

00:03:51.157 --> 00:03:53.571
 "Look, Tyler, you are doing so much in your head 

00:03:53.571 --> 00:03:55.917
 '' with others think about you, but in the big picture 

00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:58.163
 "" of things, you worry less about what people think about you, 

00:03:58.163 --> 00:04:00.462
 "" Because at the end of the day, everyone is mainly concerned 

00:04:00.462 --> 00:04:02.668
 "" to himself and ultimately you know 

00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:04.734
 "" Nobody condemned you as much as 

00:04:04.734 --> 00:04:06.615
 "That you always think they do." 

00:04:06.615 --> 00:04:08.542
 Amy wants to know if I prefer 

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:10.283
 make drunk videos or sober videos. 

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.886
 Drunk videos are great because I think so 

00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:13.163
 that they are always hilarious. 

00:04:13.163 --> 00:04:15.415
 But sober videos are great too, because the next day, 

00:04:15.415 --> 00:04:16.529
 can I still function. 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.871
 Which Janoskian would you like to date if you could choose and why? 

00:04:20.871 --> 00:04:22.590
 I would go for Luke, 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.679
 because when we made our video together, 

00:04:24.679 --> 00:04:28.000
 well, i mean i'll just say it, 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.462
 the sparks flew off. 

00:04:29.462 --> 00:04:30.948
 "Do you have a phobia?" 

00:04:30.948 --> 00:04:32.272
 Yes, I have a phobia. 

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.360
 I'm terrified of insects. 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.589
 For example, if there is a spider, I cannot come close. 

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:39.330
 If I knew there was a spider in the kitchen, 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.490
 I should literally invite a friend 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.556
 to come and kill him, because I am terrified. 

00:04:43.556 --> 00:04:46.435
 Because I know, I know that if I kill a spider, 

00:04:46.435 --> 00:04:48.804
 all his friends will come to me. 

00:04:48.804 --> 00:04:50.127
 They know what I am up to. 

00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:51.497
 They know where I sleep, 

00:04:51.497 --> 00:04:53.610
 and they know what they can do to me. 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.212
 "Which book should I get for free 

00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:56.954
 "" at audible.com/tyleroakley? " 

00:04:56.954 --> 00:04:58.695
 That is a good question. 

00:04:58.695 --> 00:05:00.715
 If you know me, you know me every 

00:05:00.715 --> 00:05:03.664
 recommend a new book on audible.com every month 

00:05:03.664 --> 00:05:06.311
 They have millions of books to choose from, but if you do 

00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:08.656
 Use audible.com/tyleroakley, you can get your first book for free. 

00:05:08.656 --> 00:05:10.746
 This month I recommend "Attack of the." 

00:05:10.746 --> 00:05:11.605
 "Theater People". 

00:05:11.605 --> 00:05:13.764
 I've always been a theater person. 

00:05:13.764 --> 00:05:15.970
 When I was in high school I played in every play, 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.131
 every musical. 

00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:18.408
 I was the president of the drama club. 

00:05:18.408 --> 00:05:20.103
 And so, I read this book for the first time in college, 

00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:21.519
 and I thought it was great. 

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:23.864
 So I checked audible.com, and they have it there. 

00:05:23.864 --> 00:05:25.142
 So again, you can get it for free on 

00:05:25.142 --> 00:05:27.533
 audible.com/tyleroakley, the first book is free. 

00:05:27.533 --> 00:05:29.997
 But I absolutely recommend it if you haven't read it yet. 

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:30.786
 It is awesome. 

00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:32.598
 And if you have a recommendation for a book for the following month, 

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:34.107
 recommend it to me in the comments below, 

00:05:34.107 --> 00:05:35.802
 because I really need something good to listen to, 

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:37.079
 so yes! 

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:38.182
 Maple would like to know, 

00:05:38.182 --> 00:05:40.643
 "How did you come across @klainky?" 

00:05:40.643 --> 00:05:43.894
 At first she was a normal viewer just like you. 

00:05:43.894 --> 00:05:45.821
 And then I started noticing that she was with me 

00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:47.423
 tweeted and sat with me on Tumblr. 

00:05:47.423 --> 00:05:49.350
 And all her tweets were so funny, so then, 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.370
 I went to her Twitter page more and more often, 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.576
 just to see how she thought about pop culture things. 

00:05:53.576 --> 00:05:55.968
 And then I realized that if I love this person, 

00:05:55.968 --> 00:05:57.593
 as much as I do, I should follow her. 

00:05:57.593 --> 00:06:00.032
 And so I started following her. 

00:06:00.032 --> 00:06:01.448
 I mean, to be honest, this has been the last few years, 

00:06:01.448 --> 00:06:02.493
 become very normal. 

00:06:02.493 --> 00:06:05.581
 I have found so many viewers that I absolutely adore 

00:06:05.581 --> 00:06:08.530
 those of ordinary viewers, normal viewers 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.248
 have become good internet friends. 

00:06:10.248 --> 00:06:12.941
 This is especially the case on Tumblr. 

00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:16.030
 You make great gifs and fan creations 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.978
 and fan fantasies, and you use the Tyler Oakley 

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:20.534
 tag with a whole lot of love. 

00:06:20.534 --> 00:06:21.858
 And for that I love you. 

00:06:21.858 --> 00:06:24.481
 And I love to find you and become friends with you 

00:06:24.481 --> 00:06:26.664
 and just become internet besties. 

00:06:26.664 --> 00:06:30.356
 So if you want to become my best, stay yourself 

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:32.120
 and communicate with me on Twitter and Tumblr 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.814
 and Facebook and Instagram and everything in between. 

00:06:34.814 --> 00:06:37.995
 And who knows, maybe you will be my new internet bestie. 

00:06:37.995 --> 00:06:40.038
 This person emphasizes that I should not ignore him. 

00:06:40.038 --> 00:06:42.151
 He wants to know if I pee in the shower? 

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:45.332
 And the answer is, it depends on who is with me 

00:06:45.332 --> 00:06:47.375
 in the shower, and what they like. 

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:48.652
 But I think this is all I have for you today 

00:06:48.652 --> 00:06:50.347
 for our special small Question &amp; Answer video. 

00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:52.692
 If you liked this Q&amp;A video, don't forget to click the thumbs up button. 

00:06:52.692 --> 00:06:54.689
 I think this is my second or my third Question &amp; Answer 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:55.804
 video I have ever made. 

00:06:55.804 --> 00:06:58.451
 I never do this, so if you want to see it more often, 

00:06:58.451 --> 00:06:59.333
 let me know. 

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:00.331
 If this gets a lot of thumbs up 

00:07:00.331 --> 00:07:01.725
 I may do this more often. 

00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:03.484
 And I'm going to warn you 

00:07:03.484 --> 00:07:05.620
 There will be a very special Halloween video 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.476
 in a few days, so prepare your body well. 

00:07:08.476 --> 00:07:10.681
 It is the most epic thing I have ever edited. 

00:07:10.681 --> 00:07:11.842
 I'm working on it right now. 

00:07:11.842 --> 00:07:13.514
 I have been editing the last days. 

00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:15.836
 And it's kind of amazing, so be prepared. 

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:17.624
 Subscribe if you have not already done so. 

00:07:17.624 --> 00:07:19.412
