you is called the fancy fences mod but
the<00:00:19.779> irony<00:00:19.929> is<00:00:20.230> it's<00:00:20.500> not<00:00:20.650> actually<00:00:20.949> anything

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
the irony is it's not actually anything

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.490 
the irony is it's not actually anything
to<00:00:21.939> do<00:00:22.029> with<00:00:22.150> fences<00:00:22.510> its<00:00:22.689> to<00:00:23.019> do<00:00:23.140> with<00:00:23.170> walls

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
to do with fences its to do with walls

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.410 
to do with fences its to do with walls

name of and I don't even know how to

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.570 
name of and I don't even know how to
craft<00:00:53.440> it<00:00:53.590> didn't<00:00:53.890> even<00:00:53.950> know<00:00:54.130> is<00:00:54.280> in<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.460> game

craft it didn't even know is in the game
but<00:00:54.790> anyway<00:00:55.030> this<00:00:55.510> is<00:00:55.690> what<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:55.870> looks<00:00:56.020> like

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
but anyway this is what it looks like

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.080 
but anyway this is what it looks like
and<00:00:56.350> it's<00:00:56.590> really<00:00:56.800> cool<00:00:56.980> so<00:00:57.370> if<00:00:57.910> you<00:00:58.000> like

and it's really cool so if you like
decorating<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.720> building<00:00:58.960> stuff<00:00:59.050> these<00:00:59.500> will

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
decorating and building stuff these will

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.530 
decorating and building stuff these will
be<00:00:59.770> brilliant<00:01:00.130> for<00:01:00.160> you<00:01:00.400> and<00:01:00.610> I<00:01:01.240> may<00:01:01.330> also

be brilliant for you and I may also

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.020 
be brilliant for you and I may also
change<00:01:01.780> some<00:01:02.080> of<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.230> mechanics<00:01:02.350> of<00:01:02.740> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
change some of the mechanics of the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.450 
change some of the mechanics of the
walls<00:01:04.030> in<00:01:04.299> Minecraft<00:01:04.989> so<00:01:05.619> here's<00:01:05.799> a<00:01:05.859> wall<00:01:06.039> made

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
walls in Minecraft so here's a wall made

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.090 
walls in Minecraft so here's a wall made
out<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:06.759> walls<00:01:06.939> and<00:01:07.179> in<00:01:08.079> default<00:01:08.439> minecraft<00:01:08.590> it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
out of walls and in default minecraft it

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.380 
out of walls and in default minecraft it
wouldn't<00:01:09.520> really<00:01:09.609> look<00:01:09.820> like<00:01:09.880> this<00:01:10.119> it<00:01:10.299> would

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
wouldn't really look like this it would

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.450 
wouldn't really look like this it would
look<00:01:10.479> terrible<00:01:10.810> so<00:01:11.679> if<00:01:11.770> we<00:01:11.890> move<00:01:12.100> this<00:01:12.280> block

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
look terrible so if we move this block

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.950 
look terrible so if we move this block
here<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:12.820> can<00:01:12.939> see<00:01:13.060> it<00:01:13.149> changing<00:01:13.659> shape

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
here you can see it changing shape

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.630 
here you can see it changing shape
depending<00:01:14.229> on<00:01:14.679> how<00:01:14.890> many<00:01:15.039> blocks<00:01:15.250> and<00:01:15.549> white

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
depending on how many blocks and white

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.370 
depending on how many blocks and white
it's<00:01:15.759> attached<00:01:15.939> to<00:01:15.969> so<00:01:16.780> if<00:01:16.869> we<00:01:16.929> put<00:01:17.079> this<00:01:17.170> back

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
it's attached to so if we put this back

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.690 
it's attached to so if we put this back
there<00:01:17.679> we<00:01:17.740> are<00:01:17.859> back<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.249> a<00:01:18.280> wall<00:01:18.460> again

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
there we are back to a wall again

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.580 
there we are back to a wall again
there's<00:01:19.479> a<00:01:19.539> weird<00:01:19.689> little<00:01:19.840> texture<00:01:20.320> book<00:01:20.469> with

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
there's a weird little texture book with

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.289 
there's a weird little texture book with
this<00:01:20.740> which<00:01:20.979> makes<00:01:21.249> like<00:01:21.429> really<00:01:21.729> thin<00:01:21.969> brick

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
this which makes like really thin brick

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.419 
this which makes like really thin brick
layer<00:01:22.509> here<00:01:22.749> it<00:01:23.619> only<00:01:23.770> happens<00:01:24.130> between<00:01:24.249> the

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
layer here it only happens between the

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:25.889 
layer here it only happens between the
first<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:24.759> second<00:01:25.119> layer<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.539> second<00:01:25.810> or

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
first and second layer the second or

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.690 
first and second layer the second or
third<00:01:25.929> layer<00:01:26.259> looks<00:01:26.409> completely<00:01:26.890> fine<00:01:27.009> but

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
third layer looks completely fine but

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.489 
third layer looks completely fine but
it's<00:01:27.850> just<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.090> first<00:01:28.329> and<00:01:28.479> second<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:28.960> you

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499 
it's just the first and second so you

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:30.569 
it's just the first and second so you
might<00:01:29.619> have<00:01:29.679> to<00:01:29.770> just<00:01:29.950> ignore<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.369> it<00:01:30.460> might

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
might have to just ignore that it might

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.039 
might have to just ignore that it might
be<00:01:30.700> fixed<00:01:30.969> in<00:01:31.060> future<00:01:31.329> versions<00:01:31.479> of<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.899> mod

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
be fixed in future versions of the mod

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.749 
be fixed in future versions of the mod
by<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.799> way<00:01:32.920> this<00:01:33.039> works<00:01:33.280> with<00:01:33.460> all<00:01:33.609> different

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
by the way this works with all different

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.109 
by the way this works with all different
kinds<00:01:33.999> of<00:01:34.179> wall<00:01:34.359> or<00:01:34.710> 11<00:01:35.710> type<00:01:35.920> just<00:01:36.159> total<00:01:36.520> so

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
kinds of wall or 11 type just total so

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.459 
kinds of wall or 11 type just total so
yeah<00:01:37.329> you<00:01:37.569> can<00:01:37.689> mess<00:01:37.840> around<00:01:37.869> with<00:01:38.170> those<00:01:38.259> and

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
yeah you can mess around with those and

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.859 
yeah you can mess around with those and
make<00:01:38.560> some<00:01:38.710> cool<00:01:38.920> structures<00:01:39.369> so<00:01:40.359> anyway<00:01:40.689> I'm

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
make some cool structures so anyway I'm

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:41.910 
make some cool structures so anyway I'm
just<00:01:41.020> going<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.229> show<00:01:41.319> you<00:01:41.380> over<00:01:41.560> here<00:01:41.679> how

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
just going to show you over here how

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.649 
just going to show you over here how
they<00:01:42.069> interact<00:01:42.429> with<00:01:42.520> other<00:01:42.700> blocks<00:01:42.909> so<00:01:43.569> if

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
they interact with other blocks so if

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.029 
they interact with other blocks so if
you<00:01:43.780> can<00:01:43.899> see<00:01:43.990> here<00:01:44.109> we've<00:01:44.200> got<00:01:44.229> wall<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:44.799> it's

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
you can see here we've got wall and it's

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.099 
you can see here we've got wall and it's
attaching<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.670> normal<00:01:46.479> blocks<00:01:46.719> which<00:01:46.960> of

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
attaching to normal blocks which of

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:48.989 
attaching to normal blocks which of
these<00:01:47.170> stone<00:01:47.409> bricks<00:01:47.679> we<00:01:48.399> remove<00:01:48.670> them<00:01:48.909> you

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
these stone bricks we remove them you

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:50.160 
these stone bricks we remove them you
see<00:01:49.149> it<00:01:49.210> just<00:01:49.299> goes<00:01:49.450> back<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.810> normal<00:01:49.990> wall

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
see it just goes back to the normal wall

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.279 
see it just goes back to the normal wall
shape<00:01:50.409> and<00:01:50.619> it<00:01:51.460> also<00:01:51.579> connects<00:01:51.999> to<00:01:52.210> non<00:01:52.929> full

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
shape and it also connects to non full

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.370 
shape and it also connects to non full
blocks<00:01:53.560> like<00:01:53.889> stone<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.670> mean<00:01:54.999> iron<00:01:55.210> bars<00:01:55.600> stone

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
blocks like stone I mean iron bars stone

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.499 
blocks like stone I mean iron bars stone
bars<00:01:56.619> what<00:01:56.799> I<00:01:56.859> went<00:01:56.979> on<00:01:57.039> about<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.270> yeah<00:01:58.450> you

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
bars what I went on about so yeah you

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.989 
bars what I went on about so yeah you
can<00:01:58.689> see<00:01:58.810> looks<00:01:58.959> cool<00:01:59.200> if<00:01:59.380> we<00:01:59.469> remove<00:01:59.709> it<00:01:59.999> back

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:00.999 
can see looks cool if we remove it back

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:02.520 
can see looks cool if we remove it back
to<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.299> weird<00:02:01.479> shape<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.079> if<00:02:02.229> we<00:02:02.259> add<00:02:02.499> it

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
to that weird shape and if we add it

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.760 
to that weird shape and if we add it
back

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
back

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.620 
back
back<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.460> being<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.820> wall<00:02:05.000> again<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:05.509> it's

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
back to being a wall again so it's

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.300 
back to being a wall again so it's
really<00:02:05.750> cool<00:02:05.929> works<00:02:06.380> with<00:02:06.560> glass<00:02:06.770> panes<00:02:07.070> and

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
really cool works with glass panes and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.550 
really cool works with glass panes and
stuff<00:02:07.880> like<00:02:08.000> that<00:02:08.060> even<00:02:08.330> cobweb<00:02:08.810> which<00:02:09.440> is

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
stuff like that even cobweb which is

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.280 
stuff like that even cobweb which is
kind<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.860> interesting<00:02:11.019> anyway<00:02:12.019> I'm<00:02:12.110> going<00:02:12.170> to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
kind of interesting anyway I'm going to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.330 
kind of interesting anyway I'm going to
show<00:02:12.379> you<00:02:12.470> some<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.800> other<00:02:12.920> mechanics

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
show you some of the other mechanics

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.369 
show you some of the other mechanics
which<00:02:13.489> I'll<00:02:13.610> mention<00:02:13.640> yep<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:14.930> if<00:02:15.050> we<00:02:15.170> put

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
which I'll mention yep so if we put

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.470 
which I'll mention yep so if we put
block<00:02:15.680> down<00:02:15.830> here<00:02:16.099> just<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.760> little<00:02:16.790> normal

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
block down here just a little normal

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.589 
block down here just a little normal
stone<00:02:17.750> block<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.370> put<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.489> well<00:02:19.970> stone<00:02:20.390> brick

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
stone block and put it well stone brick

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.479 
stone block and put it well stone brick
block<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.170> put<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> wall<00:02:21.680> next<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.340> see

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
block and put a wall next to it you see

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.430 
block and put a wall next to it you see
it<00:02:22.580> doesn't<00:02:22.670> connect<00:02:23.090> if<00:02:23.269> we<00:02:23.810> put<00:02:23.989> one<00:02:24.080> here<00:02:24.260> it

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
it doesn't connect if we put one here it

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.809 
it doesn't connect if we put one here it
will<00:02:24.560> connect<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.129> you<00:02:25.220> need<00:02:25.340> two<00:02:25.519> next<00:02:25.760> to

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
will connect so you need two next to

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.300 
will connect so you need two next to
each<00:02:25.879> other<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.680> important<00:02:28.069> thing<00:02:28.190> is

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
each other and the important thing is

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.920 
each other and the important thing is
these<00:02:28.489> need<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.790> be<00:02:28.879> perpendicular<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.840> the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
these need to be perpendicular to the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.289 
these need to be perpendicular to the
block<00:02:30.110> like<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:30.980> if<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.610> put<00:02:31.760> one<00:02:31.910> here<00:02:32.090> it

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
block like that if you put one here it

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.820 
block like that if you put one here it
won't<00:02:32.420> connect<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.349> is<00:02:33.500> actually<00:02:33.739> quite

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
won't connect this is actually quite

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.559 
won't connect this is actually quite
over<00:02:34.040> neat<00:02:34.250> feature<00:02:34.730> because<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.299> means<00:02:35.420> you

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
over neat feature because it means you

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.289 
over neat feature because it means you
can<00:02:35.690> have<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.810> fence<00:02:36.370> running<00:02:37.370> next<00:02:37.579> door<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:38.090> am

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
can have a fence running next door I am

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.180 
can have a fence running next door I am
normal<00:02:38.870> well<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.170> mean<00:02:39.319> her<00:02:39.560> wall<00:02:39.799> night

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
normal well I mean her wall night

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.220 
normal well I mean her wall night
running<00:02:40.370> next<00:02:40.549> to<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.730> normal<00:02:40.910> wall<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:41.930> normal

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
running next to a normal wall of normal

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.319 
running next to a normal wall of normal
blocks<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.739> they<00:02:42.950> won't<00:02:43.130> connect<00:02:43.430> normally

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
blocks and they won't connect normally

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.610 
blocks and they won't connect normally
it<00:02:44.510> looked<00:02:44.750> like<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:45.019> which<00:02:45.349> would<00:02:45.530> look

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
it looked like this which would look

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.650 
it looked like this which would look
really<00:02:45.890> terrible<00:02:46.340> wouldn't<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.670> but<00:02:47.450> anyway

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
really terrible wouldn't it but anyway

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.380 
really terrible wouldn't it but anyway
it's<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.349> cool<00:02:48.530> little<00:02:48.560> feature<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:49.220> yeah<00:02:50.090> so

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390

hundreds of stacks of wheat which can

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.160 
hundreds of stacks of wheat which can
fill<00:03:15.920> up<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.100> lot<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.280> chests<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.780> mod<00:03:17.989> adds

fill up a lot of chests so this mod adds
a<00:03:18.319> new<00:03:18.470> block<00:03:18.859> which<00:03:19.100> is<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.400> wheat<00:03:19.549> block

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
a new block which is the wheat block

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.580 
a new block which is the wheat block
which<00:03:20.209> has<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.660> cool<00:03:20.930> texture<00:03:21.200> which<00:03:21.380> looks

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
which has a cool texture which looks

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.379 
which has a cool texture which looks
like<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:21.859> and<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.700> can<00:03:22.850> make<00:03:22.970> this<00:03:23.120> by

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
like that and you can make this by

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.449 
like that and you can make this by
putting<00:03:23.780> nine<00:03:24.260> wheat<00:03:24.470> in<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.829> crafting<00:03:25.400> table

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
putting nine wheat in the crafting table

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.360 
putting nine wheat in the crafting table
and<00:03:25.880> filling<00:03:26.510> it<00:03:26.600> up<00:03:26.690> like<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:28.010> there

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
and filling it up like that and there

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.680 
and filling it up like that and there
you<00:03:28.459> got<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:28.609> wheat<00:03:28.760> block<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.450> can<00:03:29.569> also

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
you got a wheat block you can also

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.720 
you got a wheat block you can also
convert<00:03:30.290> this<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.739> wheat<00:03:30.920> block<00:03:31.130> back<00:03:31.370> into

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
convert this and wheat block back into

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.460 
convert this and wheat block back into
the<00:03:31.910> wheat<00:03:32.060> like<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:33.170> get<00:03:33.319> your<00:03:33.440> weight

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
the wheat like that and get your weight

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.259 
the wheat like that and get your weight
back<00:03:33.739> but<00:03:34.190> we'll<00:03:34.370> need<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:34.639> week<00:03:34.849> block<00:03:35.060> for<00:03:35.209> the

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
back but we'll need a week block for the

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.360 
back but we'll need a week block for the
next<00:03:35.450> demonstration<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:36.829> anyway<00:03:37.099> this<00:03:37.220> is

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
next demonstration so anyway this is

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.809 
next demonstration so anyway this is
useful<00:03:37.579> for<00:03:37.790> condensing<00:03:38.540> all<00:03:39.079> your<00:03:39.489> 64<00:03:40.489> piles

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
useful for condensing all your 64 piles

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.539 
useful for condensing all your 64 piles
of<00:03:41.000> 64<00:03:41.480> wheat<00:03:41.720> into<00:03:42.170> just<00:03:42.410> one<00:03:42.650> stack<00:03:43.010> which<00:03:43.370> is

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
of 64 wheat into just one stack which is

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.330 
of 64 wheat into just one stack which is
much<00:03:43.970> better<00:03:44.209> anyway<00:03:45.109> with<00:03:45.680> these<00:03:45.889> you<00:03:46.190> can

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
much better anyway with these you can

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.640 
much better anyway with these you can
also<00:03:46.519> make<00:03:46.910> something<00:03:47.419> called<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:47.810> scarecrow

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
also make something called a scarecrow

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.500 
also make something called a scarecrow
so<00:03:49.220> if<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.489> make<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.970> same<00:03:50.120> way<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.299> snow

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
so if you make it the same way the snow

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.300 
so if you make it the same way the snow
gone<00:03:50.690> there<00:03:51.049> you<00:03:51.109> have<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.260> scarecrow<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:51.889> this

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
gone there you have a scarecrow and this

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.250 
gone there you have a scarecrow and this
actually<00:03:52.459> has<00:03:52.700> its<00:03:52.730> own<00:03:52.940> unique<00:03:52.970> feature<00:03:53.569> so

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
actually has its own unique feature so

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.559 
actually has its own unique feature so
if<00:03:54.349> we<00:03:54.380> go<00:03:54.530> over<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.739> load<00:03:54.950> for<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:55.400> spawn<00:03:56.329> some

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
if we go over to load for and spawn some

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.509 
if we go over to load for and spawn some
sheep<00:03:56.810> you'll<00:03:57.560> see<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:57.859> I'll<00:03:57.980> attempt<00:03:58.340> to

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
sheep you'll see that I'll attempt to

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.420 
sheep you'll see that I'll attempt to
run<00:03:58.730> away<00:03:58.849> from<00:03:59.329> the<00:03:59.769> Scarecrow's<00:04:00.769> sometimes

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
run away from the Scarecrow's sometimes

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.890 
run away from the Scarecrow's sometimes
they<00:04:01.549> just<00:04:01.579> step<00:04:02.150> on<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:02.299> chest<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.660> start

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
they just step on the chest and start

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.059 
they just step on the chest and start
spinning<00:04:03.169> around<00:04:03.349> or<00:04:03.590> something<00:04:03.829> which<00:04:03.919> is<00:04:04.040> a

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
spinning around or something which is a

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.559 
spinning around or something which is a
bit<00:04:04.160> weird<00:04:04.190> but<00:04:04.730> anyway<00:04:04.970> if<00:04:05.180> we<00:04:05.299> remove<00:04:05.510> the

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
bit weird but anyway if we remove the

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.379 
bit weird but anyway if we remove the
Scarecrow<00:04:06.019> and<00:04:06.549> place<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:07.579> sheep<00:04:07.880> just<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.239> show

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
Scarecrow and place a sheep just to show

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:09.759 
Scarecrow and place a sheep just to show
that<00:04:08.419> works<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:09.230> see<00:04:09.260> it<00:04:09.470> doesn't<00:04:09.590> really

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
that works you see it doesn't really

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.170 
that works you see it doesn't really
want<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.069> move<00:04:10.280> at<00:04:10.459> all<00:04:10.609> it<00:04:10.790> just<00:04:10.819> stays<00:04:11.150> there

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.210 
next block I wanted to show you is the
coal<00:04:24.479> block<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:25.199> you<00:04:25.530> know<00:04:25.650> in<00:04:25.770> your<00:04:25.860> mining

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
coal block so you know in your mining

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.040 
coal block so you know in your mining
you<00:04:26.400> can't<00:04:26.880> end<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.270> with<00:04:27.660> like<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.810> full

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
you can't end it with like a full

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.600 
you can't end it with like a full
inventory<00:04:28.320> of<00:04:28.530> coal<00:04:28.830> because<00:04:29.130> there's<00:04:29.400> so

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
inventory of coal because there's so

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.680 
inventory of coal because there's so
much<00:04:29.759> written<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.180> just<00:04:30.330> swallow<00:04:30.509> mine

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
much written you just swallow mine

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.499 
much written you just swallow mine
anyway<00:04:31.020> although<00:04:31.740> some<00:04:32.070> people<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:32.789> ignore

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
anyway although some people just ignore

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.210 
anyway although some people just ignore
it<00:04:33.539> in<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.900> future<00:04:34.020> but<00:04:34.289> anyway<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:34.979> can<00:04:35.130> now

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
it in the future but anyway you can now

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.830 
it in the future but anyway you can now
condense<00:04:35.550> all<00:04:35.699> your<00:04:35.880> coal<00:04:36.060> into<00:04:36.300> one<00:04:36.539> block

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
condense all your coal into one block

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.960 
condense all your coal into one block
and<00:04:37.110> then<00:04:37.740> convert<00:04:38.009> it<00:04:38.130> back<00:04:38.280> out<00:04:38.550> again<00:04:38.669> when

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
and then convert it back out again when

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.210 
and then convert it back out again when
you<00:04:39.030> want<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.509> need<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.530> anyway<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:40.919> can

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
you want to need it so anyway you can

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.219 
you want to need it so anyway you can
make<00:04:41.520> this<00:04:41.669> with<00:04:41.910> filling<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.810> crafting

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
make this with filling the crafting

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.170 
make this with filling the crafting
table<00:04:43.289> up<00:04:43.650> with<00:04:43.770> coal<00:04:43.979> like<00:04:44.729> you<00:04:44.820> do<00:04:44.940> with<00:04:45.060> the

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
table up with coal like you do with the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.580 
table up with coal like you do with the
wheat<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:45.479> there<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.780> get<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.960> coal<00:04:46.139> block<00:04:46.380> and

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
wheat and there you get a coal block and

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.170 
wheat and there you get a coal block and
again<00:04:47.039> you<00:04:47.190> can<00:04:47.220> convert<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:47.729> back<00:04:47.759> like<00:04:48.000> that

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
again you can convert it back like that

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.300 
again you can convert it back like that
and<00:04:48.419> these<00:04:49.289> coal<00:04:49.560> blocks<00:04:49.800> are<00:04:49.919> also<00:04:50.039> very

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
and these coal blocks are also very

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.500 
and these coal blocks are also very
useful<00:04:50.370> because<00:04:50.729> you<00:04:50.970> can<00:04:51.060> put<00:04:51.240> them<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.449> the

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
useful because you can put them in the

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.330 
useful because you can put them in the
furnace<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.050> they'll<00:04:52.680> actually<00:04:52.830> smell<00:04:53.310> a

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
furnace and they'll actually smell a

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.760 
furnace and they'll actually smell a
whole<00:04:53.669> 64<00:04:54.360> stack<00:04:54.720> of<00:04:54.930> whatever<00:04:55.289> food<00:04:55.500> or

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
whole 64 stack of whatever food or

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.170 
whole 64 stack of whatever food or
whatever<00:04:56.070> you<00:04:56.340> want<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.699> put<00:04:56.820> up<00:04:56.910> in<00:04:57.030> there

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
whatever you want to put up in there

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.540 
whatever you want to put up in there
like<00:04:57.500> sand<00:04:58.500> or<00:04:58.680> anything<00:04:58.919> like<00:04:58.949> that<00:04:59.070> so<00:04:59.400> yeah

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
like sand or anything like that so yeah

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.969 
like sand or anything like that so yeah
it<00:05:00.389> just<00:05:00.449> really<00:05:00.960> efficient<00:05:01.410> although<00:05:01.889> if

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
it just really efficient although if

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.260 
it just really efficient although if
you've<00:05:02.100> got<00:05:02.250> enough<00:05:02.460> coal<00:05:02.669> to<00:05:02.699> make<00:05:02.940> blocks

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
you've got enough coal to make blocks

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.300 
you've got enough coal to make blocks
anyway<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:04.260> chances<00:05:04.590> i<00:05:04.680> don't<00:05:04.919> really<00:05:05.010> need

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
anyway the chances i don't really need

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.570 
anyway the chances i don't really need
to<00:05:06.060> worry<00:05:06.090> about<00:05:06.330> efficiency<00:05:06.870> of<00:05:06.960> coal<00:05:07.169> usage

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
to worry about efficiency of coal usage

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.950 
to worry about efficiency of coal usage
but<00:05:08.580> anyway<00:05:08.880> suppose<00:05:09.240> it<00:05:09.419> would<00:05:09.599> matter<00:05:09.810> if

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
but anyway suppose it would matter if

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.540 
but anyway suppose it would matter if
you're<00:05:10.260> using<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.680> mod<00:05:10.860> pack<00:05:11.070> like<00:05:11.250> feed<00:05:11.430> the

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
you're using a mod pack like feed the

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.790 
you're using a mod pack like feed the
beast<00:05:11.729> but<00:05:11.970> you<00:05:12.389> know<00:05:12.479> no<00:05:12.660> so<00:05:13.380> anyway<00:05:13.410> I'm

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
beast but you know no so anyway I'm

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.189 
beast but you know no so anyway I'm
there's<00:05:14.639> also<00:05:14.789> another<00:05:15.060> block<00:05:15.449> to<00:05:15.960> do<00:05:16.080> with

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
there's also another block to do with

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.629 
there's also another block to do with
this<00:05:16.320> as<00:05:16.470> well<00:05:16.620> called<00:05:16.919> the<00:05:17.009> charcoal<00:05:17.430> block

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
this as well called the charcoal block

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.999 
this as well called the charcoal block
which<00:05:18.120> is<00:05:18.150> made<00:05:18.449> with<00:05:18.479> charcoal<00:05:19.169> if<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.830> don't

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
which is made with charcoal if you don't

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:21.500 
which is made with charcoal if you don't
know<00:05:20.099> that's<00:05:20.310> what<00:05:20.669> happens<00:05:20.970> when<00:05:21.060> you<00:05:21.180> smelt

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
know that's what happens when you smelt

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.360 
know that's what happens when you smelt
logs<00:05:21.720> and<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:22.530> get<00:05:22.680> charcoal<00:05:23.039> and<00:05:23.190> you<00:05:23.250> can

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
logs and you get charcoal and you can

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.070 
logs and you get charcoal and you can
again<00:05:23.580> make<00:05:23.789> those<00:05:23.970> into<00:05:24.270> blocks<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:24.840> they

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
again make those into blocks and they

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.629 
again make those into blocks and they
have<00:05:25.199> a<00:05:25.229> slightly<00:05:25.500> different<00:05:25.710> texture<00:05:26.190> which

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
have a slightly different texture which

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.430 
have a slightly different texture which
looks<00:05:26.880> like<00:05:26.940> that<00:05:27.180> so<00:05:27.599> yeah<00:05:27.810> you<00:05:28.289> can

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
looks like that so yeah you can

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.290 
looks like that so yeah you can
distinguish<00:05:28.770> between<00:05:28.919> them<00:05:29.250> last<00:05:30.090> but<00:05:30.270> not

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
distinguish between them last but not

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.969 
distinguish between them last but not
least<00:05:30.449> we've<00:05:30.810> got<00:05:30.990> the<00:05:31.080> redstone<00:05:31.470> block<00:05:31.710> which

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
least we've got the redstone block which

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.820 
least we've got the redstone block which
is<00:05:32.180> made<00:05:33.180> you<00:05:33.720> guessed<00:05:33.960> it<00:05:34.110> yup<00:05:34.289> in<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.650> same

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
is made you guessed it yup in the same

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.350 
is made you guessed it yup in the same
way<00:05:34.889> as<00:05:35.070> the<00:05:35.130> other<00:05:35.310> ones<00:05:35.460> you<00:05:35.849> just<00:05:35.880> fill<00:05:36.240> the

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
way as the other ones you just fill the

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.750 
way as the other ones you just fill the
crafting<00:05:36.630> table<00:05:36.690> with<00:05:37.169> redstone<00:05:37.770> like<00:05:38.550> this

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
crafting table with redstone like this

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.180 
crafting table with redstone like this
and<00:05:39.449> you<00:05:39.630> get<00:05:39.750> your<00:05:39.870> license<00:05:40.590> tone<00:05:40.710> block<00:05:40.949> here

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
and you get your license tone block here

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.990 
and you get your license tone block here
so<00:05:42.180> if<00:05:42.270> we<00:05:42.389> jump<00:05:42.539> over<00:05:42.780> to<00:05:42.810> load<00:05:43.020> for<00:05:43.229> here<00:05:43.440> and

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
so if we jump over to load for here and

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.770 
so if we jump over to load for here and
place<00:05:45.000> a<00:05:45.030> redstone<00:05:45.210> block<00:05:45.599> down<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:46.159> then

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
place a redstone block down and then

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.000 
place a redstone block down and then
connect<00:05:48.780> redstone<00:05:49.080> to<00:05:49.229> it<00:05:49.349> you<00:05:49.590> see<00:05:49.620> it<00:05:49.770> lights

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
connect redstone to it you see it lights

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.950 
connect redstone to it you see it lights
up<00:05:50.159> like<00:05:50.310> that<00:05:50.520> like<00:05:51.060> glowstone<00:05:51.449> or<00:05:51.659> something

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
up like that like glowstone or something

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.170 
up like that like glowstone or something
but<00:05:52.289> I<00:05:52.500> don't<00:05:53.010> know<00:05:53.070> if<00:05:53.099> it<00:05:53.550> likes<00:05:53.909> to<00:05:54.030> put

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
but I don't know if it likes to put

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.839 
but I don't know if it likes to put
nighttime<00:05:54.510> let's<00:05:54.720> try<00:05:54.840> that<00:05:54.990> out<00:05:55.699> yeah<00:05:56.699> it's

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
nighttime let's try that out yeah it's

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.189 
nighttime let's try that out yeah it's
like<00:05:56.940> a<00:05:57.000> light<00:05:57.210> source<00:05:57.389> a<00:05:57.599> nighttime<00:05:57.780> if<00:05:58.080> you

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
like a light source a nighttime if you

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.379 
like a light source a nighttime if you
like<00:05:58.349> yeah<00:05:58.919> it's<00:05:59.159> cool<00:05:59.340> so<00:05:59.820> yeah<00:05:59.970> you<00:06:00.240> could

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
like yeah it's cool so yeah you could

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:01.580 
like yeah it's cool so yeah you could
probably<00:06:00.449> use<00:06:00.780> these<00:06:00.930> as<00:06:00.960> lights<00:06:01.320> in<00:06:01.530> your

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
probably use these as lights in your

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.010 
probably use these as lights in your
house<00:06:01.740> or<00:06:01.889> something<00:06:02.070> but<00:06:03.000> anyway<00:06:03.240> am<00:06:03.389> as<00:06:03.659> far

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
house or something but anyway am as far

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.189 
house or something but anyway am as far
as<00:06:04.110> i<00:06:04.199> know<00:06:04.260> it<00:06:04.470> doesn't<00:06:04.650> wait<00:06:05.190> let's<00:06:05.460> try<00:06:06.199> yeah

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
as i know it doesn't wait let's try yeah

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.600 
as i know it doesn't wait let's try yeah
it<00:06:07.289> doesn't<00:06:07.440> power<00:06:07.710> any<00:06:07.979> blocks<00:06:08.310> like<00:06:08.580> a

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
it doesn't power any blocks like a

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.990 
it doesn't power any blocks like a
redstone<00:06:09.060> torch<00:06:09.180> would<00:06:09.659> but<00:06:10.500> it<00:06:10.789> just<00:06:11.789> lights

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
redstone torch would but it just lights

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.939 
redstone torch would but it just lights
up<00:06:12.150> looks<00:06:12.449> cool<00:06:12.630> i<00:06:12.840> think<00:06:13.289> it<00:06:13.380> also<00:06:13.500> triggers<00:06:13.770> a

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
up looks cool i think it also triggers a

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:17.029 
up looks cool i think it also triggers a
block<00:06:14.159> updates<00:06:14.520> so<00:06:15.289> like<00:06:16.289> a<00:06:16.320> good<00:06:16.560> switch<00:06:16.860> or

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
block updates so like a good switch or

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:18.409 
block updates so like a good switch or
whatever<00:06:17.280> they're<00:06:17.430> called<00:06:17.460> or<00:06:17.940> something<00:06:18.150> i

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
whatever they're called or something i

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.879 
whatever they're called or something i
don't<00:06:18.479> know<00:06:18.630> what<00:06:18.900> its<00:06:19.020> uses<00:06:19.349> to<00:06:19.470> be<00:06:19.620> i'm<00:06:19.770> not

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
don't know what its uses to be i'm not

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.740 
don't know what its uses to be i'm not
really<00:06:20.039> very<00:06:20.220> good<00:06:20.310> at<00:06:20.490> redstone<00:06:20.820> but<00:06:21.030> you<00:06:21.599> can

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
really very good at redstone but you can

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.060 
really very good at redstone but you can
probably<00:06:21.930> guess<00:06:22.050> what<00:06:22.349> they<00:06:22.470> do<00:06:22.530> and<00:06:22.860> stuff

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
probably guess what they do and stuff

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.219 
probably guess what they do and stuff
like<00:06:23.159> that<00:06:23.250> so<00:06:23.520> yeah<00:06:23.789> you<00:06:24.330> can<00:06:24.630> condense<00:06:25.169> your

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
like that so yeah you can condense your

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:26.930 
like that so yeah you can condense your
redstone<00:06:25.500> if<00:06:25.710> you<00:06:25.800> got<00:06:25.919> tons<00:06:26.070> of<00:06:26.159> it<00:06:26.279> and

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
redstone if you got tons of it and

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.520 
redstone if you got tons of it and
I<00:06:27.000> suppose<00:06:27.570> you<00:06:27.690> can<00:06:27.780> find<00:06:27.960> some<00:06:28.110> cool<00:06:28.290> uses

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
I suppose you can find some cool uses

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.500 
I suppose you can find some cool uses
for<00:06:28.770> these<00:06:28.860> blocks<00:06:29.160> so<00:06:29.430> anyway<00:06:29.790> this<00:06:30.300> is<00:06:30.480> the

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
for these blocks so anyway this is the

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.270 
for these blocks so anyway this is the
useful<00:06:30.690> storage<00:06:31.020> mod<00:06:31.290> there's<00:06:31.710> another<00:06:31.980> 3
