00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.360
 I hope you are super well 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:20.030
 I am very happy to see you today and 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.580
 I come well then to tell you about a 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.890
 new section that I'm going to have already know 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.630
 that I like to go changing and the day 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.180
 today we are going to talk about this section 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.800
 that is called nurturing weekly challenges the 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.629
 multi weekly challenges are going to be 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.580
 directly here on my page so that 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.950
 everyone can see these are not going to 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.620
 have no cost and I will be 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.900
 going up the nutritionists where I'm going to 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.380
 be talking about what to do during this 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.870
 week 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.090
 in this way I will be able to help them 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.710
 very general way to all of you for 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.100
 that they change certain habits 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.960
 remember that the multi weekly challenges 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.000
 nothing more let's say I'm going to give you this 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.160
 video during a day of the week for 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.500
 that you do it alone and it is very 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.899
 different from the multi challenges that I do 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.790
 normally three weeks within the 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.490
 private group you have on facebook 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.159
 these are programs where I go up 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.780
 manual I give you recipes I give them all the 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.820
 information of this nurturing challenge and in addition 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.250
 I give you your food plans in this 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.420
 case the multi weekly challenges are 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.399
 let's say that a very very summarized way 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.549
 of how can you go modifying 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.140
 their diets their way of feeding and 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.810
 start having changes very 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.280
 significant in their feeding 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.039
 so then, today 's 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.229
 fact had already gone up to the page in 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.689
 multi challenge weekly I put them for 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.509
 written and told them about the flours 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.390
 we are going to look very much during 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.209
 this week of not consuming flours 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.100
 processed or white flours these are 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:51.860
 refers to everything that is white bread 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.409
 the sweet bread the bobbles the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.450
 cakes cookies 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.149
 to some extent also obviously 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.829
 good to avoid everything that is of some 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.439
 processed way that contains flours 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.630
 like the true potatoes and all these 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.000
 types of foods that somehow 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.860
 Well, if we love them but they have 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.769
 much more obviously amount of 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.590
 chemical preservatives of sugars 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.450
 sodium fat and that do not work for us and 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.549
 they do not serve us, it has been proven that 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.930
 they have a glycemic index that is the 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.390
 speed with which they will absorb 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.700
 these these carbohydrates or these 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.170
 sugars very very fast inside 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.690
 our blood and is going to become 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.910
 glucose and remember that if we do not 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.099
 we occupy and if we do not go and we have to 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.860
 run or do an exercise of some 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.260
 way you burn these this amount of 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.690
 glucose then it ends up accumulating as 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.030
 fat if I invite you to avoid 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.280
 all this type of flours during this 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.739
 week and if they can therefore avoid it for 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.870
 always true to consume it in a very 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.180
 moderate and very occasionally and 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.150
 concentrate more on another type of 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.849
 flours or cereal such as could be the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.540
 quinoa rice that is high in protein 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.400
 and it's very home 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.849
 It has a lot of fiber we can also 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.519
 consume in oatmeal for example we can 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.200
 also consume corn as for example 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.359
 corn tortillas or toast 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.079
 baked all these are a lot 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:17.150
 best source of whole flours for 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.769
 example and even good forgiveness 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.959
 including rice we can also 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.420
 consume integral so it's good 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.549
 this is going to be your weekly challenge nourish 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.680
 to be trying to be uploading these 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.540
 many challenges on Monday morning 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.400
 now it goes up a little bit later 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.349
 but so that in this way you 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.269
 start doing during the week and I 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.609
 would love to leave me your comments 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.099
 at the end of the week how did it go? 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.139
 they could do it how they feel that 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.629
 cps do not look to see if there was any 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.220
 change and this good because that's how I 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.590
 we are going to be doing I hope that you 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.239
