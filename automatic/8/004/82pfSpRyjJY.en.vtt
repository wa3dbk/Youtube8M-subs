00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
figures you can see go and also the

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.009 
figures you can see go and also the
battery<00:03:35.019> life<00:03:35.380> is<00:03:35.739> longer<00:03:36.579> should<00:03:37.269> be<00:03:37.359> good

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.680 

that's<00:03:41.019> about<00:03:41.319> it<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:43.230> screen<00:03:44.230> and

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
that's about it the screen and

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.890 
that's about it the screen and
apparently<00:03:46.690> clicks<00:03:47.200> at<00:03:47.769> different<00:03:48.220> angles

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
apparently clicks at different angles

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.320 
apparently clicks at different angles
there<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:50.049> go

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
there you go

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.630 
there you go
-<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:51.990> old<00:03:52.170> 3ds<00:03:52.740> and<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:54.480> make<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:55.640> better

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
- the old 3ds and to make it a better

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.760 
- the old 3ds and to make it a better
viewing<00:03:57.000> angle<00:03:57.510> for<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.720> 3d<00:03:58.170> apparently<00:03:58.650> it's

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
viewing angle for the 3d apparently it's

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.310 
viewing angle for the 3d apparently it's
got<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:58.950> bigger<00:03:59.250> range<00:03:59.550> than<00:03:59.990> the<00:04:00.990> old<00:04:01.110> three

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
got a bigger range than the old three

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.020 
got a bigger range than the old three
yes<00:04:01.530> which<00:04:01.710> is<00:04:01.860> good<00:04:02.070> because<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.310> found<00:04:02.580> that<00:04:02.790> a

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
yes which is good because I found that a

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.360 
yes which is good because I found that a
bit<00:04:03.420> too<00:04:03.630> awesome<00:04:03.780> at<00:04:04.050> times<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.650> obviously

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
bit too awesome at times and obviously

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.870 
bit too awesome at times and obviously
you<00:04:05.520> get<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:05.700> 4<00:04:05.970> gigabyte<00:04:06.450> card<00:04:06.780> instead<00:04:07.110> of<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.290> 2

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
you get a 4 gigabyte card instead of a 2

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.830 
you get a 4 gigabyte card instead of a 2
so<00:04:09.020> this<00:04:10.020> is<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.290> outside<00:04:10.410> feels<00:04:11.360> really<00:04:12.360> nice

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
so this is the outside feels really nice

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.080 
so this is the outside feels really nice
and<00:04:13.140> smooth<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:14.250> it's<00:04:14.430> got<00:04:14.580> a<00:04:14.610> matte<00:04:14.880> finish

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
and smooth and it's got a matte finish

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.630 
and smooth and it's got a matte finish
unlike<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.650> original<00:04:16.739> 3d<00:04:17.250> yes<00:04:17.400> which<00:04:17.610> is

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
unlike the original 3d yes which is

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.630 
unlike the original 3d yes which is
glossy<00:04:18.380> so<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.410> lot<00:04:19.769> less<00:04:19.950> fingerprints<00:04:20.670> and

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
glossy so a lot less fingerprints and

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:31.100 
glossy so a lot less fingerprints and
same<00:04:23.640> with<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.910> back<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:30.000> stylus<00:04:30.540> is<00:04:30.840> now

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
same with the back and the stylus is now

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.840 
same with the back and the stylus is now
on<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.530> right<00:04:31.710> hand<00:04:31.740> side<00:04:31.980> run<00:04:32.400> from<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.670> top

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
on the right hand side run from the top

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.240 
on the right hand side run from the top
which<00:04:33.120> is<00:04:33.150> much<00:04:33.540> better<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.290> it's<00:04:34.710> not<00:04:34.890> metal

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
which is much better and it's not metal

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.670 
which is much better and it's not metal
so<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.820> won't<00:04:36.030> hurt<00:04:36.240> your<00:04:36.390> hands

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.330 

two<00:04:40.680> 3d<00:04:41.130> cameras<00:04:41.550> like<00:04:41.760> before<00:04:42.770> so<00:04:43.770> yeah<00:04:43.920> let's

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
two 3d cameras like before so yeah let's

buttons feel clicky

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:10.070

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
the insides mapped and there was a

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.530 
the insides mapped and there was a
problem<00:05:22.230> with<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.440> old<00:05:22.560> 3d<00:05:22.919> s's<00:05:23.400> that<00:05:24.090> when
