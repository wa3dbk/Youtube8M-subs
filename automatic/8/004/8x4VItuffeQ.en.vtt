the guys are all standing right next to
each<00:02:21.830> other<00:02:25.690> here<00:02:26.690> I'll<00:02:26.840> just<00:02:27.080> kill<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.680> one

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
each other here I'll just kill this one

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.660 
each other here I'll just kill this one
guy<00:02:28.310> with<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.850> mark<00:02:29.360> regular<00:02:30.020> attack<00:02:30.670> send

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
guy with the mark regular attack send

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.720 
guy with the mark regular attack send
them<00:02:31.820> off<00:02:31.940> switch<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:36.440> this<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.680> his<00:02:37.040> rapier

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
them off switch so this is his rapier

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.660 
them off switch so this is his rapier
which<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.630> imagine<00:02:38.930> does<00:02:39.500> multiple<00:02:40.070> hits<00:02:40.280> that

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
which I imagine does multiple hits that
