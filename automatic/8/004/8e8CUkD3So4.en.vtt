00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.260

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.820

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.820
 I'm in a neon fever and I have the way 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.390
 New day and I thought the flamingo 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.120
 I would have stood up I found it 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.229
 Just a nice change of color 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.229
 could give me little feedback if 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:54.890
 you want or yes and that's it 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:56.330
 to change glassware that is 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.030
 to make a small vase out of it 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.589
 this is a normal simple glass 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.030
 as you know it from every custody business 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.140
 And what we need is a glass 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.159
 Household rubbers so rubbers for the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.270
 You get household in the drugstore and 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.020
 neon colors I love and I totally stand 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.220
 on seas and with these two colors 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.710
 can you do the following? 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.049
 we take our glass vessel eighth on it 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.509
 please that you if you with spray paint 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:28.729
 that works outside and that you do 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:30.140
 then make sure that everything 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.299
 is protected and does not claim anything 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.950
 this i have taken small rubbers 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.710
 and with such small rubbers worked 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.850
 Do not trick so well I have the big ones 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.100
 should take and then not so 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.420
 overlapping I have unfortunately such a 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.890
 little bit overlapping you did 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.999
 Just take it then I'll show it to you 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.020
 no moment you take your glass 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:55.039
 takes elastics grabs the glass into 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.420
 around and how exactly or in what amount 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.670
 you want that you can do that then 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.829
 play so fair that it is so wavy 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.079
 and then the faces are definitely good 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.280
 off and then one more and as and when 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.119
 how many you want you can do that 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.910
 to do 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.710
 and that protects the glass from the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.720
 paint color you put that over 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.610
 head take your spray paint and spray 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.830
 All this is really nice in the country 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.390
 Dry dry and the great thing is that 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.080
 this trail color dries 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.090
 so then you have your glasses here 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.720
 look really stylish and I have to 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.310
 say look at the thick rubber bands 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.990
 that is much easier 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.400
 a lot of clean as if you were with 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.040
 The little one I can find it now 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.570
 not so bad but it definitely works 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.450
 more beautiful as here it is all so 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.550
 nice clean smooth I like that well 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.010
 is the do it yourself tip for you 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.810
 This time you can put in candles you 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.209
 can use as a vase you can yours 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.670
 cosmetics brush clean up donor 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.100
 the desk but so you can half 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.230
 these simple boring glasses like that 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.340
 aufpimpen and so even make the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.120
 is again stylish 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.700
 and quite honestly it does 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.100
 whether the glass was so boring 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.810
 is or in these colors so if 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.280

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.050
