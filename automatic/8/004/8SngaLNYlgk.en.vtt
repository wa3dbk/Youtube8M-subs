00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
accuracy pretty decent it's not the best

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.580

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
but its top it's a pretty good one and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.039 
but its top it's a pretty good one and
it<00:01:43.590> only<00:01:43.829> goes<00:01:44.100> up<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.340> 65<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.840> got<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it only goes up to 65 then you got the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.950 
it only goes up to 65 then you got the
MSMC<00:01:46.500> goes<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.159> 30<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.939> starts<00:01:48.270> from<00:01:48.329> 30<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
MSMC goes to 30 it starts from 30 and it

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.929 
MSMC goes to 30 it starts from 30 and it
goes<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.200> 40<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:50.399> got<00:01:50.549> all<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> other

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
goes to 40 and they got all the other

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.060 
goes to 40 and they got all the other
guns<00:01:51.090> 30<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.600> 40<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.110> increases<00:01:52.530> about<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> like

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
guns 30 to 40 so increases about to like

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.649 
guns 30 to 40 so increases about to like
thirty<00:01:53.369> percent<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.060> extended<00:01:54.509> mags

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
thirty percent the extended mags

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.899 
thirty percent the extended mags
attachment<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.290> then<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.130> fast<00:01:56.340> mags<00:01:56.640> is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
attachment and then the fast mags is

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.480 
attachment and then the fast mags is
like<00:01:57.210> bootleg<00:01:57.450> sleight<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.840> hand<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.829> reloads

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
like bootleg sleight of hand it reloads

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.260 
like bootleg sleight of hand it reloads
fast<00:01:59.990> every<00:02:00.990> time<00:02:01.399> but<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.460> heard<00:02:02.939> that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
fast every time but I heard that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
fast every time but I heard that
sometimes<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.140> doesn't<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.860> don't<00:02:05.219> know<00:02:05.310> if

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
sometimes it doesn't I don't know if

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.789 
sometimes it doesn't I don't know if
it's<00:02:05.549> some<00:02:05.729> glitch<00:02:06.119> um<00:02:06.560> something<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.680> that

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
it's some glitch um something like that

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.559 
it's some glitch um something like that
like<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.250> dual<00:02:08.489> mag<00:02:08.700> that's<00:02:08.970> every<00:02:09.360> other

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
like is the dual mag that's every other

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.930 
like is the dual mag that's every other
I<00:02:10.319> haven't<00:02:10.920> really<00:02:11.220> looked<00:02:11.370> into<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.819> too<00:02:11.910> much

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
I haven't really looked into it too much

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.850 
I haven't really looked into it too much
I<00:02:12.300> might<00:02:12.810> make<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.989> video<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.560> you

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
anyways I play this map because you has

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.760 
anyways I play this map because you has
seen<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.510> map<00:02:30.720> there's<00:02:31.110> two<00:02:31.380> windows

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
seen this map there's two windows

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.650 
seen this map there's two windows
looking<00:02:32.070> at<00:02:32.190> B<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.640> playing<00:02:32.850> domination<00:02:33.450> so

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
looking at B and playing domination so

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.170 
looking at B and playing domination so
whenever<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.080> try<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.350> hop<00:02:34.530> on<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.770> middle<00:02:35.180> it's

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
whenever I try to hop on the middle it's

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.820 
whenever I try to hop on the middle it's
like<00:02:36.360> instant<00:02:36.720> death<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.110> reminds<00:02:37.410> me<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> lot

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
like instant death it reminds me a lot

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.090 
like instant death it reminds me a lot
of<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.250> map<00:02:38.460> a<00:02:38.640> cracked<00:02:39.800> doesn't<00:02:40.800> look<00:02:40.890> like

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
of the map a cracked doesn't look like

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.070 
of the map a cracked doesn't look like
the<00:02:41.220> map<00:02:41.370> cracked<00:02:41.700> at<00:02:41.850> all<00:02:41.970> but<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.660> design

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
the map cracked at all but the design

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.130 
the map cracked at all but the design
that<00:02:43.410> there's<00:02:43.590> two<00:02:43.860> windows<00:02:44.630> like<00:02:45.630> looking<00:02:46.050> at

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
that there's two windows like looking at

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.230 
that there's two windows like looking at
each<00:02:46.290> other<00:02:46.440> on<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.100> B<00:02:47.250> flag<00:02:47.550> it's<00:02:47.820> hard<00:02:48.180> to

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
each other on the B flag it's hard to

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.430 
each other on the B flag it's hard to
get<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.480> B<00:02:48.600> flight<00:02:48.810> because<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.290> got<00:02:49.410> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
get the B flight because you got the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.680 
get the B flight because you got the
snipers<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:50.310> sit<00:02:50.520> there<00:02:50.700> with<00:02:51.570> the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
snipers that just sit there with the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.840 
snipers that just sit there with the
bouncing<00:02:52.050> Betties<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:53.190> shock<00:02:53.430> charges

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
bouncing Betties and the shock charges

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.580 
bouncing Betties and the shock charges
that's<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.300> right<00:02:54.570> there<00:02:54.630> just<00:02:55.050> chill<00:02:55.410> there

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
that's it right there just chill there

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.410 
that's it right there just chill there
the<00:02:55.709> whole<00:02:55.860> game<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.370> they<00:02:56.910> have<00:02:57.060> fun<00:02:57.270> like

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
the whole game and they have fun like

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.530 
the whole game and they have fun like
that<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.530> try<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.310> avoid<00:02:59.640> the<00:03:00.150> middle<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.480> the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
that so I try to avoid the middle of the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.180 
that so I try to avoid the middle of the
map<00:03:00.690> unless<00:03:01.020> we're<00:03:01.230> losing<00:03:01.560> but<00:03:01.770> in<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:01.980> case

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
map unless we're losing but in this case

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.340 
map unless we're losing but in this case
we<00:03:02.430> were<00:03:02.580> triple<00:03:02.970> capping<00:03:03.300> for<00:03:03.840> three<00:03:04.140> minutes

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
we were triple capping for three minutes

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.410 
we were triple capping for three minutes
of<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.770> game<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.430> could<00:03:05.640> have<00:03:05.730> been<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.850> 100k

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
of this game this could have been a 100k

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.800 
of this game this could have been a 100k
d<00:03:06.480> game<00:03:07.250> it's<00:03:08.250> one<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.520> those<00:03:08.610> games<00:03:08.760> where<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
d game it's one of those games where the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.600 
d game it's one of those games where the
servers<00:03:10.230> were<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.560> fucked<00:03:10.830> up<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.190> no<00:03:11.489> one

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
servers were so fucked up that no one

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.979 
servers were so fucked up that no one
connected<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.239> they'll<00:03:12.420> back<00:03:12.630> out<00:03:12.840> and

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
connected so they'll back out and

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.180 
connected so they'll back out and
there's<00:03:13.170> like<00:03:13.320> two<00:03:13.470> guys<00:03:13.620> on<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.890> enemy<00:03:14.040> team

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
there's like two guys on the enemy team

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.810 
there's like two guys on the enemy team
one<00:03:14.910> or<00:03:15.150> there<00:03:15.630> was<00:03:15.750> zero<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.430> we<00:03:17.430> were<00:03:17.489> triple

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
one or there was zero and we were triple

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.160 
one or there was zero and we were triple
capping<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.330> you're<00:03:18.510> just<00:03:18.660> gaining<00:03:18.900> points

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
capping so you're just gaining points

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.420 
capping so you're just gaining points
left<00:03:19.470> in<00:03:19.620> where<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.769> think<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.040> finish<00:03:20.310> this

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
left in where I think we finish this

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.360 
left in where I think we finish this
round<00:03:20.640> with<00:03:21.150> like<00:03:21.299> 120<00:03:22.110> points<00:03:22.320> some<00:03:23.160> are<00:03:23.280> on

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
round with like 120 points some are on

hundred<00:04:37.340> plus<00:04:37.610> it<00:04:38.479> didn't<00:04:38.720> get<00:04:38.840> too<00:04:38.960> much<00:04:38.990> view

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
so you know I wish I think this reason

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.719 
so you know I wish I think this reason
was<00:04:42.349> because<00:04:42.530> I<00:04:42.830> uploaded<00:04:43.159> at<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.430> weirdest

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
was because I uploaded at the weirdest

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.879 
was because I uploaded at the weirdest
time<00:04:43.909> because<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.210> normally<00:04:44.599> upload<00:04:44.889> earlier

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
time because I normally upload earlier

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.339
