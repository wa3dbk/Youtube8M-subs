watch<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.900> video<00:01:37.110> you're<00:01:37.950> actually<00:01:38.250> clicking

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
watch the video you're actually clicking

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.140 
watch the video you're actually clicking
on<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> rogue<00:01:39.920> application<00:01:40.920> through<00:01:41.640> facebook

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
on a rogue application through facebook

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:51.639 
on a rogue application through facebook
which<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:44.869> not<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:48.409> very<00:01:49.409> very<00:01:50.399> nice<00:01:50.610> and

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
which is not really very very nice and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.490 
which is not really very very nice and
so<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.670> origin<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.600> would<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.079> somewhere

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so the origin of this would be somewhere

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.620 
so the origin of this would be somewhere
in<00:01:55.530> october<00:01:56.130> 2013<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.360> something

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
in october 2013 so it's really something

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.999 
in october 2013 so it's really something
that's<00:01:57.960> happened<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.740> last<00:02:00.680> month<00:02:01.680> or<00:02:01.950> so

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
that's happened in the last month or so

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.880 
that's happened in the last month or so
and<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:03.090> quite<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> new<00:02:03.840> one<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.439> might
