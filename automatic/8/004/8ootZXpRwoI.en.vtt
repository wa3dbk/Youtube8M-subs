go into pipe in this I'm going to add in
the<00:02:01.390> tree<00:02:01.630> spread<00:02:01.960> so<00:02:02.500> we<00:02:02.680> have<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:02.890> G<00:02:03.190> spread<00:02:03.550> as

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
the tree spread so we have a G spread as

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.370 
the tree spread so we have a G spread as
you<00:02:03.970> can<00:02:04.150> see<00:02:04.330> it's<00:02:04.600> of<00:02:04.870> a<00:02:04.960> thick<00:02:05.230> consistency

you can see it's of a thick consistency
the<00:02:06.310> reason<00:02:06.640> is<00:02:06.820> that<00:02:07.080> we<00:02:08.080> need<00:02:08.260> to<00:02:08.290> pipe<00:02:08.710> it

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
the reason is that we need to pipe it

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.400 
the reason is that we need to pipe it
and<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.310> has<00:02:09.520> to<00:02:09.550> stay<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.180> the<00:02:10.330> crack<00:02:10.540> rock<00:02:10.750> now

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
and it has to stay on the crack rock now

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.730 
and it has to stay on the crack rock now
this<00:02:12.160> is<00:02:12.220> one<00:02:12.550> bit<00:02:12.820> that<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:14.020> am<00:02:14.140> sure<00:02:14.320> your<00:02:14.470> kids

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
are going to work as the eyes like I

told you and the green olives are going
to<00:02:54.459> be<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.700> mustache<00:02:55.150> now<00:02:55.810> exactly<00:02:56.140> the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
to be the mustache now exactly the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.750 
to be the mustache now exactly the
mustache<00:02:56.769> but<00:02:56.920> something<00:02:57.340> like<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.489> mouth

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
mustache but something like a mouth

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.110 
mustache but something like a mouth
right<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:59.140> our<00:02:59.709> Santa<00:03:00.220> can't<00:03:00.459> have<00:03:00.640> such<00:03:00.910> big

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
right so our Santa can't have such big

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.940 
right so our Santa can't have such big
eyes<00:03:01.300> I'm<00:03:01.630> going<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.470> make<00:03:02.620> really<00:03:02.920> small

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
eyes I'm going to make really small

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.490 
eyes I'm going to make really small
triangles<00:03:03.760> out<00:03:03.880> of<00:03:04.030> these<00:03:04.209> so<00:03:04.780> basically<00:03:05.170> take

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
triangles out of these so basically take

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.850 
triangles out of these so basically take
in<00:03:05.680> order<00:03:06.090> cut<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.209> into<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.450> moon<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.080> just

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
in order cut it into a moon and just

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.120 
in order cut it into a moon and just
chop<00:03:09.430> out<00:03:09.700> tiny<00:03:10.269> tiny<00:03:10.480> pieces<00:03:11.019> so<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.650> think<00:03:11.860> I

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
chop out tiny tiny pieces so I think I

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.250 
chop out tiny tiny pieces so I think I
have<00:03:12.250> enough<00:03:12.280> ice<00:03:12.700> for<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:13.000> Santa<00:03:13.510> now<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:13.959> new

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
of half and another half this should be

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.340 
of half and another half this should be
enough<00:03:27.070> for<00:03:27.220> now<00:03:27.430> ok<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:28.510> here<00:03:28.750> we<00:03:28.960> have<00:03:28.990> these

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
ready it's assembly time so a cracker

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.470 
ready it's assembly time so a cracker
biscuit<00:03:35.830> let's<00:03:36.220> just<00:03:36.400> take<00:03:36.580> three<00:03:36.820> and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
biscuit let's just take three and

ok<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:42.970> this<00:03:43.180> cheese<00:03:43.570> is<00:03:44.790> going<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.940> act<00:03:46.240> as<00:03:46.450> a

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
ok so this cheese is going to act as a

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.230 
ok so this cheese is going to act as a
glue<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:47.860> I<00:03:47.890> have<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.250> chip<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:48.910> have<00:03:49.030> my

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
glue so I have a chip and I have my

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.510 
glue so I have a chip and I have my
crack<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.600> biscuits<00:03:50.020> so<00:03:50.650> this<00:03:50.830> chip<00:03:51.100> will

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
crack of biscuits so this chip will

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.690 
crack of biscuits so this chip will
become<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:51.910> Hat<00:03:52.300> so<00:03:53.170> using<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.220> cheese<00:03:54.460> as<00:03:54.670> a

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
become the Hat so using a cheese as a

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.940 
become the Hat so using a cheese as a
sticky<00:03:55.120> glue<00:03:55.330> I'm<00:03:55.600> going<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.170> pipe<00:03:56.410> in<00:03:56.650> some

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
sticky glue I'm going to pipe in some

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.870 
sticky glue I'm going to pipe in some
cheese<00:03:57.570> not<00:03:58.570> too<00:03:58.750> much<00:03:58.930> but<00:03:59.230> just<00:03:59.290> enough<00:03:59.880> so
