when<00:00:00.450> you<00:00:00.539> buy<00:00:00.659> one<00:00:00.690> of<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.079> new<00:00:01.230> power<00:00:01.469> candy

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
when you buy one of the new power candy

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.070 
when you buy one of the new power candy
trolleys<00:00:02.129> from<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.639> f/w<00:00:02.909> range<00:00:03.360> there's<00:00:03.990> a

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
trolleys from the f/w range there's a

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.749 
trolleys from the f/w range there's a
choice<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.529> four<00:00:04.770> batteries<00:00:05.190> with<00:00:05.430> each<00:00:05.549> of

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
choice of four batteries with each of

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.290 
choice of four batteries with each of
them<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.810> starting<00:00:07.290> price<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.730> lead<00:00:08.910> acid

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
them the starting price is the lead acid

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.240 
them the starting price is the lead acid
so<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.230> starting<00:00:10.559> price<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.040> trolley

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
so the starting price of the trolley

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.690 
so the starting price of the trolley
will<00:00:11.490> include<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.179> along<00:00:12.809> with<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.019> charger

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
will include that along with the charger

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.029 
will include that along with the charger
this<00:00:14.700> features<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.240> plug-and-play<00:00:15.480> system

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
this features the plug-and-play system

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.410 
this features the plug-and-play system
so<00:00:17.039> basically<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.520> can<00:00:17.670> hook<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.029> into<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
so basically you can hook it into the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.260 
so basically you can hook it into the
trolley<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.680> drops<00:00:20.010> into<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.340> tray<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
trolley it drops into the tray and the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.450 
trolley it drops into the tray and the
connections<00:00:21.750> are<00:00:21.869> automatically<00:00:22.439> made<00:00:22.680> so

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
connections are automatically made so

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.679 
connections are automatically made so
there's<00:00:23.609> no<00:00:23.730> leads<00:00:24.029> or<00:00:24.180> anything<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.630> that

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
there's no leads or anything like that

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.080 
there's no leads or anything like that
on<00:00:24.990> show<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:26.010> standard<00:00:26.460> battery<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.849> fairly

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
on show the standard battery is fairly

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.320 
on show the standard battery is fairly
heavy<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:27.720> seven<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> half<00:00:28.170> kilograms

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
heavy it's seven and a half kilograms

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.759 
heavy it's seven and a half kilograms
but<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.480> good<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:30.840> 18<00:00:31.080> holes<00:00:31.109> around<00:00:31.619> any

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
but it's good for 18 holes around any

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.850 
but it's good for 18 holes around any
course<00:00:32.360> for<00:00:33.360> an<00:00:33.420> extra<00:00:33.660> thirty<00:00:33.899> pound<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.829> can

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
course for an extra thirty pound you can

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.400 
course for an extra thirty pound you can
upgrade<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.670> extended<00:00:36.180> lead<00:00:36.390> acid<00:00:36.780> which

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
upgrade to the extended lead acid which

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.139 
upgrade to the extended lead acid which
as<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.770> see<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> bit<00:00:38.250> bigger<00:00:38.460> it's

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
as you can see is a bit bigger it's

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.819 
as you can see is a bit bigger it's
quite<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> bit<00:00:39.600> heavier<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.350> ten<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> half

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
quite a bit heavier it's ten and a half

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.369 
quite a bit heavier it's ten and a half
kilograms<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.390> too<00:00:42.600> heavy<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.110> case

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
kilograms and it's too heavy for a case

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.160 
kilograms and it's too heavy for a case
so<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.640> comes<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.000> nylon<00:00:45.239> case<00:00:45.809> and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
so it just comes with a nylon case and

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.350 
so it just comes with a nylon case and
it<00:00:46.800> comes<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.160> wire<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.760> plug<00:00:47.969> into<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it comes with a wire to plug into the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.510 
it comes with a wire to plug into the
trolley<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.710> lose<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> benefit

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
trolley so you kind of lose the benefit

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.590 
trolley so you kind of lose the benefit
of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> plug<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.090> play

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
of the plug and play

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.110 
of the plug and play
it<00:00:52.559> also<00:00:52.770> comes<00:00:53.129> supplied<00:00:53.399> with<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> battery

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it also comes supplied with a battery

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.760 
it also comes supplied with a battery
tray<00:00:54.390> which<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.079> need<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.350> put<00:00:55.500> into<00:00:55.620> the

lithium's<00:00:59.820> are<00:01:00.000> becoming<00:01:00.239> increasingly

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
lithium's are becoming increasingly

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.810 
lithium's are becoming increasingly
popular<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.559> trolleys<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.640> there's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
popular on the trolleys and there's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
popular on the trolleys and there's
quite<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> lot<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.210> advantages<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> them<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
quite a lot of advantages to them the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.539 
quite a lot of advantages to them the
18-hole<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:05.880> shown<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.680> does<00:01:07.680> add<00:01:07.890> 150

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
18-hole one shown here does add 150

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.850 
18-hole one shown here does add 150
pounds<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> cost<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.439> only<00:01:10.560> two

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
pounds to the cost but it's only two

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.520 
pounds to the cost but it's only two
kilograms<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.240> almost<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.750> quarter<00:01:13.290> of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
kilograms so it's almost a quarter of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.670 
kilograms so it's almost a quarter of
the<00:01:14.130> weight<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.700> 18-hole<00:01:15.240> led<00:01:15.420> acid<00:01:15.780> it's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
the weight of the 18-hole led acid it's

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.760 
the weight of the 18-hole led acid it's
much<00:01:16.950> smaller<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.450> life<00:01:18.900> expectancy<00:01:19.320> is

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
much smaller and the life expectancy is

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.520 
much smaller and the life expectancy is
far<00:01:20.040> better<00:01:20.630> whereas<00:01:21.630> these<00:01:21.810> two<00:01:22.080> come<00:01:22.350> with<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
far better whereas these two come with a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.890 
far better whereas these two come with a
year<00:01:22.799> warranty<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:24.060> comes<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> two<00:01:24.869> year

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
year warranty this comes with a two year

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.679 
year warranty this comes with a two year
full<00:01:25.350> warranty<00:01:25.520> plus<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> further<00:01:26.970> three<00:01:27.390> years

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
full warranty plus a further three years

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.020 
full warranty plus a further three years
at<00:01:27.930> discounted<00:01:28.500> rate<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.430> you'd<00:01:29.549> expect<00:01:29.939> to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
at discounted rate so you'd expect to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.609 
at discounted rate so you'd expect to
get<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> much<00:01:30.420> better<00:01:30.600> lifespan<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.470> this

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
get a much better lifespan out of this

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.190 
get a much better lifespan out of this
and<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.610> will<00:01:32.820> comfortably<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.540> 18<00:01:33.930> holes

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and that will comfortably do 18 holes

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.649 
and that will comfortably do 18 holes
around<00:01:34.409> any<00:01:34.740> course<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:36.000> as<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.390> see

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
around any course and as you can see

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.140 
around any course and as you can see
it's<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:37.680> neat<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.310> flush<00:01:38.610> into<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
it's it's really neat and flush into the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.370 
it's it's really neat and flush into the
trolley<00:01:40.460> finally<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:42.150> an<00:01:42.210> extra<00:01:42.509> 200<00:01:43.140> pound

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
trolley finally for an extra 200 pound

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.160 
trolley finally for an extra 200 pound
over<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> starting<00:01:44.369> price<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.540> another<00:01:45.810> 50

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
over the starting price so another 50
