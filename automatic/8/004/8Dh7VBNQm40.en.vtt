is<00:01:19.539> the<00:01:19.599> first<00:01:19.840> frame<00:01:27.209> so<00:01:28.209> first<00:01:28.780> we<00:01:28.869> want<00:01:29.020> to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
is the first frame so first we want to

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.070 
is the first frame so first we want to
do<00:01:29.200> is<00:01:29.500> see<00:01:29.830> save<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.360> then<00:01:31.599> the<00:01:31.840> file<00:01:32.050> name

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
do is see save and then the file name

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.660 
do is see save and then the file name
let's<00:01:32.440> just<00:01:32.679> have<00:01:32.800> teen<00:01:33.099> just<00:01:33.399> so<00:01:33.520> it's

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
let's just have teen just so it's

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.559 
let's just have teen just so it's
quickly<00:01:34.110> easier<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.649> do<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.729> now<00:01:37.330> let's

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
quickly easier to do and now let's

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.419 
quickly easier to do and now let's
modify<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:38.170> so<00:01:38.619> that's<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.920> first<00:01:38.950> frame

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
modify it so that's the first frame

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.400 
modify it so that's the first frame
that's<00:01:39.670> what<00:01:39.819> run<00:01:40.000> apply<00:01:40.270> this<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:41.229> get<00:01:41.349> the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
that's what run apply this to get the

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.170 
that's what run apply this to get the
second<00:01:41.709> frame<00:01:41.979> so<00:01:43.170> yes

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
second frame so yes

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.270 
second frame so yes
at<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.690> circle<00:01:46.170> appears<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.070> middle

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
at the circle appears here in the middle

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.970 
at the circle appears here in the middle
then<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.270> do<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.600> save<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.740> same

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
then we do see save and then the same

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.730 
then we do see save and then the same
thing<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.910> see<00:01:51.150> safety<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.470> would<00:01:52.620> be

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
thing so see safety and that would be

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.830 
thing so see safety and that would be
frame<00:01:53.010> number<00:01:53.220> two<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:54.420> then<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:54.660> can<00:01:54.780> edit

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
frame number two and then we can edit

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.320 
frame number two and then we can edit
this<00:01:55.080> again<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.920> let's<00:01:56.100> make<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> cycle<00:01:57.150> bit

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
this again so let's make the cycle bit

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:07.520 
this again so let's make the cycle bit
bigger<00:02:02.480> Jesus<00:02:03.510> yes<00:02:04.310> do<00:02:05.310> see<00:02:05.550> save<00:02:05.850> T<00:02:06.300> and<00:02:06.930> then

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
bigger Jesus yes do see save T and then

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.830 
bigger Jesus yes do see save T and then
we<00:02:08.130> can<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.300> change<00:02:09.660> what

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
we can do that we can just change what

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.770 
we can do that we can just change what
we<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.850> let's<00:02:11.850> have<00:02:12.030> these<00:02:12.180> things<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.630> the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
we like let's have these things in the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.430 
we like let's have these things in the
end<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.140> all<00:02:13.230> they<00:02:13.350> are<00:02:13.500> do<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:16.110> can<00:02:16.290> see

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.110 
end of it all they are do it you can see
you<00:02:16.530> could<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.830> do<00:02:17.040> whatever<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.340> like<00:02:17.400> with

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
you could just do whatever you like with

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.500 
you could just do whatever you like with
the<00:02:18.360> frame<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:20.220> can<00:02:20.340> change<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.760> totally<00:02:21.150> or

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
the frame you can change it totally or

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.280 
the frame you can change it totally or
just<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.900> bit<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.290> as<00:02:23.130> long<00:02:23.250> as<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.490> do<00:02:23.610> is

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
just a bit of it as long as you do is

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.580 
just a bit of it as long as you do is
see<00:02:25.290> same<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.040> then<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.450> see<00:02:27.690> safer<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.440> now

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
see same and then it so see safer so now

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.199 
see same and then it so see safer so now
we've<00:02:28.709> got<00:02:28.830> four<00:02:29.040> frames<00:02:29.810> but<00:02:30.810> once<00:02:30.959> we've<00:02:31.170> got

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
we've got four frames but once we've got

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.610 
we've got four frames but once we've got
all<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.330> frames<00:02:33.540> at<00:02:33.720> one<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:34.080> can<00:02:34.260> have<00:02:34.530> as

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
all the frames at one we can have as

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.800 
all the frames at one we can have as
many<00:02:34.740> friends<00:02:35.070> as<00:02:35.250> we<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.940> then<00:02:36.630> we<00:02:36.660> do

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
many friends as we like but then we do

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.470 
many friends as we like but then we do
see<00:02:37.080> play<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.780> then<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.020> IDs<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:41.180> let's<00:02:42.180> have

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
see play and then the IDs so let's have

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.220 
see play and then the IDs so let's have
the<00:02:42.540> ID<00:02:42.840> as<00:02:44.690> zero<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:48.120> file<00:02:48.360> name<00:02:48.630> will<00:02:48.990> have

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
the ID as zero the file name will have

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.380 
the ID as zero the file name will have
was<00:02:49.650> T<00:02:50.720> sets<00:02:51.810> err<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:52.970> whether<00:02:53.970> or<00:02:54.060> not<00:02:54.180> you

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
was T sets err so whether or not you

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.190 
was T sets err so whether or not you
want<00:02:54.570> air<00:02:54.810> or<00:02:54.959> not<00:02:55.340> so<00:02:56.570> let's<00:02:57.570> have<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.810> zero

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
want air or not so let's have that zero

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.800 
want air or not so let's have that zero
the<00:02:58.950> play<00:02:59.190> count<00:02:59.550> this<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.209> how<00:03:00.390> many<00:03:00.570> times

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
the play count this is how many times

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.570 
the play count this is how many times
will<00:03:00.989> play<00:03:01.320> until<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.739> automatically<00:03:02.190> stops

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
will play until it automatically stops

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.979 
will play until it automatically stops
let's<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.690> have<00:03:03.870> for<00:03:04.380> this<00:03:04.709> example<00:03:05.989> restore

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
let's just have for this example restore

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.729 
let's just have for this example restore
after<00:03:07.380> stop<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:09.209> true<00:03:09.570> or<00:03:09.600> false<00:03:09.870> for<00:03:10.140> not<00:03:10.410> so

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
after stop so true or false for not so

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.030 
after stop so true or false for not so
zero<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.810> then<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.080> Fame<00:03:13.380> duration

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
zero so that and then the Fame duration

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.100 
zero so that and then the Fame duration
in<00:03:14.160> milliseconds<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.750> how<00:03:15.870> long<00:03:16.080> each

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
in milliseconds so this is how long each

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.770 
in milliseconds so this is how long each
frame<00:03:16.560> will<00:03:16.800> appear<00:03:17.190> for<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:18.330> 20<00:03:20.390> that's<00:03:21.390> not

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
frame will appear for so 20 that's not

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.750 
frame will appear for so 20 that's not
right<00:03:22.050> this<00:03:22.350> says<00:03:22.560> just<00:03:22.590> have<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.250> base<00:03:23.550> a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
right this says just have a base a

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.690 
right this says just have a base a
thousand<00:03:24.260> lire<00:03:25.260> seconds<00:03:25.739> in<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:25.980> second<00:03:26.430> so

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
thousand lire seconds in the second so

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.570 
thousand lire seconds in the second so
let's<00:03:26.820> just<00:03:27.060> have<00:03:27.180> one<00:03:27.209> second<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.840> frame<00:03:28.580> all

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
let's just have one second a frame all

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.610 
let's just have one second a frame all
right<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:29.940> now<00:03:30.060> we've<00:03:30.209> started<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.750> we<00:03:31.049> fly<00:03:31.590> up

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
right so now we've started it we fly up

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.140 
right so now we've started it we fly up
here<00:03:31.920> know<00:03:32.670> as<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.330> can<00:03:33.390> see<00:03:33.660> our<00:03:33.900> pattern

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
here know as you can see our pattern

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.940 
here know as you can see our pattern
he's<00:03:36.150> a

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
he's a

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.160 
he's a
there<00:03:37.760> we<00:03:37.849> go<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.420> now<00:03:38.450> I<00:03:38.630> was<00:03:38.690> going<00:03:38.900> for<00:03:39.110> a

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
there we go so now I was going for a

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.130 
there we go so now I was going for a
loop<00:03:39.500> for<00:03:39.800> all<00:03:39.890> times<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:41.230> then<00:03:43.060> we'll<00:03:44.140> stop

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
loop for all times and then we'll stop

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.559 
loop for all times and then we'll stop
there<00:03:46.099> we<00:03:46.160> go<00:03:46.280> no<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:46.459> I<00:03:46.730> do<00:03:46.880> believe<00:03:47.330> this

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
there we go no I I do believe this

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:48.850 
there we go no I I do believe this
doesn't<00:03:47.900> work<00:03:48.020> just<00:03:48.200> for<00:03:48.319> too<00:03:48.470> much<00:03:48.650> dude

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
doesn't work just for too much dude

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.350 
doesn't work just for too much dude
they're<00:03:49.099> two<00:03:49.370> dimensional<00:03:49.910> buildings<00:03:50.239> it

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
they're two dimensional buildings it

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.059 
they're two dimensional buildings it
does<00:03:50.480> work<00:03:50.660> with<00:03:51.410> 3d<00:03:51.830> as<00:03:51.920> well<00:03:52.099> so<00:03:52.400> if<00:03:52.459> we

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
does work with 3d as well so if we

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.010 
does work with 3d as well so if we
silence<00:03:55.069> I<00:03:55.340> do<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:55.880> haven't<00:03:56.330> done<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.630> area<00:03:56.870> for

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
silence I do I haven't done the area for

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.370 
silence I do I haven't done the area for
that<00:03:57.140> no<00:03:58.300> so<00:03:59.300> we<00:03:59.510> would<00:03:59.600> have<00:03:59.690> to<00:03:59.870> make<00:04:00.110> a<00:04:00.170> new

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
that no so we would have to make a new

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.900 
that no so we would have to make a new
area<00:04:00.560> but<00:04:00.890> what<00:04:00.980> we<00:04:01.069> can<00:04:01.190> do<00:04:01.310> we<00:04:01.459> can<00:04:01.489> go<00:04:01.700> down

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
area but what we can do we can go down

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.229 
area but what we can do we can go down
actually<00:04:02.920> this<00:04:03.920> was<00:04:04.760> just<00:04:05.140> came<00:04:06.140> out<00:04:06.380> this

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
actually this was just came out this

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.840 
actually this was just came out this
well<00:04:08.239> that<00:04:08.510> won't<00:04:08.630> change<00:04:08.720> both<00:04:09.170> okay<00:04:09.850> see

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
well that won't change both okay see

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.910 
well that won't change both okay see
stays<00:04:12.310> she<00:04:13.310> wasn't<00:04:13.610> it<00:04:14.350> so<00:04:15.350> now<00:04:15.470> we<00:04:15.500> do<00:04:15.680> see

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
stays she wasn't it so now we do see

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.039 
stays she wasn't it so now we do see
play<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:18.260> ideas<00:04:18.680> of<00:04:18.799> zero<00:04:19.100> game<00:04:19.340> T<00:04:19.760> zero<00:04:20.630> play

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
play the ideas of zero game T zero play

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.219 
play the ideas of zero game T zero play
count<00:04:21.350> to<00:04:21.739> three<00:04:22.070> this<00:04:22.160> time<00:04:22.540> zero<00:04:23.540> and<00:04:24.080> then

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
count to three this time zero and then

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.840 
count to three this time zero and then
let's<00:04:24.650> make<00:04:24.800> it<00:04:24.830> a<00:04:24.950> bit<00:04:24.979> faster<00:04:25.250> let's<00:04:25.669> make<00:04:25.820> it

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
let's make it a bit faster let's make it

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.920 
let's make it a bit faster let's make it
twice<00:04:26.540> as<00:04:26.600> fast<00:04:26.870> 500<00:04:27.970> now<00:04:28.970> you<00:04:29.479> can<00:04:29.630> see<00:04:29.840> it

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
twice as fast 500 now you can see it

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.360 
twice as fast 500 now you can see it
change<00:04:30.229> and<00:04:30.500> we'll<00:04:30.680> go<00:04:30.770> down<00:04:30.979> there<00:04:31.190> as<00:04:31.340> well

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
change and we'll go down there as well

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.370 
change and we'll go down there as well
