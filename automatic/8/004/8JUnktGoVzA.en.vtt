00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.450
 Hello 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.730
 to start I will use max trouw 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.199
 cream this is a moisturizing cream that 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.480
 will help me prepare my skin for the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.580
 makeup leaves an iridescent finish 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.560
 what help to be able to create more 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.710
 lighting below our base of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.710
 makeup 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.230
 like in my makeup base I'm going to 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.960
 use anything that studies spit on 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.540
 I'm going to apply this with a 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.660
 duo fiver brush previously wetted 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.760
 with fix plan remember to explore as 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.070
 I commented on the last video has 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.450
 glycerin in addition to vitamins and 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.950
 minerals that will help them to 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.950
 our makeup lasts a lot more 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.590
 to correct besides illuminate used 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.880
 a chancellor of marc this environment nw 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.190
 of the council I will apply for 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.470
 correct under the eyes and I'm going to 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.570
 Apply to light in the most areas 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.790
 high of the face this means in 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.420
 account the analysis on the lip 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.910
 upper on the chin on the forehead 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.830
 and towards the pongos this is going to help 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.050
 give more light and will give more shape to 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.280
 our face everything I will blur with 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.280
 a visible in green creek 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.720
 now comes the interesting part I'm going to 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.380
 use a corrector palette and 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.329
 contour and cream of city college 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.579
 the cream outline that comes in this 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.969
 palette is my favorite is a coffee color 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.350
 super dark with grayish tones this is 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.380
 very important when using the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.630
 outline without cream since the outline 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.799
 it should always be in a grayish tone and 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.799
 not in warm colors 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.710
 now the space is not going to add this 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.960
 cream is going to be everywhere 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.590
 where we should have shadows 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.869
 this is below the cheekbones in the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.719
 part under the nose on the sides of 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.399
 the nose I apply a little under the 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.950
 lip what makes my lips will be 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.019
 a little more prominent and also to the 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.700
 sides of your forehead if your forehead is a 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:20.130
 little bigger I would apply it too 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.130
 all around the hair area 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.120
 I'm going to blur all this together 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.120
 my corrector with the same language 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.620
 after this I will do everything with 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.620
 translucent powder 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.590
 after the translucent village 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.540
 continue my eyebrows in addition to my 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.879
 eye makeup 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.040
 after this I will take advantage of my face 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.840
 I will use the same ones that 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.329

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.420

 mary kate I'm going to apply this in the 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.810
 Same area where you apply the contour 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.359
 but a little higher this is going to give 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.099
 warmth to our perimeter and it's going to be 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.739
 our face looks a lot more 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.769
 tanned for summer like blogs 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.730

 with a wet brush with fix plus 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.299

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.269
