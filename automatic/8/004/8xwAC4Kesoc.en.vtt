00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 here we are again super loads for 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.730
 start another irresistible recipe 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.890
 because I had a group 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.290
 the little garden that looked real 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.940
 own destiny of eggplant think that 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.460
 even the seedlings were pure for 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.379
 then support the weight of the vegetables 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.970
 I have collected many, I thought 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.220
 to prepare with you some 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.410
 eggplant parmigiana however as at 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.539
 I usually put my hand in it and modify it 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.699
 in bubble original recipe which 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.010
 changes we will bring first of all not 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 we will take the bad eggplant we will cook 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.570
 simply grilled to the plate 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.210
 to save a little bit on calories 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.670
 then we will talk about the springs placed or in for 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.280
 make the dish even more enjoyable 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.350
 only at sight to finish we will use 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.309
 both tomato paste and gold 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.370
 fresh we discover together how to exploit them 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.649
 to prepare about 9 10 mini pro tv's 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.570
 Parmesan aubergines only needed 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.530
 two large aubergines and by weight 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.780
 Approximately 600 750 g 80 grams 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.460
 about two tomato sauce 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.549
 tomatoes was loved by weight 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.770
 Approximately 300 grams on the oil 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.229
 extra virgin olive oil about 2 tablespoons 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.119
 then we still have 170 grams of 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.159
 mozzarella cheese or too much from 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.869
 what you like best 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.460
 grated grated novel about 30 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.150
 grams then still a basil leaves 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.159
 fresh a dozen first thing we are 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.080
 to cook our aubergines 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.000
 plate so I have already put one 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.369
 pan on the fire to warm up we do 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.259
 even the mains water test yes 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.850
 they immediately form droplets that 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.420
 fry so it means that it is hot at 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.360
 right point 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.720
 I cut the eggplant into slices 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.880
 about a centimeter in rounds because 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.189
 then as I told you before we'll go 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.840
 therefore of the single portions of the pyramids 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.549
 nor of eggplant so let's hear it from 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.740
 one side to the other then approx 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.400
 it will take two minutes per side and for the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.410
 red 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.510
 later we will cover with the 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.010
 lid and to lower the flame in 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.410
 so that even the heart is cooked 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.090
 perfectly now that the eggplant is 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.800
 they are browned both on one side and on the other 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.350
 on the other we can as I said before 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.980
 dome with the lid and lower the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.110
 flame 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.480
 here's one thing I didn't tell you before 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.970
 some people suggest leaving 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.100
 to drain the aubergines by arranging them 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.230
 abstract on a colander and alternate them 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.300
 with coarse salt for about two hours in 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.220
 so as to remove the vegetation water 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.990
 then the eggplant destinations 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.180
 only water should be washed and then 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.610
 dry with a soft cloth that 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.350
 passage I do n't particularly like doing it 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.570
 simply because in my opinion the 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.700
 eggplants get rich too 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.370
 in fact rises as you have seen now not 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.770
 I put an oil and salt because we will go to 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.660
 to season in everything subsequently for 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.209
 save a little on heat 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.070
 We then cooked all the notes 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.110
 eggplant so we cut it 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.020
 clearly affective we can now 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.120
 place them on a nice plate 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.590
 we have already arranged the others less 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:07.980
 use in layers to the layer you will have to 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:12.750
 put a little salt and a drop of 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:17.250
 oil so perfect 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:22.050
 and here instead we have already cut 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:29.660
 our tomato and thin slices 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:33.000
 here too we proceed to salt while here 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.030
 we chopped the fresh basil e 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.459
 now we come to assemble we have 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.980
 added a little olive oil a little salt and 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.280
 some fresh basil our past 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.020
 tomato part we poured on 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.530
 bottom of an open pyre and beer xvi ho 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.890
 got a round baking dish now like 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.340
 proceed take a slice of 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.790
 eggplant then we put him in slices 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.940
 of tomato a slice of mozzarella 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.400
 for pizza I recommend pure and provola if 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.500
 you want to do the classic Parmesan of 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.150
 used aubergines 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.250
 clearly the mozzarella 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.200
 only that in Naples they use to fry the 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.049
 eggplant instead I know a little more 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.510
 back on calories then we put a 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.169
 bit of basil 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:28.270
 yet another slice of less than sun 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:32.020
 a little grated parmesan then a 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:36.190
 tomato slices still mozzarella e 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.680
 we finish with an eggplant and now the 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.100
 pira medina affixed to our di 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.470
 rapid 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.910
 if we continue like this until filling the 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.860
 baking dish to exhaust all the 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.290
 ingredients now that we have built 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.050
 our beautiful pyramids or aubergines 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.510
 the parmigiana we can complete as 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:58.570
 do then we put a slice of 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.570
 mozzarella over each dynamic 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:11.650
 then some perfect grated parmesan 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.720
 so the cup 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.130
 since inside we did only in 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.509
 a lawn with large we then call with 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:26.080
 the tomato puree 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:28.389
 if we are held by partners and now 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.009
 we can proceed to put in the oven at 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.039
 to gratinate our reality in the 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:35.710
 parmigiana temperature of 180 200 degrees 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.789
 for about 20 minutes as an alternative if 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.070
 you want to speed up 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.880
 you can also cook in the microwave five 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.919
 minutes with combined Greek myth function 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.870
 and this is the eggplant parmigiana a 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.000
 my way by stacking the slices of 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.280
 eggplant in this way will be more 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.720
 easy to prepare single portions and 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.400
 dish will be wonderful 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.400
 because the eye also wants its part
