00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
since we kind of touched on that subject

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.880 
since we kind of touched on that subject
last<00:00:32.890> time<00:00:33.220> I<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:37.300> six<00:00:37.839> tomato<00:00:38.260> plants<00:00:38.739> this

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.789 
year now they were planted I won't say
early<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.610> they<00:00:45.940> ended<00:00:46.900> up<00:00:47.049> going<00:00:47.500> through

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:47.799 
early but they ended up going through

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:51.780 
early but they ended up going through
two<00:00:48.580> and<00:00:48.760> a<00:00:48.790> half<00:00:49.000> Ross<00:00:50.370> two<00:00:51.370> were<00:00:51.549> pretty

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
two and a half Ross two were pretty

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.329 
two and a half Ross two were pretty
serious<00:00:52.180> burn<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:53.110> leaves<00:00:53.290> I<00:00:53.890> mean<00:00:54.070> they<00:00:54.220> look

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
serious burn the leaves I mean they look

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.109 
serious burn the leaves I mean they look
really<00:00:54.610> bad<00:00:56.040> one<00:00:57.040> of<00:00:57.250> them<00:00:57.430> was<00:00:57.460> just<00:00:57.850> a<00:00:57.909> little

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:58.119 
really bad one of them was just a little

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:03.240 
really bad one of them was just a little
light<00:00:58.299> frost<00:00:59.489> they<00:01:00.489> all<00:01:00.760> have<00:01:00.970> blooms<00:01:01.449> and<00:01:02.250> I

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
light frost they all have blooms and I

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.920 
light frost they all have blooms and I
think<00:01:03.699> most<00:01:04.030> have<00:01:04.449> they'll<00:01:05.290> green<00:01:05.590> tomatoes

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
think most have they'll green tomatoes

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.999 
think most have they'll green tomatoes

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
can see here in the center these were

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.469 
can see here in the center these were
hurt<00:01:36.959> a<00:01:37.289> lot<00:01:37.950> more<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:39.209> ones<00:01:39.599> on<00:01:39.750> either<00:01:39.929> side

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479

hurt a lot more the ones on either side
if<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.959> look<00:01:43.109> at<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.349> road<00:01:43.560> next<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.099> them

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
if you look at the road next to them

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.539 
if you look at the road next to them
that's<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.229> ones<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.649> will<00:01:46.829> spray<00:01:47.099> in<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
that's the ones I will spray in the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.529 
that's the ones I will spray in the
liquid<00:01:47.849> seven<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:48.750> other<00:01:48.869> day<00:01:50.539> they're

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
liquid seven on the other day they're

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.709 
liquid seven on the other day they're
almost<00:01:51.929> as<00:01:52.500> big<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.119> they<00:01:54.450> are<00:01:54.479> much

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
almost as big and I know they are much

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.949 
almost as big and I know they are much
prettier<00:01:56.030> than<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.179> ones<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.599> were<00:01:57.629> planted

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
prettier than the ones that were planted

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.369 
prettier than the ones that were planted
a<00:01:58.200> month<00:01:58.439> earlier<00:01:59.509> these<00:02:00.509> didn't<00:02:00.989> go<00:02:01.140> through

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:01.379 
a month earlier these didn't go through

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:06.949 
a month earlier these didn't go through
an<00:02:01.530> impulse<00:02:04.610> that's<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.849> two<00:02:06.030> rows<00:02:06.299> side<00:02:06.719> by

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
an impulse that's the two rows side by

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:20.119 
an impulse that's the two rows side by
side<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.970> purple<00:02:12.329> hull<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.540> flowering<00:02:19.129> again

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
side the purple hull of flowering again

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.780 
side the purple hull of flowering again
next<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:21.299> row<00:02:21.629> or<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:23.250> purple<00:02:23.459> holes

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
next to this row or the purple holes

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.910 
next to this row or the purple holes
that<00:02:24.090> are<00:02:24.180> planted<00:02:24.690> bout<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> month<00:02:25.230> later<00:02:25.530> I

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.819 

think<00:02:28.920> they're<00:02:29.069> going<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.280> be<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.670> lot<00:02:30.239> nicer

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
think they're going to be a lot nicer

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:36.320 
think they're going to be a lot nicer
they<00:02:31.829> didn't<00:02:32.069> go<00:02:32.190> through<00:02:32.459> any<00:02:32.489> cold<00:02:32.970> weather

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.080 

and<00:02:36.990> that's<00:02:37.380> my<00:02:37.500> two<00:02:37.620> rows<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.400> got<00:02:38.580> going<00:02:38.970> on

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and that's my two rows I got going on

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.310 
and that's my two rows I got going on
the<00:02:40.080> south<00:02:40.350> end<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.830> garden<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:42.110> will<00:02:43.110> be

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.760 
the south end of the garden I will be
drawing<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.920> third<00:02:44.190> row<00:02:45.110> right<00:02:46.110> next<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.590> this

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
drawing a third row right next to this

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.640 
drawing a third row right next to this
one<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:48.420> plant<00:02:48.660> another<00:02:48.750> royal<00:02:49.170> purple<00:02:49.470> ho<00:02:51.650> mai
