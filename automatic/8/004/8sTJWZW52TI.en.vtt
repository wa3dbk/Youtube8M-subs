 We have 15 questions the further the more difficult 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.659
 the more money you get money 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.910
 this is of course virtual 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.540
 so by in the aspect of questions 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.990
 percent 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.880
 first five questions 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.620
 the next five trees will be asked 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.020
 already heavier percentage 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.150
 more in the next five questions 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.810
 but very difficult 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.540
 and 5 points canceled but 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.890
 here everything is standard let's go right away 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.110
 move on to the game 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.000
 there are as usual three tips fifty 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.080
 fifty volumes from salons to a friend 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.740
 and we can 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.980
 disinfect archery 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.030
 oh and we can 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.920
 take money 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.090
 but it certainly is 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.110
 strange function okay 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.780
 so first just what legs are 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.330
 electors in Russian fairy tales but we 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.840
 of course we know for sure 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.550
 no more solid 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.740
 this is of course tow 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.380
 as what mark did mark Timur and his 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.990
 team gates on chess windows by the way 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.570
 I decided to show you also how it works 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.560
 tips 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.140
 as an example experience 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.270
 hint call a friend 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.980
 it means we choose one of the virtual 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:44.930
 friends 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.230
 they are depicted exactly like this and nastya romanova 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.120
 more 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.080
 let's let the novels 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.340
 and you always know me when you are from 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.690
 I need more 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.160
 no longer for the wrong answer 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.210
 smartly 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.720
 but it does show that he would be humor where everyone 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.220
 still present but at least he answered 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.209
 and this answer is correct 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.909
 so where do they work 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:11.909
 large 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.879
 coverage is we of course for this 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.829
 we know that this is a casino 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.769
 let's take it all the same 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.949
 hint to sort 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:21.389
 show off work 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.189
 order to take a full room but somehow 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.669
 strange that at first 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.649
 matters at my expense so much 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:29.999
 doubts 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.439
 martin is here 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.799
 abay option 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.299
 supposed to 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.650
 which of these where like mushrooms grow 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.209
 underground 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.909
 well smog 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.069
 we see a hint this way already 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.439
 can not use 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.439
 Remains 50 to 50 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:53.899
 too we will derive 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:55.409
 let's goals 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.399
 and right 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:00.479
 so here is ha from now fifth simple 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.569
 custody by the way some question 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.769
 may be not so levki 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:08.639
 no way 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.599
 show them 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.139
 on television there all the same we would have 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.259
 that mother is a little easier 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:17.189
 Here for example this question can also 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.169
 not all but which of these areas 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.049
 income composition northwest and regions 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.569
 Russia 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.489
 meaning not included 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.489
 but I don’t think it is 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:30.440
 Volgograd 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.030
 and this is great-great-grandfathers so here we answer five 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.120
 questions but we can continue 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.849
 farther 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:37.879
 okay 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.389
 and I think 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.430
 everything is clear here, but at the end I’ll also say 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:45.659
 what the player downloaded for free read the broad market 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.430
 so they present 4000 questions like 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.300
 assures 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.699
 developers he promises that there is 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.279
 and that's not all and under the nickname will be 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.859
 but I don’t even know if 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:58.799
 so no 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.629
 but I hope the developer doesn't 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:01.569
 will let you down 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.599
 here we are actually asking all the same 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.599
 sometimes repeated 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:09.939
 nevertheless the court happens this is not 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:10.929
 Often 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:13.379
 what was it in the city of uah for 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.309
