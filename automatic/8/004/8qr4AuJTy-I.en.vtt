00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.960 

I<00:00:07.650> started<00:00:08.650> designing<00:00:08.800> bikes<00:00:09.340> in<00:00:09.610> the<00:00:09.700> early

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:09.970 
I started designing bikes in the early

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.320 
I started designing bikes in the early
seventies<00:00:10.420> pursues<00:00:10.900> to<00:00:11.110> race<00:00:11.410> bikes<00:00:11.800> and<00:00:12.330> do

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
seventies pursues to race bikes and do

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.870 
seventies pursues to race bikes and do
some<00:00:13.600> quite<00:00:13.870> extensive<00:00:14.530> bicycle<00:00:15.490> tools<00:00:15.670> as

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
some quite extensive bicycle tools as

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.200 
some quite extensive bicycle tools as
well<00:00:16.059> so<00:00:17.020> I<00:00:17.350> thought<00:00:17.800> for<00:00:18.460> economics<00:00:19.000> I'd

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
well so I thought for economics I'd

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.270 
well so I thought for economics I'd
rather<00:00:19.480> have<00:00:19.840> one<00:00:20.050> bike<00:00:20.380> that<00:00:20.650> serve<00:00:20.950> both

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.280 
rather have one bike that serve both

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.160 
rather have one bike that serve both
purposes<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:23.020> I<00:00:23.470> had<00:00:24.130> several<00:00:24.460> bikes<00:00:24.910> made<00:00:25.630> for

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
purposes so I had several bikes made for

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.750 
purposes so I had several bikes made for
my<00:00:26.320> designs<00:00:26.740> until<00:00:27.010> they<00:00:27.190> came<00:00:27.369> up<00:00:27.430> with<00:00:27.580> a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
my designs until they came up with a

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.820 
my designs until they came up with a
design<00:00:28.060> i<00:00:28.119> liked<00:00:28.510> and<00:00:28.780> from<00:00:29.530> then<00:00:29.680> either

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
design i liked and from then either

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.100 
design i liked and from then either
decide<00:00:30.279> i<00:00:30.340> thought<00:00:30.640> well<00:00:31.000> i<00:00:31.270> shall<00:00:31.810> be<00:00:31.930> able<00:00:32.020> to

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
decide i thought well i shall be able to

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.880 
decide i thought well i shall be able to
design<00:00:32.349> more<00:00:33.420> racing<00:00:34.420> bikes<00:00:34.659> to<00:00:35.289> suit<00:00:35.710> other

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
design more racing bikes to suit other

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.009 
design more racing bikes to suit other
people<00:00:36.190> as<00:00:36.280> well<00:00:36.309> so<00:00:36.730> how<00:00:37.359> the<00:00:37.420> people<00:00:37.629> started

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
people as well so how the people started

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.559 
people as well so how the people started
to<00:00:38.079> ask<00:00:38.199> me<00:00:38.440> you<00:00:39.219> know<00:00:39.249> could<00:00:39.670> I<00:00:39.760> design<00:00:40.179> a<00:00:40.210> bike

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:40.569 
to ask me you know could I design a bike

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:43.189 
to ask me you know could I design a bike
because<00:00:40.780> their<00:00:41.079> particular<00:00:41.710> needs<00:00:42.219> the

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
because their particular needs the

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.920 
because their particular needs the
ergonomics

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.100 

I've<00:00:49.500> always<00:00:49.710> liked<00:00:50.160> designing<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.110> having

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
I've always liked designing and having

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.170 
I've always liked designing and having
things<00:00:52.410> made<00:00:52.880> custom<00:00:53.880> made<00:00:54.270> by<00:00:54.510> people<00:00:54.750> hence

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
things made custom made by people hence

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.000

back<00:01:27.869> from<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.050> touring<00:01:28.590> background<00:01:29.100> I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
back from that touring background I

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.240 
back from that touring background I
thought<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.820> when<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.450> came<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:31.190> sight<00:01:32.190> of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
thought that when I came in sight of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.570 
thought that when I came in sight of
designing<00:01:32.790> my<00:01:32.940> own<00:01:32.970> bikes<00:01:33.330> I<00:01:34.310> realized<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.460> was

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
designing my own bikes I realized it was

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.510 
designing my own bikes I realized it was
a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.030> racing<00:01:36.990> bikes<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.440> market<00:01:37.890> but

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
a lot of racing bikes on the market but

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.210 
a lot of racing bikes on the market but
there<00:01:38.700> was<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> lot<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.740> functional<00:01:40.740> commuting

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
there was a lot of functional commuting

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.600 
there was a lot of functional commuting
bikes<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.880> were<00:01:42.030> economic<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.610> individuals

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
bikes that were economic to individuals

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.920 
bikes that were economic to individuals
and<00:01:45.140> predominantly<00:01:46.140> made<00:01:46.410> out<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.680> steel<00:01:47.930> my
