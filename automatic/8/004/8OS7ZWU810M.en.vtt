00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:00.619 

okay<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:53.730> basically<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:57.110> this<00:00:58.110> piece<00:00:59.629> this

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629

little this thing and then make that

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.730 
little this thing and then make that
thing<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.460> build<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.869> that

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
thing it is to build if we have that

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.530 
thing it is to build if we have that
piece<00:01:08.460> um<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:09.690> probably<00:01:10.110> could<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:11.330> make<00:01:12.330> it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
piece um we probably could like make it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.770 
piece um we probably could like make it
that's<00:01:13.320> pretty<00:01:13.560> easy<00:01:13.680> could<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:15.000> build<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.390> if

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
that's pretty easy could you build it if

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.609 
that's pretty easy could you build it if
you<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.410> piece<00:01:16.880> put<00:01:17.880> anything<00:01:18.619> because

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you have that piece put anything because

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.660 
you have that piece put anything because
um<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.900> other<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.619> think<00:01:22.950> that's<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
um the other one I think that's in the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.820 
um the other one I think that's in the
middle<00:01:23.940> but<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.570> isn't<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.380> middle<00:01:25.680> of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
middle but this isn't in the middle of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.430 
middle but this isn't in the middle of
the<00:01:26.130> star<00:01:26.910> thing<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.539> not<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> middle

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
the star thing it's not in the middle

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.279 
the star thing it's not in the middle
it's<00:01:28.590> enough<00:01:28.920> n<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:31.080> I<00:01:32.070> wonder<00:01:32.780> is<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.930> like

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
it's enough n so I I wonder is that like

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.760 
it's enough n so I I wonder is that like
