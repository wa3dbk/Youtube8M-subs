Oh

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:02.420 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.290 

what<00:00:03.200> makes<00:00:03.470> the<00:00:03.830> nerve<00:00:04.070> cells<00:00:04.430> also<00:00:05.029> called

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:05.300 
what makes the nerve cells also called

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.379 
what makes the nerve cells also called
neurons<00:00:05.900> so<00:00:06.350> special<00:00:06.950> they<00:00:07.640> produce<00:00:08.149> and

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
neurons so special they produce and

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.020 
neurons so special they produce and
conduct<00:00:08.809> electrical<00:00:09.440> signals<00:00:09.950> because<00:00:10.760> of

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
conduct electrical signals because of

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.240 
conduct electrical signals because of
that<00:00:11.330> we<00:00:11.809> can<00:00:12.019> think<00:00:12.320> remember<00:00:13.040> make

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
that we can think remember make

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.200 
that we can think remember make
decisions<00:00:13.910> act<00:00:14.269> react<00:00:15.019> and<00:00:15.320> so<00:00:15.500> on<00:00:15.800> if<00:00:16.580> I<00:00:16.820> speak

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
decisions act react and so on if I speak

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.450 
decisions act react and so on if I speak
it's<00:00:17.509> because<00:00:17.930> of<00:00:18.110> those<00:00:18.349> electrical<00:00:18.980> signals

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
it's because of those electrical signals

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.180 
it's because of those electrical signals
if<00:00:20.119> you<00:00:20.390> listen<00:00:20.810> and<00:00:20.960> watch<00:00:21.289> it's<00:00:21.680> because<00:00:22.039> of

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
if you listen and watch it's because of

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.900 
if you listen and watch it's because of
those<00:00:22.369> signals<00:00:22.910> but<00:00:23.810> what<00:00:24.050> is<00:00:24.260> the<00:00:24.560> signal<00:00:25.010> we

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
those signals but what is the signal we

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.439 
those signals but what is the signal we
call<00:00:26.180> it<00:00:26.330> action<00:00:26.869> potential<00:00:27.529> or<00:00:27.680> AP<00:00:28.340> where<00:00:29.300> is

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
call it action potential or AP where is

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.229 
call it action potential or AP where is
it<00:00:29.630> it<00:00:30.140> spreads<00:00:30.980> along<00:00:31.160> the<00:00:31.490> cell<00:00:31.760> membrane

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
it it spreads along the cell membrane

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.719 
it it spreads along the cell membrane
like<00:00:32.449> a<00:00:32.480> wave<00:00:32.870> shown<00:00:33.530> in<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.129> picture<00:00:34.489> by<00:00:34.670> the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
more proteins inside the cell than

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.190 
more proteins inside the cell than
outside<00:01:15.670> in<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.850> way<00:01:17.000> it<00:01:17.299> is<00:01:17.509> similar<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.020> the

top right corner there are two poles
positive<00:01:24.859> and<00:01:25.100> negative<00:01:25.609> we<00:01:26.060> can<00:01:26.600> say<00:01:26.869> that

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
positive and negative we can say that

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.230 
positive and negative we can say that
the<00:01:27.289> membrane<00:01:27.740> that<00:01:27.770> separates<00:01:28.399> the<00:01:28.729> charges

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
the membrane that separates the charges

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.080 
the membrane that separates the charges
is<00:01:29.479> polarized<00:01:30.079> there<00:01:30.829> is<00:01:30.950> plus<00:01:31.249> on<00:01:31.579> one<00:01:31.789> side

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
pluses out and two pluses in means a

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.920 
pluses out and two pluses in means a

more sodium outside

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.020 
more sodium outside

which means that three pluses out is for

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.720 
which means that three pluses out is for
sodium<00:04:31.510> as<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:32.200> goes<00:04:32.410> from<00:04:32.650> low<00:04:32.920> level<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.340> high

sodium as it goes from low level to high

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.470 
sodium as it goes from low level to high
then<00:04:34.630> two<00:04:35.110> pluses<00:04:35.440> in<00:04:36.010> is<00:04:36.400> for<00:04:37.180> potassium

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
then two pluses in is for potassium

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.610 
then two pluses in is for potassium
which<00:04:38.080> also<00:04:38.380> moves<00:04:38.800> from<00:04:39.010> low<00:04:39.250> level<00:04:39.670> to<00:04:39.850> high

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
which also moves from low level to high

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.010 
which also moves from low level to high
now<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.680> stage<00:04:42.250> is<00:04:42.280> set<00:04:42.790> for<00:04:42.850> generating<00:04:43.570> the

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
now the stage is set for generating the

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.380 
now the stage is set for generating the
action<00:04:44.560> potential<00:04:45.190> all<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:46.000> need<00:04:46.210> to

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
action potential all you need to

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.960 
action potential all you need to
remember<00:04:46.660> is<00:04:47.050> that<00:04:47.080> inside<00:04:48.010> is<00:04:48.280> negative<00:04:48.790> and

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
remember is that inside is negative and

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.090 
remember is that inside is negative and
there<00:04:49.360> is<00:04:49.450> more<00:04:49.750> sodium<00:04:50.020> outside<00:04:50.380> and<00:04:50.920> more

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
there is more sodium outside and more

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.390 
there is more sodium outside and more
potassium<00:04:51.730> inside<00:04:51.970> in<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.230> second<00:04:53.680> part<00:04:53.950> we

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
potassium inside in the second part we

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.670 
potassium inside in the second part we
will<00:04:54.430> see<00:04:54.610> how<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.330> movement<00:04:55.930> of<00:04:56.080> sodium<00:04:56.440> and

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
will see how the movement of sodium and

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.490 
will see how the movement of sodium and
potassium<00:04:56.830> ions<00:04:57.460> across<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:58.000> membrane

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
potassium ions across the membrane

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.770 
potassium ions across the membrane
changes<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.740> transmembrane<00:05:00.280> potential<00:05:00.970> it

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
changes the transmembrane potential it

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.170 
changes the transmembrane potential it
goes<00:05:02.080> from<00:05:02.350> negative<00:05:02.890> to<00:05:03.130> positive<00:05:03.160> and<00:05:03.820> back

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
goes from negative to positive and back

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.500 
goes from negative to positive and back
this<00:05:04.900> fast<00:05:05.230> change<00:05:05.650> up<00:05:05.980> and<00:05:06.370> down<00:05:06.580> is<00:05:06.880> what<00:05:07.300> we

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
this fast change up and down is what we

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.160 
this fast change up and down is what we
call<00:05:07.750> action<00:05:08.160> potential
