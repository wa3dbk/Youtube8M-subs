itself on screen I'm playing this with

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.100 
itself on screen I'm playing this with
the<00:01:23.610> standard<00:01:23.820> Wii<00:01:24.149> controller<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.899> when<00:01:25.020> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the standard Wii controller and when you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.749 
the standard Wii controller and when you
hold<00:01:25.320> down<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.649> of<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> buttons<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.340> rotate

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
hold down one of the buttons and rotate

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.969 
hold down one of the buttons and rotate
the<00:01:27.090> controller<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.750> entire<00:01:28.049> screen<00:01:28.500> rotates

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the controller the entire screen rotates

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.700 
the controller the entire screen rotates
with<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.369> affecting<00:01:30.329> everything<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.229> screen

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
with it affecting everything on screen

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.310 
with it affecting everything on screen
like<00:01:32.070> folders<00:01:32.490> bats<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.390> most<00:01:33.810> importantly

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
like folders bats and most importantly

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.650 
like folders bats and most importantly
you

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.030 

this<00:01:40.660> is<00:01:40.870> all<00:01:41.020> pretty<00:01:41.170> early<00:01:41.440> on<00:01:41.620> in<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:42.010> game

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
this is all pretty early on in the game

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.710 
this is all pretty early on in the game
but<00:01:42.370> what<00:01:42.490> I'm<00:01:42.580> trying<00:01:42.730> to<00:01:42.910> do<00:01:43.060> here<00:01:43.090> is<00:01:43.360> rotate

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
but what I'm trying to do here is rotate

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.960 
but what I'm trying to do here is rotate
the<00:01:43.960> screen<00:01:44.230> so<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.830> bats<00:01:45.130> move<00:01:45.430> upwards

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
the screen so that the bats move upwards

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.550 
the screen so that the bats move upwards
and<00:01:46.180> attack<00:01:46.510> one<00:01:46.660> of<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.840> enemies<00:01:47.230> moving

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
and attack one of the enemies moving

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.320 
and attack one of the enemies moving
them<00:01:47.800> out<00:01:48.010> of<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.280> way<00:01:48.430> so<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.820> can<00:01:49.150> then

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
them out of the way so that I can then

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:58.950 
them out of the way so that I can then
fall<00:01:49.750> through<00:01:49.990> that<00:01:50.020> hole<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:57.750> seems<00:01:58.750> like<00:01:58.930> a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
fall through that hole it seems like a

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.810 
fall through that hole it seems like a
simple<00:01:59.410> concept<00:01:59.590> that<00:02:00.220> could<00:02:00.460> be<00:02:00.580> gimmicky

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
simple concept that could be gimmicky

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.910 
simple concept that could be gimmicky
but<00:02:01.270> it's<00:02:01.390> used<00:02:01.690> to<00:02:02.020> great<00:02:02.290> effect<00:02:02.320> here

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
but it's used to great effect here

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.560 
but it's used to great effect here
during<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.400> gameplay<00:02:03.580> there's<00:02:04.240> also<00:02:04.420> a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
during the gameplay there's also a

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.030 
during the gameplay there's also a
couple<00:02:04.750> different<00:02:05.110> controller<00:02:05.470> options<00:02:05.680> you

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
couple different controller options you

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.070 
couple different controller options you
can<00:02:06.160> use<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:06.640> when<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.540> get<00:02:07.690> through<00:02:07.900> the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
can use and when you get through the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.240 
can use and when you get through the
levels<00:02:08.350> you<00:02:08.440> can<00:02:08.560> go<00:02:08.649> back<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.070> try<00:02:09.190> to

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
levels you can go back and try to

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.880 
levels you can go back and try to
speedrun<00:02:09.850> them<00:02:10.030> if<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.929> understand<00:02:11.590> the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
speedrun them if you understand the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.040 
speedrun them if you understand the
gravity<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.459> your<00:02:12.580> situation<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.570> hats<00:02:13.810> of

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
plan words the art style isn't exactly

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.320 
plan words the art style isn't exactly
my<00:02:21.040> thing<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.580> audio<00:02:21.850> is<00:02:21.910> certainly

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
my thing and the audio is certainly

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.030 
my thing and the audio is certainly
subdued<00:02:22.930> also<00:02:23.290> there's<00:02:23.470> not<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.650> single

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
subdued also there's not a single

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.040

flamethrower<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:25.239> know<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.480> could<00:02:25.660> really

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
flamethrower you know that could really

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.470 
flamethrower you know that could really
illuminate<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.860> darkness<00:02:27.190> maybe<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.390> the
