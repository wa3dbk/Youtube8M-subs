00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.740 
connect it to a piston and I close this
before<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.640> activate<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> crusher<00:01:21.330> which

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
before I activate the crusher which

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.560 
before I activate the crusher which
prevents<00:01:22.200> any<00:01:22.290> spiders<00:01:22.920> new<00:01:23.909> spiders<00:01:24.330> coming

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
prevents any spiders new spiders coming

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.230 
prevents any spiders new spiders coming
in<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.990> not<00:01:25.770> getting<00:01:26.040> hit<00:01:26.250> by<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.400> crusher<00:01:26.729> so

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
in and not getting hit by the crusher so

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.429 
in and not getting hit by the crusher so
I'll<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> hit<00:01:27.780> instead<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.170> been<00:01:28.320> one

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
I'll have to hit instead of been one

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.620 
I'll have to hit instead of been one
hitting<00:01:28.619> them<00:01:28.860> I'll<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.189> use<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.310> sword<00:01:29.640> so

to<00:02:07.020> give<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> little<00:02:07.320> trying<00:02:07.619> so

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
to give you a little trying so

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.030 
to give you a little trying so
we<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.460> this<00:02:08.729> either<00:02:09.290> quo<00:02:10.290> going<00:02:10.590> around<00:02:10.770> to

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
we have this either quo going around to

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.280 
we have this either quo going around to
him<00:02:11.450> it's<00:02:12.450> never<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.900> repeaters<00:02:13.260> which

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
him it's never on repeaters which

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.280 
him it's never on repeaters which
activates<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.890> crusher<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.810> just<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.870> similar

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
activates the crusher and just a similar

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.110 
activates the crusher and just a similar
concept<00:02:16.500> for<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:19.200> redstone<00:02:20.120> connected

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
concept for the the redstone connected

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.510 
concept for the the redstone connected
to<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.390> failsafe<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.950> I'll<00:02:23.010> demonstrate<00:02:23.190> this

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
to the failsafe so I'll demonstrate this

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.810 
to the failsafe so I'll demonstrate this
again<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.120> activate<00:02:24.720> our<00:02:24.930> failsafe<00:02:25.820> closes

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
again so activate our failsafe closes

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.910 
again so activate our failsafe closes
off<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.120> which<00:02:28.080> stops<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> flow<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.680> water

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
off this which stops the flow of water

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.290 
off this which stops the flow of water
and<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.400> stops<00:02:29.640> any<00:02:29.850> fresh<00:02:30.240> spiders<00:02:30.690> coming<00:02:30.960> in

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
and it stops any fresh spiders coming in

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.030 
and it stops any fresh spiders coming in
11<00:02:33.300> times<00:02:33.450> 3<00:02:33.720> 4<00:02:34.320> 5<00:02:34.830> 6<00:02:35.250> 7<00:02:35.730> 8<00:02:36.120> 9<00:02:36.780> 10<00:02:37.290> 11

any<00:02:38.940> more<00:02:39.270> than<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.480> I'll<00:02:39.720> die<00:02:39.900> now<00:02:40.680> it's

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
any more than that I'll die now it's

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.620 
any more than that I'll die now it's
simply<00:02:41.040> standing<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.520> gap<00:02:41.640> hit<00:02:42.390> them<00:02:42.510> all

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
simply standing in the gap hit them all

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:51.100 
simply standing in the gap hit them all
once<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.290> they<00:02:43.410> should<00:02:43.560> all<00:02:43.650> die<00:02:48.620> like<00:02:49.620> this

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
once and they should all die like this

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.030 
once and they should all die like this
then<00:02:52.110> all<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.320> slip<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.560> do<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.710> walk<00:02:52.860> around

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
then all you slip to do is walk around

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.780 
then all you slip to do is walk around
again<00:02:53.990> take<00:02:54.990> their<00:02:55.140> experience<00:02:58.610> take<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.730> to

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
again take their experience take it to

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.780 
again take their experience take it to
an<00:02:59.880> enchanting<00:03:00.360> table<00:03:04.220> place<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.370> item<00:03:05.640> you

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
an enchanting table place the item you

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.720 
an enchanting table place the item you
want<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.030> enchant<00:03:08.510> there<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.600> get<00:03:09.690> level<00:03:10.020> 5

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
want to enchant there you get level 5

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.070 
want to enchant there you get level 5
efficiency<00:03:11.730> 1<00:03:14.270> so<00:03:15.270> that's<00:03:15.390> how<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.690> do<00:03:15.870> my

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
efficiency 1 so that's how to do my

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.540 
efficiency 1 so that's how to do my
spider<00:03:16.350> spawner<00:03:17.090> hope<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.150> enjoyed<00:03:18.390> it
