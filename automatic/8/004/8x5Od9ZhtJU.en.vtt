00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.519
 new guide surely indispensable 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.440

 especially the templar safe even in the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.730
 cases you are facing sometimes 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.740
 I get to level 3 what you have 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.840
 need at least one banner in the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.000
 your team that is equipped with a grenade e 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.289
 solar care to feed these 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.420
 to the shield of the Templar 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.460
 doing so the Templar will retreat e 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.900
 after a few meters it will fall into the abyss that 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.030
 he finds his shoulders doing so 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.649
 die and win the victory in 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.820
 quite simple way 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.430
 the rest of the team had to stay 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.440
 here in this covered corner that struck 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.790
 of the Templar from the threat of the harpies 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.920
 and many other enemies 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.450
 by doing this you will remain assured this 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.160
 team will not die and above all what 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.809
 the owner of the shield is important 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.340
 he had to stay alive in the corner 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.020
 quiet waiting for the moment 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.610
 just to purify the whole team 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.100
 because not caring about the oracles 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.809
 we will be branded and thanks to the action 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.600
 there will be no purifying shield 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.680
 no problem 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.300
 so what you need is 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.580
 only a little less patience than 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.619
 one minute the templar will fall behind 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.330
 launching our grenades in the video 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.909
 question 2 flash longer than usual 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.830
 compared to normal duration in general 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.180
 it gets thrown down much faster but 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.100
 which will allow us to understand which are the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.020
 movements to do and where school should 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.030
 stay and this strategy really is 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.460
 easy to apply you will kill 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.680

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.210
