so<00:00:01.079> we've<00:00:01.170> got<00:00:01.290> rich<00:00:01.439> guys<00:00:01.650> exactly<00:00:01.829> with<00:00:02.100> us

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
so we've got rich guys exactly with us

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.910 
so we've got rich guys exactly with us
again<00:00:02.310> he's<00:00:02.760> about<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.120> demonstrate<00:00:03.270> a

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:03.920 
again he's about to demonstrate a

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.680 
again he's about to demonstrate a
powerlifting<00:00:04.920> style<00:00:05.310> style<00:00:05.910> bench<00:00:06.150> press<00:00:06.450> for

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
powerlifting style style bench press for

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.600 
powerlifting style style bench press for
us<00:00:06.810> so<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.589> much<00:00:07.799> more<00:00:07.830> specialist

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
us so this is much more specialist

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.430 
us so this is much more specialist
technique<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.450> bench<00:00:09.630> press<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.200> would<00:00:10.320> be

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
technique of bench press that would be

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.709 
technique of bench press that would be
used<00:00:10.710> by<00:00:10.860> power<00:00:11.460> lifters<00:00:11.849> who<00:00:12.090> are<00:00:12.450> looking<00:00:12.540> to

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
used by power lifters who are looking to

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.049 
used by power lifters who are looking to
move<00:00:13.230> as<00:00:13.349> much<00:00:13.500> weight<00:00:13.710> as<00:00:13.769> possible<00:00:14.059> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
move as much weight as possible the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.269 
move as much weight as possible the
biggest<00:00:15.210> difference<00:00:15.360> between<00:00:16.070> between<00:00:17.070> this

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
biggest difference between between this

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.680 
biggest difference between between this
and<00:00:17.340> what<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.670> see<00:00:17.820> most<00:00:17.970> people<00:00:18.210> doing<00:00:18.570> in

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
and what you see most people doing in

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.570 
and what you see most people doing in
the<00:00:18.779> gym<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.560> where<00:00:19.740> we're<00:00:20.279> doing<00:00:20.460> our

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
the gym is that where we're doing our

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.640 
the gym is that where we're doing our
best<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.850> make<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> full<00:00:21.449> body<00:00:21.630> movement<00:00:22.170> you

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
best to make a full body movement you

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.439 
best to make a full body movement you
see<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> way<00:00:23.039> he's<00:00:23.160> got<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.430> his<00:00:23.910> legs<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
behind him chest pushed up he'll

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.810 
behind him chest pushed up he'll
actually<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.170> aiming<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.739> push<00:00:53.190> his<00:00:53.340> chest<00:00:53.610> out

to<00:00:54.059> meet<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> bar<00:00:54.629> every<00:00:55.530> repetition<00:00:56.480> we're

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
to meet the bar every repetition we're

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.479 
to meet the bar every repetition we're
doing<00:00:57.719> our<00:00:57.840> best<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.500> shorten<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> range<00:00:59.340> of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
doing our best to shorten the range of

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.670 
doing our best to shorten the range of
motion<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.690> study<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.170> body<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.500> as

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
motion and just study the body up as

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.889 
motion and just study the body up as
much<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.129> can<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.640> make<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> really<00:01:03.660> solid

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
much as we can to make it a really solid

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.170 
much as we can to make it a really solid
left<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:05.070> isolating<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.909> chest

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
left it's not about isolating the chest

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.480 
left it's not about isolating the chest
as<00:01:06.360> much<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.439> about<00:01:07.590> moving<00:01:08.040> weight<00:01:08.220> from

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
as much this is about moving weight from

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.490 
as much this is about moving weight from
A<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.640> B<00:01:08.820> by<00:01:09.420> pushing<00:01:09.689> himself<00:01:09.990> backwards

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
A to B by pushing himself backwards

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.100 
A to B by pushing himself backwards
using<00:01:11.430> his<00:01:11.520> heels<00:01:11.790> he's<00:01:12.600> pushing<00:01:12.990> himself

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
using his heels he's pushing himself

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.859 
using his heels he's pushing himself
through<00:01:13.799> his<00:01:13.890> traps<00:01:14.250> into<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> bench<00:01:15.060> causing

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
through his traps into the bench causing

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.359 
through his traps into the bench causing
a<00:01:16.020> really<00:01:16.590> solid<00:01:16.860> core<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.759> himself<00:01:18.140> why<00:01:19.140> is

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
a really solid core for himself why is

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.620 
a really solid core for himself why is
breathing<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.520> pushing<00:01:20.820> his<00:01:20.939> chest<00:01:21.210> out<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
breathing and pushing his chest out to

breathing and pushing his chest out to
the<00:01:21.720> bar<00:01:21.900> he's<00:01:22.229> doing<00:01:22.470> everything<00:01:22.560> he<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the bar he's doing everything he can to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.830 
the bar he's doing everything he can to
increase<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.030> intra-abdominal<00:01:24.420> pressure

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
increase that intra-abdominal pressure

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.170 
increase that intra-abdominal pressure
which<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> give<00:01:25.920> us<00:01:26.070> maximum<00:01:26.640> speed

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
which is going to give us maximum speed

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.030 
which is going to give us maximum speed
off<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> off<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.900> chest
