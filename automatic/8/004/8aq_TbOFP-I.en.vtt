that there's loads of them that are very

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.560 
that there's loads of them that are very
acidic

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
acidic

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.720 
acidic
there's<00:00:37.559> not<00:00:37.770> many<00:00:38.010> foods<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.460> they're

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
there's not many foods that they're

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.150 
there's not many foods that they're
alkaline<00:00:39.300> or<00:00:39.480> very<00:00:39.780> alkaline<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.950> is

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
alkaline or very alkaline but this is

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.130 
alkaline or very alkaline but this is
bicarbonate<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.030> soda<00:00:42.390> well<00:00:42.629> secretly<00:00:42.930> make

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
bicarbonate of soda well secretly make

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
bicarbonate of soda well secretly make
this<00:00:43.260> water<00:00:43.530> alkaline<00:00:44.190> Oh<00:00:45.440> more<00:00:46.489> good<00:00:47.489> okay<00:00:48.180> so

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
this water alkaline Oh more good okay so

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.670 
this water alkaline Oh more good okay so
first<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.989> little<00:00:49.140> taste<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
first of all it's a little taste of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:01:04.460 
first of all it's a little taste of
alkaline<00:01:01.399> terrible<00:01:02.420> now<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.019> pH<00:01:04.439> meter

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
alkaline terrible now this is a pH meter

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.990 
alkaline terrible now this is a pH meter
okay

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
okay

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.590 
okay
this<00:01:06.299> tells<00:01:06.540> us<00:01:06.630> how<00:01:06.810> acidic<00:01:07.200> something<00:01:07.619> is

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
this tells us how acidic something is

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.320 
this tells us how acidic something is
seven<00:01:09.600> point<00:01:10.049> two<00:01:10.409> seven<00:01:11.070> point<00:01:11.369> two<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.909> it

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
seven point two seven point two so it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.420 
seven point two seven point two so it
should<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.630> about<00:01:13.140> seven<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.890> neutral<00:01:14.100> if

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
should be about seven if it's neutral if

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.490 
should be about seven if it's neutral if
it's<00:01:14.610> not<00:01:14.909> acidic<00:01:15.210> or<00:01:15.479> alkaline<00:01:15.570> okay<00:01:16.439> so

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it's not acidic or alkaline okay so

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.460 
it's not acidic or alkaline okay so
water<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.040> neutral<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:18.470> bicarbonate

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
water is neutral and then bicarbonate

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.270 
water is neutral and then bicarbonate
soda

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
soda

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.469 
soda
eight<00:01:20.759> point<00:01:21.290> six<00:01:22.290> eight<00:01:22.890> point<00:01:23.220> six<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.790> lemon

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
eight point six eight point six a lemon

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.590 
eight point six eight point six a lemon
juice<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.720> got<00:01:24.750> there<00:01:25.369> two<00:01:26.369> point<00:01:26.549> six<00:01:26.640> okay<00:01:27.000> so

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
juice we got there two point six okay so

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240 
juice we got there two point six okay so
you<00:01:27.689> see<00:01:27.840> seven<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.320> seventh<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
you see seven to the seventh is in the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.730 
you see seven to the seventh is in the
middle<00:01:29.490> well<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.090> my<00:01:30.270> Basilica<00:01:30.840> outline<00:01:31.140> now

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
middle well it's my Basilica outline now

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.350 
middle well it's my Basilica outline now
that<00:01:31.920> was<00:01:32.070> eight<00:01:32.340> point<00:01:32.729> something<00:01:33.090> which

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
that was eight point something which

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.060 
that was eight point something which
means<00:01:33.509> an<00:01:33.659> alkaline<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.320> was<00:01:34.650> lower<00:01:34.979> than

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
means an alkaline that was lower than

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.740 
means an alkaline that was lower than
seven<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.030> two<00:01:36.119> point<00:01:36.329> six<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.659> that's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
seven so it's two point six and that's

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.780 
seven so it's two point six and that's

that sort of soapy sensation here maybe
put<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.430> little<00:02:48.580> bit<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:48.820> your<00:02:48.910> tongue<00:02:49.060> and

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
put a little bit in your tongue and

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.630 
put a little bit in your tongue and
that's<00:02:49.720> sort<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.900> fitting<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.740> you<00:02:50.950> get<00:02:51.160> on

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
that's sort of fitting that you get on

that's sort of fitting that you get on
your<00:02:51.700> tongue<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.750> fact<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.020> you<00:02:53.410> have

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
your tongue is the fact that you have

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.250 
your tongue is the fact that you have
kick-started<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:54.820> chemical<00:02:55.510> reaction<00:02:55.870> which

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
kick-started a chemical reaction which

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.840 
kick-started a chemical reaction which
is<00:02:56.350> called<00:02:56.530> an<00:02:56.620> acid-base<00:02:57.250> reaction

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
is called an acid-base reaction

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.000 
is called an acid-base reaction
now<00:02:58.390> what<00:02:58.690> we<00:02:58.780> may<00:02:58.900> hit<00:02:59.110> box<00:02:59.320> was<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.620> shiver

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
now what we may hit box was a shiver

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.620 
now what we may hit box was a shiver
with<00:03:00.250> loads<00:03:00.610> of<00:03:00.760> bicarb<00:03:01.180> is<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.360> bit<00:03:01.480> too

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
with loads of bicarb is a bit too

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.940 
with loads of bicarb is a bit too
alkaline<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:02.200> if<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.380> want<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.530> make<00:03:02.650> your<00:03:02.770> own

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
alkaline so if you want to make your own

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.070 
alkaline so if you want to make your own
sure<00:03:03.250> but<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.520> correct<00:03:03.730> ratio<00:03:03.910> is<00:03:04.330> 1

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
sure but the correct ratio is 1

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.140 
sure but the correct ratio is 1
tablespoon<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:06.190> bicarb

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
tablespoon of bicarb

3<00:03:07.630> tablespoons<00:03:07.959> of<00:03:08.560> citric<00:03:09.010> acid<00:03:09.340> which<00:03:09.370> is

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
3 tablespoons of citric acid which is

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.600 
3 tablespoons of citric acid which is
the<00:03:09.700> sourness<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.540> then<00:03:10.989> 7<00:03:11.650> tablespoons<00:03:12.400> of

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
the sourness and then 7 tablespoons of

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.240 
the sourness and then 7 tablespoons of
icing<00:03:13.150> sugar<00:03:13.360> don't<00:03:13.870> get<00:03:14.230> citric<00:03:14.560> acid<00:03:14.830> off

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
icing sugar don't get citric acid off

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.710 
icing sugar don't get citric acid off
the<00:03:15.400> internet<00:03:15.640> really<00:03:16.060> really<00:03:16.270> easily<00:03:16.510> so

make your own it's dead easy and you can
have<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.660> reaction<00:03:19.989> goes<00:03:20.110> in<00:03:20.290> your<00:03:20.830> own<00:03:21.070> mouth

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
have the reaction goes in your own mouth

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.860 
have the reaction goes in your own mouth
so<00:03:23.230> as<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.410> little<00:03:23.530> treat<00:03:23.830> another<00:03:24.870> acid-base

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
so as a little treat another acid-base

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.160 
so as a little treat another acid-base
reaction<00:03:26.440> yes<00:03:27.400> she<00:03:28.180> loves<00:03:28.480> these<00:03:28.660> acid-base
