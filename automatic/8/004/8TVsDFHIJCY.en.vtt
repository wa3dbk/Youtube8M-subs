00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
some of those can be slightly obscured

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.870 
some of those can be slightly obscured
it<00:02:03.240> also<00:02:03.390> helps<00:02:03.750> keep<00:02:03.899> your<00:02:04.020> nose<00:02:04.700> away<00:02:05.700> from

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
it also helps keep your nose away from

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.119 
it also helps keep your nose away from
the<00:02:06.000> LCD<00:02:06.329> screen<00:02:06.509> as<00:02:06.899> well<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.590> sort<00:02:08.069> of

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the LCD screen as well and sort of

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.449 
the LCD screen as well and sort of
prevents<00:02:08.429> smoking<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.479> what<00:02:10.129> I'll<00:02:11.129> do<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.310> I'll

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
prevents smoking so what I'll do is I'll

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.090 
prevents smoking so what I'll do is I'll
show<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.670> how<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.120> goes<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.540> first

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
show you how that one goes on first

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.310 
show you how that one goes on first
have<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.310> look<00:02:13.460> at<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.610> putter<00:02:13.790> grip<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:15.170> it

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
have a look at the putter grip so if it

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.380 
have a look at the putter grip so if it
certainly<00:02:15.650> come<00:02:15.860> around<00:02:16.100> here<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:17.150> can<00:02:17.270> see

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
certainly come around here you can see

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.630 
certainly come around here you can see
in<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.510> normal<00:02:17.660> eye<00:02:17.930> piece<00:02:18.200> there<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:19.490> was

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
in a normal eye piece there it was

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.210 
in a normal eye piece there it was
pretty<00:02:19.760> just<00:02:20.000> slides<00:02:20.360> off<00:02:20.740> yeah<00:02:21.740> he<00:02:22.010> says

pretty just slides off yeah he says

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.550 
pretty just slides off yeah he says
there<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:22.970> go

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
there you go

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.350 
there you go
and<00:02:24.560> that's<00:02:24.800> just<00:02:24.950> an<00:02:25.190> online<00:02:25.520> piece<00:02:25.760> cover<00:02:26.030> up

the novel viewfinders just as it is
there<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:29.570> literally<00:02:30.020> just<00:02:30.190> slots<00:02:31.870> on

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
there and this literally just slots on

there and this literally just slots on
top<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:33.410> might<00:02:33.560> want<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:33.800> adjust<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.310> diopter

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
top you might want to adjust the diopter

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.680 
top you might want to adjust the diopter
which<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.900> just<00:02:36.080> control<00:02:36.440> here<00:02:37.510> once<00:02:38.510> you've

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
which is just control here once you've

put it on and then the rubber surround

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.820 
put it on and then the rubber surround
then<00:02:41.780> just<00:02:42.200> slots<00:02:42.470> on<00:02:42.650> top<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:44.290> they<00:02:45.290> take<00:02:45.710> the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
then just slots on top and they take the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.530 
then just slots on top and they take the
lens<00:02:46.010> cap<00:02:46.130> off<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.700> don't<00:02:47.090> know<00:02:47.270> what<00:02:47.390> you'll<00:02:47.480> be

lens cap off I don't know what you'll be

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.730 
lens cap off I don't know what you'll be
able<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.780> see<00:02:47.960> there<00:02:50.110> but<00:02:51.110> there<00:02:51.770> we<00:02:51.830> go<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:54.590> it

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
able to see there but there we go so it

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.050 
able to see there but there we go so it
just<00:02:54.920> sits<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.400> little<00:02:55.580> bit<00:02:55.670> further<00:02:56.000> away<00:02:56.680> okay

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
just sits a little bit further away okay

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.830 
just sits a little bit further away okay
next<00:02:59.060> what<00:02:59.270> we'll<00:02:59.360> do<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.510> we'll<00:02:59.600> pop<00:02:59.810> the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
next what we'll do is we'll pop the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.360 
next what we'll do is we'll pop the
battery<00:03:00.170> lip<00:03:00.350> on<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:01.220> takes<00:03:01.700> two<00:03:01.880> batteries

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
battery lip on so takes two batteries

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.830 
battery lip on so takes two batteries
just<00:03:04.370> slots<00:03:04.610> on<00:03:04.820> there<00:03:05.030> we'll<00:03:05.210> just<00:03:05.450> move<00:03:05.660> that

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
just slots on there we'll just move that

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.710 
just slots on there we'll just move that
box<00:03:06.110> out<00:03:06.350> of<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.530> way<00:03:07.240> okay<00:03:08.240> and<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:08.510> the

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
box out of the way okay and this is the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.840 
box out of the way okay and this is the
battery<00:03:09.020> replace<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.670> canon

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
battery replace the canon

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.110 
battery replace the canon
BGE<00:03:11.570> v<00:03:12.080> battery<00:03:12.410> clip<00:03:12.710> which<00:03:13.610> will<00:03:13.640> work<00:03:13.880> with

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
BGE v battery clip which will work with

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.180 
BGE v battery clip which will work with
the<00:03:14.330> canon<00:03:14.720> rebel<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:16.090> 450d<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:18.040> thousand<00:03:19.040> d

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
the canon rebel and 450d and thousand d

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.430 
the canon rebel and 450d and thousand d
as<00:03:19.370> well<00:03:20.110> 500<00:03:21.110> d<00:03:21.320> also<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.730> 550<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.720> believe

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
as well 500 d also the 550 I believe

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.830 
as well 500 d also the 550 I believe
needs<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.640> different<00:03:25.910> budget<00:03:26.360> because<00:03:26.690> it

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
needs a different budget because it

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.970 
needs a different budget because it
actually<00:03:27.170> takes<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.470> different<00:03:27.620> kind<00:03:27.800> of

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
actually takes a different kind of

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.020 
actually takes a different kind of
battery<00:03:29.140> price<00:03:30.140> of<00:03:30.290> progress<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:31.000> okay<00:03:32.000> so

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
battery price of progress a okay so

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.190 
battery price of progress a okay so
we'll<00:03:32.300> just<00:03:32.330> start<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.780> batteries<00:03:33.080> in<00:03:33.230> here

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.230 

turns<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:40.460> lots<00:03:40.730> now<00:03:41.510> your<00:03:41.870> battery<00:03:42.830> tray<00:03:43.370> or

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
turns and lots now your battery tray or

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.420 
turns and lots now your battery tray or
a<00:03:44.690> tea-tray<00:03:44.960> battery<00:03:45.380> door<00:03:45.650> on<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.160> camera

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
a tea-tray battery door on the camera

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.630 
a tea-tray battery door on the camera
body<00:03:47.200> actually<00:03:48.200> just<00:03:48.380> have<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.530> clip<00:03:49.370> hinge

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
body actually just have a clip hinge

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.710 
body actually just have a clip hinge
which<00:03:50.030> will<00:03:50.210> just<00:03:50.450> pull<00:03:50.900> off<00:03:51.020> all<00:03:51.340> right<00:03:52.340> so

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
which will just pull off all right so

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.840 
which will just pull off all right so
okay<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.750> that<00:03:54.140> conveniently<00:03:54.860> stores<00:03:57.850> in

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
okay and that conveniently stores in

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.690 
okay and that conveniently stores in
there<00:03:59.230> you<00:04:00.230> can<00:04:00.410> see<00:04:00.770> that<00:04:00.800> there's<00:04:01.460> actually

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
there you can see that there's actually

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.480 
there you can see that there's actually
slotted<00:04:02.120> in<00:04:02.240> there<00:04:02.420> nicely<00:04:02.630> and<00:04:03.310> then<00:04:04.310> the

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
slotted in there nicely and then the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.210 
slotted in there nicely and then the
camera<00:04:04.790> body<00:04:04.910> will<00:04:05.270> then<00:04:05.390> accept<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.860> battery

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
camera body will then accept the battery

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.410 
camera body will then accept the battery
rip<00:04:10.390> like<00:04:11.390> so<00:04:11.750> and<00:04:12.440> then<00:04:12.710> you<00:04:12.770> can<00:04:12.890> just<00:04:13.420> close

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
rip like so and then you can just close

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.039 
rip like so and then you can just close
that<00:04:14.860> on<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:15.980> wheel<00:04:16.480> you'll<00:04:17.480> tighten<00:04:17.750> it<00:04:17.960> off

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
that on the wheel you'll tighten it off

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.090 
that on the wheel you'll tighten it off
it<00:04:18.200> doesn't<00:04:18.320> have<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.560> be<00:04:18.650> really<00:04:18.890> really

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
it doesn't have to be really really

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.620 
it doesn't have to be really really
tight<00:04:19.340> because<00:04:19.489> you<00:04:19.730> can<00:04:19.880> actually<00:04:20.030> strip<00:04:20.450> the

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
tight because you can actually strip the

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.750 
tight because you can actually strip the
gears<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.500> you'll<00:04:22.010> end<00:04:22.130> up<00:04:22.190> having<00:04:22.250> to<00:04:22.520> drill

here now the budget you've had is on on
an<00:04:39.800> off<00:04:39.920> switch<00:04:40.070> for<00:04:40.600> power<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.750> camera<00:04:41.930> rope

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
an off switch for power the camera rope

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.770 
an off switch for power the camera rope
that's<00:04:43.550> powered<00:04:43.880> up<00:04:44.000> still<00:04:44.270> using<00:04:44.540> the<00:04:44.630> two

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
that's powered up still using the two

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.690 
that's powered up still using the two
battery<00:04:45.170> but<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.440> battery<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.860> buttons<00:04:46.610> are

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
battery but the battery the buttons are

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.930 
battery but the battery the buttons are
turned<00:04:46.910> off<00:04:47.090> they<00:04:47.330> won't<00:04:47.540> respond<00:04:48.580> okay<00:04:49.580> now

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
turned off they won't respond okay now

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.690 
turned off they won't respond okay now
to<00:04:50.000> turn<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.390> battery<00:04:50.540> grip<00:04:50.840> on<00:04:51.370> and<00:04:52.370> we<00:04:52.490> see

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
to turn the battery grip on and we see

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.820 
to turn the battery grip on and we see
here<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.750> buttons<00:04:54.050> will<00:04:54.200> actually<00:04:54.500> respond

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
here the buttons will actually respond

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.250 
here the buttons will actually respond
so<00:04:55.070> if<00:04:55.220> you<00:04:55.370> shooting<00:04:56.210> in<00:04:56.330> landscape<00:04:56.750> mode<00:04:56.780> and

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
so if you shooting in landscape mode and

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260 
so if you shooting in landscape mode and
then<00:04:57.470> you<00:04:57.500> quickly<00:04:57.770> want<00:04:58.070> to<00:04:58.130> change<00:04:59.000> to

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
then you quickly want to change to

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.750 
then you quickly want to change to
portrait<00:04:59.720> mode<00:04:59.950> you<00:05:00.950> can<00:05:01.160> do<00:05:01.310> by<00:05:01.430> holding<00:05:01.700> the

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
portrait mode you can do by holding the

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.310 
portrait mode you can do by holding the
battery<00:05:01.940> reply<00:05:02.330> so<00:05:02.570> rather<00:05:02.870> than<00:05:02.990> having<00:05:03.170> to

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
battery reply so rather than having to

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.560 
battery reply so rather than having to
come<00:05:03.440> over<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:03.770> top<00:05:03.980> of<00:05:04.010> the<00:05:04.220> camera<00:05:04.430> and<00:05:04.820> it

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
come over the top of the camera and it

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.850 
come over the top of the camera and it
actually<00:05:05.840> provides<00:05:06.170> a<00:05:06.290> better<00:05:06.440> grip<00:05:06.710> it

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
actually provides a better grip it

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.250 
actually provides a better grip it
actually<00:05:07.160> improves<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:07.640> grip<00:05:07.850> also<00:05:08.260> in

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
actually improves the grip also in

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.560 
actually improves the grip also in
generally<00:05:09.740> hand<00:05:09.980> holding<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.340> camera<00:05:10.640> like

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
generally hand holding the camera like

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.080 
generally hand holding the camera like
so<00:05:11.650> certainly<00:05:12.650> with<00:05:12.800> heavier<00:05:13.070> lenses<00:05:13.520> so<00:05:13.880> the

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
so certainly with heavier lenses so the

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.550 
so certainly with heavier lenses so the
24<00:05:14.480> to<00:05:14.660> 105<00:05:15.490> 70<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:16.580> 200<00:05:16.790> and<00:05:17.270> so<00:05:17.480> forth<00:05:17.780> and

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
24 to 105 70 to 200 and so forth and

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.720 
24 to 105 70 to 200 and so forth and
feel<00:05:18.770> it<00:05:18.890> because<00:05:19.070> it's<00:05:19.220> it's<00:05:19.520> not<00:05:19.670> the

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
feel it because it's it's not the

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.060 
feel it because it's it's not the
biggest<00:05:20.060> of<00:05:20.270> camera<00:05:20.570> bodies<00:05:20.840> and<00:05:21.080> a<00:05:21.650> fire<00:05:21.830> form

hand I prefer atom I find out on the
improves<00:05:26.300> grip<00:05:26.600> as<00:05:26.780> well<00:05:26.860> it's<00:05:27.860> not<00:05:28.070> the

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
improves grip as well it's not the

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.900 
improves grip as well it's not the
exposure<00:05:29.180> compensation<00:05:29.450> button<00:05:30.400> here<00:05:33.910> it's

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
exposure compensation button here it's

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.300 
exposure compensation button here it's
also<00:05:35.030> got<00:05:35.360> a<00:05:35.510> roller<00:05:36.080> control<00:05:36.770> wheel<00:05:36.950> at<00:05:37.220> the

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
also got a roller control wheel at the

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.450 
also got a roller control wheel at the
front<00:05:38.410> okay<00:05:39.410> you<00:05:40.370> can<00:05:40.640> also<00:05:41.270> lock<00:05:41.840> exposure

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
front okay you can also lock exposure

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.130 
front okay you can also lock exposure
change<00:05:43.460> your<00:05:43.640> focus<00:05:44.000> point<00:05:44.030> also<00:05:44.480> as<00:05:44.810> well<00:05:44.990> so

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
change your focus point also as well so

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.330 
change your focus point also as well so
pretty<00:05:45.350> much<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:45.560> same<00:05:45.740> thing<00:05:45.950> you<00:05:46.070> can<00:05:46.190> do

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
pretty much the same thing you can do

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.030 
pretty much the same thing you can do
just<00:05:46.790> using<00:05:46.910> the<00:05:47.180> camera<00:05:47.480> body<00:05:47.770> now<00:05:48.770> as<00:05:48.890> you

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
just using the camera body now as you

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.590 
just using the camera body now as you
can<00:05:49.130> see<00:05:49.400> here<00:05:50.050> it<00:05:51.050> also<00:05:51.080> has<00:05:51.380> a<00:05:51.560> shutterbug

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
can see here it also has a shutterbug

00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:00.850 
can see here it also has a shutterbug
it's<00:05:53.600> normal<00:05:53.870> half<00:05:54.050> s<00:05:59.320> it<00:06:00.320> feels<00:06:00.500> very<00:06:00.560> similar

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
it's normal half s it feels very similar

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.090 
it's normal half s it feels very similar
to<00:06:01.100> the<00:06:01.190> button<00:06:01.400> on<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:01.610> actual<00:06:01.910> camera<00:06:02.210> body

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
to the button on the actual camera body

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.800 
to the button on the actual camera body
so<00:06:04.100> that's<00:06:04.760> what<00:06:04.910> I<00:06:04.940> generally<00:06:05.210> walk<00:06:05.510> around

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
so that's what I generally walk around

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.270 
so that's what I generally walk around
but<00:06:05.900> it's<00:06:06.020> always<00:06:06.170> usually<00:06:06.500> always<00:06:06.860> attached

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
but it's always usually always attached

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.800 
but it's always usually always attached
to<00:06:07.460> the<00:06:07.550> camera<00:06:07.730> although<00:06:08.150> I<00:06:08.180> did<00:06:08.390> remove<00:06:08.630> it

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
to the camera although I did remove it

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.360 
to the camera although I did remove it
for<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.050> tutorial<00:06:09.530> videos<00:06:09.770> I've<00:06:09.980> been<00:06:10.010> doing

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
for the tutorial videos I've been doing

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.270 
for the tutorial videos I've been doing
just<00:06:10.910> so<00:06:11.120> I<00:06:11.150> didn't<00:06:11.360> confuse<00:06:11.630> matters<00:06:11.900> and<00:06:12.530> it

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
just so I didn't confuse matters and it

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.870 
just so I didn't confuse matters and it
also<00:06:13.460> has<00:06:13.820> a<00:06:13.850> tripod<00:06:14.690> mount<00:06:15.620> on<00:06:15.800> the<00:06:15.950> rear<00:06:16.130> as

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
also has a tripod mount on the rear as

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.100 
also has a tripod mount on the rear as
well<00:06:16.970> as<00:06:17.360> a<00:06:17.390> 1-yard<00:06:18.250> connection<00:06:19.810> and<00:06:20.810> should

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
well as a 1-yard connection and should

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.100 
well as a 1-yard connection and should
you<00:06:21.200> wish<00:06:21.350> to<00:06:21.380> fit<00:06:21.650> a<00:06:21.680> different<00:06:21.830> kind<00:06:22.220> of

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
you wish to fit a different kind of
