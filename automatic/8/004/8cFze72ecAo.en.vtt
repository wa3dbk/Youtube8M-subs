00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.720
 as you can notice my friends colleagues and 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.610
 I have my line 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.980
 can see approach that between 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.769
 front cabin coils is higher 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.109
 that the back can see also that the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.779
 rear sprint suspension is a 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.910
 little bent up because because 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.179
 the screw the screw as a base 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.240
 bra to extra pressure for the 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.580
 attention to the strapping 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.640
 can see that the hammer lift 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.739
 is upwards and cuts the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.650
 distance that is in the contact post or 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.730
 and contact screw is a screw 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.050
 three eighths of an inch of bronze 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.440
 now I will throw him to work so that he 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.440
 I listened 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.860
 I will put my thumb to see the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.740
 attention in support of flexibility 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.990
 At the same time the attention that the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.630
 hammer down to be able to insert 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.100
 the ink with the bar already placed in 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.750
 You will see that the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.180
 This machine's capacity is 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.780
 pretty strong 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.680
 the screw I made it a little bit 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.659
 90 degrees at the same time may 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.720
 observe that when they place fear 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.700
 index the calibration of the machine in 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.380
 no time will stop even doing the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.380
 pressure to want for the hammer 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.790
 the same sounds can hear that 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.690
 is working 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.690
 If you do not stop 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.660
 I will pass exams 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.060
 which is at 8 volts point 4 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.270
 I will not work my machine 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.270
 go to 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.630
 this filled machine can see that the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.270
 angle that has screws 45 degrees and 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.880
 also the coils the front coil 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.740
 is higher than the back one this one 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.740
 I can even assure you my friends 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.770
 colleagues of sonata your dotcom that your 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.650
 power is quite strong and does not 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.270
 to stop in no time you will see 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.060
 below how it works and the sound 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.070
 that also generates the sprint at the same 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.680
 time can see what is also a 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.550
 little bit talked up at the same 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.420
 time in hammer has 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.960
 an extra dubbing on the support 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.690
 front spring 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.030
 the sprint is not long is short too 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.560
 how can my friends denote in this 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.560
 moment the charanda to listen 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.459
 now contract my index finger so that 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.459
 see that it does not stop either 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.810
 and this is how my friends who are your 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.150
 dot com 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.360
 The 300 thousand two machines made by me 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.580
 they are jaime 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.310
 current metal or iron current that 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.290
 you can find anywhere that 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.340
 be blacksmiths in Spain here 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.340
 we call welders 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.530
 metal is how I make my contribution a 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.280
 greeting and a hug 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.280
