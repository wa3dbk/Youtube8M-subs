00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.070
 I've lost 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.599
 W 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.220
 the use of medicinal and aromatic plants accompany the history of 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.990
 men 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.600
 in the beginning it was based only on the extractivism that is the collection of plants 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.610
 who are born spontaneously 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.290
 later many of these plants were domesticated and became 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.190
 cultivated 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.220
 as many of these plants have a short life cycle or have building periods 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.240
 as in the case of cold-climate countries, the need to 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.030
 each time, and making these plants available for longer has 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.530
 man to develop techniques to preserve its quality for use up to the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.210
 next harvest 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.110
 plants are currently used by a large part of the population as a resource 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.210
 for the cure of disease symptoms 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.760
 according to research data 85% of manufactured drugs are consumed 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.770
 by 20% of the world population 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.050
 the other 80% of the population can only have 15% of this total and 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.190
 found mainly in medicinal plants the therapeutic resources 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.010
 for the cure of their diseases 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.190
 this use of plants is often done empirically and without control 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.970
 with the increase of the use even with the prescription of plants by 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.880
 the placing on the market of 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.260
 quality herbal products 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
 with proven pharmacological action 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.649
 this quality will depend on the correct botanical identification of the species and 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.510
 techniques used in the cultivation of 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.049
 of the harvest at the right moment 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.969
 I find correct handling during and after harvesting of the processing and storage 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.599
 proper 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.849
 every step taken at this stage will result in a good presentation of the 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.069
 shooting product or active principles within the defined standard for the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.069
 defense 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.609
 when it comes to medicinal plants the harvest is not always linked to the 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.379
 cultivation process 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.569
 many plants are simply harvested because they are born spontaneously in the 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.059
 Posting and flooding 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:56.869
 This is called extractivism. 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:00.629
 to get medicinal plants in this way seems very simple 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.289
 but can bring results to morocco 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:07.179
 harvests without any concern for the 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:07.980
 species 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.980
 can bring native plants to the process of extinction 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:12.719
 Besides that 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.219
 the material harvested is very heterogeneous and often bad. 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.589
 quality 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:23.260
 according to some studies conducted by some research entities marrone 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:27.309
 have sought to determine or follow the standard of product quality that is 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:29.889
 reaching the final consumer 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.109
 ass states that around 60% of the products 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:38.819
 are the best quality quality questionnaires 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.489
 the other enters 40% of the products that actually have a standard 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.579
 differentiation of production 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.269
 through this model that is characterized the manager of the world in the country 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.649
 in season 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:57.959
 it is observed very little the extractivism the medicinal plants as producer he has 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.699
 a low remuneration with your product 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.319
 he is not also interested in making national productions
