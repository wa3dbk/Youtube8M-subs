00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.590
 Hello everyone in the video above for 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.170
 we have made a little bit of quotation marks between 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.930
 magic of how with a 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.900
 with seven rings and through the 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.930
 movements we managed to make the game 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.970
 well then let's start doing the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:43.480
 assembly we need the seven rings and 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.990
 It's pretty simple to do 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.700
 we take 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.720
 two 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:54.020
 the third we put here the fourth 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.680
 we have to hook it on the second 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.180
 let's put the final part because that's how 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.180
 you just have to jump 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.400
 with 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.520
 a wire instead of the two we're going to 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.520
 watch 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:21.070
 A) Yes 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:26.400
 well as we see we have 12 the third and 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.400
 the fourth we put a fifth 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.369
 well in this way 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.159
 Y 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:44.930
 I have to look at a chop because if it's 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.930
 that time 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:53.870
 is not good 12 the third the fourth the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.490
 fifth and this one 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.360
 has been stuck here 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.660
 I'm going to look at a chop why 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.430
 but I can not do it well because with 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.060
 are these movements 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.820
 Now all we have to do is 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:17.710
 hook it in a pretty way 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:20.620
 simple the latter goes with the third 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.890
 we can not let in between one inside 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.850
 the other one because otherwise the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:33.770
 game and this first with the 1234 with the 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.290
 fifth the sixth with the sixth 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.250
 but inside 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.569
 of this 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:46.030
 I know it's a little 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:49.739
 helios or me is the game that I 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.409
 It costs a bit to do them and if I do not have 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:57.389
 those notes out there because all the 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:03:01.269
 rings are the same and are so close together 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:05.290
 that sometimes seems impossible in the 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:09.489
 do it well because this is the game already 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.469
 mounted as it says the time 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:16.319
 previous but mix life is 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:19.500
 simply night on the floor 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.010
 very well then I hope 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.400
 will serve someone 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:30.140
 and let's get this out of here to see if I 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.680
 I remember because it messes a lot is 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.790
 one of the games 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.100
 how are all the pieces the same 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.569
 well 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.329
 sometimes even 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.200
 the feeling that there is no solution 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:50.750
 but of course 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.510
 that fixing us a little bit 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.250
 if you have well this one that we just 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.350
 finish 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.470
 you have to do the same peter for a 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.310
 site 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.310
 pass it 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:10.330
 move on one side as on the other 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.600
 and what I said, I assure you 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.870
 that if you put a string instead of this 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.989
 wire the difficulty doubles or 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.920
 it even triples very well many 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.260
 thank you I hope it serves someone and 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.610
 until the next puzzle video
