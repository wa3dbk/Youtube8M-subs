00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.449
 but friend following with our work 

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.400
 interview we have with us very 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.750
 carlos ávila a great greeting to all that 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.760
 great practice of when we are through 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.250
 of digital tourism and by exact hipismo 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.559
 dotcom to many times I greet 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.949
 for you pleased once to treat you 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.619
 to support all your visitors of the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.140
 page in this in these my enrolled 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.909
 for Sunday starts with 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.289
 cancel it in the first john we are going to 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:28.460
 present yourself as an example for the competition 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.589
 comes a bad career i 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.450
 I see her as always in a large majority 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.730
 it's fine I could surprise but 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.260
 I do not think it's a rival of power in this 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.030
 career the quality of jorge spring la 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.680
 showed the last time in the equestrian gazette 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
 for this commitment a commitment 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.550
 I think more like in consumption 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.130
 unconditional chance as is all the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.570
 race in which they receive the maximum 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.360
 they are strong notwithstanding this horse 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.660
 trace excellent condition is flying 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.800
 excellent of everything and made it difficult 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.750
 someone can change these loads of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.690
 horse later in the sixth step 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.860
 of moon comes super good against stand 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.080
 of a thousand perhaps a little heavy even this one 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.280
 the weight comes last week and it was 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.710
 a 490 like 30 kilos more is normal 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.660
 I think that despite Lopez I see her 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.550
 It has great quality and could win 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.930
 tip to tip race or near the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.610
 pointers because it's about a tremendous 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.700
 it came to that I repeat the only problem that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.259
 he has how fat he is, they told us 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.149
 in the last time of honey and coffee that 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.340
 debute was debut and practically 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.410
 I was expecting good race from this copy 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.770
 it was not all good but for this 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.270
 commitment expects better and as well as not 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.119
 I was expecting a good race in mine 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.640
 he failed outright did not disarm enough 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.229
 both its owner and I hope 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.439
 a clear career improvement of 1100 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.299
 meters is better I have it tight 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.579
 Paw career and is first in acting 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.289
 of her and good in the 2012 campaign 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.350
 logically hopeful figure to follow 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.539
 enrumbado with these specimens that are 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.610
 in the block today doing great 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.140
 campaign as they are so much is that of 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.209
 cinema that comes from winning the week 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.039
 next pass the cutting load 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.410
 selective that was carried out there is that the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.180
 in addition to all of them large 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.000
 expectations for this 2012 with others 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.400
 animals and as it has not arisen was his 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.440
 mariana with also a tremendous 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.040
 mortgage careers that in the cinema the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.840
 14th unfortunately toni you will be a 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.299
 block accident that you can not with 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.940
 the presidential but will leave quickly 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.440
 this problem we have a mister coins that 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.410
 he appreciates excellent he had a fired 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.450
 he also backed down a bit but in 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.370
 this plus the big really good 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.349
 happy and excited in this great 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.730
 campaign I'm having I think that it 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.900
 keep forever because I have the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.579
 animals 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.980
 worst of luck the successes continue 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.299
 web and have friends the opinion of juan 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.370
