00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.210
 Hello from Photo Racking Protection 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.280
 Now, the moment I hit this first shutter, 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:16.650
 I was surprised by the picture. 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:22.890
 Dean is on the big monitor and Cana is somehow capable of sin. 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.359
 Things are so detailed that Carl Zeiss has cleaned him like he used to 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.840
 Features 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:32.640
 Now in dslt 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.640
 I think I can apply and apply a lot of it. 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.660
 Hello , it's just a picture and a stretch. 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:44.760
 If you want to advertise, 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.449
 There are details of individual colors. 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.989
 But after taking the story alpha 9, 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:55.230
 Transparent colors or deeper dogleg 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.610
 Then the color is really going on, etc. 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.610
 I think it's pretty fast. 1 2 3 times faster. 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.610
 The speed control in real time 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:10.020
 Quite surprised dwaeseo image transfer 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.850
 Hello cm or more I 'm taking pictures in front of the frame 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.190
 In a very ordinary screen, the premise is that the cpu fighter is provided, 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.869
 If you have been greatly improved this time 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.479
 It is very quiet and probably the best possible camera that f is f 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.940
 Is not it fast enough? 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:33.090
 The combination of the Carl Zeiss lens and the current Sony Alpha 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:38.009
 It is highly optimized when it comes to photographers . 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.880
 1 I have a little idea Hello, I'm a contemporary artist coming in last year 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.710
 It takes a lot of scenery and portraits . 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.180
 First received greetings and urine 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.240
 It's very light from the start . 35 b I put the camera on the Carl Zeiss lens, 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:57.250
 I think the book is very much a business on this land . 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:03.810
 If you are looking at a dealer in 2 years 2 f 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:07.550
 And now I think it's really the first time 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.550
 Hello there are photos and tea 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:16.860
 The interface configuration for user convenience was very good. 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:20.040
 It is also the user most of the time, such as Live View or Electronic Control Why Finder. 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.680
 I had a very good chance to do a putt today. 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.030
 This time the alpha part can control 12 or so on its finder or 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.270
 I was impressed by the fact that 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:36.360
 Alpha itself can produce 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:38.550
 There's only a Carl Zeiss lens that can see the resolution up to maxima . 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.730
 I tell sajapyeong or 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.810
 I know I'm going to introduce glossy 4 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:50.130
 Sony Alpha That's true , even in the seed land 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.350
 I tried to go to various places in the world with the topic of the sound, but the other yesterday 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:57.030
 You missed it. 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.130
 Divided between like to be at this time because a new party and really gives a chance 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.739
 I like to celebrate 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:08.030
 Oh, I want to know quickly , and I want to know that 3 is enough to come back to the world 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.030
 I'm getting better.
