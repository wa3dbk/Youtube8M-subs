weren't expecting to come up on this
list<00:02:59.700> yes<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.299> still<00:03:00.540> love<00:03:00.689> you<00:03:00.840> felt<00:03:01.109> really

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
list yes I still love you felt really

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.020 
list yes I still love you felt really
redundant<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.159> this<00:03:02.430> whole<00:03:02.639> book<00:03:02.849> could<00:03:03.000> have

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
redundant and this whole book could have

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.759 
redundant and this whole book could have
been<00:03:03.120> summarized<00:03:03.599> in<00:03:03.719> about<00:03:03.900> 20<00:03:04.169> pages<00:03:04.349> at<00:03:04.680> the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
end of the first book our favorite scene

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.270 
end of the first book our favorite scene
was<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.569> Assassin's<00:03:07.319> section<00:03:07.859> that<00:03:08.040> only

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
was the Assassin's section that only

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.369 
was the Assassin's section that only
lasted<00:03:08.730> for<00:03:08.790> about<00:03:09.000> 20<00:03:09.389> pages<00:03:09.599> and<00:03:09.989> then<00:03:10.079> Lara

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
lasted for about 20 pages and then Lara

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.379 
lasted for about 20 pages and then Lara
Jean<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.919> course<00:03:11.189> she<00:03:11.370> does<00:03:11.549> takes<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.209> too

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
Jean of course she does takes it too

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.750 
Jean of course she does takes it too
seriously<00:03:12.419> and<00:03:13.019> softens<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.859> but<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.609> was

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
seriously and softens it but that was

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.819 
seriously and softens it but that was
the<00:03:14.790> golden<00:03:15.239> gem<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.719> this<00:03:15.989> book<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.500> then<00:03:16.650> a

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
the golden gem of this book and then a

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.589 
the golden gem of this book and then a
court<00:03:17.069> of<00:03:17.129> thorns<00:03:17.250> was<00:03:17.519> being<00:03:17.790> marketed<00:03:18.060> as<00:03:18.540> a

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
court of thorns was being marketed as a

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.629 
court of thorns was being marketed as a
Beauty<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.139> Beast<00:03:19.319> retelling<00:03:19.979> but<00:03:20.430> I

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
Beauty and the Beast retelling but I

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.849 
Beauty and the Beast retelling but I
didn't<00:03:20.970> like<00:03:21.269> any<00:03:21.599> of<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.379> characters

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
didn't like any of the characters

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.920 
didn't like any of the characters
particularly<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.940> felt<00:03:24.359> that<00:03:24.449> it<00:03:24.540> was<00:03:24.720> more

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
particularly and felt that it was more

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.659 
particularly and felt that it was more
other<00:03:25.139> than<00:03:25.319> for<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:25.799> new<00:03:25.979> adult<00:03:26.220> audience

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
other than for a new adult audience

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.550 
other than for a new adult audience
rather<00:03:26.970> than<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.299> young<00:03:27.510> adult<00:03:27.629> audience<00:03:27.930> and

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
rather than a young adult audience and

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.319 
rather than a young adult audience and
we<00:03:28.680> thought<00:03:28.829> that<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:29.129> final<00:03:29.519> section<00:03:29.790> which

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
we thought that the final section which

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.569 
we thought that the final section which
is<00:03:30.629> basically<00:03:31.260> where<00:03:31.590> favor<00:03:31.859> has<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.430> go

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
is basically where favor has to go

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.640 
is basically where favor has to go
through<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.000> series<00:03:33.599> of<00:03:33.629> tests<00:03:34.229> it's<00:03:34.439> very

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
through a series of tests it's very

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.830 
through a series of tests it's very
reminiscent<00:03:35.099> of<00:03:35.459> throne<00:03:35.729> of<00:03:35.879> glass<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.329> felt

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
reminiscent of throne of glass and felt

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.020 
reminiscent of throne of glass and felt
a<00:03:36.930> bit<00:03:37.169> like<00:03:37.199> a<00:03:37.379> recycled<00:03:38.040> plotline<00:03:38.519> but<00:03:38.879> we

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
a bit like a recycled plotline but we

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.520 
a bit like a recycled plotline but we
will<00:03:39.269> probably<00:03:39.540> continue<00:03:39.989> on<00:03:40.260> with<00:03:40.439> the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
will probably continue on with the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.080 
will probably continue on with the
series<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:41.250> can<00:03:41.310> only<00:03:41.519> get<00:03:41.699> better<00:03:41.790> from<00:03:41.970> here

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
series it can only get better from here

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.909 
series it can only get better from here
so<00:03:42.599> those<00:03:42.870> are<00:03:43.139> the<00:03:43.199> books<00:03:43.319> that<00:03:43.470> we<00:03:43.650> managed

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
so those are the books that we managed

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.890 
so those are the books that we managed
to<00:03:44.069> read<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.400> one<00:03:44.639> sitting<00:03:44.669> but<00:03:45.329> over<00:03:45.810> the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
to read in one sitting but over the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.330 
to read in one sitting but over the
summer<00:03:46.109> because<00:03:46.319> we<00:03:46.590> have<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.769> lot<00:03:47.009> of<00:03:47.040> time

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
summer because we have a lot of time

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.920 
summer because we have a lot of time
most<00:03:47.790> of<00:03:47.939> the<00:03:48.000> books<00:03:48.239> were<00:03:48.419> reading<00:03:48.780> we're
