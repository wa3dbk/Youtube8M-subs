00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello my beauty how are you welcome 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.189
 to the channel today I bring you this 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.990
 look that is a tuxedo for the day well 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.970
 soft ideal for when we want 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.510
 look well groomed but not very 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.510
 recharged 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.590
 we started by placing prebase in our 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.970
 mobile eyelid that I'm using as 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.970
 always in the for internal and other 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.510
 after this we are going to take a shadow 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.550
 brown cited more or less dark we're going 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.880
 to give depth to the basin of our 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.880
 eye 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.900
 and then we're going to take a shadow of the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.340
 same tone of our mobile eyelid or a 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.620
 little clearer than what we apply 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.060
 previously and we are going to deposit it 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.100
 there to little touches after 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.840
 every step in this makeup we are going to 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.410
 proceed to blur blur and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.410
 blur 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.440
 no no 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.159
 we take a black matte shadow and go to 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.810
 deposit the condition that is well 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.710
 pressed and what we're going to do is 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.240
 try to give him that ripped smoky look to 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.240
 our eye as you can see here 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.260
 and as I said after each step 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.150
 we begin to blur I am 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.020
 doing light touches with enough 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.729
 precision with the same brush that was 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.100
 working all this makeup we are going to 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.930
 give light to the arch in the eyebrow with a 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.640
 shadow that has a bit of brightness 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.650
 but not the nail to over saturate 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.979
 just in the back in the 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.979
 eyebrow 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.330
 and we blur 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.890
 we apply mascara the rest 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.360
 of the makeup and we are ready if 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.220
 you want to know what my routine is 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.349
 base which is what I usually do them 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.120
 I'll leave the link below to it 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.280
 see also I'm going to propose a 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.410
 smoothie for the night in blue tones 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.180
 from that I will also leave the link 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.680
 below and we're seeing each other soon 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.700
 I hope you liked the video 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.700
 little kisses
