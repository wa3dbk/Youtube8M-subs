00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
speed I'm a lot slower actually and I

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.620 
speed I'm a lot slower actually and I
would<00:00:52.620> say<00:00:52.920> I've<00:00:53.520> gone<00:00:53.730> from<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.180> she<00:00:54.360> handed

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
would say I've gone from a she handed

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.600 
would say I've gone from a she handed
backhand<00:00:54.810> back<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.560> single<00:00:57.890> back<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> 200

backhand back to a single back to a 200

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.039 
backhand back to a single back to a 200

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
so I'm still in between back ends and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.359 
so I'm still in between back ends and
when<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.140> watch<00:01:04.320> federal<00:01:04.799> isn't<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.159> make

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
when you watch federal isn't that make

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.600 
when you watch federal isn't that make
you<00:01:05.489> want<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> get<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:05.969> one<00:01:06.149> hand

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610

next we went to his backhand is is so

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.090 
next we went to his backhand is is so
incredibly<00:01:10.330> fluid<00:01:10.540> in<00:01:10.690> fact<00:01:10.930> Johnny<00:01:11.860> Mack

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
incredibly fluid in fact Johnny Mack

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
incredibly fluid in fact Johnny Mack
described<00:01:12.700> him<00:01:12.910> as<00:01:13.470> similar<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.650> Mikhail

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
described him as similar to Mikhail

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.070 
described him as similar to Mikhail
Baryshnikov<00:01:16.120> I<00:01:16.300> believe<00:01:16.540> earlier<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.020> the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
Baryshnikov I believe earlier in the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.650 
Baryshnikov I believe earlier in the
broadcast<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:18.670> think<00:01:18.940> John<00:01:19.180> is<00:01:19.210> the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
broadcast but I think John is the

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.780 
broadcast but I think John is the
Baryshnikov<00:01:20.560> of<00:01:20.740> Broadcasters<00:01:21.430> if<00:01:21.610> you<00:01:21.700> ask

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790
