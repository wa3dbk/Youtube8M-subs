00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.150
 welcome to the poker tutorial a line 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.240
 today we will talk about some techniques 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.400
 of game type not slowplay slow play 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.380
 it is a game technique and therefore 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.950
 let's get into the way of playing 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.050
 a hand still a tournament and I said 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.570
 of slow play that we tend to 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.920
 confuse with this technique 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.620
 the opponent simulating to own in 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.809
 actually a weak hand when in reality 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.700
 we have very strong indeed 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.019
 the basic idea is to carry out a 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.180
 check that when we have a hand 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.940
 legitimate to bet by doing so 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.629
 we induce the opponent to bet also 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.190
 in later rounds and we can therefore 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.839
 we raise a pot more 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.690
 rich in what would have been if 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.190
 we had made a flop raise and clear 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.440
 that the first condition actually comes from 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.630
 satisfy because it is correct to play 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.300
 slowplaying and having a hand is a 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.820
 point as I said a very strong hand 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.150
 let's say mas then preflop with one hand 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.380
 very strong and fundamental to realize 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.000
 that if there are concrete risks i 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.759
 adversaries can improve theirs 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.920
 hand respect our grant cards 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.479
 free of charge our button 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.899
 obviously a serious mistake after the 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.790
 flop 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.799
 I did a slow play with ace ace 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.390
 it is not advisable to continue 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.649
 free cards because you don't get paul 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.340
 bird and they want it to come 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.840
 could tie 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.939
 another important condition that gives 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.049
 consider the type of opponents 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.520
 as said first time which 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.170
 use of his premier indeed 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.899
 works very well as I said 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.000
 right with aggressive players who 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.929
 they tend to bet in many cases 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.350
 bluff 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.700
 while it then becomes counterproductive 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.289
 against passive players or those who have the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.640
 tendency to call a lot in this case 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.319
 to laugh I accept do not do immediately 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.329
 no raise is equivalent to giving up 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.590
 surely win more food you know 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.280
 that in poker I always am 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.500
 maximize the zoom is still becomes 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.260
 more effective, however, if carried out when 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.040
 out fleet of arno arrives and maybe 2 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.180
 you want 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.190
 a card that with good probability 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.690
 hand over a lot brings a 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.640
 opponent but not superior to ours 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.019
 obviously if that card is delivered 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.560
 our verses a color and we know 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.849
 that we have full we can remove the 35 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.739
 thank you all for your attention and mauro 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.090
 Bracciani and little and no line give you 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.090
