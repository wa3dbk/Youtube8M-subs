00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.250
 Hello and welcome to the Main am Wengen I would like to tell you something today 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.350
 About a new feature on Wengen points 2 the page itself they now 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.340
 he already knows something for Germany is something directly in the eye 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.219
 do not jump 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.179
 that here is a new bar you want the whole 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.220
 the EM 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.369
 because percent of the advantage is that you are there 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.900
 These failures can be over which one must know what does that mean 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.410
 Percent the games the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.850
 For example, if I'm on the axis now, they're not planning on being white 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.909
 then can betrayal 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:34.199
 Percent so a bit stripped white Doro was you see no 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:35.770
 News on the page yes 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.530
 that in the two best things we recover with in the field 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.990
 So have in Armani 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.750
 and percent are hoping that PR I could also display on the homepage 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.730
 leave - theoretically yes 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.210
 relatively simple so 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.990
 to understand that 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.910
 we have now 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.149
 Mr. also online 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.719
 sda from the Old Republic 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.070
 Gert Voss 2 Diablo 3 of course today with strength 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.920
 to explain as - on the page there is to say with certainty he is 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.710
 but absurd 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.310
 no buck if you never have any - over 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.840
 Read Terror into a Kilt Voss No Need year then just printed one 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.950
 so you know that value and here and then you are on the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.990
 Home no news for you to see 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.240
 Gert Voss 2 and Cameroon arrived 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.680
 The same applies, of course, if he says Diablo 3 t more way I have nothing with 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.439
 Grace's most important appointment came 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.530
 just as little with barrages licks 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.200
 but I'm interested in that 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.390
 Percent of online and percent applies Voss two sons then have looked at now 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.470
 here still percent straight on the start page 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.850
 to have the tug of war - and with Diablo 3 must 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.000
 the work really works here 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.260
 and that on 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.450
 throwing that away and throwing this second person over there so we have Kurt rocking now 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.450
 stands out the Werkself - and of course - and of course - if you can 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.560
 namely do not enforce 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.100
 if you try the Wernecker to get the curve then comes in the US 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.479
 Nothing here is just super thing as I think because you can just yourself 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.260
 if in points itself put together the man wants to have 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.809
 Do not worry 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:15.189
 Percent died offer everywhere English so if he says we want 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.690
 everything that developers want to do, here too 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.540
 that belong for example and yes also with click 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.160
 then he pulls everything but if he says Bensch x4 in total, many have 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.300
 Not at all year then she just gets away so what says percent 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.340
 "We do not even want to get over it understands it must be for 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.579
 other side 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.329
 we only want to over percent in Harmony and put your info meters on year 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.529
 Kicker for that and then you have here in Harmony 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:45.109
 um has synonymous if the PR or if you have time on the city side something 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.689
 the workers are no longer news 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.049
 Euro and that would be so activated but is of course nonsensical because who so much 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.839
 Investing in money will certainly lead to it 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.189
 um was in front of strength and 9 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.519
 and as far as Terzic traffic is concerned, especially games are playing again 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.529
 Percent if you also think that our new people working here percent 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.799
 hardworking work away from the Rotho let me and others first out the old 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.230
 Republic also responsible yes then we have the mister here for 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.139
 Diablo 3 is responsible we have the Kingdom for Guild Wars 2 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.569
 Of course it is also responsible and we have in Green itself 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.720
 FÃ¼tterer feels responsible so all these four players come here 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.239
 your computer 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.230
 and percent you can see in the - if you care if 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.450
 If you are not interested in me just click below way no problem yes 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.510
 that's just percent the meaning of this new game was and why they introduced 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.379
 In the future there will still be a featurette coming in 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.610
 the dark forest percent got to know the choir I'm in 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.769
 a lot has been used and percent on the level has taken pictures 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.129
 What that will be when I need to present and do it very soon 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.069
 offers the good if you still have ideas so yes Windows 8 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.569
 percent 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.539
 I think that's a good thing the Berner Max Wende but I would that and that 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:02.420
 improve 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.739
 then of course that could change in the minus on the side of the now 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.050
 not yet published but if you already have the video seeding 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.620
 or of course in the youtube com and rhyme says that and that would have 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.130
 I like that and that I would like to do better 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.459
 please do that 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.880
 Year Percent Then if Medco made the point, that's good to accommodate yours 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.550
 Opinion with one of the normal is important for you we make this page 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.020
 therefore bitter tell us your opinion 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.800
 yes I hope and I say you like that I think that thinking very good 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.789
 possibility 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.180
 in the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.900
 Baldwin this game succeeds Werner Sinn of the exercises single player becomes 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.560
 have here 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.960
 all are not yet out but percent are still partially in the 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.310
 Beta or not even in beta 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.169
 Euro and is successful then we will of course also to the whole still one 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.509
 rebuild a little bit further 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.919
