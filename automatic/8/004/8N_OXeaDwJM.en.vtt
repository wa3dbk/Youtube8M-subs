nemesis bracers we're going to have if
you<00:00:46.770> don't<00:00:46.920> already<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.280> pair<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.350> we're

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you don't already have a pair and we're

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.160 
you don't already have a pair and we're
up<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.559> two<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.860> far<00:00:50.120> as<00:00:51.120> strong<00:00:51.480> arm<00:00:51.690> bracers

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
up to two so far as strong arm bracers

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.490 
up to two so far as strong arm bracers
are<00:00:52.559> used<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.250> some<00:00:53.640> situations<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.899> there<00:00:55.350> are

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
are used in some situations so there are

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.970 
are used in some situations so there are
several<00:00:55.980> skills<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:57.379> count<00:00:58.379> as<00:00:58.469> knock<00:00:58.710> back

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
several skills that count as knock back

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.319 
several skills that count as knock back
that<00:00:59.340> don't<00:00:59.670> actually<00:00:59.760> look<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that don't actually look like a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.139 
that don't actually look like a
knock-back<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:01.050> monk<00:01:01.320> has<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> few<00:01:01.770> skills<00:01:02.149> so

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
knock-back like monk has a few skills so

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.420 
knock-back like monk has a few skills so
for<00:01:03.570> certain<00:01:03.930> build<00:01:04.170> stronger<00:01:04.680> embraces<00:01:05.280> are

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
for certain build stronger embraces are

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.870 
for certain build stronger embraces are
actually<00:01:05.729> pretty<00:01:05.880> nice<00:01:06.090> too<00:01:10.280> but<00:01:11.280> generally

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
actually pretty nice too but generally

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.010 
actually pretty nice too but generally
speaking<00:01:11.909> you're<00:01:12.360> probably<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.960> be

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
speaking you're probably not going to be

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.230 
speaking you're probably not going to be
spending<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.500> lot<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.680> shards<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.280> especially

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
spending a lot of shards here especially

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.179 
spending a lot of shards here especially
once<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.780> get<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.320> know<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.619> initial<00:01:16.830> ones

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
once you get you know the initial ones

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.340 
once you get you know the initial ones
that<00:01:17.460> you're<00:01:17.700> looking<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:19.200> could

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that you're looking for and you could

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.460 
that you're looking for and you could
also<00:01:19.470> use<00:01:19.590> triangles<00:01:20.040> coils<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:21.439> reduce<00:01:22.439> your

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
also use triangles coils to reduce your

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.770 
also use triangles coils to reduce your
cool<00:01:22.740> down<00:01:22.860> if<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.220> want<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.520> bother<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.420> you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
cool down if you want to bother with you

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.190 
cool down if you want to bother with you
know<00:01:24.900> swapping<00:01:25.759> items<00:01:26.759> things<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:30.200> so

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
know swapping items things like that so

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.499 
know swapping items things like that so
there<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.799> got<00:01:31.920> two<00:01:32.299> out<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.360> five

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
there we go so we got two out of five

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.899 
there we go so we got two out of five
hundred<00:01:33.869> I've<00:01:34.619> got<00:01:34.770> par<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.189> course<00:01:35.250> you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
hundred I've got par for the course you

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.240 
hundred I've got par for the course you
took<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.150> look<00:01:36.299> at<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> little<00:01:36.720> quick<00:01:37.189> and<00:01:38.189> I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
took a look at a little quick and I

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.740 
took a look at a little quick and I
haven't<00:01:38.490> really<00:01:38.700> done<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.909> lot<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.090> racers<00:01:39.509> so

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
haven't really done a lot of racers so

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.730 
haven't really done a lot of racers so
unfortunately<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.259> can't<00:01:40.439> tell<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.680> guys

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
since there isn't like a bracer that

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.620 
since there isn't like a bracer that
everyone<00:01:46.829> has<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.399> outside<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.329> Reapers

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
everyone has to have outside of Reapers

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.520 
everyone has to have outside of Reapers
wraps<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.500> those<00:01:50.399> are<00:01:50.579> crafted<00:01:51.240> some<00:01:51.500> said<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
