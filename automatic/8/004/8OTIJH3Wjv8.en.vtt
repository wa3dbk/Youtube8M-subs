00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
talking about here because in a lot of

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.439 
talking about here because in a lot of
DSLRs<00:00:52.469> i<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.730> video<00:00:53.969> recording

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
DSLRs i think that the video recording

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
DSLRs i think that the video recording
should<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.690> left<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.680> dedicated<00:00:56.190> video

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
should be left for the dedicated video

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.880 
should be left for the dedicated video
recorder<00:00:57.210> because<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> DSLRs<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.530> simply

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
recorder because the DSLRs just simply

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.619 
recorder because the DSLRs just simply
aren't<00:00:59.100> equipped<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.579> handle<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:00.420> don't

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
aren't equipped to handle it they don't

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.070
