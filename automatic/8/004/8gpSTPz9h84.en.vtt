00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.580
 and another 1,000 ac and in this video I go 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.969
 talk a little about my 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.310
 experiences with the game pdz plantes 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.900
 farsi ongs garden warth 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.730
 the game has just been released for the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.269
 sony consoles but was released to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.970
 xbox 360 xbox world tc a few months 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.220
 back but only now it has reached the consoles 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.439
 of sony the game is a trick seems useful 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.989
 have an emphasis on online multiplayer 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.790
 well since I bought the game I should 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.040
 have played for about three hours 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.350
 and I had a lot of fun 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.450
 in these three hours the game is really 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.610
 very fun you can choose between 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.340
 several game modes but I 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.309
 I particularly played only two modes 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.170
 today and save on the off and team mode 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.480
 deathmatch classic mode 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 the mode of charge in a faith consists of four 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.879
 players defending the wave garden 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.649
 of enemies controlled by the machine 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.719
 as was to be expected every wave 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.600
 difficulty increases books get more 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.119
 difficult you lose more live and so 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.130
 you certainly understand 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.930
 fine, how does this work ? 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.119
 I find it super fun and it should still be 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.990
 more cool if you play with three 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.729
 friends 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.580
 the other way I played classic 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.110
 team deathmatch there are eight classes 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.600
 available in the game that you can 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.020
 choose four classes for plants 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.659
 four classes for the zombies all of them 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.240
 they are different each class has a weapon 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.310
 different a special one 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.079
 different skill so it's worth it 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.450
 You test all the classes until you 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.920
 find one that you really enjoy and 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.229
 after having played several and several 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.890
 that way I think that the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.920
 classes of the zombies are stronger are 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.000
 more powerful than the classes of 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.310
 plants 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.799
 even because the one bis can use 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.969
 machine guns and believe me, make a 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.969
 big difference in the game 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.490
 and so you can use the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.759
 skills of each character 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.009
 you need to evolve the character you 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.980
 go and play you're going to evolve is a 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.380
 natural system with every match you 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.800
 play you win coins and you use these 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.200
 coins to buy packets of cards 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.780
 these little cards are for you to open 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.290
 a new outfit and a new character 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.340
 power even one weapon and several others 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.370
 things 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.880
 is practically the same process as the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.660
 fifa ultimate team you have things 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.830
 you buy the packages and you get the 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.030
 items 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.790
 I believe it's still not possible. 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.680
 put real money on playstation 4 and 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.590
 on playstation 3 to buy these 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.660
 songs plus an xbox the bus 60 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.670
 You can put real money into 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.680
 buy these things to open these 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.959
 packets of cards that were already 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.230
 expected and since this game was played 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.060
 and published by ee games 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.310
 but one good thing is that the game has a 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.049
 reduced price for being a game of 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.590
 download then this game does not cost 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:12.260
 he is very affordable. 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.049
 on the gameplay as I already said bbc is 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.269
 a stretch to have it all worked out really well and 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.000
 It's very simple to play, there's nothing like me. 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.850
 try to explain to you why it's a 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.470
 basic fertile ground the only thing 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.510
 different is that it has no system 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.000
 you do not have a button that you 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.329
 press and the character goes into cover 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.859
 so there is no coverage system 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.019
 gameplay is simple and the game is 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.299
 really fun the graphic of the 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.480
 game is very beautiful very colorful and the 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.340
 game runs at 60 frames per second that is 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.549
 very cool and all the games 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.850
 playstation 4 and xbox onu should have 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.950
 the games should run and 60 prizes per 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.340
 according to this is my personal opinion 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.440
 all games of the new consoles 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.980
 should run at 60 frames per second 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.739
 well folks summarizing plantes fars a 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.169
 bis gardino officer is a super game 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.720
 Cool, I recommend it too much. 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:11.120
 If you like to have person shooters 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.280
 multiplayer play this game you will not 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.100
 regret the game really super 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.480
 It's cool, the little time I played. 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.130
 really liked 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.470
 The only boring thing you can leave 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.960
 some sad players is the system of 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.780
 letters from the packets of 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.940
 but for me it's something that does not 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.520
 makes no difference since I'm not going 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.300
 spending money wasting time 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.630
 To get a new outfit a new one. 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.540
 accessory because as I already told you 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.090
 evolves the characters by playing 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.190
 just playing for me then not 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.120
 has no problem and mike system 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.340
 transactions 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.320
 inside the game even because you playing 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.060
 Do you earn coins as I explained? 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.010
 but some players can get angry 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.600
 with that but this is very personal 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.640
