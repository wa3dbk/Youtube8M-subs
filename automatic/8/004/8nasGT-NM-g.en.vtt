00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.540 

a<00:00:07.450> lot<00:00:07.990> of<00:00:08.020> people<00:00:08.500> when<00:00:08.920> they<00:00:09.040> see<00:00:09.100> me<00:00:09.370> through

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:09.550 
a lot of people when they see me through

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.400 
a lot of people when they see me through
Hennepin<00:00:10.030> say<00:00:10.330> one<00:00:10.870> of<00:00:10.960> the<00:00:11.050> things<00:00:11.080> they

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
Hennepin say one of the things they

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.070 
Hennepin say one of the things they
faceted<00:00:12.010> is<00:00:12.190> that<00:00:12.430> my<00:00:12.550> speed<00:00:12.880> I'm<00:00:13.270> probably

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
faceted is that my speed I'm probably

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.510 
faceted is that my speed I'm probably
one<00:00:14.290> of<00:00:14.350> the<00:00:14.500> fastest<00:00:14.889> transfers<00:00:15.280> in<00:00:15.430> the

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
one of the fastest transfers in the

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.090 
one of the fastest transfers in the
world<00:00:15.760> that<00:00:16.000> I'm<00:00:16.150> able<00:00:16.270> to<00:00:16.450> actually<00:00:17.100> position

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
world that I'm able to actually position

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.770 
world that I'm able to actually position
my<00:00:18.220> legs<00:00:18.460> in<00:00:18.730> a<00:00:18.820> certain<00:00:19.150> position<00:00:19.300> and

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:19.780 
my legs in a certain position and

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.439 
my legs in a certain position and
therefore<00:00:20.289> also<00:00:20.890> my<00:00:21.220> hands<00:00:21.940> and<00:00:22.150> then<00:00:22.270> you

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
therefore also my hands and then you

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.450 
therefore also my hands and then you
both<00:00:22.780> really<00:00:23.260> I<00:00:23.410> go<00:00:23.650> really<00:00:24.070> really<00:00:24.190> really

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
both really I go really really really

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.450 
both really I go really really really
fast<00:00:24.820> so<00:00:25.660> it's<00:00:25.870> all<00:00:26.080> about<00:00:26.320> positioning<00:00:26.530> your

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
fast so it's all about positioning your

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.970 
fast so it's all about positioning your
arms<00:00:27.880> and<00:00:28.090> also<00:00:28.420> your<00:00:28.720> legs<00:00:28.960> your<00:00:29.560> arms<00:00:29.590> your

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
arms and also your legs your arms your

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.590 
arms and also your legs your arms your
legs<00:00:30.220> so<00:00:30.430> they<00:00:30.550> say<00:00:30.790> the<00:00:30.910> most<00:00:31.090> important

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
legs so they say the most important

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.790 
legs so they say the most important
things<00:00:31.810> on<00:00:32.050> a<00:00:32.079> head<00:00:32.259> spin

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
things on a head spin

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.920 
things on a head spin
I'm<00:00:32.860> going<00:00:33.460> to<00:00:33.610> demonstrate<00:00:33.790> you<00:00:34.300> now<00:00:34.450> and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
I'm going to demonstrate you now and

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.069 
I'm going to demonstrate you now and
also<00:00:35.410> I'm<00:00:35.739> going<00:00:36.010> to<00:00:36.190> go<00:00:37.149> into<00:00:37.420> this<00:00:37.539> position

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
also I'm going to go into this position

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.299 
also I'm going to go into this position
so<00:00:38.260> I'm<00:00:38.350> going<00:00:38.530> to<00:00:38.590> go<00:00:38.680> from<00:00:38.890> this<00:00:39.039> position

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
so I'm going to go from this position

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.069 
so I'm going to go from this position
upside<00:00:40.300> down<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:41.050> I'm<00:00:41.440> going<00:00:41.620> to<00:00:41.740> turn<00:00:41.980> and

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
upside down and I'm going to turn and

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.020 
upside down and I'm going to turn and
then<00:00:44.079> I'm<00:00:44.380> gonna<00:00:44.590> be<00:00:44.800> in<00:00:44.920> a<00:00:45.250> what<00:00:45.670> we<00:00:45.760> call<00:00:45.790> a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
then I'm gonna be in a what we call a

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.479 
then I'm gonna be in a what we call a
bicycle<00:00:46.630> position<00:00:47.079> when<00:00:47.620> you<00:00:47.770> get<00:00:48.010> over<00:00:48.250> here

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
bicycle position when you get over here

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.260 
bicycle position when you get over here
you<00:00:48.820> actually<00:00:49.210> I'm<00:00:49.390> bringing<00:00:49.750> my<00:00:49.870> arms

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
you actually I'm bringing my arms

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.330 
you actually I'm bringing my arms
towards<00:00:52.270> my<00:00:52.390> body<00:00:52.570> and<00:00:53.079> my<00:00:53.380> legs<00:00:53.710> are<00:00:54.040> coming

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
towards my body and my legs are coming

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.420 
towards my body and my legs are coming
forward<00:00:54.970> and<00:00:55.149> therefore<00:00:55.800> gravity<00:00:56.800> pulls<00:00:57.130> me

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
forward and therefore gravity pulls me

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.090 
forward and therefore gravity pulls me
as<00:00:57.910> well<00:00:58.360> as<00:00:58.600> I<00:00:58.750> do<00:00:58.809> this<00:00:59.140> gravity<00:00:59.770> is<00:00:59.829> pulling

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
as well as I do this gravity is pulling

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.340 
as well as I do this gravity is pulling
me<00:01:00.340> and<00:01:00.880> I<00:01:00.970> go<00:01:01.149> really<00:01:01.360> really<00:01:01.720> really<00:01:01.930> really

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
me and I go really really really really

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:16.109 
me and I go really really really really
really<00:01:02.739> really<00:01:02.920> fast<00:01:03.340> so<00:01:03.730> check<00:01:04.570> this<00:01:04.659> out

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.210 

keep<00:01:17.119> in<00:01:17.270> mind<00:01:17.510> you<00:01:18.380> need<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.770> maintain<00:01:18.950> your

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
keep in mind you need to maintain your

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.100 
keep in mind you need to maintain your
legs<00:01:19.670> open<00:01:19.970> in<00:01:20.450> order<00:01:20.750> for<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:21.050> to

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
legs open in order for you to

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.450 
legs open in order for you to
continuously<00:01:21.680> spin<00:01:23.830> when<00:01:24.830> you<00:01:25.009> are<00:01:25.159> doing

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
continuously spin when you are doing

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.210 
continuously spin when you are doing
that<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:26.090> generate<00:01:26.690> speed<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.950> when<00:01:28.100> you're

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
that you generate speed and when you're

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.420 
that you generate speed and when you're
generating<00:01:28.490> your<00:01:29.119> speed<00:01:29.650> you<00:01:30.650> know<00:01:30.800> your<00:01:31.130> legs

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
generating your speed you know your legs

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.940 
generating your speed you know your legs
will<00:01:31.700> maintain<00:01:31.880> open<00:01:32.659> if<00:01:32.930> they're<00:01:33.229> not<00:01:33.409> open

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
will maintain open if they're not open

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.030 
will maintain open if they're not open
then<00:01:34.909> you're<00:01:35.149> gonna<00:01:35.270> have<00:01:35.509> trouble<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.890> you

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
then you're gonna have trouble and you

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.270 
then you're gonna have trouble and you
may<00:01:37.190> able<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.550> fall<00:01:37.790> so<00:01:38.570> your<00:01:38.840> legs<00:01:39.170> they<00:01:40.009> stay

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
may able to fall so your legs they stay

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.690 
may able to fall so your legs they stay
straight<00:01:40.670> up<00:01:40.850> with<00:01:41.780> that<00:01:41.960> real<00:01:42.530> powerful<00:01:42.890> whip

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
straight up with that real powerful whip

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.969 
straight up with that real powerful whip
and<00:01:44.149> then<00:01:44.570> your<00:01:45.050> hands<00:01:45.500> are<00:01:45.590> right<00:01:45.800> in<00:01:45.920> front

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
and then your hands are right in front

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.940 
and then your hands are right in front
of<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.399> all<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.580> time<00:01:46.729> to<00:01:47.060> helping<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.539> leg

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
of you all the time to helping the leg

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.380 
of you all the time to helping the leg
and<00:01:48.950> you're<00:01:49.070> pushing<00:01:49.310> also<00:01:49.789> with<00:01:49.940> your<00:01:50.060> hands

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
and you're pushing also with your hands

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.090 
and you're pushing also with your hands
to<00:01:50.539> actually<00:01:50.660> maintain<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.560> grab<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.860> speed

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
to actually maintain and grab the speed

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.590 
to actually maintain and grab the speed
I<00:01:52.280> was<00:01:52.460> very<00:01:52.670> very<00:01:52.789> important<00:01:53.210> if<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.330> want<00:01:53.420> to

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
I was very very important if you want to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.139 
I was very very important if you want to
go<00:01:53.720> fast<00:01:53.990> now<00:01:54.500> there's<00:01:54.860> also<00:01:55.160> when<00:01:55.970> you're

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
go fast now there's also when you're

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.300 
go fast now there's also when you're
generating<00:01:56.570> all<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.170> speed<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:57.830> there's<00:01:58.070> so

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
generating all the speed and there's so

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.210 
generating all the speed and there's so
much<00:01:58.460> speed<00:01:58.820> a<00:01:59.119> lot<00:01:59.570> of<00:01:59.720> you<00:01:59.840> guys<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.860> know<00:02:00.979> or

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
much speed a lot of you guys you know or

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.859 
much speed a lot of you guys you know or
those<00:02:01.399> who<00:02:01.580> have<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.759> lot<00:02:01.940> of<00:02:02.030> problems<00:02:02.750> like

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
those who have a lot of problems like

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.219 
those who have a lot of problems like
where<00:02:03.679> they're<00:02:03.830> actually<00:02:04.340> moving<00:02:04.640> or<00:02:05.300> you

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
where they're actually moving or you

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.020 
where they're actually moving or you
know<00:02:06.350> they<00:02:06.500> don't<00:02:06.590> have<00:02:06.710> any<00:02:06.950> control<00:02:07.340> the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
know they don't have any control the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.270 
know they don't have any control the
reason<00:02:08.509> why<00:02:08.929> it's<00:02:09.110> happening<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.649> because<00:02:09.950> one

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
reason why it's happening is because one

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.940 
reason why it's happening is because one
leg<00:02:10.550> is<00:02:10.850> pulling<00:02:11.300> more<00:02:12.080> than<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.530> other<00:02:12.680> ones

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
leg is pulling more than the other ones

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.530 
leg is pulling more than the other ones
so<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.250> position<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.819> your<00:02:13.850> legs<00:02:13.940> are<00:02:14.269> not<00:02:14.390> in

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
so the position of your legs are not in

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.870 
so the position of your legs are not in
the<00:02:14.630> right<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.440> right<00:02:15.560> position<00:02:16.160> keep<00:02:16.700> in

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
the right and the right position keep in

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.610 
the right and the right position keep in
mind<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.390> if<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:17.630> bring<00:02:17.870> both<00:02:18.049> legs<00:02:18.110> at<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
mind that if you bring both legs at the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.030 
mind that if you bring both legs at the
same<00:02:18.890> time<00:02:19.329> then<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:21.560> will<00:02:21.769> give<00:02:21.950> you

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
same time then that will give you

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.400 
same time then that will give you
control<00:02:22.489> as<00:02:22.970> well<00:02:23.360> as<00:02:23.480> bringing<00:02:23.840> your<00:02:24.019> hands

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
control as well as bringing your hands

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.720 
control as well as bringing your hands
together<00:02:24.650> it's<00:02:25.190> kind<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.400> like<00:02:25.489> when<00:02:25.640> you

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
together it's kind of like when you

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.580 
together it's kind of like when you
learn<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.150> backspin<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:27.320> know<00:02:27.410> when<00:02:27.530> you

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
learn in a backspin you know when you

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.430 
learn in a backspin you know when you
learn<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.739> backspin<00:02:28.370> if<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.390> bring<00:02:29.570> one<00:02:29.630> leg<00:02:29.840> in

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
learn a backspin if you bring one leg in

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.920 
learn a backspin if you bring one leg in
and<00:02:30.650> then<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.040> leave<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.220> other<00:02:31.400> one<00:02:31.930> open

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
and then you leave the other one open

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.920 
and then you leave the other one open
you<00:02:33.410> actually<00:02:33.829> get<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.100> travel<00:02:34.579> and<00:02:34.810> then<00:02:35.810> you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
you actually get to travel and then you

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.420 
you actually get to travel and then you
lose<00:02:36.110> control<00:02:36.320> especially<00:02:36.769> if<00:02:37.130> you're<00:02:37.250> going

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
lose control especially if you're going

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.400 
lose control especially if you're going
faster<00:02:37.880> same<00:02:38.269> concept<00:02:38.750> here<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.320> the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
faster same concept here in the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.990 
faster same concept here in the
husband's<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.310> bring<00:02:40.549> you<00:02:40.640> want<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.850> bring

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
husband's you bring you want to bring

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.150 
husband's you bring you want to bring
both<00:02:41.329> legs<00:02:41.360> at<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.959> same<00:02:42.170> time<00:02:42.440> with<00:02:43.130> your

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
both legs at the same time with your

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.979 
both legs at the same time with your
arms<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:43.940> that<00:02:44.150> will<00:02:44.299> maintain<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.810> in<00:02:44.900> a

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
arms and that will maintain you in a

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.400 
arms and that will maintain you in a
perfect<00:02:45.440> spot<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:46.549> do<00:02:46.760> not<00:02:46.910> move<00:02:47.410> these

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
perfect spot so you do not move these

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.530 
perfect spot so you do not move these
are<00:02:48.590> some<00:02:49.070> of<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.250> major<00:02:49.820> problems<00:02:50.180> that

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
are some of the major problems that

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.479 
are some of the major problems that
people<00:02:50.989> have<00:02:51.380> when<00:02:51.590> they<00:02:51.709> get<00:02:51.860> into<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.100> bicycle

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
people have when they get into a bicycle

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.280 
people have when they get into a bicycle
position<00:02:53.060> when<00:02:53.630> they're<00:02:53.780> doing<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.079> head

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
position when they're doing the head

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.190 
position when they're doing the head
spins<00:02:54.590> what<00:02:55.340> happens<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.900> leg

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
spins what happens is that the leg

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.000 
spins what happens is that the leg
that's<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.709> front<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:59.720> seems<00:03:00.109> to<00:03:00.530> actually

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
that's in the front it seems to actually

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.000 
that's in the front it seems to actually
drag<00:03:01.310> down<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.970> goes<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.390> way<00:03:02.450> in<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.470> reason

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
drag down it goes this way in the reason

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.569 
drag down it goes this way in the reason
that<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.880> is<00:03:04.910> because<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.720> back<00:03:05.959> leg<00:03:06.290> is

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
that is is because the back leg is

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.400 
that is is because the back leg is
actually<00:03:07.579> not

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
actually not

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.040 
actually not
stop<00:03:08.590> pull<00:03:08.890> back<00:03:09.160> it's<00:03:10.030> gotta<00:03:10.240> be<00:03:10.450> pulled<00:03:10.750> back

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
stop pull back it's gotta be pulled back

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.590 
stop pull back it's gotta be pulled back
and<00:03:11.410> then<00:03:11.740> once<00:03:12.520> you<00:03:12.700> pull<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:13.120> back<00:03:13.360> then

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
and then once you pull that back then

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.640 
and then once you pull that back then
the<00:03:13.720> leg<00:03:13.990> in<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.170> front<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.920> rises<00:03:15.910> then

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
the leg in the front it rises then

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.890 
the leg in the front it rises then
leveled<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.860> then<00:03:18.310> also<00:03:18.610> you<00:03:19.330> gotta<00:03:19.570> have<00:03:19.780> it

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
leveled and then also you gotta have it

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.370 
leveled and then also you gotta have it
steady

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
steady

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.960 
steady
it's<00:03:20.560> gotta<00:03:20.710> be<00:03:20.830> strong<00:03:21.190> your<00:03:21.400> legs<00:03:21.640> gotta<00:03:21.820> be

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
it's gotta be strong your legs gotta be

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.630 
it's gotta be strong your legs gotta be
strong<00:03:22.330> if<00:03:22.750> it's<00:03:23.080> not<00:03:23.260> strong<00:03:23.650> it's<00:03:24.280> gonna<00:03:24.430> be

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
strong if it's not strong it's gonna be

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.250 
strong if it's not strong it's gonna be
on<00:03:24.760> wobbly<00:03:25.000> like<00:03:25.360> this<00:03:25.540> so<00:03:25.900> then<00:03:26.080> that

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
on wobbly like this so then that

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.540 
on wobbly like this so then that
therefore<00:03:26.530> it's<00:03:27.040> going<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.250> bring<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.520> down

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
therefore it's going to bring you down

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.890 
therefore it's going to bring you down
so<00:03:28.030> very<00:03:28.600> important<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.590> bring<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:30.010> back<00:03:30.220> leg

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
so very important to bring the back leg

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.390 
so very important to bring the back leg
all<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:31.960> way<00:03:32.020> the<00:03:32.230> back<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.740> then<00:03:33.010> this<00:03:33.190> one

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
all the way the back and then this one

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.550 
all the way the back and then this one
crisis<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.420> I'll<00:03:34.540> show<00:03:34.750> you<00:03:34.780> an<00:03:34.930> example<00:03:35.050> for

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
crisis and I'll show you an example for

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.160 
crisis and I'll show you an example for
that<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:36.610> I'm<00:03:36.730> gonna<00:03:36.850> demonstrate<00:03:37.120> what<00:03:38.080> I'm

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
that so I'm gonna demonstrate what I'm

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.020 
that so I'm gonna demonstrate what I'm
talking<00:03:38.500> about<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:39.100> position<00:03:39.580> of<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.760> legs

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
talking about the position of the legs

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.330 
talking about the position of the legs
on<00:03:40.270> a<00:03:40.330> bike<00:03:40.510> in<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.900> bicycle<00:03:41.320> position<00:03:41.740> when

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
on a bike in a bicycle position when

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.220 
on a bike in a bicycle position when
most<00:03:42.520> people<00:03:42.880> have<00:03:43.000> problems<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:43.810> why<00:03:44.050> they

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
most people have problems and why they

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.690 
most people have problems and why they
fall<00:03:44.590> down<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:48.370> you<00:03:48.460> start<00:03:48.910> here<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.740> you<00:03:50.740> want

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
fall down so you start here and you want

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.650 
fall down so you start here and you want
to<00:03:51.760> go<00:03:51.910> here<00:03:52.950> most<00:03:53.950> people<00:03:54.460> they<00:03:55.240> do<00:03:55.300> this

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
to go here most people they do this

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.660 
to go here most people they do this
they've<00:03:56.590> been<00:03:56.830> on<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.190> on<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.770> on<00:03:59.770> the<00:04:00.430> waist

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
they've been on the on the on the waist

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.990 
they've been on the on the on the waist
and<00:04:01.140> then<00:04:02.140> when<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.530> spin<00:04:02.860> this<00:04:03.310> leg<00:04:03.580> drags

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
decision that right away to that bicycle

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.680 
decision that right away to that bicycle
position<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:05.070> I<00:05:05.190> my<00:05:05.610> legs<00:05:05.820> are<00:05:05.970> very<00:05:06.000> steady
