how to mask an image I won't be covering

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.510 
how to mask an image I won't be covering
a<00:00:13.700> masking<00:00:14.719> idea<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:16.049> general<00:00:16.080> um<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:17.160> too

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
a masking idea in general um it's too

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.590 
a masking idea in general um it's too
big<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.880> there's<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> lot<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.210> stuff<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.570> can

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
big and there's a lot of stuff you can

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.720 
big and there's a lot of stuff you can
do<00:00:18.810> with<00:00:18.840> masking<00:00:19.410> but<00:00:19.680> I'll<00:00:20.039> separate<00:00:20.550> these

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
do with masking but I'll separate these

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.790 
do with masking but I'll separate these
into<00:00:21.060> different<00:00:21.840> tutorials<00:00:22.260> like<00:00:22.500> how<00:00:22.740> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
into different tutorials like how to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.650 
into different tutorials like how to
mask<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.220> moving<00:00:23.490> object<00:00:23.670> how<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.269> rotoscope

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
mask a moving object how to rotoscope

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.740 
mask a moving object how to rotoscope
and<00:00:25.019> things<00:00:25.859> like<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.910> today's<00:00:27.510> tutorial

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
and things like that so today's tutorial

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.830 
and things like that so today's tutorial
just<00:00:28.429> sticking<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:29.460> how<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.060> mask<00:00:30.330> an<00:00:30.539> image

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
just sticking with how to mask an image

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.229 
just sticking with how to mask an image
so<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.710> an<00:00:31.830> image<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.550> timeline<00:00:32.820> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
so you have an image on the timeline and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.389 
so you have an image on the timeline and
to<00:00:33.840> get<00:00:34.020> into<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> masking<00:00:34.680> window<00:00:35.010> all<00:00:35.219> you

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
to get into the masking window all you

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.549 
to get into the masking window all you
have<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.960> click<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> event

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
masking option utter d position so let's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.630 
masking option utter d position so let's
go<00:00:48.989> ahead<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.230> enable<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.860> will<00:00:50.160> go<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> your

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
go ahead and enable that will go to your

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.400 
go ahead and enable that will go to your
masking<00:00:51.059> window<00:00:51.329> now<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.199> you're<00:00:52.320> ever

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
masking window now if you're ever

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.709 
masking window now if you're ever
switching<00:00:52.860> between<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.460> crop<00:00:53.789> window<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
switching between your crop window to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.110 
switching between your crop window to
your<00:00:54.750> masking<00:00:55.289> window<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.579> easy<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
your masking window it's really easy the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.869 
your masking window it's really easy the
crop<00:00:57.539> window<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.710> top<00:00:59.160> keyframe<00:00:59.730> right

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
crop window is the top keyframe right

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.930 
crop window is the top keyframe right
here<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.840> masking<00:01:01.230> keyframe<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.949> below

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
here and the masking keyframe is below

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.490 
here and the masking keyframe is below
that<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.449> you're<00:01:03.600> ever<00:01:03.809> trying<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> go<00:01:04.290> back

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
that so if you're ever trying to go back

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.310 
that so if you're ever trying to go back
to<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.090> cropping<00:01:06.090> window<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.659> want<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> click

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
to the cropping window you want to click

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.640 
to the cropping window you want to click
the<00:01:07.590> first<00:01:07.890> keyframe<00:01:09.170> let's<00:01:10.170> go<00:01:10.260> back<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the first keyframe let's go back to the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.649 
the first keyframe let's go back to the
masking<00:01:11.010> window<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.460> I'll<00:01:12.000> explain<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> list

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
masking window and I'll explain the list

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.170 
masking window and I'll explain the list
of<00:01:12.810> tools<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.290> are<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:14.369> left<00:01:14.700> hand<00:01:14.850> side

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
of tools that are on this left hand side

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.749 
of tools that are on this left hand side
so<00:01:16.080> first<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.979> normal<00:01:17.159> at<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> tool

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
so first you have a normal at a tool

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.330 
so first you have a normal at a tool
where<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.270> move<00:01:18.390> around<00:01:18.570> your<00:01:18.810> image<00:01:19.340> you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
where you can move around your image you

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.640 
where you can move around your image you
have<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> Annika<00:01:21.000> tool<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.049> anchor<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> oh

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
have the Annika tool or the anchor to oh

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.060 
have the Annika tool or the anchor to oh
my<00:01:22.830> bad<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:24.270> create<00:01:24.659> points<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.590> connect<00:01:25.920> your

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
my bad to create points to connect your

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.149 
my bad to create points to connect your
mask<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.720> your<00:01:27.930> deletion<00:01:28.290> tool<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.770> delete

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
mask and your deletion tool to delete

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.020 
mask and your deletion tool to delete
points<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:30.619> split<00:01:31.619> tangent<00:01:32.159> tool<00:01:32.310> which

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
points a split tangent tool which

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.490 
points a split tangent tool which
basically<00:01:33.450> kind<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:35.299> if<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:37.320> really

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
basically kind of if you it's really

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.319 
basically kind of if you it's really
complicated<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.220> make<00:01:38.520> two<00:01:38.729> points<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.210> n

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
complicated if you make two points of n

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.870 
complicated if you make two points of n
you<00:01:39.540> i<00:01:39.780> use<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.590> split<00:01:40.860> tangent<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.460> little

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
you i use the split tangent to little

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.190 
you i use the split tangent to little
create<00:01:42.590> two<00:01:43.590> or<00:01:43.890> three<00:01:44.100> lines<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:45.540> go<00:01:45.869> off<00:01:46.020> in

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
create two or three lines that go off in

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.560 
create two or three lines that go off in
opposite<00:01:46.829> directions<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:48.270> don't<00:01:48.390> use

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
opposite directions I really don't use

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.859 
opposite directions I really don't use
this<00:01:48.689> tool<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.799> course<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> next<00:01:50.430> two

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
this tool and of course the next two

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.620 
this tool and of course the next two
tools<00:01:51.869> are<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.470> rectangle<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.250> circle

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
tools are the rectangle and circle

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.910 
tools are the rectangle and circle
masking<00:01:54.630> tool<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.770> just

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
masking tool and this is just

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.789 
masking tool and this is just
implemented<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.640> Sony<00:01:56.880> Vegas<00:01:56.969> Pro<00:01:57.240> 12

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
implemented in Sony Vegas Pro 12

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.170 
implemented in Sony Vegas Pro 12
basically<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.100> make<00:01:59.280> shapes<00:01:59.939> like

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
basically you can just make shapes like

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.740 
basically you can just make shapes like
these<00:02:00.680> if<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.799> wanted<00:02:02.070> to

which is kind of useful yeah resume at a

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.300 
which is kind of useful yeah resume at a
tool<00:02:07.910> navel<00:02:08.910> snapping<00:02:09.450> which<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.050> uh<00:02:10.160> if<00:02:11.160> you

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
tool navel snapping which is uh if you

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.370 
tool navel snapping which is uh if you
want<00:02:11.550> your<00:02:11.640> mask<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:12.300> be<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> grid<00:02:12.990> it'll

want your mask to be on a grid it'll

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.350 
want your mask to be on a grid it'll
stop<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> specific<00:02:14.250> points<00:02:14.850> instead<00:02:15.180> of

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
stop to a specific points instead of

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.900 
stop to a specific points instead of
allowing<00:02:15.960> you<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.350> move<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.280> around<00:02:17.400> freely

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
allowing you to move it around freely

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
allowing you to move it around freely
and<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:19.410> have<00:02:19.560> your<00:02:20.030> move<00:02:21.030> x<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.510> y<00:02:21.600> which<00:02:21.810> is

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
and you have your move x and y which is

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.330 
and you have your move x and y which is
basically<00:02:22.230> allowing<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.040> move<00:02:23.160> your

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
basically allowing you to move your

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.530 
basically allowing you to move your
points<00:02:23.850> in<00:02:24.570> any<00:02:24.750> direction<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:26.090> first<00:02:27.090> off<00:02:27.300> to

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
points in any direction so first off to

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.660 
points in any direction so first off to
create<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.959> mask<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.740> need<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.130> select<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
you can in After Effects so you you

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.470 
you can in After Effects so you you
would<00:02:46.530> want<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.860> find<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.310> good<00:02:47.610> position<00:02:48.120> to

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
would want to find a good position to

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.090 
would want to find a good position to
masking<00:02:49.110> where<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.380> don't<00:02:49.590> have<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.950> move

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
masking where you don't have to move

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.370 
masking where you don't have to move
around<00:02:50.280> your<00:02:50.610> window<00:02:50.910> because<00:02:51.840> if<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.260> ever

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
around your window because if you ever

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.240 
around your window because if you ever
tried<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:53.600> mask<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:55.080> then<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.800> have<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.040> move

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
tried to mask and then you have to move

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.240 
tried to mask and then you have to move
closer<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.239> side<00:02:57.570> you'll<00:02:58.500> have<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.830> go

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
closer to the side you'll have to go

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.800 
closer to the side you'll have to go
ahead<00:02:59.489> and<00:03:01.670> move<00:03:02.670> around<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.270> as<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.690> can<00:03:03.780> see

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
ahead and move around and as you can see

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.080 
ahead and move around and as you can see
the<00:03:04.110> points<00:03:04.470> for<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.860> mask<00:03:05.100> disappears<00:03:05.850> and

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
the points for the mask disappears and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.880 
the points for the mask disappears and
once<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.900> go<00:03:07.020> back<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.380> Incan<00:03:07.680> creation

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
once you go back to the Incan creation

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.530 
once you go back to the Incan creation
tool<00:03:08.220> wait<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.519> click<00:03:08.730> on<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.060> again<00:03:09.090> and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
tool wait to click on it again and

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.500 
tool wait to click on it again and
sometimes<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.560> mask<00:03:10.799> kind<00:03:11.489> of<00:03:11.640> expands<00:03:12.209> if<00:03:12.390> you

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
sometimes a mask kind of expands if you

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.270 
sometimes a mask kind of expands if you
click<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.410> again<00:03:13.500> if<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.950> want<00:03:14.130> to

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
click on it again if you want to

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.210 
click on it again if you want to
continue<00:03:14.519> your<00:03:14.820> mask<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.390> sometimes<00:03:15.959> I

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
continue your mask so sometimes I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.070 
continue your mask so sometimes I
usually<00:03:17.220> like<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.370> start<00:03:17.700> off<00:03:18.049> with<00:03:19.049> a

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
usually like to start off with a

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.890 
usually like to start off with a
position<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.680> i<00:03:19.890> can<00:03:20.250> work<00:03:20.540> entirely<00:03:21.540> with

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
position that i can work entirely with

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.979 
position that i can work entirely with
without<00:03:22.230> having<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.650> move<00:03:22.950> around<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.760> image

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
without having to move around the image

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.300 
without having to move around the image
so<00:03:24.989> I'll<00:03:25.170> go<00:03:25.230> ahead<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.410> delete<00:03:25.620> all<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.130> mask

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
so I'll go ahead and delete all the mask

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.590 
so I'll go ahead and delete all the mask
I'm<00:03:26.640> going<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.820> show<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.000> how<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.150> mask<00:03:27.420> an

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
I'm going to show you how to mask an

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.680 
I'm going to show you how to mask an
image<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.850> you<00:03:29.850> want<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.090> go<00:03:30.180> ahead<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.510> start

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
image so you want to go ahead and start

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.280 
image so you want to go ahead and start
at<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> point<00:03:32.000> click<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.209> basically<00:03:33.870> what<00:03:34.200> we

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
at a point click and basically what we

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.830 
at a point click and basically what we
want<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.530> do<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.860> click<00:03:35.250> around<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.730> image<00:03:35.910> or

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
want to do is click around the image or

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.220 
want to do is click around the image or
the<00:03:37.019> shape<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.560> want<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.799> mask<00:03:38.070> and

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
the shape that you want to mask and

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.890 
the shape that you want to mask and
basically<00:03:40.230> that's<00:03:40.829> really<00:03:41.640> all<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.820> do<00:03:42.120> so

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
basically that's really all you do so

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:55.600 
basically that's really all you do so
I'm<00:03:42.959> go<00:03:43.140> ahead<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:43.590> mask<00:03:44.070> around<00:03:44.489> this<00:03:44.790> image

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.559 

so<00:03:56.610> basically<00:03:56.970> when<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.209> have<00:03:57.390> your<00:03:57.510> first

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
so basically when you have your first

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.770 
so basically when you have your first
mask<00:03:58.080> done<00:03:58.549> it'll<00:03:59.549> give<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.879> an<00:04:00.000> options<00:04:00.510> a

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
mask done it'll give you an options a

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.289 
mask done it'll give you an options a
list<00:04:01.379> of<00:04:01.500> options<00:04:01.860> called<00:04:02.159> mask<00:04:02.430> position<00:04:03.060> and

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
list of options called mask position and

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.740 
list of options called mask position and
path<00:04:04.129> position<00:04:05.129> to<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.340> mask<00:04:05.580> is<00:04:05.819> just<00:04:06.390> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
path position to the mask is just the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.430 
path position to the mask is just the
overall<00:04:06.989> position<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.519> mask<00:04:08.930> apply<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:09.989> FX

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
overall position of the mask apply to FX

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.430 
overall position of the mask apply to FX
is<00:04:11.180> basically<00:04:12.180> if<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.720> apply<00:04:13.049> a<00:04:14.720> video<00:04:15.720> FX<00:04:16.109> to

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
is basically if you apply a video FX to

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.000 
is basically if you apply a video FX to
mask<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:20.220> then<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:20.970> can<00:04:21.150> choose<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:22.010> apply

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
mask and then you can choose to apply

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.080 
mask and then you can choose to apply
the<00:04:23.930> FX<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.289> entire<00:04:25.530> image<00:04:25.770> or<00:04:26.130> not<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:27.030> I'm

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
the FX to the entire image or not so I'm

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.840 
the FX to the entire image or not so I'm
go<00:04:27.270> ahead<00:04:27.449> and<00:04:27.570> take<00:04:27.750> off<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:29.430> color

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
go ahead and take off the color

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.430 
go ahead and take off the color
corrector<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:32.580> path<00:04:32.760> is<00:04:33.440> basically

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
corrector and the path is basically

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.040 
corrector and the path is basically
where<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:34.830> can<00:04:35.010> fine-tune<00:04:35.669> your<00:04:35.940> mask<00:04:36.330> so<00:04:36.720> if

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
where you can fine-tune your mask so if

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.180 
where you can fine-tune your mask so if
you<00:04:37.199> have<00:04:37.320> a<00:04:37.560> mode<00:04:39.740> positive<00:04:40.740> means<00:04:40.949> that

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
you have a mode positive means that

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.310 
you have a mode positive means that
whatever<00:04:41.370> you<00:04:41.580> masked<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.810> inside<00:04:43.110> of<00:04:43.229> it

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
whatever you masked the inside of it

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.250 
whatever you masked the inside of it
stays<00:04:43.560> in<00:04:44.030> he<00:04:45.030> said<00:04:45.180> it's<00:04:45.360> negative<00:04:45.570> whatever

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
stays in he said it's negative whatever

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.200 
stays in he said it's negative whatever
you<00:04:46.470> masked<00:04:46.889> on<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.100> inside<00:04:47.400> disappears<00:04:48.030> and

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
you masked on the inside disappears and

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.719 
you masked on the inside disappears and
only<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.289> outside<00:04:49.620> of<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.830> mask<00:04:50.039> will<00:04:50.340> appear

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
only the outside of the mask will appear

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.779 
only the outside of the mask will appear
and<00:04:52.039> disabled<00:04:53.039> means<00:04:53.220> everything<00:04:53.669> just

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
and disabled means everything just

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.029 
and disabled means everything just
disappears<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:55.200> I'm<00:04:55.289> gonna<00:04:55.380> go<00:04:55.470> ahead<00:04:55.500> set<00:04:55.950> it

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
disappears so I'm gonna go ahead set it

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.850 
disappears so I'm gonna go ahead set it
back<00:04:56.130> positive<00:04:56.729> I'll<00:04:57.560> anti-alias<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.710> don't

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
back positive I'll anti-alias you don't

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.710 
back positive I'll anti-alias you don't
have<00:04:58.950> to<00:04:59.010> worry<00:04:59.160> about<00:04:59.539> opacity<00:05:00.539> is<00:05:01.190> basically

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
have to worry about opacity is basically

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.930 
have to worry about opacity is basically
how<00:05:03.720> you<00:05:04.139> know<00:05:04.620> how<00:05:04.800> transparent<00:05:05.669> you<00:05:05.729> want

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
how you know how transparent you want

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.180 
how you know how transparent you want
two<00:05:06.060> masks<00:05:06.450> to<00:05:06.539> be<00:05:06.690> since<00:05:07.560> there<00:05:07.740> isn't<00:05:08.039> any

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
two masks to be since there isn't any

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.440 
two masks to be since there isn't any
image<00:05:08.550> below<00:05:08.849> this<00:05:09.470> image<00:05:10.940> obviously<00:05:11.940> if<00:05:12.270> you

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
image below this image obviously if you

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.360 
image below this image obviously if you
turned<00:05:12.690> out<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.960> opacity<00:05:13.260> it<00:05:13.710> will<00:05:13.860> start<00:05:14.280> to

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
turned out the opacity it will start to

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.390 
turned out the opacity it will start to
fade<00:05:14.669> to<00:05:14.820> black<00:05:14.940> and<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:16.680> feather<00:05:16.919> type<00:05:17.190> is

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
fade to black and the feather type is

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.570 
fade to black and the feather type is
where<00:05:18.030> you<00:05:18.210> can<00:05:18.419> actually<00:05:19.070> if<00:05:20.070> your<00:05:20.250> mask<00:05:20.430> is

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
where you can actually if your mask is

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.839 
where you can actually if your mask is
really<00:05:20.880> messy<00:05:21.090> you<00:05:21.270> can<00:05:21.479> sort<00:05:22.410> of<00:05:22.560> almost<00:05:22.849> fix

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
really messy you can sort of almost fix

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.089 
really messy you can sort of almost fix
your<00:05:24.000> mask<00:05:24.210> so<00:05:24.900> if<00:05:25.169> you<00:05:25.349> set<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.800> feather

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
your mask so if you set the feather

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.170 
your mask so if you set the feather
types<00:05:26.400> in<00:05:27.349> your<00:05:28.349> basically<00:05:29.060> shrinking<00:05:30.060> the

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
types in your basically shrinking the

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.620 
types in your basically shrinking the
max<00:05:30.419> there<00:05:31.020> there<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.770> mask<00:05:32.330> so<00:05:33.330> you<00:05:33.389> have<00:05:33.539> the

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
max there there the mask so you have the

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.480 
max there there the mask so you have the
feather<00:05:33.810> percent<00:05:34.199> and<00:05:34.349> as<00:05:34.710> you<00:05:34.949> increase<00:05:35.250> the

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
feather percent and as you increase the

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.450 
feather percent and as you increase the
feather<00:05:35.669> percent<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.270> other<00:05:36.360> type<00:05:36.800> will<00:05:37.800> kind

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
feather percent the other type will kind

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.089 
feather percent the other type will kind
of<00:05:38.520> shrink<00:05:38.789> the<00:05:38.940> masks<00:05:39.300> so<00:05:39.449> if<00:05:39.539> I<00:05:39.630> set<00:05:39.810> it<00:05:39.900> to

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
of shrink the masks so if I set it to

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:45.390 
of shrink the masks so if I set it to
five<00:05:41.099> percent

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.040 

it'll<00:05:46.400> soften<00:05:46.789> up<00:05:47.030> the<00:05:47.060> edges<00:05:47.300> but<00:05:47.660> shrink

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
it'll soften up the edges but shrink

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.710 
it'll soften up the edges but shrink
mask'<00:05:48.289> as<00:05:48.560> well<00:05:48.800> feather<00:05:49.789> type<00:05:50.000> out<00:05:50.210> does<00:05:50.509> the

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
mask' as well feather type out does the

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.379 
mask' as well feather type out does the
opposite<00:05:51.620> thing<00:05:51.830> where<00:05:52.069> it'll<00:05:52.400> I'm<00:05:52.940> kind<00:05:53.300> of

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
opposite thing where it'll I'm kind of

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.330 
opposite thing where it'll I'm kind of
spread<00:05:53.629> out<00:05:53.659> but<00:05:54.169> then<00:05:54.409> again<00:05:54.500> smooth<00:05:55.039> out<00:05:55.190> the

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
spread out but then again smooth out the

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.999 
spread out but then again smooth out the
edges<00:05:55.370> so<00:05:55.879> that's<00:05:56.090> it<00:05:56.930> won't<00:05:57.139> look<00:05:57.289> as<00:05:57.500> jagged

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
edges so that's it won't look as jagged

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.119 
edges so that's it won't look as jagged
as<00:05:58.310> it<00:05:58.490> was<00:05:58.639> if<00:05:58.879> I<00:05:59.000> said<00:05:59.180> it's<00:05:59.300> a<00:05:59.360> 0%<00:06:00.039> and<00:06:01.039> the

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129 
as it was if I said it's a 0% and the

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.990 
as it was if I said it's a 0% and the
both<00:06:01.310> it's<00:06:02.030> just<00:06:02.500> again<00:06:03.819> softening<00:06:04.819> the<00:06:04.970> edges

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
both it's just again softening the edges

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.330 
both it's just again softening the edges
but<00:06:05.509> it's<00:06:05.629> not<00:06:05.780> exactly<00:06:06.650> shrinking<00:06:07.220> or

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
but it's not exactly shrinking or

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:15.480 
but it's not exactly shrinking or
expanding<00:06:08.180> the<00:06:08.240> mask<00:06:12.340> so<00:06:13.340> after<00:06:14.000> that

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
expanding the mask so after that

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.740 
expanding the mask so after that
basically<00:06:16.490> if<00:06:16.669> you<00:06:16.759> have<00:06:16.849> little<00:06:17.030> gaps<00:06:17.419> in

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
basically if you have little gaps in

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.529 
basically if you have little gaps in
your<00:06:17.810> image<00:06:18.199> that<00:06:18.470> you<00:06:18.590> want<00:06:18.620> to<00:06:19.330> take<00:06:20.330> out

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
your image that you want to take out

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.260 
your image that you want to take out
after<00:06:21.409> you<00:06:21.500> made<00:06:21.650> your<00:06:21.800> first<00:06:21.919> mask<00:06:22.280> like<00:06:23.210> this

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
after you made your first mask like this

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.379 
after you made your first mask like this
little<00:06:23.569> spot<00:06:24.080> right<00:06:24.139> here<00:06:24.759> you<00:06:25.759> don't<00:06:25.940> want<00:06:26.090> to

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
little spot right here you don't want to

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.930 
little spot right here you don't want to
make<00:06:26.659> a<00:06:26.690> new<00:06:27.020> masking<00:06:27.590> shape<00:06:27.860> so<00:06:28.490> that's

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
make a new masking shape so that's

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.050 
make a new masking shape so that's
really<00:06:29.150> easy<00:06:29.300> all<00:06:29.750> you<00:06:29.810> have<00:06:30.020> to<00:06:30.169> do<00:06:30.319> is<00:06:31.060> grab

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
really easy all you have to do is grab

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.029 
really easy all you have to do is grab
the<00:06:32.330> anchor<00:06:32.630> creation<00:06:33.050> tool<00:06:33.199> and<00:06:33.470> start<00:06:33.949> a<00:06:34.009> new

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.279 
the anchor creation tool and start a new
mask<00:06:34.630> then<00:06:35.630> again<00:06:35.840> you<00:06:35.960> want<00:06:36.050> to<00:06:36.139> make<00:06:36.199> sure

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
mask then again you want to make sure

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.499 
mask then again you want to make sure
that<00:06:36.409> doesn't<00:06:36.560> interfere<00:06:37.039> with<00:06:37.550> your

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:38.509 
that doesn't interfere with your

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:40.029 
that doesn't interfere with your
original<00:06:38.690> masport<00:06:39.380> and<00:06:39.500> you<00:06:39.560> point<00:06:39.800> to<00:06:39.889> that

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
original masport and you point to that

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.089 
original masport and you point to that
so<00:06:40.340> we<00:06:40.430> want<00:06:40.580> to<00:06:40.669> go<00:06:40.729> ahead<00:06:40.759> and<00:06:41.919> just<00:06:42.919> make

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:43.099 
so we want to go ahead and just make

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:47.779 
so we want to go ahead and just make
another<00:06:43.719> quick<00:06:44.719> mask

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:47.789 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:49.680 

and<00:06:48.789> once<00:06:48.910> you've<00:06:49.030> done<00:06:49.120> that<00:06:49.180> you<00:06:49.449> want<00:06:49.630> to

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
and once you've done that you want to

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.499 
and once you've done that you want to
make<00:06:50.229> sure<00:06:50.259> that<00:06:50.500> the<00:06:51.370> mode<00:06:51.639> instead<00:06:51.880> of<00:06:52.210> being

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:52.509 
make sure that the mode instead of being

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:54.510 
make sure that the mode instead of being
positive<00:06:53.050> we<00:06:53.530> want<00:06:53.740> it<00:06:53.800> to<00:06:53.889> be<00:06:53.979> negative<00:06:54.190> and

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
positive we want it to be negative and

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.900 
positive we want it to be negative and
that<00:06:54.660> will<00:06:55.660> take<00:06:55.900> out<00:06:56.080> this<00:06:56.410> little<00:06:56.710> area<00:06:57.550> that

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 
that will take out this little area that

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.120 
that will take out this little area that
you<00:06:58.000> don't<00:06:58.240> want<00:06:58.479> to<00:06:59.289> be<00:06:59.470> included<00:06:59.830> in<00:07:00.039> the

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.400 
you don't want to be included in the
mask<00:07:00.370> and<00:07:00.639> you<00:07:01.210> can<00:07:01.360> create<00:07:01.539> as<00:07:01.690> many<00:07:01.720> masks<00:07:02.289> as
