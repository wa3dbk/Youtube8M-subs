hey<00:00:00.750> we're<00:00:00.989> brick<00:00:01.170> Bunch<00:00:01.410> USA<00:00:02.040> and<00:00:02.370> we've

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hey we're brick Bunch USA and we've

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.140 
hey we're brick Bunch USA and we've
taken<00:00:03.330> off<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.750> front<00:00:04.020> wall<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.740> our<00:00:05.150> lego

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
taken off the front wall of our lego

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.680 
taken off the front wall of our lego
brick<00:00:06.660> theater<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.710> if<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:09.179> haven't<00:00:09.510> seen

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
brick theater and if you haven't seen

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.990 
brick theater and if you haven't seen
the<00:00:09.809> video<00:00:09.929> already<00:00:10.410> there<00:00:11.160> will<00:00:11.370> be<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.550> link

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
the video already there will be a link

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.839 
the video already there will be a link
at<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.179> end<00:00:12.300> but<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.460> front<00:00:14.670> wall

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
at the end but this is the front wall

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.700 
at the end but this is the front wall
and<00:00:15.170> it<00:00:16.170> perfectly<00:00:16.890> fits<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.720> 32<00:00:19.230> by<00:00:19.380> 32

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
and it perfectly fits on a 32 by 32

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.490 
and it perfectly fits on a 32 by 32
baseplate<00:00:20.250> because<00:00:20.520> we've<00:00:20.699> proportionate

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
baseplate because we've proportionate

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.769 
baseplate because we've proportionate
proportioned<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.619> correctly<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.480> start

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
proportioned it correctly so we start

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.970 
proportioned it correctly so we start
with<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.960> C<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:26.400> spells<00:00:26.760> out<00:00:27.029> cinema<00:00:28.019> which

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
with a C and it spells out cinema which

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.790 
with a C and it spells out cinema which
seems<00:00:29.310> perfect<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.090> movie<00:00:30.480> theater<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.619> we

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
seems perfect for a movie theater so we

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.979 
seems perfect for a movie theater so we
start<00:00:32.040> with<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.250> C<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.880> exactly<00:00:33.270> 4

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
start with the C and it's exactly 4

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:34.790 
start with the C and it's exactly 4
bricks

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
bricks

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.010 
bricks
tall<00:00:35.219> with<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.969> little<00:00:36.239> window<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.750> then<00:00:36.870> we

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
tall with a little window and then we

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.139 
tall with a little window and then we
move<00:00:37.170> over<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> eye<00:00:37.860> which<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.640> another

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
move over to the eye which is another

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.940 
move over to the eye which is another
four<00:00:39.480> tricks<00:00:39.660> tall<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.230> then<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> end<00:00:40.649> which

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
four tricks tall and then the end which

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.760 
four tricks tall and then the end which
is<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.160> bit<00:00:41.489> longer<00:00:41.910> at<00:00:42.629> about<00:00:43.200> five<00:00:43.469> bricks

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
is a bit longer at about five bricks

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.240 
is a bit longer at about five bricks
long<00:00:44.070> no<00:00:44.460> not<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.059> about<00:00:45.710> exactly<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.160> then

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
long no not just about exactly and then

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.220 
long no not just about exactly and then
we<00:00:47.340> move<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.760> e<00:00:47.879> which<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.629> four<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
we move to the e which is four and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.979 
we move to the e which is four and
you've<00:00:50.129> got<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.270> proportion<00:00:51.840> right

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you've got to get the proportion right

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.600 
you've got to get the proportion right
which<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.379> why<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.680> use<00:00:52.890> some<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.370> flat

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
which is why we use some of the flat

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.270 
which is why we use some of the flat
plates<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.780> Lego<00:00:54.960> gave<00:00:55.260> us<00:00:55.440> oh<00:00:55.680> well<00:00:56.129> they

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
plates the Lego gave us oh well they

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.000 
plates the Lego gave us oh well they
didn't<00:00:56.579> really<00:00:56.730> give<00:00:57.030> us<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.930> got<00:00:58.170> them<00:00:58.410> but

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
didn't really give us we got them but

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.700 
didn't really give us we got them but
they're<00:00:59.460> very<00:00:59.910> nice<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.629> trying<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.469> create

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
they're very nice when trying to create

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.590 
they're very nice when trying to create
stuff<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.250> proportion<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
stuff in proportion and then we have the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.750 
stuff in proportion and then we have the
M<00:01:03.780> which<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> longest<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> bunch<00:01:05.549> but

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
M which is the longest of the bunch but

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.020 
M which is the longest of the bunch but
it<00:01:05.909> had<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.390> then<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.820> which<00:01:08.820> we

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it had to be then we have the a which we

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.789 
it had to be then we have the a which we
did<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.510> whole<00:01:09.659> proportion<00:01:10.260> thing<00:01:10.470> again

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
did the whole proportion thing again

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.359 
did the whole proportion thing again
with<00:01:11.130> two<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:13.049> two<00:01:13.350> by<00:01:13.500> two<00:01:13.530> plates<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.189> as

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
with two of the two by two plates and as

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.359 
with two of the two by two plates and as
who<00:01:14.520> by<00:01:14.670> 4<00:01:14.970> plate<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:17.130> took

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
who by 4 plate in there and we took

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.830 
who by 4 plate in there and we took
advantage<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:18.090> these<00:01:18.270> very<00:01:18.600> nice<00:01:18.869> arch<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:20.159> mean

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
advantage of these very nice arch I mean

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.880 
advantage of these very nice arch I mean
slant<00:01:21.979> pieces<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.229> actually<00:01:25.439> looks

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
slant pieces so that it actually looks

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.399 
slant pieces so that it actually looks
like<00:01:27.200> some<00:01:28.200> letters<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
like some letters and then we have the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.330 
like some letters and then we have the
door<00:01:32.990> where's<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.170> movie<00:01:34.350> theater<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.070> don't

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
door where's the movie theater I don't

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.440 
door where's the movie theater I don't
know<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.630> let's<00:01:36.659> put<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:40.220> sign<00:01:41.220> up<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
know so let's put the sign up on the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.109 
know so let's put the sign up on the
front<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.020> then<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.920> got<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> whole<00:01:44.369> bunch<00:01:44.759> of

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
front and then it's got a whole bunch of

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.030 
front and then it's got a whole bunch of
lights<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:46.140> well<00:01:46.409> as<00:01:46.530> an<00:01:46.649> awning<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:49.040> there's

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
lights as well as an awning and there's

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.660 
lights as well as an awning and there's
it<00:01:50.340> with<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:51.020> backlight<00:01:52.220> those<00:01:53.220> lights<00:01:53.490> are

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
it with a backlight those lights are

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.460 
it with a backlight those lights are
even<00:01:53.909> shining<00:01:54.360> up<00:01:54.479> there<00:01:54.659> that's<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.200> cool

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
even shining up there that's really cool

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.580 
even shining up there that's really cool
no<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.729> did<00:01:56.909> not<00:01:56.939> use<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:57.780> actually<00:01:58.200> my<00:01:58.409> mom

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
no we did not use it's actually my mom

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.920 
no we did not use it's actually my mom
with<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.860> flashlight<00:01:59.570> that's<00:02:00.570> where<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
with a flashlight that's where the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.630 
with a flashlight that's where the
effect<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.469> coming<00:02:01.619> from<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.130> did<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> same

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
effect is coming from we did the same

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.810 
effect is coming from we did the same
effect<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.329> big<00:02:03.840> theatre<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.820> speaking

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
effect on the big theatre and speaking

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.479 
effect on the big theatre and speaking
as<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> big<00:02:06.180> theatre<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.320> link<00:02:07.710> should<00:02:08.340> be

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
as a big theatre the link should be

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.650 
as a big theatre the link should be
coming<00:02:08.789> up

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
coming up
