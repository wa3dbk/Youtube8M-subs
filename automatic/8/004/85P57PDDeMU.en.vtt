00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.410 
overnight because it really softens my
hands<00:03:29.080> you'll<00:03:29.470> mix<00:03:29.680> one<00:03:29.980> teaspoon<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:30.850> almond

tablespoons of plain yogurt this one

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.229 
tablespoons of plain yogurt this one
sounds<00:03:38.769> a<00:03:39.010> little<00:03:39.250> weird<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.640> use<00:03:39.970> but

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
sounds a little weird to use but

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.330 
sounds a little weird to use but
actually<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:40.930> does<00:03:41.230> help<00:03:41.560> blend<00:03:41.980> into<00:03:42.220> a

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
actually it does help blend into a

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.699 
actually it does help blend into a
creamy<00:03:42.700> paste<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.390> smother<00:03:43.840> on<00:03:44.049> your<00:03:44.200> hands

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
then you can slip on a pair of gloves

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.900 
then you can slip on a pair of gloves
and<00:03:46.810> wear<00:03:47.200> throughout<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.860> night<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.610> yogurt
