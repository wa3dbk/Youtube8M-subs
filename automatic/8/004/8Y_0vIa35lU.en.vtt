00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.920
Started ballasting the station tracks.

00:00:26.614 --> 00:00:31.414
Several cable ducts and other (technical) equipment have been placed.

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:36.895
When all ballasting is done, tracks and ballast will be weathered.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.400
On the other end of the station, ballasting work has also been started. A buffer has been placed on the track.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.720
A small signal is placed for de siding. Progress is slow, still a lot of ballasting to do. 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.340
The latest addition to the layout is this Piko BR 186 from the Belgium railways.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:59.500
It will carry freight trains from Zilverdam to Belgium, just like the prototype where this type of locomotive runs from Rotterdam to Belgium.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.460
The staging area of Maasdrecht is now complete. It has 6 track to store trains. 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.740
For smaller trains, track can store up to two trains at once to make the most use of the available space.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.000
Here is a nice line up, of in total 4 trains on the staging tracks.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.900
