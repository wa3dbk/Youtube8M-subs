scared because there's three feral

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.269 
scared because there's three feral
druids<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.080> three<00:00:19.380> bumpkins<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.070> in

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
druids and three bumpkins in this in

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.710 
druids and three bumpkins in this in
this<00:00:20.460> match<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.850> I've<00:00:21.000> been<00:00:21.090> saying<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.539> you

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
this match and I've been saying that you

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.939 
this match and I've been saying that you
know<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.050> game<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.350> definitely<00:00:22.680> not<00:00:22.769> going

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
know this game is definitely not going

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.620 
know this game is definitely not going
into<00:00:23.130> overtime<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.640> know<00:00:23.730> over<00:00:24.240> time<00:00:24.390> when

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
into overtime you know over time when

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.720 
into overtime you know over time when
the<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.230> totems<00:00:25.590> pop<00:00:25.830> up<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.099> fire<00:00:26.369> and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the the totems pop up with fire and

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.250 
the the totems pop up with fire and
there's<00:00:26.880> fire<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.449> arena<00:00:27.660> we're<00:00:28.170> now

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
there's fire in the arena we're now

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.779 
there's fire in the arena we're now
we're<00:00:28.470> not<00:00:28.560> getting<00:00:28.830> there<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.609> gonna<00:00:29.730> be

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
we're not getting there this is gonna be

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.120 
we're not getting there this is gonna be
done<00:00:30.060> within<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.960> first<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.529> five<00:00:31.920> minutes

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
done within the first like five minutes

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.540 
done within the first like five minutes
or<00:00:32.399> less<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.380> honestly<00:00:34.380> think<00:00:34.559> oh<00:00:34.770> my<00:00:35.340> god

people are I just saw in the comments
right<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:38.610> yeah<00:00:39.270> he's<00:00:39.600> not<00:00:39.809> streaming<00:00:40.140> he<00:00:40.350> is

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
right here yeah he's not streaming he is

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.790 
right here yeah he's not streaming he is
dreaming<00:00:40.800> oh<00:00:40.980> my<00:00:41.219> god<00:00:41.370> they<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:42.030> who<00:00:42.270> i<00:00:42.329> am

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
dreaming oh my god they know who i am

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.830

on<00:00:49.800> my<00:00:49.980> warrior<00:00:50.309> know<00:00:50.579> wow<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.210> can't<00:00:51.510> survive

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
on my warrior know wow I can't survive

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.779 
on my warrior know wow I can't survive
it<00:00:51.960> man<00:00:52.110> i<00:00:52.320> get<00:00:52.559> i<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.710> i<00:00:52.949> get<00:00:53.010> right<00:00:53.280> now<00:00:53.760> i

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
it man i get i get i get right now i

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.450 
it man i get i get i get right now i
discovered<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> nice<00:00:54.629> cool<00:00:54.989> trick<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.309> able

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
discovered a nice cool trick to be able

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.060 
discovered a nice cool trick to be able
to<00:00:56.550> tag<00:00:56.760> everybody<00:00:57.210> within<00:00:57.899> five<00:00:58.559> seconds<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
to tag everybody within five seconds I

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.529 
to tag everybody within five seconds I
can<00:00:59.100> tag<00:00:59.399> every<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.850> hundred<00:01:00.270> percent<00:01:00.329> of

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
can tag every a hundred percent of

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.510 
can tag every a hundred percent of
everybody<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.289> Coliseum<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.219> only

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
everybody in the Coliseum the only

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.770 
everybody in the Coliseum the only
difference<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.000> only<00:01:03.059> thing<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
difference the only thing is I have to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.880 
difference the only thing is I have to
be<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.170> watch<00:01:04.290> out<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> decays

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
be I have to watch out for the decays

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.170 
be I have to watch out for the decays
the<00:01:05.129> decays<00:01:05.430> are<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> only<00:01:05.790> ones<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.090> can

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
the decays are the only ones that can

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240 
the decays are the only ones that can
grip<00:01:06.420> me<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.290> i'm<00:01:07.409> gonna<00:01:07.500> right<00:01:07.710> now<00:01:07.860> target

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
grip me in so i'm gonna right now target

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.740 
grip me in so i'm gonna right now target
where<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> decays<00:01:08.880> are<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.420> where<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
where the decays are and see where the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960 
where the decays are and see where the
heck<00:01:09.930> they<00:01:10.080> are<00:01:10.430> maybe<00:01:11.430> i<00:01:11.549> should<00:01:11.670> make<00:01:11.790> some

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
heck they are maybe i should make some

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.280 
heck they are maybe i should make some
friends<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.450> I've<00:01:12.600> made<00:01:12.810> friends<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
friends but I've made friends and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
friends but I've made friends and
they've<00:01:13.380> betrayed<00:01:13.710> me<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.250> don't<00:01:14.610> trust

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
they've betrayed me so I I don't trust

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.640 
they've betrayed me so I I don't trust
anybody<00:01:15.090> when<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.930> comes<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.170> calcium<00:01:16.409> okay

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
anybody when it comes to calcium okay

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.340 
anybody when it comes to calcium okay
one<00:01:16.830> BK<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.220> there<00:01:17.460> oh<00:01:18.390> there's<00:01:18.840> only<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.140> DK

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
one BK is there oh there's only one DK

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.130 
one BK is there oh there's only one DK
and<00:01:19.560> there's<00:01:19.740> another<00:01:19.950> DK<00:01:20.400> there<00:01:21.390> ok<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:21.810> both

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and there's another DK there ok so both

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.289 
and there's another DK there ok so both
decays<00:01:22.530> are<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.979> corner<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.119> make

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
decays are in that corner I have to make

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.820 
decays are in that corner I have to make
sure<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> don't<00:01:25.049> get<00:01:25.259> gripped<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.740> I

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
sure that I don't get gripped in if I

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.740 
sure that I don't get gripped in if I
get<00:01:25.979> gripped<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.610> stun<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.180> gotta<00:01:27.390> drink<00:01:27.630> it

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
get gripped in and stun I gotta drink it

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
get gripped in and stun I gotta drink it
and<00:01:27.810> get<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.960> heck<00:01:28.020> out<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.290> there<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.680> then

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and get the heck out of there and then

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.550 
and get the heck out of there and then
I'm<00:01:28.890> vulnerable<00:01:29.479> but<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.780> gripped<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:31.170> I

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
I'm vulnerable but if I get gripped in I

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.830 
I'm vulnerable but if I get gripped in I
could<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.610> sure<00:01:32.640> I'm<00:01:32.850> bet<00:01:33.030> I'm<00:01:33.150> dead<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> got

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
could be sure I'm bet I'm dead so I got

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.149 
could be sure I'm bet I'm dead so I got
to<00:01:33.930> make<00:01:33.990> sure<00:01:34.049> not<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> get<00:01:34.439> too<00:01:34.619> close<00:01:34.770> what's

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
to make sure not to get too close what's

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.609 
to make sure not to get too close what's
40<00:01:35.430> yards<00:01:35.670> let<00:01:35.880> me<00:01:35.939> see<00:01:36.090> let<00:01:36.329> me<00:01:37.110> see<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:37.350> 40

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
40 yards let me see let me see what 40
