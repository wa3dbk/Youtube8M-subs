includes<00:00:18.259> three<00:00:18.800> separate<00:00:19.220> images<00:00:19.550> but

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
includes three separate images but

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.450 
includes three separate images but

effect I'll go ahead and start off by

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.460 
effect I'll go ahead and start off by
displaying<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.029> rulers<00:00:29.509> for<00:00:29.899> the<00:00:30.020> image<00:00:30.320> by

figure out exactly where I want to place
the<00:00:39.080> guides<00:00:39.350> which<00:00:39.950> I'll<00:00:40.130> use<00:00:40.370> as<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:40.790> basis

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
the guides which I'll use as the basis

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
the image and in this case I'm going to

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.610 
the image and in this case I'm going to
place<00:00:52.640> guides<00:00:53.060> a<00:00:53.360> quarter<00:00:53.840> inch<00:00:54.020> from<00:00:54.500> each

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
place guides a quarter inch from each

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.430

edge<00:00:55.070> of<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.520> image<00:00:55.940> that<00:00:56.360> will<00:00:56.960> give<00:00:57.110> me<00:00:57.320> an

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
edge of the image that will give me an

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.950 
edge of the image that will give me an
outer<00:00:57.739> bounding<00:00:58.489> area<00:00:58.910> for<00:00:59.270> the<00:00:59.450> image<00:00:59.780> and

outer bounding area for the image and

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.740 
outer bounding area for the image and
then<00:01:00.829> I'm<00:01:01.160> going<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.430> place<00:01:01.730> guides<00:01:02.060> that<00:01:02.540> will

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
then I'm going to place guides that will

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.460 
then I'm going to place guides that will
define<00:01:03.140> exactly<00:01:03.640> where<00:01:04.640> I<00:01:04.670> want<00:01:05.239> each<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:06.049> the

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
define exactly where I want each of the

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.860 
define exactly where I want each of the
individual<00:01:07.130> frames<00:01:07.520> for<00:01:08.030> my<00:01:08.150> triptych<00:01:08.600> to

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
individual frames for my triptych to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.890 
individual frames for my triptych to
appear<00:01:09.460> so<00:01:10.460> I'll<00:01:10.550> finish<00:01:10.700> placing<00:01:11.150> each<00:01:11.659> of

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
appear so I'll finish placing each of

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.430 
appear so I'll finish placing each of
the<00:01:12.020> guides<00:01:12.229> here<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.960> now<00:01:14.960> we<00:01:15.020> have<00:01:15.290> the

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
the guides here and now we have the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.100 
the guides here and now we have the
outer<00:01:15.650> boundary<00:01:16.340> created<00:01:17.000> now<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:17.840> guides

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
outer boundary created now the guides

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.660 
outer boundary created now the guides
because<00:01:18.590> I've<00:01:18.710> placed<00:01:18.950> them<00:01:19.159> a<00:01:19.220> quarter<00:01:19.520> inch

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
because I've placed them a quarter inch

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.390 
because I've placed them a quarter inch
in<00:01:19.940> that<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:20.390> far<00:01:20.630> consumes<00:01:21.200> half<00:01:21.710> an<00:01:21.920> inch<00:01:22.130> out

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
in that so far consumes half an inch out

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.250 
in that so far consumes half an inch out
of<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:22.700> ten<00:01:23.030> inch<00:01:23.210> width<00:01:23.570> that<00:01:23.870> I'm<00:01:23.990> currently

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
of the ten inch width that I'm currently

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.160 
of the ten inch width that I'm currently
working<00:01:24.560> with<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.190> I<00:01:25.940> also<00:01:26.120> want<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.600> have<00:01:26.780> two

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
working with and I also want to have two

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.320 
working with and I also want to have two
additional<00:01:28.010> spaces<00:01:28.430> here<00:01:28.820> each<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.060> those

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
additional spaces here each of those

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.149 
additional spaces here each of those
will<00:01:29.600> be<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.750> quarter<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.200> an<00:01:30.290> inch<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:30.950> that

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
will be a quarter of an inch so that

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.180 
will be a quarter of an inch so that
totals<00:01:31.670> one<00:01:32.180> inch<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.690> I'm<00:01:32.840> using<00:01:33.200> up<00:01:33.560> out<00:01:33.830> of

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
totals one inch that I'm using up out of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.950 
totals one inch that I'm using up out of
the<00:01:34.490> overall<00:01:34.909> width<00:01:35.119> of<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.390> image<00:01:35.570> that

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
the overall width of the image that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.980 
the overall width of the image that
leaves<00:01:36.860> nine<00:01:37.250> inches<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.150> since<00:01:38.479> I<00:01:38.630> want<00:01:38.810> to

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
leaves nine inches and since I want to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.230 
leaves nine inches and since I want to
use<00:01:39.229> three<00:01:39.710> individual<00:01:40.159> segments<00:01:40.580> that<00:01:40.970> means

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
use three individual segments that means

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.719 
use three individual segments that means
that<00:01:41.420> each<00:01:41.659> should<00:01:42.080> be<00:01:42.229> three<00:01:42.560> inches<00:01:42.860> wide<00:01:43.130> so

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
that each should be three inches wide so

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.460 
that each should be three inches wide so
I'll<00:01:43.820> go<00:01:43.940> ahead<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.210> drag<00:01:44.450> from<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.930> left

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
I'll go ahead and drag from the left

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.670 
I'll go ahead and drag from the left
ruler<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.280> I'll<00:01:47.270> place<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.659> guide<00:01:48.080> three

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
ruler and I'll place a guide three

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.420 
ruler and I'll place a guide three
inches<00:01:49.010> in<00:01:49.250> from<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:50.060> last<00:01:50.540> guide<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.350> then<00:01:52.159> a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
inches in from the last guide and then a

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.280 
inches in from the last guide and then a
guide<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.909> quarter<00:01:53.299> inch<00:01:53.450> away<00:01:53.630> from<00:01:54.020> that

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
guide a quarter inch away from that

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.969 
guide a quarter inch away from that
guide<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:56.020> then<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.049> guide<00:01:57.260> three<00:01:57.560> inches<00:01:57.830> away

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
guide and then a guide three inches away

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.719 
guide and then a guide three inches away
from<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.520> guide<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.890> finally<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.100> guide<00:02:01.430> a

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
from that guide and finally a guide a

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.179 
from that guide and finally a guide a
quarter<00:02:02.150> inch<00:02:02.299> away<00:02:02.540> from<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:03.439> most<00:02:03.680> recent

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
quarter inch away from that most recent

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.070 
quarter inch away from that most recent
guide<00:02:04.400> so<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.759> can<00:02:04.939> see<00:02:05.150> I'm<00:02:05.270> using<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.750> ruler

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
guide so you can see I'm using the ruler

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.529 
guide so you can see I'm using the ruler
as<00:02:06.259> a<00:02:06.290> reference<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:07.280> add<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.520> series<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.119> guides

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
as a reference to add a series of guides

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.539 
as a reference to add a series of guides
now<00:02:08.810> these<00:02:08.929> are<00:02:09.110> non<00:02:09.409> printing<00:02:10.039> guides<00:02:10.310> I'm

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
now these are non printing guides I'm

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.399 
now these are non printing guides I'm
just<00:02:10.729> using<00:02:10.939> them<00:02:11.239> as<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.450> basis<00:02:12.049> of<00:02:12.260> a

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
just using them as the basis of a

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.830 
just using them as the basis of a
selection<00:02:12.739> I'll<00:02:13.340> go<00:02:13.669> ahead<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.209> choose<00:02:14.540> my

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
selection I'll go ahead and choose my

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.830 
selection I'll go ahead and choose my
rectangular<00:02:15.379> lasso<00:02:15.980> tool<00:02:16.249> from<00:02:16.639> the<00:02:16.790> toolbox

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
rectangular lasso tool from the toolbox

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.229 
rectangular lasso tool from the toolbox
and<00:02:17.930> then<00:02:18.110> I<00:02:18.349> will<00:02:18.560> click<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.190> drag<00:02:19.790> and

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
and then I will click and drag and

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.110 
and then I will click and drag and
notice<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.319> selection<00:02:22.069> snaps<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:23.090> the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
notice that the selection snaps to the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.940 
notice that the selection snaps to the
guides<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.750> it's<00:02:24.050> quite<00:02:24.260> easy<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.590> create<00:02:24.860> a

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
guides so it's quite easy to create a

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.640 
guides so it's quite easy to create a
selection<00:02:25.459> using<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.390> guide<00:02:26.660> as<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.260> basis

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
selection using a guide as the basis

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.830 
selection using a guide as the basis
I'll<00:02:27.860> then<00:02:28.370> make<00:02:28.610> sure<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.360> option<00:02:29.750> is

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
I'll then make sure that the option is

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.720 
I'll then make sure that the option is
set<00:02:29.989> on<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.170> options<00:02:30.530> bar<00:02:30.739> for<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.190> add<00:02:31.370> to

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
set on the options bar for the add to

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.729 
set on the options bar for the add to
selection<00:02:31.879> option<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.660> then<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.530> will

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
selection option and then I will

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.789 
selection option and then I will
continue<00:02:34.010> clicking<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.150> dragging<00:02:35.180> in<00:02:36.080> order

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
continue clicking and dragging in order

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.339 
continue clicking and dragging in order
to<00:02:36.950> create<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.640> selection<00:02:38.360> that<00:02:38.660> includes<00:02:39.049> all

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
to create a selection that includes all

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.360 
to create a selection that includes all
three<00:02:39.560> cells<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.580> triptych<00:02:42.220> now<00:02:43.220> I'm

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
three cells of the triptych now I'm

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.160 
three cells of the triptych now I'm
going<00:02:43.549> to<00:02:43.640> use<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.970> selection<00:02:44.330> as<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.810> basis

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
going to use the selection as the basis

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.080 
going to use the selection as the basis
of<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.500> map<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:46.040> I'll<00:02:46.160> add<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.760> image

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
of the map that I'll add to the image

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.059 
of the map that I'll add to the image
but<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.720> don't<00:02:48.110> want<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.379> add<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.680> Matt<00:02:48.860> in<00:02:49.040> the

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
but I don't want to add the Matt in the

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.620 
but I don't want to add the Matt in the
area<00:02:49.400> that's<00:02:49.519> currently<00:02:49.970> selected<00:02:50.150> but

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
area that's currently selected but

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.569 
area that's currently selected but
rather<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.260> opposite<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.190> I'll<00:02:52.310> choose

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
rather the opposite and so I'll choose

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.059 
rather the opposite and so I'll choose
select<00:02:53.299> and<00:02:53.480> then<00:02:53.750> inverse<00:02:54.260> from<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.680> menu<00:02:54.950> in

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
order to invert that selection so that
