00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.430
 I showed my absolute today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.250
 must be experienced by the victory 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.870
 because it is based on small fouls 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.960
 and I have it here with a whole 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.970
 fine comb oszkÃ³ knitted by schuler 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.070
 and I show that again in thick 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.900
 felt wool so that you see exactly what 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.150
 I do 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:27.800
 I have a number of stitches in part 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.289
 10 + 1 I still have two edge stitches 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.859
 added so I knit at 23 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.110
 mesh 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.000
 The pattern is actually very simple 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.530
 and once you knit it 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.269
 then you do not need to tell 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.010
 because you clearly see what you do 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:43.219
 must 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.239
 the first I had a strictly 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.239
 handbag right 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:50.850
 123 right stitches 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.040
 then two stitches together to the right 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.860
 knit an envelope a stitch on the right 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.050
 an envelope a stitch lift one 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:08.200
 knit the upscale ones over the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:11.269
 knitted 10.5 stitches on the right 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.269
 [Music] 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.479
 two stitches together on the right 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.240
 an envelope a stitch on the right 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.420
 envelope a stitch lift a mesh 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.670
 knit the upscale coat and on 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:36.610
 At the end of three stitches on the right, a handbag 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.119
 All back rhine will be left stitched 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.680
 knitted you can already see the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.899
 knitted together actually 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.860
 to the right the coated stitches 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.860
 lean to the left 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.750
 So a return trip mesh about it 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.140
 Landmass right all other stitches 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.140
 Left 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.039
 series in the next, the next had to 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.330
 start you with an edge mesh two 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.560
 mesh right 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.560
 Now the pattern begins 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.420
 knit two stitches together 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.120
 envelope three stitches on the right 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.370
 an envelope a stitch lift one 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.370
 Knit stitch and pull over 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.250
 a lint 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.690
 three stitches on the right 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.190
 two stitches together on the right 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.860
 an envelope three stitches to the right 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.440
 an envelope a stitch lift one 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.360
 knit the upscale knit 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.360
 two stitches to the end 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.200
 and a handbag and again one 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.060
 row of left stitches 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.990
 You already see clearly how the 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.990
 tend to mesh 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.400
 and start to form a v 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.400
 So backspace left mesh 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.099
 [Music] 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.470
 the next one you had to start with one 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.930
 Farm machine mesh right 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.420
 knit two stitches together to the right 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:34.450
 then the mesh tease to the right 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.450
 an envelope five stitches to the right 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.830
 an envelope a stitch lift one 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.320
 Knit stitch and pull over the 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.590
 mesh tend with one left 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.860
 mesh on the right two stitches on the right 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.370
 together an envelope of five stitches 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.370
 right 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.230
 an envelope a lift a knit 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.870
 top the up and you finish 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.160
 row with a stitch right one 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:09.190
 handbag over it now strictly one 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:12.640
 row left one right row left 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.180
 and now the actual pattern begins 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.110
 track one edge stitch right five 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.110
 mesh right 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.540
 six stitches to the right 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.740
 exactly you are right up to the middle 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:34.600
 mesh of the fund and now you take out 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:37.570
 each gap a loop so six times 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.260
 Overall, it's important that you do this 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.470
 wrap lance else shrivel the 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.060
 template 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:51.240
 the fourth gap is the fifth and always 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.460
 pull the thread and the sixth so 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.340
 hates 46 slings from the holes 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:00.080
 brought out then you rise normally 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.080
 continue 10 right stitches 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.310
 again until the middle stitch of the v 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.950
 and get out of the six holes again 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.680
 one stitch at a time 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:21.380
 thread high long pull 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.630
 pull a sting thread high long 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.510
 to pull a sting 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.450
 so through all six holes 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.960
 each thread a thread and long 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.750
 pull 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.169
 quite normal, five rights continue to stretch 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.169
 mesh 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.960
 and a border stitch 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.940
 So this return journey is special 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.480
 important because here almost the loops 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.480
 together 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:01.169
 You start with a handbag rich 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:01.169
 and 5 stitches left 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.410
 you do not need it here either 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.570
 to be especially careful because here 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.970
 Do you see clearly what to do? 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.930
 that is the loop the six 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:22.170
 Strictly tie yourself with the following 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:27.960
 mesh left together ie the slings 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:31.580
 and the mesh then stretch left 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.580
 9 stitches left 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:48.530
 and again they sound like the next one 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.530
 knit machine together 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.449
 then at the end of the row, five more stitches 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:58.000
 Left 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:02.000
 and another edge stitch 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.950
 now the pattern is a pattern tel 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.260
 almost done you 're still two 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.310
 row one row to the right 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.440
 row left 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:15.150
 In the next video I'll show you again 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.150
 how the pattern is then offset 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.840
 So you see it has to be that way 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.110
 clearly and that's easy 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:28.010
 knit if that's done once 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.010
 you do not need to count anymore
