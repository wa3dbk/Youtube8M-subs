00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.839
 hi everyone knows premium is fixed 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.850
 and we end up today for a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.820
 new video 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.580
 the boxing of the mouse roccat conix td 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.070
 who is a gamer mouse 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.480
 so well I'll unpack it 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.130
 quickly done that and then I'll do 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.320
 a little test to show anyway 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.950
 so it'll be a video unpacking and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.629
 so is firstly so have enough 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:47.550
 mouse with a piece of plastic around 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:50.870
 which is strictly for nothing 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.100
 then there is a small air hole 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.039
 we do not know what it's used for 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.250
 a little loving box and here and there we have 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.460
 directly a plastic again and 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.820
 our mouse is rock atcon with the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.110
 little logo at the bottom of the mouse good then 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.970
 I 'm never going to unpack I do not know 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.590
 in what sense does it open up in my opinion 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.290
 there is something that is a trick that is a 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:20.009
 here's here I 'll put that 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.580
 side and we will be able to proceed to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.580
 unpacking 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:32.700
 so here it does not want to smile here 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.490
 you have to take a little bit of 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.640
 train to digest it 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:44.030
 here are his releases then we will watch 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.259
 all there is inside so the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:54.259
 box for now we do not need anymore 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.979
 So here it is here I remove the 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.860
 plastic 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.750
 we will see your mouse that I can 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.369
 now touch without having to make a 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.720
 dish if we are so a little box 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.720
 so I will show you very closely 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.840
 so here is it marked on it 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:22.340
 roccat white box so this is the box to 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.830
 peas actually it would be nice to do the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.080
 focus brief let's say that that to 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.480
 almost good so I see it here 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.549
 suffer or bah here and there you have to 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.540
 every time in small weights 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.170
 100 grams 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.810
 that's sorted in this box 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.260
 then compared to the mouse but I 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.810
 tell you not take the little packaging 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.220
 we can remove 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.200
 here we have the installation lead 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:00.079
 quick 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:01.940
 so here I do not know if a cd so 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:08.660
 no it does not seem to me that a cd 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:11.750
 directly in there is no cd and for 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.579
 on the other hand for the threshold number actually 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.720
 they will ask to use the one that 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.870
 is on the mouse ie on 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.130
 mouse we will have a serial number 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.980
 good compared to the grip and 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.260
 Well, I do not know that much, I'll tell you 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.299
 more after we are served a little bit 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.889
 anyway we have a wheel that 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.180
 please already well because the ol turns 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.940
 not in the void we feel that it turns 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.700
 really well the button lama not look 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.790
 too accessible but good and I will put 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:43.010
 a configuration for things that me 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:45.630
 are less useful here then we have two 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.400
 buttons on the side so that it is rather 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.140
 ballous main use for me it's 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.310
 Previous web browsing 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.050
 next after in the game it can 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.240
 always it can always serve 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.980
 we stick left and right with the 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.070
 wheel so it went very fine 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.170
 we do not have to force and we are 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:07.570
 here more and me for sensitivity 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:11.290
 So here we are going to have the 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.670
 little storage here for peas so 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.840
 that is to say, there are none and there 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.970
 we will be able to put the peas that are 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.540
 in the box inside 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.180
 and why turn it just close 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.250
 that's fine, I think he's 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.460
 walk a little bit good it should ask 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.020
 no problem but we are a little 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.740
 detail that could have been fine 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.290
 think so here bah I propose you to 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.630
 we 're going to find myself rather all of 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.630
 next for the mouse test
