the<00:02:15.000> Great<00:02:15.209> Salt<00:02:15.480> Lake<00:02:15.599> origin<00:02:16.580> they<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.930> patch

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
the Great Salt Lake origin they do patch

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.339 
the Great Salt Lake origin they do patch
larger<00:02:19.650> than<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.099> San<00:02:20.310> Francisco<00:02:20.849> Bay<00:02:21.349> strain

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
larger than the San Francisco Bay strain

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.740 
larger than the San Francisco Bay strain
and<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:23.250> find<00:02:23.519> that<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.790> premium<00:02:24.209> grade<00:02:24.480> is

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
and I find that the premium grade is

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.680 
and I find that the premium grade is
well<00:02:24.989> worth<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.709> want<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> keep<00:02:26.690> your

won't see the orange color until they've
hatched<00:04:38.190> that's<00:04:38.880> how<00:04:39.030> you<00:04:39.090> know<00:04:39.330> you're<00:04:39.479> ready

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.480 
hatched that's how you know you're ready
to<00:04:39.900> harvest

to harvest

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.520 
to harvest
now<00:04:41.490> harvesting<00:04:42.090> is<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.479> very<00:04:42.780> simple<00:04:42.900> what

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
now harvesting is is very simple what

a flashlight pointed at the bottom you

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.010 
a flashlight pointed at the bottom you
set<00:04:56.460> it<00:04:56.580> next<00:04:56.729> to<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.090> brine<00:04:57.300> shrimp<00:04:57.330> hatchery

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
set it next to the brine shrimp hatchery

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.980 
set it next to the brine shrimp hatchery
what<00:04:58.650> will<00:04:58.860> happen<00:04:59.250> is<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.910> spent<00:05:00.419> egg<00:05:00.630> shells

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
what will happen is the spent egg shells

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.310 
what will happen is the spent egg shells
will<00:05:01.710> float<00:05:01.979> to<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.250> top<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:03.080> your<00:05:04.080> brine

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
will float to the top and your brine

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.860 
will float to the top and your brine
shrimp<00:05:04.350> will<00:05:04.890> gather<00:05:05.130> as<00:05:05.580> they're<00:05:06.360> attracted

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
shrimp will gather as they're attracted

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.360 
shrimp will gather as they're attracted
to<00:05:06.900> light<00:05:07.200> they'll<00:05:07.440> gather<00:05:07.620> at<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:08.010> bottom

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
to light they'll gather at the bottom

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.290 
to light they'll gather at the bottom
and<00:05:08.630> then<00:05:09.630> you<00:05:09.810> can<00:05:09.990> use<00:05:10.140> a<00:05:10.169> turkey<00:05:10.620> baster<00:05:10.770> to

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
and then you can use a turkey baster to

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.659 
and then you can use a turkey baster to
suck<00:05:12.300> out<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.500> brine<00:05:13.740> shrimp<00:05:13.770> they<00:05:14.220> gather<00:05:14.460> at

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
suck out the brine shrimp they gather at

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.310 
suck out the brine shrimp they gather at
the<00:05:14.789> bottom<00:05:15.120> without<00:05:15.300> collecting<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.140> lot<00:05:16.289> of

the bottom without collecting a lot of
the<00:05:16.530> eggs<00:05:16.789> and<00:05:17.789> you<00:05:17.880> can<00:05:18.419> then<00:05:18.570> squirt<00:05:18.930> that

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
the eggs and you can then squirt that

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.260 
the eggs and you can then squirt that
into<00:05:19.560> a<00:05:19.590> brine<00:05:19.919> shrimp<00:05:19.950> net<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.700> catch<00:05:20.910> or<00:05:21.210> a

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
order to get all the saltwater out

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.620 
order to get all the saltwater out
because<00:05:28.560> you<00:05:28.680> don't<00:05:28.800> want<00:05:28.919> to<00:05:28.979> put<00:05:29.160> salt<00:05:29.340> water

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
because you don't want to put salt water

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.650 
because you don't want to put salt water
in<00:05:30.630> your<00:05:30.780> fry<00:05:30.990> tanks<00:05:31.410> um<00:05:32.300> put<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.419> through<00:05:33.539> the

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
brine shrimp net and then I normally use

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.570 
brine shrimp net and then I normally use
