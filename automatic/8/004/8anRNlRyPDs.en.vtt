00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.580
 this case is 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.360
 and we have to dismantle that way 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.690
 painting in the state is blooming 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.930
 Moreover, it is once here and 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:27.449
 Here is a talk show while in the bumper 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.519
 which then stops at the carrier and once 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.280
 the city ​​hall shells are removed 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.840
 plastic clips to then offers a 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.559
 either a side cutter or a 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 kombizange or in the case a snotty 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:51.000
 and maybe even a small slit 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.480
 screwdriver around the plastic 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.329
 to get out a bit 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.940

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.960

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:07.580

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.680
 it's time to deal with it 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.909
 do not just screw it up before 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.470
 I've been so strong that one 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.990
 it's just that easy 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.990
 Screw not stop ceiling are quite 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.509
 if she just has then then can 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.509
 you can also unscrew it well by hand 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.680
 In the case I am with the exclamation 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.320
 hot I have to be careful now that I 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.869
 Now not so much to the exhaust 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:53.170
 Women come because otherwise, among other things 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:55.630

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:06.220
 the other side as the same then plays 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:13.120
 Also here just below and me 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:27.220
 write here from screws missing 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:29.739

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.459
 Yesterday loose today 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.769
 very well solve everything in my 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.870
 Endeffekt you may find it 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.670
 be a little firmer if you like that 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.440
 then you dismantled 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.020
 sven has rusted a grind 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.340
 bit with sandpaper or with 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.319
 A council has decided for the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.890
 if I leave at the drill 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.550
 maybe remove that again 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.599
 bumper does not eat so badly pure 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.230
 because the screws I leave now 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.770
 lay here 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.010
 Now we go direction city hall 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.750
 shell and as times go on 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:15.349
 down here the underrun protection of the 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.349

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:27.810
 Tailors and such clips are now 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.700
 Once again I want to clip her here 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.500
 above then ever removed the 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.660
 can not see now because the camera 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.850
 not to record that is dark 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:42.269
 probably she had clips too 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:47.670
 as attached to the underbody and below 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:49.620
 Zoom in here in the back up takes a while 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.109

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.690
 plastic disk still attached and the 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.870
 must then be removed and then 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.890
 can you teacher flat rate as left as 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.530
