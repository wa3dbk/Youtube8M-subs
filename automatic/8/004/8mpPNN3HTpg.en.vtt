00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 I want to learn maths sign up 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.370
 come with me 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.880
 the ball of the world cup of brazil 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.360
 brazuca is a cube and spherical 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.389
 calm is not the square ball of kiko 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.730
 this is the river math channel sign up 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.220
 if 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.400
 Calm down for us to understand. 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.390
 since the 1970 Mexico Cup until 2006 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.730
 in Germany 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.900
 all the balls had a shape of a 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.899
 icosahedron a case with 32 buds and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.809
 anything was truncated one of the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.300
 of archimedes icosahedron is a 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.100
 of platonic solids formed by 20 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.890
 triangular faces 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.469
 note that in each of the 20 cribs 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.820
 focus 5 edges and to obtain the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.879
 accused was locked 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.520
 just cut out those verses that will form 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.440
 a pentagonal base pyramid and you 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.680
 discard this pyramid 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.579
 this way icosahedron cadu will have 20 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.010
 hexagonal faces and 12 pentagonal passes 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.970
 and will get closer to the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.610
 a sphere 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.040
 now we have 60 vertices and in each one 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.740
 of these verses deal only three 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.060
 which facilitates the sewing of 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.830
 32 buds 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.680
 not to mention that it is much easier 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.810
 to plan the 32 plans of 150 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.570
 truncated than to plan a sphere 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.860
 which facilitates the production of the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.439
 ball material which is a material 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.840
 and therefore when inflated it is 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.040
 seeming a sphere is similar to a 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.240
 football 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.670
 But then the mystery is calm. 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 in the 2010 African Cup of Nations 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.380
 south 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.049
 we had the jabulani that we no longer had 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.649
 plus the shape of the fish changed 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.100
 she was the one from here it's hard that's it formed 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.619
 by twelve pentagonal flat raisins or 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.740
 whether it was a ball or not 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.020
 already our brazuca is coated with six 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.110
 goals sewn over twelve 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.880
 edges and has eight vertices of a cube 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.179
 It's what made it easy. 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.430
 twelve of these and 8 vertex the difference 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.290
 then this ball to a real hub 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.959
 is that the edges of a cube are 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.349
 straight while that ball is edges 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.200
 and note that at each vertex at the 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:26.159
 encounter three edges exactly as 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.409
 in a very cool cube he lets himself 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.079
 here is a video with the production of the ball 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.780
 brazuca for you to check out and have fun 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.590
 and then like the video then let 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.359
 they liked 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.220
 do not forget too and sign up for 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.780
 Mathematical river channel will stay connected 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.599
 in the new videos that are posted here 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.889
 in the channel periodically also by 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.540
 two other channel videos that are 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.430
 appearing there on your screen 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.819
 A big hug and until the next 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.819
 videos
