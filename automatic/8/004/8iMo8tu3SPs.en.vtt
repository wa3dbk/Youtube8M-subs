00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
going to turn this town I had a Blair an

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.690 
going to turn this town I had a Blair an
earlier<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:09.690> uh<00:02:10.160> so<00:02:11.160> yeah<00:02:11.310> we're<00:02:11.459> going<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> be

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.979 
earlier but uh so yeah we're going to be
fusing<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> two<00:02:12.180> armors<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.720> video

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
fusing the two armors in this video

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.760 
fusing the two armors in this video
which<00:02:13.230> is

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
which is

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.290 
which is
very<00:02:14.040> very<00:02:14.250> stupid<00:02:14.370> idea<00:02:14.730> mean<00:02:14.940> because<00:02:15.180> I've

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
very very stupid idea mean because I've

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.610 
very very stupid idea mean because I've
never<00:02:15.420> even<00:02:15.570> done<00:02:15.690> any<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.960> these<00:02:16.050> but

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
never even done any of these but

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.240 
never even done any of these but
hopefully<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.580> had<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.240> point<00:02:18.750> off<00:02:19.110> from<00:02:19.770> someone

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
hopefully I had a point off from someone

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.500 
hopefully I had a point off from someone
and<00:02:20.400> they<00:02:20.490> said<00:02:20.670> they'd<00:02:20.850> do<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.120> fire<00:02:21.300> one

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
and they said they'd do the fire one

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.640 
and they said they'd do the fire one
first<00:02:21.720> that's<00:02:22.020> what<00:02:22.110> I'm<00:02:22.200> doing<00:02:22.470> hopefully

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
first that's what I'm doing hopefully

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
first that's what I'm doing hopefully
this<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.010> actually<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.430> be<00:02:23.490> good

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
this is actually going to be good

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.590 
this is actually going to be good
because<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:23.970> really<00:02:24.210> don't<00:02:24.330> want<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.510> waste

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
these two armors because they're

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.170

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
although you can't really fuse to get up

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
the end of this video um I'm probably

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.629 
the end of this video um I'm probably
just<00:04:31.930> gonna<00:04:32.110> level<00:04:32.409> that<00:04:32.530> thing<00:04:32.770> up<00:04:32.949> and<00:04:33.099> see

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
just gonna level that thing up and see

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.999 
just gonna level that thing up and see
if<00:04:33.759> it<00:04:33.909> gets<00:04:34.030> better<00:04:34.330> than<00:04:34.509> my<00:04:34.659> nemesis<00:04:35.650> and

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
if it gets better than my nemesis and

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.580 
if it gets better than my nemesis and
then<00:04:36.330> if<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.479> get<00:04:37.629> another<00:04:37.779> 2<00:04:37.990> star<00:04:38.259> I'll<00:04:38.409> just

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
then if I get another 2 star I'll just

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.649 
then if I get another 2 star I'll just
trade<00:04:39.129> off<00:04:39.249> the<00:04:39.370> nemesis<00:04:39.759> armor<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.360> fuse

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
trade off the nemesis armor and fuse

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:41.939 
trade off the nemesis armor and fuse
that<00:04:40.840> together<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.229> make<00:04:41.529> a<00:04:41.560> video<00:04:41.770> out<00:04:41.860> of

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
that together and make a video out of

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.769 
that together and make a video out of
that<00:04:42.189> because<00:04:42.430> it's<00:04:42.759> really<00:04:43.120> not<00:04:43.419> that<00:04:43.479> good

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:43.779 
that because it's really not that good

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:45.899 
that because it's really not that good
of<00:04:43.840> an<00:04:43.990> armor<00:04:44.349> it<00:04:44.770> only<00:04:45.189> goes<00:04:45.370> up<00:04:45.430> like<00:04:45.639> another

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
of an armor it only goes up like another

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.619 
of an armor it only goes up like another
like<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.180> few<00:04:46.389> more<00:04:46.569> levels<00:04:47.439> and<00:04:48.360> it's<00:04:49.360> already

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:49.629
