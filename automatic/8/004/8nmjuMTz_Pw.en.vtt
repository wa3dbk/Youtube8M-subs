all<00:00:01.199> right<00:00:01.319> now<00:00:01.410> we're<00:00:01.530> going<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.680> go<00:00:01.770> ahead

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
all right now we're going to go ahead

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.010 
all right now we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:02.040> solve<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.340> front<00:00:02.580> rack<00:00:02.790> what<00:00:03.780> you<00:00:03.899> need

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
and solve the front rack what you need

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.809 
and solve the front rack what you need
is<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.140> 10<00:00:04.380> millimeter<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.160> 13<00:00:05.609> millimeter

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
is a 10 millimeter and a 13 millimeter

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.320 
is a 10 millimeter and a 13 millimeter
ratchet<00:00:06.740> eat<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:07.830> way<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.069> do<00:00:08.250> these<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.700> take

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
ratchet eat this way to do these is take

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.530 
ratchet eat this way to do these is take
two<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.660> your<00:00:10.400> bolts<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.580> came<00:00:11.730> with<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.059> you

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
two of your bolts that came with it you

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.419 
two of your bolts that came with it you
want<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.750> slide<00:00:12.990> these<00:00:13.230> into<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.650> top<00:00:14.160> part

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
want to slide these into this top part

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.019 
want to slide these into this top part
first<00:00:14.759> then<00:00:15.690> when<00:00:15.809> we<00:00:15.900> do<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:19.550> you<00:00:20.550> can<00:00:20.699> slit

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
first then when we do this you can slit

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.779 
first then when we do this you can slit
up<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.240> they<00:00:21.330> go<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.480> these<00:00:21.720> slots<00:00:28.640> get<00:00:29.640> your

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
up so they go to these slots get your

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:38.390 
up so they go to these slots get your
bolts<00:00:30.029> started

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:48.900 

do<00:00:39.400> that<00:00:39.550> on<00:00:39.580> boost<00:00:39.850> sides<00:00:47.640> we'll<00:00:48.640> put<00:00:48.820> our

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
do that on boost sides we'll put our

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.350 
do that on boost sides we'll put our
nuts<00:00:49.120> on<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.420> end<00:00:50.730> we're<00:00:51.730> not<00:00:51.880> gonna<00:00:52.000> tighten

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
nuts on the end we're not gonna tighten

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.170 
nuts on the end we're not gonna tighten
these<00:00:52.450> down<00:00:52.510> by<00:00:52.960> any<00:00:53.140> means<00:00:53.910> I'm<00:00:54.910> just<00:00:54.970> gonna

in it got your rack what you want to do
when<00:03:41.850> install<00:03:42.180> on<00:03:42.269> this<00:03:42.420> rack<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.950> easiest

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
when install on this rack the easiest

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.220 
when install on this rack the easiest
way<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.519> do<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:44.850> is<00:03:44.940> tuck<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.359> back<00:03:45.480> half<00:03:46.019> up

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
way to do it is tuck the back half up

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.130 
way to do it is tuck the back half up
underneath<00:03:46.880> all<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.120> way<00:03:50.630> so<00:03:51.630> we<00:03:51.750> can<00:03:51.900> put<00:03:52.109> our

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
underneath all the way so we can put our

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.580 
underneath all the way so we can put our
front<00:03:52.739> sedan<00:03:53.010> through<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.250> grommets<00:03:53.640> I<00:03:54.590> get

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
front sedan through the grommets I get

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.069 
front sedan through the grommets I get
that<00:03:55.709> started<00:03:56.220> what<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.400> want<00:03:56.609> to<00:03:56.670> do<00:03:56.840> is<00:03:57.840> come
