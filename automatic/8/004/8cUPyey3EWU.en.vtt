00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.860
 hello my name is isabelle and I am 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.410
 specialized in flowering the 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.480
 window and balcony today we 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.880
 let's see together how to compose 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.039
 a beautiful pretty planters all 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.400
 the year to get a gardener who 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.040
 be beautiful all year long so you have to 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.960
 choose your plants for this 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.630
 gardener so I selected for 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.180
 you some plants with 4 foliage 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.230
 different from different forms of 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.140
 different colors 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.280
 in the first place a fern all these 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.670
 plants are evergreen 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.810
 that is, winter and summer 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.840
 keep their foliage 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:50.050
 so I chose a fern a 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.110
 tiare and there that blooms in the spring of 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.380
 pretty little starry flowers a 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.420
 pulpit for its beautiful lemon foliage and 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.120
 a periwinkle that will bloom 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.210
 also in spring a pretty little 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.649
 Helicoidal blue flower for 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.320
 this gardener so I chose a 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.659
 pretty containing the felt jets 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.520
 geotextile the biggest part of the job is 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.420
 so did when one chose his 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.180
 different plants 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.549
 now we will compose a 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.950
 planter that is pretty to the eye and 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:24.250
 which showcases each of the plants 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.820
 for this gardener I will therefore placed 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.040
 the expensive way ahead with its foliage 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.900
 let's go back down so I'll put the little 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.479
 periwinkle in front of the tiara and there 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.369
 with its pretty spring bloom and 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.530
 its pretty river shaped foliage 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.310
 heart is behind because she is over 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.470
 high the fern now so my 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.290
 planters and composed it you do not have 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.390
 more than at the plant, and then you 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.250
 place on a window sill 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.140
 this gardener composed of four 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.880
 perennials and very easy to 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.950
 maintain 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.460
 Clear it'll just the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.390
 pink is moderately including during 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.520
 the winter months 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.769
 even once a month but 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.369
 it's essential to keep a pretty 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.129
 planters 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.140
 r that will bloom again next spring 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.239
