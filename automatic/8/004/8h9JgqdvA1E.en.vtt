00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.740
 plus 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.530
 how is it so good for those who do not 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.780
 know I am easy and today they 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.100
 I bring a super simple tutorial for 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.140
 a little detail that we can see in 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.910
 our daddies this day the father here in 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.390
 mexico we celebrate it on the third Sunday 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:26.440
 June now falls on June 21 and 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.620
 well this idea I saw it in pinter is the vi 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.140
 as I think he will sell it in some 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.239
 store or they do it for the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.180
 home decoration and it occurred to me 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.090
 adapt it using a little bit of 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.820
 scrap to make a little detail to 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.510
 our dads and I'm talking about 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.829
 this is a decorative pendant but 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.230
 It can be used as a 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.630
 frame because it does not bring pictures 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.370
 and some details is super simple 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.040
 then let's see the how-to tutorial 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.480
 it is done and well we are going to use fabric 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.460
 you can use the fabric that you 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.070
 want I'm going to use jute some 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.659
 wooden stick lace also we are going to 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.520
 use some photographs can 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.909
 use one or those that you want 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.740
 decorated paper and paper and they are some 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.650
 scissors we're also going to use a 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.350
 ruler 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.990
 let's use the glue of your 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.910
 preference we will also need 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.200
 something to mark your web and use a 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.510
 white color and any element 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.820
 decorative that you want to put 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.350
 to your little detail first thing we're going to 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.950
 to do is we're going to mark a square 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.020
 of our 9 x 9 inch fabric we go 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.450
 to mark one part in half at 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.480
 4.5 and down we're going to measure two 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.970
 inches let's join this point with the 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.070
 edges to form the triangulation of the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.570
 bottom part of our pendant what 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.750
 next is that we are going to cut 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.270
 our fabric all around by 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.860
 all the brands around that 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.990
 we did once we already have it 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.210
 cut it's time to choose the piece of paper 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.610
 I'm going to choose this white background background 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.060
 coffee forgiveness and I'm going to frame it with this one 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.430
 cartonboard in yellow or cardboard 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.560
 base measures 6 x 6 inches then that of 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.929
 down the yellow then cut it a 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.790
 little bit bigger I think a means of 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.770
 inch a quarter bigger and 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.230
 I'm just going to place my piece of paper 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.150
 decorated the above yellow paper 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.950
 following that I'm going to place my 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.900
 photographs and I will use 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.580
 two small photographs remember that 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.650
 you can make this pendant more 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.810
 large or smaller and so the 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.459
 photographs will be depending on the 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.170
 size of the pendant that you make 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.250
 the measures that I am giving you here 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.610
 Well, they are simply recommended 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.530
 and well I will use to decorate this 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.420
 same little paper that they are comes 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.790
 ties and the lenses come that landmarks 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.860
 it makes me that it goes as very a doc with the 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.980
 theme will make some banners'm going to 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.230
 try with distress ink and I'm going to 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.000
 paste on top if you see they are 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.310
 cut in three different sizes 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.130
 following that I'm going to stick in my piece 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.050
 of cardboard to my canvas and as they saw by the 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.880
 I put another piece of cardboard back 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.280
 so to protect the glue and not 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.290
 it looks ugly I'm going to start decorating 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.230
 I'm going to use a few buttons 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.940
 I'm going to sew is something super simple and I'm going 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.100
 to also use a few letters of 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.930
 foami to put in the word dad 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.770
 also as you see there I have some 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.270
 pieces of wood veneer dating that I think 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.160
 that go very well with the decoration to me 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.160
 I like to indent them so that they hold 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.900
 a darker color coffee but then 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.310
 remember that you can put what 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.989
 that you want from decoration to 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.020
 better if your dad likes you like them 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.700
 sports or likes cars or not 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.650
 be some hobby that you have so you can 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.900
 put decorations that go with what 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.510
 they like it and well the following is that 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.519
 we are going to stick the stick as you see 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.579
 I'm sticking on the fabric in the part of 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.819
 up with hot silicone 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.290
 let's measure a bit of our 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.599
 tape to our ribbon whatever they are 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.849
 using I'm going to cut 10 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.099
 inches not 20 inches sorry but 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.319
 you can cut the longest 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.909
 shorter depending on how they need it 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.459
 and in the end, we 're just going to 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.079
 make some nudity on the banks that 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.519
 let's reinforce with a little bit of 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.530
 silicon so that there will not be 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.019
 some accident that we are going to 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.459
 drop our cord cited and so on 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.400
 simple is how we have our 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.900
 pendant 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.329
 what did they think was true 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.009
 super simple tutorial to me the truth 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.509
 is that I liked the idea very much and I 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.930
 I think it's a detail that if they do 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.430
 they will like their daddies very much and 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.310
 put with super simple materials 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.259
 that we can get at home like 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.060
 I say the fabric can use the fabric that 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.740
 you want even the best if you do not 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.620
 have they can do it the same 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.509
 paper the ribbon cited or the cord 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.300
 can put a ribbon with the stamen 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:45.090
 some thick thread some cord what 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.010
 you have at hand and well then I 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.139
 I know something that many of you do not 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.270
 they have their parents or have a mom who 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.520
 is mom and dad and mom says some very 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.100
 father and well I also did as a 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.350
 slightly more feminine version that is being 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.720
 Well with colors as you can see more 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.639
 feminine and also looks super nice 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.889
 so it's also a detail so that 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.889
 you can do to your dad your mom or 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.770
 for some gift in some other 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.539
 and then I have nothing left but 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.039
 congratulate all the daddies study to 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.110
 father who have a very nice time 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.520
 spoiled and well then I for the video 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.169

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.259
