quality<00:00:39.719> power<00:00:40.020> supply<00:00:40.350> one<00:00:41.190> last<00:00:41.370> thing<00:00:41.520> is

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
quality power supply one last thing is

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.510 
quality power supply one last thing is
that<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.239> erp<00:00:42.899> compliant<00:00:43.860> which<00:00:44.010> means<00:00:44.280> its

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
that it is erp compliant which means its

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.940 
that it is erp compliant which means its
energy<00:00:44.940> consumption<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.629> standby<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:46.350> less

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
energy consumption in standby is less

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.220 
energy consumption in standby is less
than<00:00:47.129> point<00:00:47.399> five<00:00:47.700> watts<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.870> let's<00:00:49.020> take<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
than point five watts so let's take a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.810 
than point five watts so let's take a
look<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.530> what<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.770> get<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.399> accessories

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
look at what you get in the accessories

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.920 
look at what you get in the accessories
this<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.899> power<00:00:52.350> cable<00:00:52.530> very<00:00:53.190> necessary<00:00:53.610> as

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
this is a power cable very necessary as

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.470 
this is a power cable very necessary as
well<00:00:54.930> as<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.559> bag<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.920> cable<00:00:56.879> ties<00:00:57.030> those<00:00:57.300> zip

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.149 
sure how to install this power supply
let's<00:01:06.450> take<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> look<00:01:06.840> at<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> cables<00:01:07.590> first<00:01:07.950> as

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
let's take a look at the cables first as

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370 
let's take a look at the cables first as
you<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.430> tell<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> non<00:01:09.479> modular<00:01:10.110> power

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you can tell this is a non modular power

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.969 
you can tell this is a non modular power
supply<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:12.000> cables<00:01:12.510> are<00:01:12.840> sleeved<00:01:13.530> black
