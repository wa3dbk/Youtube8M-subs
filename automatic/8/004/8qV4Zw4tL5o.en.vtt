00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.179
 Hello dear friends, you look 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.460
 srz 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.620
 this third edition of the victrix tavern will 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.309
 be called a new series of commercials 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.009
 dedicated to jailbreak and tick for ios 7 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.809
 like not going out every week and why 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.730
 go release because before 2 we 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.630
 already they were called themselves actual 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.250
 tweaks for ios and we start give on 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.350
 Yuri Denisovich who annoys me 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.310
 your heart has this black one 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.550
 bars in the lower bar upper bar in 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.980
 camera which would be the grandee for 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.100
 all switches it looks a bit 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.230
 scary and closes and fate pictures 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.690
 so before called transparent 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.840
 the camera bar he lets you take here 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.160
 these are black stripes and their memory on 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.379
 wonderful blur effect 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.969
 losing everything but why it was impossible to do 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.000
 she herself began as it were very cool 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.390
 fits into her all blur everything 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.770
 as it should, therefore, we depend on juice where will 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.199
 be your camera to us will 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.640
 watch it and be done 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.309
 blur loves very beautiful 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.340
 agree and also with this fic 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.290
 bundles and tweak called ocean 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.150
 blue seven 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.420
 kick is exposed by default along with 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.780
 him on this tag allows you to customize 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.939
 and regulate who will be so blue 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.799
 blur in this type so if you 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.900
 put on a minimum as you understand 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.000
 blurring will not be at all and it generally 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.810
 I really like the way she looks 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.159
 just some sliders with no background and 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.619
 now we can go back to ours 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.659
 the first previously mentioned telly and there 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.520
 perform about some setting ie 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.710
 see how well they work these two 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.470
 tweak bundles right there we can set up 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.200
 on the transparency themselves switch the fairies not 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.899
 background them on the switches themselves in 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.880
 we put the camera on low levels 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.590
 see it disappears to the maximum then 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.259
 do you have more space now 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.460
 maximally appear on the screen 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.619
 picture they are closed in black 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.869
 strips every there switches 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.670
 so the 20th century in general, you take Henna 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.880
 on yourself get out than cool and 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.110
 the most important thing is free and the next one 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.750
 some that I propose to see 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.289
 called far it is right by the name the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.980
 fabric 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.870
 the bottom line is you so we 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.670
 whether to get quick access any 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.319
 one sentence directly with 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.989
 home screen 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.190
 is he this tag is different from types 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.250
 which controls 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.560
 that is, to be from the frame of the center to them 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.599
 us screen home all that you and you 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.120
 able to make your left simple 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.280
 side home like this you are nowhere vaio 6th 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.989
 gets access to spotlight search and 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.180
 get quick access any 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.090
 let the camera drop one application 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.860
 there is a calculator but you can choose any 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.329
 the application that you installed more often 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.209
 it costs me a lot of boxing 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.190
 any official mail 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.319
 the next is absolutely amazing simple 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.319
 and the logical tweak is called insi kill 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.569
 the bottom line is to let him get 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.370
 access exactly who and what you 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.069
 fertilizer which she wants for example if 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.799
 you will make a settlement with you 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.829
 access to all if i'm off to the left 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.540
 only today according to the extreme 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.440
 the right corner then get from leisure shorts 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:17.440
 missed very simple and logical and very 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.120
 the main thing again is their free last 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.099
 type on which we will not look 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.690
 called foot sounds 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.660
 it is for those who can not 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.060
 reconcile with everyone still yearn for 6 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.940
 This effect adds sound to us. 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.519
 unlock the one that time 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.700
 attended 6 of which unfortunately 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.650
 we are not around can also customize 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.200
 volume and unlock that pretty 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.280
 nevertheless convenient and what type of custom waves gas 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.459
 and set up my 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.250
 its volume and this was the third release 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.440
