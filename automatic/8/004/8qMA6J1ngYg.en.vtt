then we're gonna turn it on and and rev

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.090 
then we're gonna turn it on and and rev
it<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.430> bit<00:01:02.610> and<00:01:02.870> we<00:01:03.870> should<00:01:04.110> see<00:01:04.350> tons<00:01:04.860> of

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
it up a bit and we should see tons of

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.940 
it up a bit and we should see tons of
crap<00:01:05.850> coming<00:01:06.300> out<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.050> this<00:01:07.740> should<00:01:07.920> be

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
crap coming out of it so this should be

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.590 
crap coming out of it so this should be
interesting

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
interesting

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.010 
interesting
be<00:01:09.600> back<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.899> a<00:01:09.930> bit<00:01:10.790> okay<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.090> Kevin<00:01:12.420> wussed

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
be back in a bit okay so Kevin wussed

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.660 
be back in a bit okay so Kevin wussed
out<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.590> we're<00:01:13.710> gonna<00:01:13.800> do<00:01:14.040> my<00:01:14.190> Volvo

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
out so we're gonna do my Volvo

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.150 
out so we're gonna do my Volvo
and<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:16.380> mobile<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:17.070> bit

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
and so my mobile is a little bit

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.690 
and so my mobile is a little bit
different<00:01:17.550> because<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:19.250> it's<00:01:20.250> got<00:01:20.399> a<00:01:20.430> turbo

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
different because we it's got a turbo

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.080 
different because we it's got a turbo
back<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> their<00:01:22.470> intakes<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.250> goes

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
back there so their intakes here goes

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.180 
back there so their intakes here goes
through<00:01:24.300> here<00:01:24.660> goes<00:01:25.500> through<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.800> turbo

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
through here goes through the turbo

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.020 
through here goes through the turbo
comes<00:01:26.789> out<00:01:27.030> here<00:01:27.619> right<00:01:28.619> here<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.580> goes

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
comes out here right here and it goes

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.930 
comes out here right here and it goes
into<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.510> intake<00:01:30.840> there<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:32.100> we<00:01:32.670> wanted

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
into the intake there and so we wanted

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.340 
into the intake there and so we wanted
to<00:01:33.060> get<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.270> somewhere<00:01:33.570> after<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.990> turbo

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
to get it somewhere after the turbo

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.649 
to get it somewhere after the turbo
because<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.770> don't<00:01:34.950> want<00:01:35.190> I<00:01:35.450> don't<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:36.510> I

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
because we don't want I don't know I

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.820 
because we don't want I don't know I
don't<00:01:36.750> know<00:01:36.900> how<00:01:37.020> big<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.380> deal<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.680> makes

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
don't know how big of a deal that makes

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.859 
don't know how big of a deal that makes
but<00:01:38.010> I<00:01:38.040> didn't<00:01:38.310> want<00:01:38.460> hot<00:01:38.729> flammable<00:01:39.420> seafoam

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
but I didn't want hot flammable seafoam

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.740 
but I didn't want hot flammable seafoam
getting<00:01:40.560> pulled<00:01:40.920> through<00:01:41.159> deep<00:01:41.630> through<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
getting pulled through deep through the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.700 
getting pulled through deep through the
turbo<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.840> brake<00:01:46.020> line<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.350> kind<00:01:46.530> of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
turbo but and the brake line is kind of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.870 
turbo but and the brake line is kind of
hard<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:47.610> at<00:01:47.760> back<00:01:47.970> there<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.729> did

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
hard to get at back there so what we did

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.600 
hard to get at back there so what we did
is<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.990> guess<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.650> don't<00:01:52.799> necessarily<00:01:52.950> need<00:01:53.549> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
is I guess you don't necessarily need to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.359 
is I guess you don't necessarily need to
use<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.210> brake<00:01:54.750> booster<00:01:54.930> hose<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:56.100> kind<00:01:56.310> of

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
use the brake booster hose and kind of

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.310 
use the brake booster hose and kind of
use<00:01:56.460> any<00:01:56.670> vacuum<00:01:57.060> lines<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:57.810> use<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.140> one

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
use any vacuum lines so we use this one

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.700 
use any vacuum lines so we use this one
right<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:58.890> we<00:01:59.580> just<00:01:59.900> pulled<00:02:00.900> it<00:02:01.049> off<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.470> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
right here we just pulled it off of the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.999 
right here we just pulled it off of the
the<00:02:02.610> intake<00:02:02.939> manifold<00:02:03.390> there<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.860> Kevin<00:02:04.860> had

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
