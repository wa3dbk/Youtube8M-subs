the things that i decided we're
important<00:01:51.990> when<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.229> built<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.590> now<00:01:53.430> with<00:01:53.549> all

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
important when we built it now with all

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.340 
important when we built it now with all
of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> alienware<00:01:54.299> systems<00:01:54.780> you're<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.290> to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
of the alienware systems you're going to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.840 
of the alienware systems you're going to
notice<00:01:55.470> right<00:01:55.680> out<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.009> gate<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
notice right out of the gate that the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.060 
notice right out of the gate that the
case<00:01:57.119> itself<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:58.110> almost<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.560> work<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.890> art

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
case itself is is almost a work of art

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.950 
case itself is is almost a work of art
and<00:01:59.310> they've<00:01:59.670> done<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.969> lot<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.420> effort<00:02:00.750> making

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
and they've done a lot of effort making

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.899 
and they've done a lot of effort making
the<00:02:01.140> case<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.530> functional<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.460> be

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
overall look when we pop the system

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.990 
overall look when we pop the system
itself<00:02:24.810> open<00:02:25.019> we<00:02:25.799> see<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.220> other<00:02:26.370> kind<00:02:26.909> of

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
itself open we see the other kind of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.970 
itself open we see the other kind of
hallmark<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.840> alienware<00:02:28.409> systems<00:02:28.829> and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
hallmark of the alienware systems and

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.640 
hallmark of the alienware systems and
one<00:02:29.159> of<00:02:29.250> them<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.549> it's<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.150> huge<00:02:30.659> case<00:02:31.049> now<00:02:31.590> we

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
one of them is it's a huge case now we

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.199 
one of them is it's a huge case now we
need<00:02:31.859> a<00:02:31.890> big<00:02:32.099> case<00:02:32.280> because<00:02:32.489> we<00:02:32.609> pack<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:32.849> lot<00:02:33.060> of

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
need a big case because we pack a lot of

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.509 
need a big case because we pack a lot of
components<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.349> all<00:02:34.590> about<00:02:34.620> cooling

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
components in but it's all about cooling

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.039 
components in but it's all about cooling
so<00:02:35.700> they<00:02:35.819> need<00:02:36.030> room<00:02:36.239> in<00:02:36.359> here<00:02:36.510> for<00:02:36.540> liquid

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
so they need room in here for liquid

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.569 
so they need room in here for liquid
cooling<00:02:37.409> that<00:02:37.560> some<00:02:37.769> of<00:02:37.859> them<00:02:37.920> require<00:02:38.099> and

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
cooling that some of them require and

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.610 
cooling that some of them require and
the<00:02:39.000> extra<00:02:39.359> fans<00:02:39.659> that<00:02:39.959> all<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.319> them<00:02:40.409> require

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
the extra fans that all of them require

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.130 
the extra fans that all of them require
to<00:02:41.250> keep<00:02:41.489> these<00:02:41.700> systems<00:02:42.120> running<00:02:42.359> cool<00:02:42.659> now<00:02:43.109> I

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
to keep these systems running cool now I

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.140 
to keep these systems running cool now I
built<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.650> with<00:02:43.859> a<00:02:43.920> huge<00:02:44.220> honkin<00:02:44.609> processor

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
built this with a huge honkin processor

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.199 
built this with a huge honkin processor
a<00:02:45.269> big<00:02:45.720> custom<00:02:46.200> dual<00:02:46.500> headed<00:02:46.859> video<00:02:47.190> card<00:02:47.579> lots

blu-ray drive but you can see there's
plenty<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.470> room<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:52.680> me<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.010> expand<00:02:53.370> adding

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
plenty of room for me to expand adding

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.849 
plenty of room for me to expand adding
more<00:02:54.180> memory<00:02:54.450> more<00:02:54.840> video<00:02:55.079> cards<00:02:55.409> money<00:02:55.560> and

more memory more video cards money and
lots<00:02:56.430> more<00:02:56.609> media<00:02:57.209> should<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.989> need<00:02:58.319> it<00:02:58.470> now<00:02:58.859> one

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
lots more media should I need it now one

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.589 
lots more media should I need it now one
of<00:02:59.159> the<00:02:59.310> things<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.700> happens<00:02:59.909> with<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.239> system

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
of the things that happens with a system

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.899 
of the things that happens with a system
like<00:03:00.659> this<00:03:00.720> as<00:03:00.989> i<00:03:01.079> said<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.680> cooling<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:02.609> one<00:03:02.819> of

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
like this as i said in cooling is one of

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.339 
like this as i said in cooling is one of
the<00:03:02.970> most<00:03:03.060> important<00:03:03.569> aspects<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.109> it<00:03:04.230> and

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
the most important aspects of it and

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.199 
the most important aspects of it and
cooling<00:03:04.920> means<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.340> need<00:03:05.459> extra<00:03:05.849> fans

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
cooling means that you need extra fans

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.240 
cooling means that you need extra fans
and<00:03:06.450> extra<00:03:06.720> cooling<00:03:06.930> capabilities<00:03:07.650> now<00:03:08.069> this

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
and extra cooling capabilities now this

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.610 
and extra cooling capabilities now this
one<00:03:08.459> has<00:03:08.639> a<00:03:08.670> simple<00:03:09.030> extra<00:03:09.510> fan<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:10.019> that

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
one has a simple extra fan in here that

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.319 
one has a simple extra fan in here that
helps<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.099> cool<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.489> system<00:03:11.790> as<00:03:11.909> well<00:03:12.060> as<00:03:12.209> the

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
helps to cool the system as well as the

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.119 
helps to cool the system as well as the
main<00:03:12.510> system<00:03:12.900> fan<00:03:13.139> but<00:03:13.709> one<00:03:13.859> of<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.069> things

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
main system fan but one of the things

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.710 
main system fan but one of the things
that<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.609> recognize<00:03:15.120> when<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.329> start<00:03:15.599> adding

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
that you recognize when you start adding

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.140 
that you recognize when you start adding
fans<00:03:16.139> is<00:03:16.379> the<00:03:16.829> systems<00:03:17.220> tend<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.639> start<00:03:17.879> to<00:03:18.030> get

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
fans is the systems tend to start to get

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.119 
fans is the systems tend to start to get
a<00:03:18.180> lot<00:03:18.480> noisier<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.199> roar<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.650> feds<00:03:19.889> the

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
a lot noisier the roar of the feds the

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.189 
a lot noisier the roar of the feds the
constant<00:03:20.519> roar<00:03:20.669> the<00:03:20.849> fans<00:03:21.090> makes<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.840> systems

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
constant roar the fans makes the systems

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.390 
constant roar the fans makes the systems
quite<00:03:22.440> loud<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.799> they<00:03:22.859> create<00:03:23.099> a<00:03:23.129> lot<00:03:23.280> of

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
quite loud and they create a lot of

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.339 
quite loud and they create a lot of
background<00:03:23.609> noise<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.299> i<00:03:24.599> added<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:25.049> really

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
background noise so i added a really

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.229 
background noise so i added a really
important<00:03:25.739> feature<00:03:25.889> here<00:03:26.160> which<00:03:26.549> is<00:03:26.730> acoustic

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
important feature here which is acoustic

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.240 
important feature here which is acoustic
dampening<00:03:27.480> which<00:03:28.139> will<00:03:28.319> quiet<00:03:28.620> this<00:03:28.859> system

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
dampening which will quiet this system

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.710 
dampening which will quiet this system
down<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.489> lot<00:03:29.819> and<00:03:29.849> when<00:03:30.090> will<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.329> have<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.629> in

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
down a lot and when will you have it in

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.539 
down a lot and when will you have it in
a<00:03:30.780> small<00:03:31.049> office<00:03:31.079> you'll<00:03:31.889> appreciate<00:03:32.159> having

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
a small office you'll appreciate having

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.729 
a small office you'll appreciate having
the<00:03:32.669> system<00:03:33.120> run<00:03:33.599> a<00:03:33.629> little<00:03:33.959> bit<00:03:34.139> quiet<00:03:34.409> and<00:03:34.620> so

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
the system run a little bit quiet and so

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.559 
the system run a little bit quiet and so
sometimes<00:03:35.280> it's<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.760> small<00:03:36.060> things<00:03:36.090> that

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
sometimes it's the small things that

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.990 
sometimes it's the small things that
make<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.930> big<00:03:37.049> difference<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.919> for<00:03:38.040> me<00:03:38.190> having

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
a nice quiet system is one of the most

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.189 
a nice quiet system is one of the most
important<00:03:41.310> aspects<00:03:41.970> now<00:03:42.599> you<00:03:42.659> are<00:03:42.930> going<00:03:43.109> to

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
all for testing games that are sent to

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:58.159 
all for testing games that are sent to
us<00:03:56.129> and<00:03:56.310> then<00:03:56.819> I'm<00:03:57.060> going<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.569> retire<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.049> as<00:03:58.139> a

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
us and then I'm going to retire it as a

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.469 
us and then I'm going to retire it as a
killer<00:03:58.620> desktop<00:03:59.250> system<00:03:59.639> in<00:03:59.729> the<00:03:59.819> office<00:04:00.150> but

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:00.479 
killer desktop system in the office but

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.360 
killer desktop system in the office but
our<00:04:00.690> office<00:04:01.019> is<00:04:01.169> quite<00:04:01.349> small<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:01.889> this

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
our office is quite small so this

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.069 
our office is quite small so this
acoustic<00:04:02.639> dampening<00:04:03.000> might<00:04:03.629> be<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.870> single

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
acoustic dampening might be the single

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.140 
acoustic dampening might be the single
most<00:04:04.199> important<00:04:04.739> long-term<00:04:04.979> addition<00:04:05.699> to<00:04:06.060> the
