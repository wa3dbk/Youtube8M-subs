00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.240
 the year of 1994 was the simpsons 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.910
 met five years of existence just 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.970
 murder colosio 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.970
 i 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.150
 and on the verge of not leaving in america was 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.310
 megaman 6 this was the most tragic to little 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.930
 it does not turn out that for this year and nobody 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.000
 I gave two cents for the old anise 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.070
 since the super nintendo is in the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.540
 peak of its popularity and any 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.370
 developer with two fingers in front 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.500
 he preferred to spend money on the apparatus of 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.140
 16 bits than in the old gray toaster 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.420
 8-bit capcom had just released the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.970
 rock man 6 in japan and I did not have the most 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.040
 minimum interest in launching an America not 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.660
 only for the obsolescence of the month but 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.520
 because by that time they had already 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.800
 released mega man x in the super nintendo 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.870
 and all the attention was on the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.339
 nintendo who has always tried that 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.540
 your consoles generate the most amount 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.300
 of possible money 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.580
 he told capcom ok you do not throw it 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.280
 but I do risk my own wool 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.320
 practical is distributed what do you think to 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.930
 what capcom he answered after me 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.080
 tear fabric in staple fabric on the forehead 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.880
 and I risk 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.410
 this nation neither the first nor the only 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.510
 occasion in which nintendo is thrown the 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.280
 distribution of a foreign title and 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.400
 previously I had done it with host as 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.980
 Final Fantasy 1 Aragon, I'll tell you 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.390
 dragon warrior does not hurt to say that 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.730
 they were not the biggest titles 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.100
 sales in history and they call me 6 no 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.900
 was the exception the worst of the case is that 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.910
 because of how close death was 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.380
 of the old man and how risky it would be 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.370
 for nintendo to distribute a game of nes 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.680
 in 1994 the megaman run 6 was quite 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.050
 limited and derived from it is that in 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.030
 2013 then that game of 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.460
 second hand for the almost insignificant 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.740
 amount of 145 dollars 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.869
 this is where they are surely doing 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.720
 the cry of that lagrimita clown that 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.350
 already borders on the cliché and that I refuse to 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.290
 repeat 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.290
 it does not matter how much they insist 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.890
 good to see this 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.110
 according 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.000
 what happens when you grab megaman and what 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.800
 mixes with street fighter you get the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.800
 megaman story 6 since 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.740
 good and street fighter cross megaman 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.020
 wiki carmas fumaste grass does not spare you 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.520
 a little bit so you can live with me 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.350
 street fighter cross mega man 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.410
 Hahaha sounds like a game played by a 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.380
 good bye bye 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.360
 street fighter cross mega man everything 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.520
 that is invented is a kid 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.380
 it said the story of megaman 6 tells a 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.450
 competitive event of the world world 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.250
 where the main developers of 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.050
 robots will put their best inventions 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.730
 to see who is the better 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.860
 organizer of said event is a plan 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.290
 Mr. x that to describe the best 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.110
 physically it is someone just like 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.810
 doctor weili but with beard without glasses 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.370
 dark but of course don x equal and 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.060
 they are two completely unrelated people 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.680
 of course good said this Mr. x 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.360
 stated that he was behind the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.100
 misdeeds of doctor weili that has 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.890
 reprogrammed the eight robots of the tournament 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.170
 and that will make sure that mega man is worth 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.600
 that that once and for all 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.120
 the megaman 6 master robots are the 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.430
 truly unmemorable and even some 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.470
 border on the absurd and repetitive by 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.450
 example, several concepts are already recycled 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.150
 used to exhaustion as the 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.200
 typical fire robot and the typical robot 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.879
 of ice 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.209
 but it also looks like the typical robot that 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:42.940
 gives you a shield if the fourth of the series 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.830
 in doing it and on absurd concepts 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.390
 all the robots that have appeared in the 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.890
 series so far give us an idea of 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.190
 his skills through his name 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.310
 but what does it say to us call take what it 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.769
 dedicate a call I say gives us an idea 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.209
 what is Japanese but and is the 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.790
 equivalent to a Mexican robot that 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.830
 will call quan man or man rodríguez 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.239
 perhaps the only interesting element the 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.549
 catalog of master robots of this 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.900
 game is the scene of tomahawk man the 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.150
 which presents several plans of 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.010
 movement something never seen until now 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.930
 a Mega Man game and a sunset 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.540
 Sun complements the environment very well 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.940
 old this the character and that the net 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.470
 look good china today you only go to 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.780
 find other interesting things like 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.729
 water on the roof as an achievement where x 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.710
 defy gravity that way then 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.300
 they think but it's been seen 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.790
 china also the sequence that appears 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.560
 When you have a new weapon , it's wow 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.620
 and not only that, it also shows you 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.830
 briefly how is the weapon working 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.600
 and new bugs there in megaman 6 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.550
 perhaps the most notorious and said is of 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.650
 step is what makes note megaman 6 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.410
 about the other games of the saga is the 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.710
 reconfiguration of roche no longer exists nor 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.630
 rossi ni rose trampoline in its place rock 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.949
 merges with mega man so that 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.080
 don chaparrita has only his 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.300
 layout a jetpack that allows you 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.580
 fly for brief instants oil and 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.860
 anabolic steroid ratio which 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.630
 it returns well mom pains and allows you 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.970
 jump over cases that neither 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.919
 hepatic shells survive this 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.500
 new element gives you a whole new 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.120
 dynamic to the game even if in the 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.490
 last two games the mega booster leaves 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.710
 practically in the uselessness to the 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.419
 weapons of the master robots and mega van 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.550
 6 you can be sure that you will have it 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.639
 switching between the jetpack mega booster 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.139
 and the mega man sucked and there is already a new 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.240
 adapter that allows you to recharge the 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.460
 energy of your weapons even if you do not have it 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.100
 selected or the same function as 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.479
 megaman x but more than a year later the 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.650
 scenes have the colors scrub 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.660
 retinas that seem to have been 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.970
 colored by the same maternal child 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.529
 that colored the google offices 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.719
 there are some scenarios with 2 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:45.729
 to the world mario if you defeat the robot 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.349
 correct teacher you will get a letter 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.299
 to complete the word beat the 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:51.429
 collective the useless bird that 

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:53.439
 you gave enemies attack something that is 

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:55.239
 highlight is the opposite end the 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.949
 previous mega man where was 

00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:59.019
 uncertain what had happened with doctor 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.489
 While here we can clearly appreciate 

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:02.889
 through a written newspaper 

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:04.779
 apparently by a dyslexic and while and 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.809
 He was finally imprisoned for all his 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:10.569
 misdeeds and better yet than the game in 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:14.110
 the other games will continue good 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:16.450
 they also had continuations 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.340
 but none openly admitted that 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:23.140
 there would be a sequel as mega are allowed 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.970
 man 6 good this was mega man 6 we can 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.470
 say it's a mega man of the bunch and 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.270
 although the new roll certainly gives it a 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.520
 very different spin to the game and actually 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.320
 there is nothing new under the sun in this 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.430
 that would be the last megaman game in 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.430
 the console that saw it born 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.790
 I 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.360
 they 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.390
 I
