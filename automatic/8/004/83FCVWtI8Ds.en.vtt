00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
pitch a couple times before what I never

pitch a couple times before what I never
actually<00:01:36.820> got<00:01:37.060> deleted<00:01:37.660> so<00:01:38.470> I<00:01:39.130> was<00:01:39.340> pretty

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
actually got deleted so I was pretty

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.460 
actually got deleted so I was pretty
psyched<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.970> lead<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.479> without<00:01:40.660> falling<00:01:41.140> that

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
psyched to lead it without falling that

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.380

day<00:01:42.270> which<00:01:43.270> three<00:01:43.570> was<00:01:43.780> my<00:01:43.929> next<00:01:44.320> lead<00:01:44.530> which

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
day which three was my next lead which

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.029 
day which three was my next lead which
I'd<00:01:46.390> say<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.600> probably<00:01:46.899> one<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.200> my<00:01:47.320> favourite
