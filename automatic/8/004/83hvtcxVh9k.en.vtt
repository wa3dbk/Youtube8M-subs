issue<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:56.030> basically<00:01:57.030> not<00:01:57.630> knowing<00:01:58.079> exactly

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320

there's<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:46.900> weird<00:02:47.380> lag<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.460> you<00:02:48.520> pull<00:02:48.850> up

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
there's this weird lag so you pull up

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.550 
there's this weird lag so you pull up
the<00:02:49.150> cable<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:49.780> then<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.050> still<00:02:50.260> have<00:02:50.410> to

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
the cable and then you still have to

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.440 
the cable and then you still have to
wait<00:02:50.740> like<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.010> second<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:51.910> half<00:02:52.090> while<00:02:52.300> it's

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
wait like a second and a half while it's

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.360 
wait like a second and a half while it's
just<00:02:52.510> sitting<00:02:52.840> there<00:02:52.960> ready<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.560> fire<00:02:53.800> before

it<00:02:54.670> will<00:02:54.790> actually<00:02:55.330> shoot<00:02:55.630> for<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.230> don't

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
it will actually shoot for you I don't

it will actually shoot for you I don't
know<00:02:56.740> if<00:02:56.860> it's<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.100> bug<00:02:57.340> or<00:02:57.610> if<00:02:58.030> they<00:02:58.150> have<00:02:58.270> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
know if it's a bug or if they have the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.480 
know if it's a bug or if they have the
animation<00:02:59.020> timing<00:02:59.350> just<00:02:59.800> wrong<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.160> it

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
animation timing just wrong and it

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.370 
animation timing just wrong and it
doesn't<00:03:00.820> line<00:03:01.060> up<00:03:01.090> with<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.570> actual<00:03:01.840> in-game

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
doesn't line up with the actual in-game

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.040 
doesn't line up with the actual in-game
animation<00:03:03.130> but<00:03:03.760> either<00:03:04.030> way<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.660> was<00:03:04.840> just

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
animation but either way it was just

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.590 
animation but either way it was just
miserable<00:03:05.440> switching<00:03:06.250> between<00:03:06.640> primary<00:03:07.300> and

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
miserable switching between primary and

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.230 
miserable switching between primary and
secondary<00:03:08.040> alright<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.400> think<00:03:09.700> I've<00:03:10.030> made

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
secondary alright so I think I've made

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.420 
secondary alright so I think I've made
my<00:03:10.450> point<00:03:10.480> in<00:03:10.960> that<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.350> build<00:03:11.680> pretty<00:03:12.160> much

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
my point in that this build pretty much

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.180 
my point in that this build pretty much
sucks<00:03:12.820> in<00:03:13.090> theory<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:13.780> sounds<00:03:14.200> cool<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.770> actual

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
sucks in theory it sounds cool in actual

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.430 
sucks in theory it sounds cool in actual
practice<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.880> just<00:03:16.090> doesn't<00:03:16.420> work<00:03:16.570> out<00:03:16.870> why

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
practice it just doesn't work out why

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.510 
practice it just doesn't work out why
don't<00:03:17.500> we<00:03:17.680> talk<00:03:17.830> about<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.220> actual

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
don't we talk about the actual

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.340 
don't we talk about the actual
individual<00:03:19.060> guns<00:03:19.300> involved<00:03:19.690> with<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.170> build

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
individual guns involved with the build

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.440 
individual guns involved with the build
and<00:03:20.530> if<00:03:20.650> those<00:03:20.860> are<00:03:21.040> actually<00:03:21.460> any<00:03:21.730> good<00:03:22.060> on

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
and if those are actually any good on

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.930 
and if those are actually any good on
their<00:03:22.690> own<00:03:22.720> now<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.530> K<00:03:23.860> volt<00:03:24.130> starts<00:03:24.610> out<00:03:24.760> with

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
their own now the K volt starts out with

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.940 
their own now the K volt starts out with
50<00:03:25.360> rounds<00:03:25.750> initially<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.530> then<00:03:26.650> if<00:03:26.830> you

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
50 rounds initially and then if you

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.040 
50 rounds initially and then if you
upgrade<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.460> with<00:03:27.610> extended<00:03:28.300> magazines<00:03:28.780> it

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
upgrade it with extended magazines it

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.530 
upgrade it with extended magazines it
gets<00:03:29.260> 75<00:03:30.010> rounds<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.550> it<00:03:31.000> doesn't<00:03:31.360> shoot

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
gets 75 rounds and it doesn't shoot

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
of my main annoyances with this gun is

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.620 
of my main annoyances with this gun is
that<00:03:40.960> the<00:03:41.200> actual<00:03:41.760> projectiles<00:03:42.760> fire<00:03:43.180> so

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
that the actual projectiles fire so

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.290 
that the actual projectiles fire so
slowly<00:03:44.110> that<00:03:44.290> if<00:03:44.650> you're<00:03:44.830> aiming<00:03:45.010> at<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.850> moving

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
slowly that if you're aiming at a moving

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.600 
slowly that if you're aiming at a moving
target<00:03:46.540> they're<00:03:46.990> probably<00:03:47.260> gonna<00:03:47.710> miss<00:03:48.040> it's

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
target they're probably gonna miss it's

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.730 
target they're probably gonna miss it's
only<00:03:48.820> really<00:03:49.240> accurate<00:03:49.840> in<00:03:49.960> close<00:03:50.260> quarters

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
only really accurate in close quarters

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.100 
only really accurate in close quarters
where<00:03:50.920> bullet<00:03:51.310> travel<00:03:51.850> time<00:03:52.090> isn't<00:03:52.810> really<00:03:53.080> a

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
where bullet travel time isn't really a

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.380 
where bullet travel time isn't really a
factor<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:54.070> other<00:03:54.100> really<00:03:54.700> weird<00:03:55.030> thing

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
factor the other really weird thing

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.360 
factor the other really weird thing
about<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.870> cable<00:03:56.110> is<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.800> it's<00:03:56.980> got<00:03:57.190> this

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
about the cable is that it's got this

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.660 
about the cable is that it's got this
insanely<00:03:58.120> long<00:03:58.720> reload<00:03:59.350> time<00:03:59.620> the<00:04:00.040> gun<00:04:00.220> itself

insanely long reload time the gun itself

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.170 
insanely long reload time the gun itself
isn't<00:04:00.880> all<00:04:01.210> that<00:04:01.290> amazing<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.470> mean<00:04:03.180> compared

isn't all that amazing I mean compared

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.730 
isn't all that amazing I mean compared

to the Jackal shotgun which is

I'm<00:04:09.130> using<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.670> cable<00:04:09.880> with<00:04:10.450> weapons<00:04:10.900> Pro

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
I'm using the cable with weapons Pro

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.320 
I'm using the cable with weapons Pro
which<00:04:11.380> makes<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:11.770> reload<00:04:12.100> even<00:04:12.370> faster<00:04:13.120> and

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
which makes it reload even faster and

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.840 
which makes it reload even faster and
it's<00:04:13.780> still<00:04:14.050> an<00:04:14.230> incredibly<00:04:14.890> long<00:04:15.280> reload

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
it's still an incredibly long reload

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.120 
it's still an incredibly long reload
time<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.359> really<00:04:16.750> don't<00:04:17.020> know<00:04:17.230> why<00:04:17.799> they<00:04:17.980> gave

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
time I really don't know why they gave

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.770 
time I really don't know why they gave
it<00:04:18.280> such<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.459> long<00:04:18.730> reload<00:04:19.120> time<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.540> only

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
it such a long reload time the only

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.170 
it such a long reload time the only
thing<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.109> seems<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.380> read<00:04:20.650> load

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180

longer<00:04:21.359> than<00:04:21.509> the<00:04:21.660> cables<00:04:22.049> are<00:04:22.280> LMGs<00:04:23.280> so<00:04:23.910> let's

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
longer than the cables are LMGs so let's

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.390 
longer than the cables are LMGs so let's
recap<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.840> cable<00:04:25.259> tier<00:04:25.590> high<00:04:25.889> damage<00:04:26.280> to

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
recap the cable tier high damage to

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.760 
recap the cable tier high damage to
armor<00:04:26.759> low<00:04:27.090> damage<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.630> health<00:04:27.810> pretty<00:04:28.320> decent

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
armor low damage to health pretty decent

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.700 
armor low damage to health pretty decent
rate<00:04:29.430> of<00:04:29.610> fire<00:04:29.880> very<00:04:30.509> slow<00:04:31.020> projectile

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
velocity decent magazine size but

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.610

insanely<00:04:34.979> long<00:04:35.490> reload<00:04:36.120> time<00:04:36.449> ultimately<00:04:37.440> I

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
insanely long reload time ultimately I

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.620 
insanely long reload time ultimately I
think<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:38.190> cable<00:04:38.550> really<00:04:38.940> isn't<00:04:39.090> bringing<00:04:39.419> a

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
think the cable really isn't bringing a

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.659 
think the cable really isn't bringing a
lot<00:04:39.810> to<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.080> table<00:04:40.410> that<00:04:40.470> other<00:04:40.800> guns<00:04:41.100> aren't

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
lot to the table that other guns aren't

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.360 
lot to the table that other guns aren't
besting<00:04:42.360> easily<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.020> think<00:04:43.199> the<00:04:43.800> cable<00:04:44.190> is

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
besting easily I think the cable is

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.730 
besting easily I think the cable is
probably<00:04:45.030> one<00:04:45.330> of<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.690> worst<00:04:45.930> guns<00:04:46.259> in<00:04:46.500> the

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
probably one of the worst guns in the

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.490 
probably one of the worst guns in the
game<00:04:46.919> now<00:04:47.520> how<00:04:47.729> about<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:48.060> majestic<00:04:48.660> six<00:04:49.050> well

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
game now how about the majestic six well

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.070 
game now how about the majestic six well
it's<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.919> six<00:04:50.190> shooter<00:04:50.280> much<00:04:50.850> like<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.449> 44

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
it's a six shooter much like the 44

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.409 
it's a six shooter much like the 44
Magnum<00:04:52.110> of<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.919> future<00:04:53.250> definitely<00:04:54.240> has<00:04:54.389> a

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
Magnum of the future definitely has a

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.409 
Magnum of the future definitely has a
lot<00:04:54.660> of<00:04:54.720> damage<00:04:55.020> per<00:04:55.500> shot<00:04:55.789> and<00:04:56.789> it<00:04:56.940> will<00:04:57.180> kill

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
lot of damage per shot and it will kill

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.570 
lot of damage per shot and it will kill
somebody<00:04:57.690> in<00:04:57.900> one<00:04:58.139> shot<00:04:58.530> if<00:04:58.979> they<00:04:59.039> don't<00:04:59.340> have

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
somebody in one shot if they don't have

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.430 
somebody in one shot if they don't have
any<00:04:59.759> armor<00:05:00.150> on<00:05:00.240> if<00:05:00.479> they<00:05:00.660> do<00:05:00.720> have<00:05:01.020> armor<00:05:01.320> on

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
any armor on if they do have armor on

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.990 
any armor on if they do have armor on
it's<00:05:01.650> gonna<00:05:01.770> be<00:05:01.979> two<00:05:02.220> shots<00:05:02.490> if<00:05:02.699> they<00:05:02.820> have

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
it's gonna be two shots if they have

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.779 
it's gonna be two shots if they have
full<00:05:03.660> armor<00:05:04.139> and<00:05:04.349> full<00:05:04.889> health<00:05:05.130> it's<00:05:05.430> gonna<00:05:05.580> be

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
full armor and full health it's gonna be

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.670 
full armor and full health it's gonna be
three<00:05:06.210> shots<00:05:06.599> if<00:05:06.870> you're<00:05:07.020> not<00:05:07.169> hitting<00:05:07.410> them

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
three shots if you're not hitting them

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.070 
three shots if you're not hitting them
in<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.919> head<00:05:08.039> to<00:05:08.400> kill<00:05:08.729> them<00:05:08.970> that's<00:05:09.570> actually

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
in the head to kill them that's actually

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.749 
in the head to kill them that's actually
pretty<00:05:10.320> bad<00:05:10.530> especially<00:05:10.710> for<00:05:11.130> a<00:05:11.310> pistol<00:05:11.639> that

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
pretty bad especially for a pistol that

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.330 
pretty bad especially for a pistol that
only<00:05:11.940> has<00:05:12.180> six<00:05:12.509> bullets<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.199> when<00:05:13.949> people<00:05:14.130> are

how<00:05:21.840> about<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.229> laser<00:05:22.470> sight<00:05:22.830> that<00:05:23.070> we're

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
how about the laser sight that we're

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.000 
how about the laser sight that we're
attaching<00:05:23.970> to<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.270> majestic<00:05:24.570> six<00:05:25.139> I'm<00:05:25.530> kind

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
attaching to the majestic six I'm kind

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.890 
attaching to the majestic six I'm kind
of<00:05:26.099> in<00:05:26.280> a<00:05:26.400> love-hate<00:05:26.849> relationship<00:05:27.539> with<00:05:27.750> the

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
of in a love-hate relationship with the

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.320 
of in a love-hate relationship with the
laser<00:05:28.110> sight<00:05:28.440> right<00:05:28.680> now<00:05:28.740> on<00:05:29.159> one<00:05:29.610> hand<00:05:29.639> it

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
laser sight right now on one hand it

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.230 
laser sight right now on one hand it
gives<00:05:30.570> you<00:05:30.690> a<00:05:30.750> much<00:05:31.110> tighter<00:05:31.560> hipfire<00:05:31.860> spread

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
gives you a much tighter hipfire spread

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.300 
gives you a much tighter hipfire spread
so<00:05:33.240> you're<00:05:33.570> gonna<00:05:33.690> get<00:05:33.960> better<00:05:34.470> accuracy<00:05:34.889> when

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
so you're gonna get better accuracy when

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.250 
so you're gonna get better accuracy when
shooting<00:05:35.610> from<00:05:35.789> the<00:05:35.940> hip<00:05:36.090> this<00:05:36.479> could<00:05:37.110> be

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
shooting from the hip this could be

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.990 
shooting from the hip this could be
great<00:05:37.530> for<00:05:37.800> running<00:05:38.250> around<00:05:38.370> jumping<00:05:38.880> around

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
great for running around jumping around

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.270 
great for running around jumping around
and<00:05:39.330> not<00:05:39.449> needing<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:39.960> aim<00:05:40.080> down<00:05:40.260> sight<00:05:40.650> the

and not needing the aim down sight the

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.899 
and not needing the aim down sight the
offhand

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
offhand

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.120

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
is that it takes away your targeting

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.770 
is that it takes away your targeting
reticle<00:05:44.610> and<00:05:44.820> you'll<00:05:44.970> notice<00:05:45.240> here<00:05:45.510> when<00:05:45.659> I'm

firing from the hip that the laser from

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.420 
firing from the hip that the laser from
the<00:05:48.720> actual<00:05:49.050> gun<00:05:49.260> gets<00:05:49.590> lost<00:05:49.889> very<00:05:50.310> easily

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
the actual gun gets lost very easily

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.520 
the actual gun gets lost very easily
it's<00:05:51.090> very<00:05:51.150> hard<00:05:51.570> for<00:05:51.750> me<00:05:51.870> to<00:05:51.900> actually<00:05:52.349> keep

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
it's very hard for me to actually keep

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.409 
it's very hard for me to actually keep
track<00:05:52.860> of<00:05:53.280> where<00:05:53.550> the<00:05:53.669> center<00:05:53.880> of<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.150> screen

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
track of where the center of the screen

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.080 
track of where the center of the screen
is<00:05:54.539> and<00:05:54.900> be<00:05:55.349> on<00:05:55.500> target<00:05:56.009> so<00:05:56.490> in<00:05:56.639> one<00:05:56.820> hand

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
is and be on target so in one hand

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.540 
is and be on target so in one hand
you're<00:05:57.539> technically<00:05:58.229> more<00:05:58.710> accurate<00:05:59.280> but<00:05:59.430> on

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
you're technically more accurate but on

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.089 
you're technically more accurate but on
the<00:05:59.669> other<00:05:59.820> hand<00:06:00.120> you<00:06:00.270> have<00:06:00.300> a<00:06:00.449> much<00:06:01.099> crappier

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
the other hand you have a much crappier

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:04.159 
the other hand you have a much crappier
way<00:06:02.310> of<00:06:02.580> actually<00:06:03.090> getting<00:06:03.419> your<00:06:03.630> target<00:06:04.080> or

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
way of actually getting your target or

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.800 
way of actually getting your target or
on<00:06:04.349> target<00:06:05.070> so<00:06:05.400> it<00:06:05.729> just<00:06:05.940> becomes<00:06:06.240> very<00:06:06.330> very

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
on target so it just becomes very very

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.170 
on target so it just becomes very very
difficult<00:06:07.169> to<00:06:07.620> use<00:06:07.889> and<00:06:08.159> I<00:06:08.610> feel<00:06:08.820> like<00:06:09.000> it's

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
difficult to use and I feel like it's

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.540 
difficult to use and I feel like it's
almost<00:06:09.360> not<00:06:09.720> worth<00:06:09.750> the<00:06:10.530> added<00:06:11.130> bonus<00:06:11.340> to

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
almost not worth the added bonus to

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.450 
almost not worth the added bonus to
hipfire<00:06:12.030> accuracy<00:06:12.539> it<00:06:13.380> honestly<00:06:13.770> reminds<00:06:14.250> me

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
hipfire accuracy it honestly reminds me

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.129 
hipfire accuracy it honestly reminds me

screen<00:07:00.980> all<00:07:01.700> right<00:07:01.940> so<00:07:02.210> let's<00:07:02.419> do<00:07:02.570> a<00:07:02.600> recap<00:07:03.110> of

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.290 
screen all right so let's do a recap of

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.260 
screen all right so let's do a recap of
this<00:07:03.410> build<00:07:03.710> here<00:07:04.100> we've<00:07:04.310> got<00:07:04.520> the<00:07:04.700> cable<00:07:04.910> -

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
this build here we've got the cable -

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.450 
this build here we've got the cable -
probably<00:07:05.540> my<00:07:05.990> least<00:07:06.290> favorite<00:07:06.919> primary

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
probably my least favorite primary

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.360 
probably my least favorite primary
weapon<00:07:07.940> just<00:07:08.240> bad<00:07:08.600> in<00:07:08.870> general<00:07:09.350> then<00:07:10.190> we've

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
weapon just bad in general then we've

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.030 
weapon just bad in general then we've
got<00:07:10.610> the<00:07:10.820> majestic<00:07:11.419> six<00:07:11.750> a<00:07:11.960> very<00:07:12.229> hard<00:07:12.560> gun<00:07:12.830> to

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.040 
got the majestic six a very hard gun to

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.700 
got the majestic six a very hard gun to
use<00:07:13.310> not<00:07:13.970> particularly<00:07:14.570> great<00:07:15.169> if<00:07:15.380> you<00:07:15.530> miss

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:15.710 
use not particularly great if you miss

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.620 
use not particularly great if you miss
any<00:07:16.010> of<00:07:16.160> your<00:07:16.310> shots<00:07:16.580> and<00:07:16.850> then<00:07:17.300> we're<00:07:17.510> giving

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630 
any of your shots and then we're giving

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.240 
any of your shots and then we're giving
it<00:07:17.900> a<00:07:17.990> laser<00:07:18.260> pointer<00:07:18.590> which<00:07:18.919> is<00:07:19.070> going<00:07:19.190> to

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.250 
it a laser pointer which is going to

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.340 
it a laser pointer which is going to
make<00:07:19.400> it<00:07:19.580> even<00:07:19.910> more<00:07:20.389> difficult<00:07:20.630> to<00:07:21.080> hit<00:07:21.200> your

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350 
make it even more difficult to hit your

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.710 
make it even more difficult to hit your
targets<00:07:21.770> when<00:07:22.310> hip<00:07:22.490> firing<00:07:22.520> then<00:07:23.360> we<00:07:23.540> have

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720 
targets when hip firing then we have

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.170 
targets when hip firing then we have
really<00:07:24.169> clunky<00:07:24.560> weapon<00:07:25.220> switching<00:07:25.490> mechanics

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:26.180 
really clunky weapon switching mechanics

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.330 
really clunky weapon switching mechanics
that<00:07:26.419> are<00:07:26.450> just<00:07:26.870> inherent<00:07:27.380> to<00:07:27.530> this<00:07:27.650> game<00:07:28.040> so

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.340 
that are just inherent to this game so

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.879 
that are just inherent to this game so
not<00:07:29.270> only<00:07:29.419> is<00:07:29.630> it<00:07:29.660> difficult<00:07:30.169> to<00:07:30.350> do<00:07:30.470> weapon

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:30.889 
not only is it difficult to do weapon

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:32.680 
not only is it difficult to do weapon
switching<00:07:31.160> precisely<00:07:31.760> quickly<00:07:32.479> and

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690 
switching precisely quickly and

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.050 
switching precisely quickly and
accurately<00:07:32.960> but<00:07:33.650> we've<00:07:33.770> got<00:07:33.979> two<00:07:34.220> bad<00:07:34.490> guns<00:07:34.790> to

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:35.060 
accurately but we've got two bad guns to

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.120 
accurately but we've got two bad guns to
switch<00:07:35.300> between<00:07:35.479> this<00:07:36.260> is<00:07:36.380> pretty<00:07:36.650> much<00:07:36.860> the

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.130 
switch between this is pretty much the

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.909 
switch between this is pretty much the
worst<00:07:37.570> crisis<00:07:38.570> lota<00:07:38.810> I've<00:07:39.080> ever<00:07:39.350> done

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 
worst crisis lota I've ever done

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:42.310 
worst crisis lota I've ever done
no<00:07:40.310> more<00:07:40.520> weapon<00:07:40.940> switching<00:07:41.210> load<00:07:41.510> ask<00:07:41.720> guys<00:07:41.960> I

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:42.320 
no more weapon switching load ask guys I

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.740 
no more weapon switching load ask guys I
