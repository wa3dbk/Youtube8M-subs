00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
a little bit and then I'm gonna throw my

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.319 
a little bit and then I'm gonna throw my

apples<00:00:51.719> or<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.049> may<00:00:52.769> use<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.979> little<00:00:53.190> bit<00:00:53.309> less

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
apples or so may use a little bit less

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.759 
apples or so may use a little bit less
since<00:00:54.000> my<00:00:54.120> pan<00:00:54.299> is<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.479> little<00:00:54.750> bit<00:00:54.839> smaller<00:00:55.140> but

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769

now the key to caramelizing is just

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.270 
now the key to caramelizing is just
letting<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.199> sit<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.559> there<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.890> little<00:00:59.129> bit

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
letting it sit in there for a little bit

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.670 
letting it sit in there for a little bit
and<00:00:59.549> I<00:00:59.909> love<00:01:00.239> caramelizing<00:01:00.690> because<00:01:01.079> it's

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
lot it might shift them a little bit to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.130 
lot it might shift them a little bit to
make<00:01:45.000> sure<00:01:45.149> they<00:01:45.270> don't<00:01:45.359> burn<00:01:45.599> from<00:01:45.869> time<00:01:46.020> to

make sure they don't burn from time to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.580 
make sure they don't burn from time to
time

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
time

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.319 
time
it<00:01:46.770> should<00:01:46.950> take<00:01:47.130> anywhere<00:01:47.340> from<00:01:47.490> two<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.179> five

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
it should take anywhere from two to five
