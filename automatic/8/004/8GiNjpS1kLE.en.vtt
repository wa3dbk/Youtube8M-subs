00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 I'll show you my extra 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.480
 hair care, in principle, could be 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.630
 do without him but not glad that 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.330
 I have these bonuses and sometimes my voices 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.009
 and i kind of them homemade masks i do 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.379
 rarely because i have them on just not 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.779
 have enough time or more often i 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.300
 mistaken components my hair after 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.840
 masks are either home dried or 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.000
 the opposite is supersaturated and so i'm not 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.949
 fond of homemade masks but if 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.920
 suddenly I decided to do my home 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.960
 mask then always as a basis i 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.030
 I use this one with the face 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.980
 on the basis of this fluid, I dilute all 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.000
 the remaining components and add died 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.219
 egg yolk 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.309
 olive oil can also add 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.219
 coconut oil but here coconut oil 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.440
 my voice is a little drying 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.449
 it seems that this oil is just not mine mine 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.780
 most favorite burdock oil and more often 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.860
 I just mix these two components 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.370
 not enough burdock oil 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.129
 and everything is fine. I will put this on 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.119
 mask on the hair roots on the scalp 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.680
 because it works if prices only 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.080
 it is with the hair roots that it stimulates 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.090
 Hair Growth 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.549
 it is the total length I can apply here 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.729
 residues like burdock for i can 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.310
 add broccoli butter either simple 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.650
 olive oil but it is these 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.600
 two burdock and if prices 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.479
 I still try to wash in the scalp 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.640
 to the effect was evident after 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.650
 i washed my hair i dry them in 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.729
 I don't use natural mode 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.979
 what genes 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.759
 that is, my hair dries themselves 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.610
 myself and before combing them i 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.500
 apply some indelible spray 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.369
 I really liked it lately 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.540
 spray klava cipher at first i have it 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.700
 underestimated it seemed to me that his 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.220
 just intercepted that he is not 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.470
 working so wonderful about him 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.259
 everyone started talking on youtube and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.840
 originally as first bought 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.899
 these products I somehow treated him 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.299
 skeptical but then I keep it 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.660
 used used my hair 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.780
 such after him smooth such 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.950
 soft 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.590
 work smells so good indeed 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.920
 Antiques are pleasant to the touch and gorgeous 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.790
 great combing so here with 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.310
 stroke 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.120
 now probably one of my most 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.709
 favorite will be a series of mass market of skye 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.220
 hair care cosmetics 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.080
 next spray cheaper and simpler 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.930
 Belarusian-made 3d keratin from 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.590
 exclusive cosmetics 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.530
 well she's not really working really but 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.930
 in size best of what is in 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.160
 Belarusian indelible entrance and 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.640
 hair cosmetics 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.750
 all that I had before he went 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.810
 in the bin right here without a doubt 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.629
 this spray is quite simply if vados 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.769
 comparing it even we are with it just 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:07.530
 water in the set is easy to comb 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.170
 have a little hair softening 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.099
 but there is a certain aesthetics of some 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.739
 the harmonies in this blue slashes plus this 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.860
 dangling lid everywhere lost but 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.480
 here there are certainly flaws in it but 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.129
 the most important thing is that all the same its function 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.530
 moisturizing hair 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:30.450
 softening and improving combing he 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.379
 well, everything else is possible 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.599
 to endure 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.130
 although the more I buy it most likely 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.130
 I will not be something and 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.450
 search in Belarusian products 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.640
 production for hair 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.380
 but also my favorite oils with which I am not 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.720
 parted neither day nor night 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.330
 this oil is from loreal first oil and 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.030
 kerastase series is a pink bottle for 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.130
 very dead hair 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.220
 I really like this oil in principle 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:00.060
 as well as oil from l'oreal oil 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.270
 extra ordinary I don't see in them yet 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.090
 some obvious difference to make for 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.190
 you comparative characteristic just 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.210
 I will say that both these mass smells great 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.850
 fit perfectly on the hair improve 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.400
 combing is better from appearance all 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.370
 what they say on youtube about these oils 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.650
 all true they work they are not only 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.520
 improve the appearance of the hair but they also 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.580
 lick them 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.320
 but if we talk about the composition of 2 kerastase 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.140
 slightly natural composition 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.390
 I like this more but here I am 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.000
 like that glass bottle to me 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.980
 lucky to tear off the old series now 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.270
 there are no glass bottles but I have 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.670
 oil glass 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.640
 smells gorgeous effect wonderful 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.340
 if i still see some such 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.050
 specific difference in these oils then i 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.850
 taken for you I will do a comparative 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.040
 one more favorite feature 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.960
 butter it is not purely organ war with 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.300
 additives but we also work well with 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.000
 her hair is so petite 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.340
 boxes flacons marching option 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.450
 you can always take everywhere with you and 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.160
 hair will be in good condition at last 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.380
 I got pure argan oil 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.910
 but so far I have not tried it yet and I 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.850
 only while it pleases me 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:19.410
 she appeared to me in a prominent place 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:22.020
 and I walk him licks I'm sure that he 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.000
 they won't disappoint him mom brought me 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.640
 from Turkey 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.220
 you remember this because it does not write 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.010
 still made Rus, so basically you can 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.320
 take shi and butter which is sold in 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.900
 our stores cost well 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.350
 will cost the same money but here is the quality 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.080
 Of course everyone decides for me 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.230
 for example with somehow calmer that to me 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.020
 brought the oil from the country where 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.380
 it is actually made like this 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.300
