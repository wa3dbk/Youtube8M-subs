00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.670 
18 on an 18 to 55 millimeter zoom so not
only<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.719> want<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> wide<00:00:49.469> angle

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
only do you want to have a wide angle

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.529 
only do you want to have a wide angle
but<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.190> want<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> maximum<00:00:51.270> depth

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
but you want to have the maximum depth

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.979 
but you want to have the maximum depth
of<00:00:51.719> field<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.320> get<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.620> well<00:00:53.510> now<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.600> could

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
of field you can get as well now I could

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.900 
of field you can get as well now I could
have<00:00:55.079> decided<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.920> particular<00:00:56.129> shot

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
have decided in this particular shot

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.970 
have decided in this particular shot
that<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> wanted<00:00:57.629> perhaps<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.199> farmhouse<00:00:58.710> in

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that I wanted perhaps the farmhouse in

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.170 
that I wanted perhaps the farmhouse in
focus<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.750> fields<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.559> front<00:01:02.219> out<00:01:02.940> of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
focus and the fields in front out of

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.109 
focus and the fields in front out of
focus<00:01:03.439> what<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.589> would<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.339> direct<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
focus what this would do is direct the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.810 
focus what this would do is direct the
eye<00:01:06.150> towards<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.110> farmhouse<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.490> didn't

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
eye towards that farmhouse but I didn't

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.280 
eye towards that farmhouse but I didn't
really<00:01:08.909> want<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.479> wanted<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.110> have

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
really want that I wanted to have

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.800 
really want that I wanted to have
everything<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:11.100> much<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.580> possible<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.270> focus

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
everything as much as possible in focus

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.980 
everything as much as possible in focus
so<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.740> did<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.549> set<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.150> maximum

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
so what I did is I set for a maximum

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.310 
so what I did is I set for a maximum
depth<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.530> field<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.570> way<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> did<00:01:18.900> that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
depth of field and the way I did that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.520 
depth of field and the way I did that
was<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.890> had<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> camera<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> tripod<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.530> I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
was I had the camera on a tripod and I

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.609 
was I had the camera on a tripod and I
set<00:01:22.830> my<00:01:23.040> lens<00:01:23.460> opening<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.150> f-22<00:01:24.990> which<00:01:25.409> is

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
set my lens opening for f-22 which is

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.740 
set my lens opening for f-22 which is
the<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.159> smallest<00:01:26.640> opening<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.570> on

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the the smallest opening you can have on

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.109 
the the smallest opening you can have on
this<00:01:27.869> particular<00:01:28.200> lens<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.909> did

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
this particular lens and what that did

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.330 
this particular lens and what that did
is<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.329> gave<00:01:30.780> me<00:01:30.810> maximum<00:01:31.500> depth<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.070> field

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
is that gave me maximum depth of field

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.620 
is that gave me maximum depth of field
if<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.640> look<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:32.970> hard<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.270> see<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
if you look it's hard to see on the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.660 
if you look it's hard to see on the
video<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:34.020> course<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:35.040> if<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.280> look<00:01:35.430> at<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
video of course but if you look at the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.370 
video of course but if you look at the
shot<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.240> would<00:01:36.390> see<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:36.960> pretty<00:01:37.200> well

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
shot you would see that it's pretty well

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.890 
shot you would see that it's pretty well
in<00:01:37.530> focus<00:01:37.979> right<00:01:38.700> from<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> foreground<00:01:39.479> all

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
in focus right from the foreground all

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.920 
in focus right from the foreground all
the<00:01:40.049> way<00:01:40.200> back<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> farmhouse<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:42.630> that's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the way back to the farmhouse and that's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.620 
the way back to the farmhouse and that's
exactly<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.560> was<00:01:43.680> looking<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:44.119> so<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.149> used

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
exactly what I was looking for so I used

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.539 
exactly what I was looking for so I used
a<00:01:45.750> small<00:01:46.049> opening<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.649> because<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.130> I

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
a small opening and because of that I

because it was on a tripod it gave me

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.790 
because it was on a tripod it gave me
the<00:02:08.280> opportunity<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.929> really<00:02:10.080> compose<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
the opportunity to to really compose the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
it and that's one thing a tripod can do

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.179 
it and that's one thing a tripod can do
people<00:02:14.359> talking<00:02:14.629> about<00:02:14.750> using<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:15.049> tripod<00:02:15.260> so

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
people talking about using a tripod so

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.009 
people talking about using a tripod so
your<00:02:16.370> image<00:02:16.670> doesn't<00:02:16.909> get<00:02:17.150> blurry<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:17.689> it's

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
your image doesn't get blurry but it's

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.349 
your image doesn't get blurry but it's
also<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:19.040> almost<00:02:19.310> forces<00:02:19.819> you<00:02:19.939> to<00:02:20.090> slow<00:02:20.120> down

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
also it almost forces you to slow down

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.050 
also it almost forces you to slow down
and<00:02:20.840> really<00:02:21.109> compose<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.859> shot<00:02:22.129> and<00:02:22.400> take<00:02:23.030> a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
and really compose the shot and take a

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.199 
and really compose the shot and take a
good<00:02:23.329> look<00:02:23.510> at<00:02:23.719> it<00:02:23.799> so<00:02:25.000> that's<00:02:26.000> basically

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
good look at it so that's basically

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.330 
good look at it so that's basically
