the<00:01:02.370> pillar<00:01:02.609> technology<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.780> similar<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
the pillar technology is that similar to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.130 
the pillar technology is that similar to
directly<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.159> same<00:01:05.430> suspension<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:07.020> we

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
directly the same suspension that we

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.740 
directly the same suspension that we
have<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> corner<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:09.090> everything<00:01:09.600> we

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
have in the corner so everything we

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.620 
have in the corner so everything we
could<00:01:09.930> keep<00:01:10.369> that<00:01:11.369> was<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> most<00:01:11.880> were<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
little bit smaller the Kronos was

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.569 
little bit smaller the Kronos was
designed<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.320> more<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.560> 12-inch<00:01:32.009> arms<00:01:32.369> this

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
designed to more for 12-inch arms this

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.760 
designed to more for 12-inch arms this
one<00:01:32.790> accommodates<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> 10<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> 10<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> a

one accommodates up to 10 a 10 and a
half<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:35.159> could<00:01:35.310> always<00:01:35.490> fit<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> 12<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.990> case

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
half we could always fit a 12 in case

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.830 
half we could always fit a 12 in case
somebody<00:01:37.619> wanted<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:39.180> were<00:01:39.360> asked<00:01:39.659> to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
somebody wanted it but we were asked to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.539 
somebody wanted it but we were asked to
have<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.079> turntable<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.710> either<00:01:40.890> bit<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.430> an

have a turntable that either bit of an
arrow<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.210> footprint<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.290> did<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.280> with

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
arrow for footprint so we did this with

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.569 
arrow for footprint so we did this with
this<00:01:44.700> model<00:01:45.090> by<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.420> way<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:46.460> turntable<00:01:47.460> is
