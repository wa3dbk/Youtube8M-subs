00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that's it so when I'm playing this beat

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.850 
that's it so when I'm playing this beat
I'm<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.329> gonna<00:01:57.420> insert<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.930> flam<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.380> there

every<00:01:59.190> other<00:01:59.310> time<00:01:59.550> and<00:01:59.820> it's<00:02:00.810> gonna<00:02:01.020> have

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
every other time and it's gonna have

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.440 
every other time and it's gonna have
like<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.620> quick<00:02:01.830> little<00:02:02.130> blip<00:02:02.400> sound<00:02:02.730> that<00:02:03.210> kind

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
like a quick little blip sound that kind

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.940 
like a quick little blip sound that kind
of<00:02:03.480> makes<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:04.170> bit<00:02:04.320> more<00:02:04.440> aggressive

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
of makes it a little bit more aggressive

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.980 
of makes it a little bit more aggressive
I<00:02:05.070> guess<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.550> anyways<00:02:06.360> yeah<00:02:06.540> here's<00:02:06.750> what<00:02:06.900> its

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
I guess so anyways yeah here's what its

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.730 
I guess so anyways yeah here's what its
gonna<00:02:07.080> sound<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.470> at<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.770> slow<00:02:07.950> speed<00:02:12.740> and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
gonna sound like at a slow speed and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.900 
gonna sound like at a slow speed and
when<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.070> speed<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> beat<00:02:14.490> up<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.790> get

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
when you speed the beat up you get

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.510 
when you speed the beat up you get
something<00:02:15.210> like<00:02:15.330> this
