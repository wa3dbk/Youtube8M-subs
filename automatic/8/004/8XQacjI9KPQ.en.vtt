away<00:02:00.000> from<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.600> activeness<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.320> really

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
away from that in activeness I really

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.050 
away from that in activeness I really
don't<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.979> doing<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.580> don't<00:02:02.790> know<00:02:02.850> why<00:02:03.030> I

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
don't like doing that I don't know why I

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.730 
don't like doing that I don't know why I
did<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.659> guess<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.200> was<00:02:04.290> cuz<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.500> was<00:02:04.650> in

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
did but I guess it was cuz I was in

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.170 
did but I guess it was cuz I was in
California<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.250> didn't<00:02:05.460> really<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.729> access

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
California I didn't really have access

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.670 
California I didn't really have access
to<00:02:06.300> a<00:02:06.330> computer<00:02:06.509> with<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> microphone<00:02:07.440> or

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
to a computer with a microphone or

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.499 
to a computer with a microphone or
gameplay<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.970> that's<00:02:09.090> pretty<00:02:09.300> much<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
gameplay on it so that's pretty much a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.809 
gameplay on it so that's pretty much a
pretty<00:02:09.959> big<00:02:10.259> reason<00:02:10.770> along<00:02:11.220> with<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.610> fact

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
pretty big reason along with the fact

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.970 
pretty big reason along with the fact
that<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.090> also<00:02:12.360> did<00:02:12.780> not<00:02:12.989> want<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.350> rape<00:02:13.680> their

internet for the hour and a half it

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.960

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.000 
story and I see this bag with like these
beers<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.359> it<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.690> one<00:03:24.989> of<00:03:25.079> them<00:03:25.200> was<00:03:25.320> open<00:03:25.799> and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
beers in it and one of them was open and

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.800 
beers in it and one of them was open and
up<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.549> thought<00:03:26.940> they<00:03:27.060> were<00:03:27.120> empty<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:27.780> I

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
up and so I thought they were empty so I

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.810 
up and so I thought they were empty so I
walk<00:03:28.200> over<00:03:28.410> there<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:28.859> for<00:03:29.220> some<00:03:29.370> reason<00:03:29.400> I

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
walk over there and for some reason I

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.699 
walk over there and for some reason I
feel<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.299> need<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.690> just<00:03:30.930> punt<00:03:31.200> these<00:03:31.380> cans
