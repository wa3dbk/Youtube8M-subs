00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.460
 Easy pigtails for every day 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.040
 [Music] 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.020
 in the first action we will separate a 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.820
 Tuft of the ear diagonally towards the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.050
 other side and with the rest of hair 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.240
 we will make a pigtail 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.250
 now let's make a root braid 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.529
 three-way crossed inside 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.599
 we crossed normal the first crossing and when 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.850
 we cross below we add hair and 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.769
 we make it normal above we add 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.809
 hair when we cross below and by 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.030
 up we make it normal just 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.280
 we use the three mentions inside 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.040
 and we add hair when we cross by 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.350
 down we braid the whole lock and 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.440
 we tie the braid with a small rubber 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.120
 we wrap it around the pigtail 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.120
 [Music] 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.120
 we hold it with forks and you're done 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.069
 [Music] 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.080
 in the second option we divide the 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.600
 hair in two partitions 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.690
 and we let loose a small lock of 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.060
 each side 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.340
 now we take the two small strands 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.070
 we pass them over we cross them 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.070
 each other and we pass them down below 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:32.509
 and we pass them over and cross them 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.509
 and we passed them again below 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.520
 [Music] 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.660
 we are crossing the two strands until 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.660
 that are too short 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.660
 and then we add hair from one of the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.690
 two pigtails we make a pigtail behind 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.690
 to hold the strands and ready 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.289
 [Music] 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.939
 in the last option we take a lock of 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.649
 one side of the top part and what 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.869
 we separate so that it does not bother us and 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.869
 we make a pigtail with all the hair 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.320
 with the lock we are going to make a braid 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.570
 of three ends and we are going to add hair 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.440
 in the first crosses to leave it more 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.560
 punch 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.560
 [Music] 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.950
 we braid normal to the tip and the 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.200
 we tie with a small rubber now the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.810
 we went over it we rolled it up 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.060
 the rubber and ready what option you liked 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.860
