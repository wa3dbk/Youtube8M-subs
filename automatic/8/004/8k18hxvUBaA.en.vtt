and I haven't taken very good care of it

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.999 
and I haven't taken very good care of it
it's<00:00:22.450> been<00:00:22.539> sitting<00:00:22.900> outside<00:00:22.990> quite<00:00:23.529> a<00:00:23.560> bit

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.800 
it's been sitting outside quite a bit
so<00:00:24.640> we're<00:00:24.759> going<00:00:24.849> to<00:00:24.939> cut<00:00:25.090> those<00:00:25.240> off<00:00:25.450> today

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
so we're going to cut those off today

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.220 
so we're going to cut those off today
and<00:00:25.960> put<00:00:26.110> some<00:00:26.259> new<00:00:26.380> ones<00:00:26.529> on<00:00:28.050> these<00:00:29.050> are<00:00:29.169> the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
and put some new ones on these are the

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.780 
and put some new ones on these are the
wheels<00:00:29.439> I'm<00:00:29.710> going<00:00:29.890> to<00:00:29.950> use<00:00:30.219> in<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:30.550> place

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
wheels I'm going to use in the place

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:47.750 
wheels I'm going to use in the place
that<00:00:30.939> I'm<00:00:31.059> going<00:00:31.090> to<00:00:31.270> cut<00:00:31.419> the<00:00:31.540> mounts<00:00:31.719> out<00:00:31.960> of

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.190 

one<00:00:48.760> of<00:00:48.790> my<00:00:48.910> main<00:00:49.120> reasons<00:00:49.360> for<00:00:49.630> one<00:00:49.900> to<00:00:50.050> hack

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
one of my main reasons for one to hack

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.440 
one of my main reasons for one to hack
this<00:00:50.380> thing<00:00:50.440> up<00:00:50.860> and<00:00:51.130> kind<00:00:51.670> of<00:00:51.730> rebuild<00:00:52.150> it<00:00:52.329> as

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
this thing up and kind of rebuild it as

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.490 
this thing up and kind of rebuild it as
it<00:00:52.600> originally<00:00:52.840> had<00:00:53.380> three<00:00:54.040> swivel<00:00:54.820> casters

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
it originally had three swivel casters

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.330 
it originally had three swivel casters
that<00:00:56.500> were<00:00:56.620> pretty<00:00:56.800> small<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:59.440> I<00:00:59.710> think<00:01:00.100> it

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
that were pretty small and I I think it

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.399 
that were pretty small and I I think it
only<00:01:00.460> needs<00:01:00.760> one<00:01:00.850> on<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:03.309> end<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:03.989> then<00:01:04.989> I'm

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
only needs one on this end and then I'm

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.969 
only needs one on this end and then I'm
going<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.619> put<00:01:05.860> two<00:01:07.259> straight<00:01:08.259> wheels<00:01:08.470> on<00:01:08.829> the

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
going to put two straight wheels on the

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.770 
going to put two straight wheels on the
on<00:01:09.219> the<00:01:09.520> two<00:01:09.990> other<00:01:10.990> ends<00:01:11.350> here<00:01:12.329> so<00:01:13.329> that<00:01:13.600> went

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
on the two other ends here so that went

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.420 
on the two other ends here so that went
on<00:01:13.840> pork<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.380> head<00:01:14.560> bolts<00:01:14.920> or<00:01:15.040> something<00:01:15.370> I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
on pork and head bolts or something I

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.770 
on pork and head bolts or something I
don't<00:01:15.610> have<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:15.909> have<00:01:16.060> so<00:01:16.360> much<00:01:16.479> trouble

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
don't have to have so much trouble

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:32.390 
don't have to have so much trouble
chasing<00:01:17.350> it<00:01:17.470> around

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.410 

these<00:01:33.400> are<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:33.610> wheels<00:01:33.729> that<00:01:33.909> I'm<00:01:34.090> planning

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
these are the wheels that I'm planning

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.750 
these are the wheels that I'm planning
to<00:01:34.510> put<00:01:34.720> on<00:01:34.870> this<00:01:35.110> end<00:01:35.409> I<00:01:35.680> just<00:01:35.760> fabricated

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
to put on this end I just fabricated

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
to put on this end I just fabricated
some<00:01:36.940> plates<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:37.660> will<00:01:38.290> weld<00:01:38.500> them<00:01:38.650> on

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
some plates and will weld them on

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.870 
some plates and will weld them on
well<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:41.050> plates<00:01:41.560> on<00:01:41.770> so<00:01:42.010> that<00:01:42.130> we<00:01:42.250> can<00:01:42.460> bolt

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
well the plates on so that we can bolt

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.120 
well the plates on so that we can bolt
the<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.690> wheels<00:01:43.960> on<00:01:44.260> so<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.650> we<00:01:44.740> can<00:01:44.890> change

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
the the wheels on so that we can change

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.040 
the the wheels on so that we can change
them<00:01:45.369> if<00:01:45.460> there's<00:01:45.670> everyone<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:46.240> damaged<00:01:46.720> or

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
them if there's everyone and damaged or

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.920 
them if there's everyone and damaged or
doesn't<00:01:47.470> roll<00:01:47.619> quite<00:01:47.890> right<00:01:51.479> okay<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:52.840> is

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
doesn't roll quite right okay this is

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
doesn't roll quite right okay this is
going<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.110> be<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.229> little<00:01:53.470> hard<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:53.800> do

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
going to be a little hard to do

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:25.100 
going to be a little hard to do
one-handed

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.660
