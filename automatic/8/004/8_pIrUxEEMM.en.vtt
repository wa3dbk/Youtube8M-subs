in the video let's quickly have a look
at<00:00:53.730> what<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.059> machine<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.719> pablo<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.440> get

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
at what this machine is pablo so get

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.920 
at what this machine is pablo so get
into<00:00:55.829> silymarin<00:00:56.160> 1.4<00:00:56.850> gigas<00:00:57.239> dual-core

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
into silymarin 1.4 gigas dual-core

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.479 
into silymarin 1.4 gigas dual-core
processor<00:00:58.500> along<00:00:58.620> with<00:00:58.680> four<00:00:58.980> gigabyte<00:00:59.340> of

quite nice for divides us under 300

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.250 
quite nice for divides us under 300
pounds<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> UK<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.510> definitely<00:01:09.869> not<00:01:10.020> bad

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
pounds in the UK it's definitely not bad

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.609 
feel on it is quite plasticky and
sometimes<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> mouse<00:01:15.810> does<00:01:16.049> jump<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.590> over

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
sometimes the mouse does jump all over

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.160 
sometimes the mouse does jump all over
the<00:01:16.890> place<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.610> screen<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> best

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the place the screen is not the best

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.550 
the place the screen is not the best
resolution<00:01:19.619> measuring<00:01:20.369> at<00:01:20.490> 1366<00:01:21.479> by<00:01:21.570> 768

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
resolution measuring at 1366 by 768

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.710 
resolution measuring at 1366 by 768
but<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:23.220> again<00:01:23.340> guys<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:24.000> get<00:01:24.150> 15<00:01:24.479> inch

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
but then again guys you can get 15 inch

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.450 
but then again guys you can get 15 inch
models<00:01:25.229> with<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> same<00:01:25.770> resolution<00:01:26.040> so

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
models with the same resolution so

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.859 
models with the same resolution so
considering<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.000> you're<00:01:27.270> losing<00:01:27.450> three

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
considering that you're losing three

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
inch of swing size you will have a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.630 
inch of swing size you will have a
higher<00:01:29.820> ppi<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:31.259> also<00:01:31.409> has<00:01:31.740> 10-point<00:01:32.490> of

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
not gonna be the fastest and sometimes

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.090 
not gonna be the fastest and sometimes
it<00:03:12.540> will<00:03:12.630> stutter<00:03:12.990> but<00:03:13.590> what<00:03:13.770> else<00:03:13.920> do<00:03:14.070> you

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
it will stutter but what else do you

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.940 
it will stutter but what else do you
need<00:03:14.310> for<00:03:14.550> uni<00:03:14.910> or<00:03:15.120> beginning<00:03:15.660> on<00:03:15.720> user<00:03:15.960> you

can also download applications such as

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.470 
can also download applications such as
visual<00:03:19.680> studio<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.550> can<00:03:20.790> do<00:03:20.940> program

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
visual studio so you can do program

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.860 
visual studio so you can do program
making<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.960> C<00:03:22.200> sharp<00:03:22.670> C<00:03:23.670> plus<00:03:23.940> X<00:03:24.210> cetera<00:03:24.600> they

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
making the C sharp C plus X cetera they

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.270 
making the C sharp C plus X cetera they
want<00:03:25.320> absolutely<00:03:25.740> fine

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
want absolutely fine

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.830 
want absolutely fine
the<00:03:26.490> only<00:03:26.700> problem<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.240> you<00:03:27.360> can't<00:03:27.630> run

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
the only problem is you can't run

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.410 
the only problem is you can't run
high-end<00:03:28.350> games<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:29.460> only<00:03:29.490> game<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.820> did<00:03:30.120> try

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
high-end games the only game I did try

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.950 
high-end games the only game I did try
was<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.140> believe<00:03:31.710> it<00:03:31.980> was<00:03:32.190> grid<00:03:32.730> or<00:03:33.030> another

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
was I believe it was grid or another

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.840 
was I believe it was grid or another
World<00:03:34.590> Rally<00:03:34.770> Championship<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:35.730> was

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
World Rally Championship and that was

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.180 
World Rally Championship and that was
run<00:03:36.120> at<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.420> lowest<00:03:36.960> setting<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:38.010> got

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
run at the lowest setting and I got

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.670 
run at the lowest setting and I got
frame<00:03:38.490> rate<00:03:38.820> of<00:03:38.850> about<00:03:39.300> 20<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:39.990> it's<00:03:40.350> not<00:03:40.500> a

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
frame rate of about 20 so it's not a

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.830 
frame rate of about 20 so it's not a
local<00:03:41.340> book<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.880> run<00:03:42.090> games<00:03:42.360> or<00:03:42.480> anything<00:03:42.660> like

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
local book to run games or anything like

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
around here and as you can see the

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.950 
around here and as you can see the
screen<00:04:22.650> since<00:04:23.010> we<00:04:23.190> need<00:04:23.400> dim<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:24.000> dark<00:04:24.360> but<00:04:24.870> if

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
screen since we need dim and dark but if
