00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.160
 A) Yes 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.340
 we are going to see a picture of 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.340
 foreground 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.900
 so they can see how it looks in good light 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.240
 the photographs taken with the nexus 5 and 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.700
 in the foreground that as we can see the 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.880
 approach is super fast makes a 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.380
 incredible light measurement let's do 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.369
 a first photo so that you can 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.369
 see here on screen 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.680
 and now let's put the hdr mode because 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.150
 you can see on this side has like 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.030
 a kind of shadow 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.740
 then we activate the hdr mode if my 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.420
 puppy leaves me 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.929
 to the grave good 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.809
 we activate the hdr mode and as we can see 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:05.430
 now that part that has shade does not 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.430
 I would have to get it right let's go there 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.180
 the approach is magnificent let's do 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.980
 other 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.940
 let's do another one with a focus 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.940
 selective 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.289
 the seal focuses well now 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.750
 Yes now 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.330
 the approach has got me super good 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.340
 and as we can see 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.149
 the photo is magnificent 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.259
 incredible details levels so 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.259
 this is the hdr mode 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.799
 yes 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.850
 we will once again put to the test 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.040
 nexus camera 5 this time we're going to 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.280
 make a backlight photograph a hdr 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.410
 more with the great camera of lexus 5 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.270
 that we're going to put ourselves at the same 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.520
 ground level where the photograph is 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.090
 and to the android we are going to do what 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.950
 the only one that as we can see 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.250
 I would not have to position there anymore or 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.250
 less 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.340
 so that the sun I do not know if they see 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.690
 I'm going to arrange to capture 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.550
 in focus and for 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.970
 how can you see the result is 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.460
 phenomenal 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.060
 so I recommend this great 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.060
 camera 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.750
 first spoke I open the camel app 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.099
 I use it I open photos field and what 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.150
 I try to do it with both hands 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:53.780
 hold until I do the first 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.780
 photo and I'm turning to the right ok 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.480
 and now we find the first 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.820
 photo that we made now we upload what is 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.360
 a tad to start making the photos 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.360
 from above ok 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.110
 I now go back to the position 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.190
 initial and I take a photo 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.030
 from below game 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.030
 as you can see 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.990
 and he's taking the pictures 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.620
 okay 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.760
 and now to make the last two pictures 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.130
 of the ground separates me a little from the ground and 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.130
 I take a picture below ok 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.189
 as you can see there was here a 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.189
 what is a 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.570
 as we can see here I have a fact 5 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.150
 which with which I will take pictures 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.340
 since moving to that 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.560
 see how good they are here we are going to 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.230
 Take a couple of shots so that the 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.230
 can you see where they come from 1 2 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.390
