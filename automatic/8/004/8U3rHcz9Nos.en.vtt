00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.890
 good afternoon friends today we have a project 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.370
 Red October 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.370
 that's what happened with us 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:20.789
 relatively see the key we have for 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:24.029
 semi and he doesn't want what happened now 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:31.309
 we can demonstrate that is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:33.380
 neighbors hammer namely he rubs 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.090
 OK 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.700
 he either loosened in his boarding 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.370
 the place has either shifted partially and now 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.750
 we are 90 defective grief there we press 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.270
 levels there because it is generally the boundaries 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.430
 what are we waiting for we previously shot here 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:57.390
 now we can show you 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.430
 previously removed this one 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.940
 part 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.820
 repaired this is you part of the tower 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.090
 right here started 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:15.090
 now we have a cap here 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:19.970
 it is also well fixed here we are rain and 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.740
 mount now the most important thing like these 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:28.860
 operations 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:31.259
 cork is dismantling this horror . 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.590
 what i did here is here there are such two 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.750
 Does the bayonet neatly right here in the right 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.040
 parts spring so she is very 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.710
 neatly here then there is not afraid 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.960
 easy is the most important thing now see 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.060
 at the moment then we have it so that we have a hammer 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.450
 whom I used to lower 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.850
 what you need for 1 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.850
 this is another hadith 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.409
 you can now show games here 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.739
 organics further we what to do and not 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:15.750
 pull out what i do i take three days 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.730
 a screwdriver here you see where the trick I look 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.050
 what do i have to put for what 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.430
 E key 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.150
 she that saw twisting lacor and like this 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.239
 see 9 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.750
 with the displacement case in the left part so that 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.380
 us my 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.940
 zapadlo no, not touched now on what 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:39.390
 makes and neatly very twisted then 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.340
 there is a fix so she can play there 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:48.269
 to be broken now you can check 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:51.269
 because he is not a coward and rap a little bit too 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:03:00.630
 you can drill by moving them to the angle 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:03:06.840
 you, too, not zapadlo on buy fix for 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:09.720
 Accuracy slightly significant all 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.549
 fixed we all had that is 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.170
 can all keys participate is a number 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.600
 the bank does not look carefully now 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.489
 uchinyat participants need to see me 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.560
 if you can show there and here we are 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:27.510
 need and here I am on the spring so here 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:31.160
 a little bit because here as if to the right 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.160
 pushers but to tidy you 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.000
 operations 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.930
 Now we have a little bit it's because we 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.220
 already got yourself just gotta go 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.250
 hurry and turn on comfort of 6 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:56.320
 all we need now is what we do 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.320
 must make sure that you are not watching us 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.840
 hurt everything works if it means you 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.910
 it turns out who such a defect 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.740
 connected and look of course if you 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.840
 a lot of hammers here such a yarn will not say 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.450
 necessary and necessarily attacked the table 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.459
 put and align all that possessions in 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.560
 in our case it was not enough for us 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.680
 pulling out the keyboard mechanism 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.580
