00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.910 
tools I've changed the arrangement of is
an<00:01:43.530> NC<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:50.080> now<00:01:50.229> i'm<00:01:50.320> just<00:01:50.350> going<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.619> show<00:01:50.710> you

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
an NC so now i'm just going to show you

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.679 
an NC so now i'm just going to show you
the<00:01:51.070> order<00:01:51.429> for<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.640> verse<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.299> pre<00:01:52.479> course

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
the order for the verse and pre course

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.749 
the order for the verse and pre course
are<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:52.929> same<00:01:53.229> thing<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.619> Midlakes<00:01:54.399> even<00:01:54.700> the

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
are the same thing and Midlakes even the

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.399 
are the same thing and Midlakes even the
same<00:01:54.939> as<00:01:55.090> well<00:01:55.270> because<00:01:55.509> it's<00:01:55.659> just<00:01:55.720> repeated

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
same as well because it's just repeated

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.740 
same as well because it's just repeated
so<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.280> verse<00:01:57.490> is<00:01:58.409> c<00:01:59.409> g<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.459> minor<00:02:01.030> F<00:02:01.360> as<00:02:01.539> you<00:02:01.630> can

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
so the verse is c g a minor F as you can
