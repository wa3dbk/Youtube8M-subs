 in fact, a rare event takes place here

 the traditional and secular knowledge of manual metal processing yes 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.690
 they blend harmoniously with the use of new technologies 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.560
 our characteristic is an all-Italian processing since in

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.980
 automatic processing is constantly followed by personnel

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:18.649
 directly as the immediate elimination of the pieces if necessary 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:21.189
