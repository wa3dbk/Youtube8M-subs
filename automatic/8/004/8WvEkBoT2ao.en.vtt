Knight and dick by tau in our gym even

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.550 
Knight and dick by tau in our gym even
if<00:05:05.880> we<00:05:05.970> would<00:05:06.090> make<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.450> NCAA<00:05:06.870> tournament<00:05:07.200> go

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
if we would make the NCAA tournament go

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.410 
if we would make the NCAA tournament go
far<00:05:07.890> I<00:05:08.190> don't<00:05:08.520> know<00:05:08.670> that<00:05:08.790> we<00:05:08.910> could<00:05:09.120> capture

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
far I don't know that we could capture

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.180 
far I don't know that we could capture
the<00:05:09.750> audience<00:05:10.170> that<00:05:10.410> we<00:05:10.470> could<00:05:10.620> have<00:05:10.770> tonight

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
the audience that we could have tonight

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.950 
the audience that we could have tonight
so<00:05:11.850> I<00:05:11.880> think<00:05:11.970> tonight's<00:05:12.300> game<00:05:12.510> is<00:05:12.690> really

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
so I think tonight's game is really

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:49.340 
so I think tonight's game is really
important

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.820 

if<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:49.980> win<00:05:50.130> this<00:05:50.250> game<00:05:51.020> bent<00:05:52.020> then<00:05:52.230> I<00:05:52.470> think

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
if you win this game bent then I think

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.690 
if you win this game bent then I think
it's<00:05:52.980> a<00:05:53.010> no-brainer

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
it's a no-brainer

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.310 
it's a no-brainer
I<00:05:53.730> think<00:05:53.910> it's<00:05:54.030> a<00:05:54.060> no-brainer<00:05:54.150> anyway<00:05:54.690> so<00:05:55.290> I

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
I think it's a no-brainer anyway so I

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.480 
I think it's a no-brainer anyway so I
think<00:05:55.560> I<00:05:55.680> think<00:05:55.830> Virginia<00:05:55.980> Tech<00:05:56.280> is<00:05:56.370> gonna

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
think I think Virginia Tech is gonna

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.090 
think I think Virginia Tech is gonna
make<00:05:56.640> it<00:05:56.790> regardless
