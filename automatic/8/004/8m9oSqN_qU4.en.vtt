00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.280 

so<00:00:11.519> we're<00:00:11.910> talking<00:00:12.059> installing<00:00:12.960> depth

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
so we're talking installing depth

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.829 
so we're talking installing depth
finders<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.070> basically<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.179> comes<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.540> four

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
finders and basically it comes to four

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.529 
finders and basically it comes to four
steps<00:00:16.230> first<00:00:16.949> steps<00:00:17.310> mounting<00:00:17.940> your<00:00:18.060> hardware

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
steps first steps mounting your hardware

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.109 
steps first steps mounting your hardware
that's<00:00:18.840> mounting<00:00:19.500> your<00:00:19.619> GPS<00:00:20.070> pucks<00:00:20.460> mounting

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
that's mounting your GPS pucks mounting

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.390 
that's mounting your GPS pucks mounting
your<00:00:21.210> transducers<00:00:21.990> your<00:00:22.650> side-scan

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
your transducers your side-scan

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.519 
your transducers your side-scan
transducers<00:00:26.400> things<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.210> nature<00:00:27.529> this

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
transducers things of that nature this

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.109 
transducers things of that nature this
is<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.949> those<00:00:29.070> deals<00:00:29.340> where<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.789> want<00:00:29.970> to

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
is one of those deals where you want to

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.229 
is one of those deals where you want to
measure<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.080> plan<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.189> get<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> good<00:00:33.210> idea

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
measure and plan and get a good idea

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.700 
measure and plan and get a good idea
where<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.750> want<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.020> anything<00:00:34.350> before<00:00:34.559> you

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
where you want to do anything before you

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.900 
where you want to do anything before you
start<00:00:34.980> drilling<00:00:35.700> holes<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:38.010> then<00:00:38.280> basically

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
start drilling holes and then basically

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.209 
start drilling holes and then basically
once<00:00:39.450> you've<00:00:39.629> got<00:00:40.020> them<00:00:40.260> installed<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.160> you

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
once you've got them installed and you

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.770 
once you've got them installed and you
want<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.520> think<00:00:42.000> about<00:00:42.120> how<00:00:42.420> you're<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
want to think about how you're going to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.229 
want to think about how you're going to
run<00:00:42.989> your<00:00:43.020> cables<00:00:43.680> kind<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.460> plan<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.059> out

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
run your cables kind of plan that out

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.069 
run your cables kind of plan that out
ahead<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.539> time<00:00:46.730> because<00:00:47.870> pulling<00:00:48.870> cables

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
ahead of time because pulling cables

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.720 
ahead of time because pulling cables
that's<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> next<00:00:49.890> step<00:00:50.070> we'll<00:00:50.219> talk<00:00:50.370> about<00:00:50.460> in

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
that's the next step we'll talk about in

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.549 
that's the next step we'll talk about in
just<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.969> second<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.629> mean<00:00:51.989> that's<00:00:52.110> that's

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
just a second but I mean that's that's

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.380 
just a second but I mean that's that's
the<00:00:52.710> hard<00:00:52.949> part<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.280> doing<00:00:53.430> these<00:00:53.640> installs<00:00:54.149> so

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the hard part of doing these installs so

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.510 
the hard part of doing these installs so
you<00:00:54.480> kind<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.780> want<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> think<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.160> out<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
you kind of want to think that out and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.340 
you kind of want to think that out and
plan<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.090> before<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.449> actually<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:58.079> into

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
plan it out before you actually get into

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.410 
plan it out before you actually get into
pulling<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> cables<00:00:59.699> through<00:00:59.940> the<00:00:59.969> conduit

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
pulling the cables through the conduit

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.870 
pulling the cables through the conduit
inside<00:01:00.899> your<00:01:01.079> boat<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.430> you've<00:01:05.640> got

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
inside your boat so you know you've got

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.370 
inside your boat so you know you've got
to<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.090> about<00:01:06.180> mounting<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> LS<00:01:06.960> s1

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
to think about mounting the LS s1

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.260 
to think about mounting the LS s1
modules<00:01:07.950> if<00:01:08.159> you're<00:01:08.369> installing<00:01:08.790> all<00:01:09.030> around

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
modules if you're installing all around

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.750 
modules if you're installing all around
side-scan<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.100> once<00:01:11.340> you've<00:01:11.490> got<00:01:11.640> it

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
side-scan so you know once you've got it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.890 
side-scan so you know once you've got it
planned<00:01:11.909> out<00:01:12.119> where<00:01:12.299> everything<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
planned out where everything is going to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.390 
planned out where everything is going to
go<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.710> matter<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.979> getting<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
go then it's a matter of getting the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.429 
go then it's a matter of getting the
cables<00:01:14.820> from<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> different<00:01:15.840> components<00:01:16.350> you

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
cables from the different components you

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.149 
cables from the different components you
know<00:01:16.560> you're<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:17.009> your

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
know you're going to have your

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.770 
know you're going to have your
transducers<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> back<00:01:18.240> you're<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
transducers in the back you're going to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.240 
transducers in the back you're going to
have<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:19.020> shoot<00:01:19.259> through<00:01:19.470> transducer<00:01:20.070> down

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
have your shoot through transducer down

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.240 
have your shoot through transducer down
in<00:01:20.400> your<00:01:20.520> hole<00:01:20.990> you're<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> GPS

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
in your hole you're going to have a GPS

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.640 
in your hole you're going to have a GPS
puck<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.119> things<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.080> nature<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
puck and things of that nature that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.050 
puck and things of that nature that
you're<00:01:25.799> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.250> deal<00:01:26.400> with<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
you're going to have to deal with and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.789 
you're going to have to deal with and
you've<00:01:27.450> got<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.720> pull<00:01:27.900> those<00:01:28.080> cables<00:01:28.500> as<00:01:28.650> well

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
you've got to pull those cables as well

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.060 
you've got to pull those cables as well
as<00:01:28.920> Ethernet<00:01:29.369> cables<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.590> pulling<00:01:31.590> cables<00:01:31.740> is

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
as Ethernet cables so pulling cables is

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.069 
as Ethernet cables so pulling cables is
usually<00:01:32.369> better<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:33.060> two<00:01:33.360> guys<00:01:33.630> one

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
usually better if you get two guys one

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.719 
usually better if you get two guys one
that<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.380> feed<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> cable<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.220> then<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.549> that

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that can feed a cable and then one that

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.670 
that can feed a cable and then one that
can<00:01:35.880> pull<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.659> trick<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> lot<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.560> guys

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
can pull it and a trick a lot of guys

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.789 
can pull it and a trick a lot of guys
use<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.759> pull<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.240> cables<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:40.380> your<00:01:40.590> old

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
use is to pull the cables with your old

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.679 
use is to pull the cables with your old
existing<00:01:41.220> cables<00:01:41.759> from<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.030> old<00:01:42.150> units<00:01:42.540> in

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
existing cables from the old units in

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.170 
existing cables from the old units in
your<00:01:42.810> boat<00:01:43.070> you<00:01:44.070> may<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:44.759> things<00:01:45.030> like

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
your boat you may have to do things like

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.319 
your boat you may have to do things like
drill<00:01:45.780> holes<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.520> pass<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.970> cables

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
drill holes so you can pass the cables

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.240 
drill holes so you can pass the cables
through<00:01:48.540> some<00:01:48.840> different<00:01:49.380> areas<00:01:49.530> once<00:01:50.130> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
through some different areas once you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.440 
through some different areas once you
determine<00:01:50.579> where<00:01:50.909> you're<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.210> mount

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
determine where you're going to mount

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.370 
determine where you're going to mount
your<00:01:51.720> units<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:54.000> know<00:01:54.119> obviously<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.079> unit

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
your units you know obviously the unit

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.450 
your units you know obviously the unit
on<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> back<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.130> mount<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
on the back is going to mount on the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.889 
on the back is going to mount on the
console<00:01:56.880> somewhere<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.450> then<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> other<00:01:57.780> one

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
console somewhere and then the other one

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.569 
console somewhere and then the other one
the<00:01:58.259> front<00:01:58.590> one<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:59.009> either<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.340> flush

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the front one can either be flush

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.760 
the front one can either be flush
mounted<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> dash<00:02:00.390> or<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:01.350> did<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.590> my

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
mounted in the dash or what we did on my

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.139 
mounted in the dash or what we did on my
boat<00:02:01.979> we<00:02:02.280> actually<00:02:02.670> used<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.149> ram<00:02:03.390> mount<00:02:04.130> and

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
boat we actually used a ram mount and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.819 
boat we actually used a ram mount and
mounted<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.329> right<00:02:06.930> next<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.439> recessed

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
mounted it right next to the recessed

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.210 
mounted it right next to the recessed
trolling<00:02:08.190> motor<00:02:08.340> pedal<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.450> we<00:02:09.569> ate

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
trolling motor pedal and and so we ate

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.490 
trolling motor pedal and and so we ate
we<00:02:10.340> drilled<00:02:10.910> some<00:02:11.210> additional<00:02:11.810> holes<00:02:12.050> in<00:02:12.380> that

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
we drilled some additional holes in that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.580 
we drilled some additional holes in that
recess<00:02:12.890> pedal<00:02:13.250> tray<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.170> pulled<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.260> cables

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
recess pedal tray and pulled the cables

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.630 
recess pedal tray and pulled the cables
underneath<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.130> make<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.430> nice<00:02:16.580> clean

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
underneath to make it a nice clean

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.480 
underneath to make it a nice clean
install<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:17.950> again<00:02:18.950> we<00:02:19.070> had<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.280> feed

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
install but again we had to feed

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.400 
install but again we had to feed
Ethernet<00:02:20.180> cables<00:02:20.630> from<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.320> LS<00:02:22.310> s1<00:02:22.820> up<00:02:23.210> to<00:02:23.630> the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
Ethernet cables from the LS s1 up to the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.900 
Ethernet cables from the LS s1 up to the
front<00:02:24.830> unit<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:25.250> we<00:02:25.340> could<00:02:25.460> have<00:02:25.550> structure

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
front unit so we could have structure

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.810 
front unit so we could have structure
scan<00:02:26.120> in<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.360> front<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:28.190> third<00:02:28.400> step<00:02:28.700> of

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
scan in the front the third step of

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.390 
scan in the front the third step of
doing<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.210> install<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:30.050> mounting<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:30.950> actual

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
doing it install is mounting the actual

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.760 
doing it install is mounting the actual
units<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.240> for<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:33.050> install<00:02:33.380> we<00:02:33.530> just

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
units and for the install we just

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.640 
units and for the install we just
recently<00:02:33.950> did<00:02:34.160> on<00:02:34.370> my<00:02:34.490> boat

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
recently did on my boat

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:44.020 
recently did on my boat
we<00:02:37.270> we<00:02:40.390> we<00:02:41.390> mounted<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.260> units<00:02:42.709> on<00:02:43.030> ramp

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
we we we mounted the units on ramp

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.460 
we we we mounted the units on ramp
mounts<00:02:44.390> we<00:02:44.510> use<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.780> largest<00:02:45.050> Ram<00:02:45.290> mounts

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
mounts we use the largest Ram mounts

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.160 
mounts we use the largest Ram mounts
that<00:02:45.740> they<00:02:45.860> make<00:02:46.600> we've<00:02:47.600> mounted<00:02:47.720> one<00:02:47.990> of<00:02:48.080> the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
that they make we've mounted one of the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.260 
that they make we've mounted one of the
console<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.800> also<00:02:49.160> one<00:02:49.370> at<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.580> front<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.120> I

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
console and also one at the front and I

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.790 
console and also one at the front and I
like<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.660> because<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.050> RAM<00:02:51.260> mount<00:02:51.470> gives

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
like that because the RAM mount gives

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.070 
like that because the RAM mount gives
you<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.340> lot<00:02:52.580> of<00:02:52.700> flexibility<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.600> can<00:02:53.660> raise

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
you a lot of flexibility you can raise

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.500 
you a lot of flexibility you can raise
it<00:02:54.290> up<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.740> can<00:02:54.920> get<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.670> angle<00:02:55.820> exactly

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
it up you can get the angle exactly

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.710 
it up you can get the angle exactly
right<00:02:57.130> it's<00:02:58.130> easy<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.550> remove<00:02:58.880> your<00:02:59.180> units<00:02:59.600> and

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
right it's easy to remove your units and

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.440 
right it's easy to remove your units and
take<00:02:59.930> them<00:03:00.050> out<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.320> boat<00:03:00.470> with<00:03:00.740> you<00:03:01.450> the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
take them out of the boat with you the

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.270 
take them out of the boat with you the
last<00:03:02.660> step<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:03.170> course<00:03:03.470> is<00:03:03.680> making<00:03:04.160> the

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
last step of course is making the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.699 
last step of course is making the
connections<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.180> know<00:03:05.750> power<00:03:05.990> is<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.260> big<00:03:06.470> deal

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
connections you know power is a big deal

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.500 
connections you know power is a big deal
with<00:03:07.010> electronics<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.060> want<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.270> make<00:03:08.360> sure

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
with electronics you want to make sure

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.180 
with electronics you want to make sure
you've<00:03:08.660> got<00:03:08.690> fuses<00:03:09.320> in<00:03:09.470> line<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:10.010> want<00:03:10.130> to

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
you've got fuses in line you want to

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.560 
you've got fuses in line you want to
make<00:03:10.280> sure<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.490> have<00:03:10.610> really<00:03:11.060> strong

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
make sure you have really strong

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.140 
make sure you have really strong
connections<00:03:12.320> don't<00:03:12.650> skimp<00:03:13.070> on<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.340> the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
connections don't skimp on the the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.970 
connections don't skimp on the the
connectors<00:03:14.750> or<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.200> tools<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:15.800> use<00:03:15.860> to

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
make the connection so that you always

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.880 
make the connection so that you always
have<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.840> good<00:03:18.050> connection<00:03:18.350> that's<00:03:18.709> where<00:03:18.860> a

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
you take those precautions follow these

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.479 
you take those precautions follow these
steps<00:03:24.080> you're<00:03:24.470> going<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.650> end<00:03:24.950> up<00:03:25.100> with<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.250> nice

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
steps you're going to end up with a nice
