 Hi, friends, how are you? 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.360
 find good I am milk dorita de 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.849
 lima peru and in this opportunity we are going to 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.969
 do a technique that is the technique of 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.930
 decoupage this technique is very simple 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.510
 you work with what is the ticket this 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.030
 Napkin is decorated I have chosen a 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.360
 Christmas motive because after I go to 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.580
 make a video of a bottle and we're going to 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.800
 employ this design 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.590
 to make this technique napkins 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.980
 come with some layers in this 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.260
 opportunity and this has two layers let's 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.890
 to take off the first layer with a lot 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.890
 watch out 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.329
 second layer depending on the napkins 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.110
 are the layers we are going to remove them with a lot 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.600
 watch out 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.600
 so that we will not be harmed or 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.940
 to break 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.550
 and our napkin will be like that 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.789
 and this is going to be that it adheres well to 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.850
 background in this case we're going to use a home 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.710
 and white to make contrast with 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.990
 our napkin 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.710
 we put here 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.229
 let's use with the synthetic mixed 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.450
 with a little water and with our 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.210
 brush of hard bristles and that is of 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.689
 big preference the brush so that 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.509
 encompass more spaces let's start 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.100
 throw our glue 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.790
 trying that we do not have any 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.450
 point without glue since our 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.979
 napkin 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.979
 I would not wait and not what 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.610
 we extend 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.130
 take care not to throw too much glue anymore 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.750
 that when making contact with the paper 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.580
 it could hurt 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.680
 you know that these videos 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.750
 they are caused why 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.750
 what interests me is that you 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.320
 we are still struggling 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.840

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:23.030
