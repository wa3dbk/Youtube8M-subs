alright this video I'll show you guys
how<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.750> thinned<00:00:07.649> down<00:00:07.800> my<00:00:08.010> paint

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
how I thinned down my paint

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.879 
how I thinned down my paint
I'm<00:00:09.300> usually<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.690> thinned<00:00:10.050> down<00:00:10.170> all<00:00:10.440> my<00:00:10.650> paint

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
I'm usually I thinned down all my paint

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.779 
I'm usually I thinned down all my paint
whether<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.309> be<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:12.000> transparent<00:00:12.900> paint<00:00:13.080> or

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:13.789 
whether it be a transparent paint or

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.580 
whether it be a transparent paint or
pearls<00:00:14.789> or<00:00:14.999> opaque<00:00:15.450> paints<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.049> don't<00:00:16.350> use<00:00:16.500> very

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
pearls or opaque paints I don't use very

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.350 
pearls or opaque paints I don't use very
many<00:00:16.890> old<00:00:17.039> pig<00:00:17.220> paints<00:00:17.610> just<00:00:17.640> because<00:00:18.210> they

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
many old pig paints just because they

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.620 
many old pig paints just because they
are<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> lot<00:00:18.780> thicker<00:00:19.020> but<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:20.300> usually<00:00:21.300> thin

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
are a lot thicker but I usually thin

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.690 
are a lot thicker but I usually thin
down<00:00:21.750> with<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:22.140> water<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:23.220> use<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
down with just water and I use the

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.540 
down with just water and I use the
pledge<00:00:24.030> floor<00:00:24.360> care<00:00:24.660> shine<00:00:25.650> polish<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.340> guess

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
pledge floor care shine polish I guess

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.830 
pledge floor care shine polish I guess
and<00:00:26.840> this<00:00:27.840> helps<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.970> flow<00:00:30.210> through<00:00:30.540> the<00:00:30.660> gun

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and this helps the flow through the gun

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.100 
and this helps the flow through the gun
through<00:00:31.290> airbrush<00:00:31.770> and<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.369> dries<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:33.120> lot<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
through airbrush and it dries a lot the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.590 
through airbrush and it dries a lot the
paint<00:00:34.440> dries<00:00:34.649> harder<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.519> it's<00:00:36.269> just<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
paint dries harder to so it's just a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.180 
paint dries harder to so it's just a
little<00:00:36.749> something<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.199> I<00:00:37.350> add<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.679> don't<00:00:37.890> add

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
little something that I add I don't add

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.689 
little something that I add I don't add
a<00:00:38.219> lot<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:39.289> enough<00:00:40.289> to<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.100> smells

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
a lot of it but enough to and it smells

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.020 
a lot of it but enough to and it smells
good<00:00:41.940> too<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:43.280> basically<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.519> do<00:00:44.640> if<00:00:44.909> I

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
good too so basically what I do if I

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.520 
good too so basically what I do if I
start<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.420> um<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.249> get<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.429> new<00:00:47.640> color<00:00:48.199> if<00:00:49.199> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
start out um and I get a new color if I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.829 
start out um and I get a new color if I
if<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.039> don't<00:00:50.280> sometimes<00:00:50.819> out<00:00:50.999> if<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.449> don't<00:00:51.510> have

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
if I don't sometimes out if I don't have

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.049 
if I don't sometimes out if I don't have
an<00:00:52.109> existing<00:00:52.409> color<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.190> I'll<00:00:53.370> usually

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
an existing color of it I'll usually

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.939 
an existing color of it I'll usually
just<00:00:54.449> sacrifice<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.199> dump<00:00:55.379> some<00:00:55.589> out<00:00:55.739> because

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
just sacrifice and dump some out because

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.479 
just sacrifice and dump some out because
I'd<00:00:56.100> rather<00:00:56.280> shoot<00:00:56.760> good<00:00:57.949> consistent<00:00:58.949> thinner

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
I'd rather shoot good consistent thinner

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.689 
I'd rather shoot good consistent thinner
paint<00:00:59.789> than<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.089> would<00:01:00.300> try<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:01.429> try<00:01:02.429> to<00:01:02.489> use<00:01:02.670> up

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
paint than I would try to try to use up

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.640 
paint than I would try to try to use up
the<00:01:03.059> thicker<00:01:03.329> stuff<00:01:03.659> so<00:01:03.960> usually<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.530> do

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the thicker stuff so usually what I do

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.550 
the thicker stuff so usually what I do
is<00:01:05.030> after<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.240> get<00:01:06.330> some<00:01:06.690> hold<00:01:06.900> enough<00:01:07.229> space

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
is after I get some hold enough space

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.830 
is after I get some hold enough space
and<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.549> trial<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.240> error<00:01:09.360> type<00:01:09.570> deal

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and this is a trial and error type deal

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
and this is a trial and error type deal
but<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.969> usually<00:01:11.969> add<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.810> I'm<00:01:13.140> my<00:01:13.409> paint<00:01:13.680> is

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
but it's usually add if I'm my paint is

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.920 
but it's usually add if I'm my paint is
about<00:01:14.130> right<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.790> right<00:01:15.149> now<00:01:15.329> I'll<00:01:15.509> put<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
about right here right now I'll put it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.149 
about right here right now I'll put it
up<00:01:16.079> to<00:01:16.229> about<00:01:16.320> right<00:01:16.469> there

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
up to about right there

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.219 
up to about right there
so<00:01:17.640> I'll<00:01:17.729> bow<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.060> don't<00:01:18.270> know<00:01:18.329> 10%<00:01:18.600> water

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
so I'll bow it I don't know 10% water

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.340 
so I'll bow it I don't know 10% water
and<00:01:19.649> then<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:22.380> then<00:01:23.719> I'll<00:01:24.719> add<00:01:24.930> about<00:01:25.170> maybe

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
and then and then I'll add about maybe

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.380 
and then and then I'll add about maybe
five<00:01:25.680> percent<00:01:25.829> of<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> floor<00:01:26.610> care<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.149> floor

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
five percent of the floor care the floor

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.539 
five percent of the floor care the floor
shine<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:30.020> then<00:01:32.299> usually<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:34.250> take<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.399> up

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
shine and then usually just take it up

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.560 
shine and then usually just take it up
and<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.789> a<00:01:39.060> little<00:01:39.090> thicker

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and I like to have just a little thicker

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.690 
and I like to have just a little thicker
than<00:01:39.689> milk<00:01:40.049> consistency<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.579> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
than milk consistency is what I like to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.880 
than milk consistency is what I like to
use<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.969> shoot<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.719> and<00:01:42.990> with<00:01:43.680> all<00:01:43.859> my

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
use to shoot with so and with all my

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.889 
use to shoot with so and with all my
pins<00:01:44.189> before<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> shoot<00:01:44.909> before<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.509> put<00:01:45.719> them<00:01:45.780> in

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
pins before I shoot before I put them in

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.830 
pins before I shoot before I put them in
my<00:01:45.929> airbrush<00:01:46.289> I<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:47.329> shake<00:01:48.329> them<00:01:48.509> up<00:01:48.600> real<00:01:48.810> good

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
my airbrush I do shake them up real good

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.999 
my airbrush I do shake them up real good
that<00:01:49.229> way<00:01:49.409> because<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:50.670> separate<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
that way because it will separate the

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.010 
that way because it will separate the
water<00:01:53.009> extra<00:01:53.579> water<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.270> floor<00:01:54.780> care

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
water extra water in the floor care

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.469 
water extra water in the floor care
shine<00:01:55.289> so<00:01:56.130> usually<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.969> know<00:01:57.060> obviously

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
shine so usually you know obviously

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.459 
shine so usually you know obviously
you're<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.810> want<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.020> shake<00:01:58.200> them<00:01:58.350> up

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
you're going to want to shake them up

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.599 
you're going to want to shake them up
good<00:01:58.710> but<00:02:00.170> that's<00:02:01.170> that's<00:02:01.590> about<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.249> it's

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
good but that's that's about it and it's

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:07.700 
good but that's that's about it and it's
uh<00:02:04.939> it's<00:02:05.939> not<00:02:06.179> a<00:02:06.210> perfect<00:02:06.869> science<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.350> 10%

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
uh it's not a perfect science of 10%

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.340 
uh it's not a perfect science of 10%
exactly<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.759> water<00:02:09.000> at<00:02:09.420> least<00:02:09.479> not<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.320> I

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
exactly of water at least not that I

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.160 
exactly of water at least not that I
have<00:02:10.619> found<00:02:11.009> even<00:02:11.819> between<00:02:12.480> transparent

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
have found even between transparent

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.509 
have found even between transparent
colors<00:02:13.440> you'd<00:02:13.680> think<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.040> they'd<00:02:14.220> all<00:02:14.340> be

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
colors you'd think that they'd all be

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.810 
colors you'd think that they'd all be
the<00:02:14.610> same<00:02:14.640> consistency<00:02:15.480> but<00:02:15.810> they're<00:02:15.989> not<00:02:16.140> so

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
the same consistency but they're not so

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.790 
the same consistency but they're not so
you<00:02:17.820> know<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.060> might<00:02:18.210> be<00:02:18.240> just<00:02:18.600> 5%<00:02:18.810> water<00:02:19.380> or

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
you know it might be just 5% water or

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.390 
you know it might be just 5% water or
you<00:02:20.220> or<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:21.090> know<00:02:21.210> maybe<00:02:21.570> 15%<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:22.860> kind

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
you or you know maybe 15% so it's kind

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.520 
you or you know maybe 15% so it's kind
of<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.550> trial<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:23.970> error<00:02:24.120> thing<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:25.350> is

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
of a trial and error thing and it is

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.560 
of a trial and error thing and it is
good<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.860> thin<00:02:26.370> them<00:02:26.520> out<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.850> way<00:02:27.030> takes

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
good to thin them out that way takes

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.950 
good to thin them out that way takes
less<00:02:27.780> pressure<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.200> shoot<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:29.600> you<00:02:30.600> can<00:02:30.780> get<00:02:30.930> a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
less pressure to shoot and you can get a

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.140 
less pressure to shoot and you can get a
lot<00:02:31.350> nicer<00:02:31.590> spray<00:02:32.100> pattern<00:02:32.490> with<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.910> so

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
lot nicer spray pattern with it so

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.300 
lot nicer spray pattern with it so
that's<00:02:33.780> basically<00:02:34.200> all<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.440> do<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.950> just<00:02:35.130> add<00:02:35.280> a

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
that's basically all I do is just add a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.810 
that's basically all I do is just add a
little<00:02:35.490> water<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:37.280> play<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.340> play<00:02:38.790> it

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
little water and and play it play it

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.840 
little water and and play it play it
from<00:02:39.060> there<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.770> try<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.340> out<00:02:41.490> on<00:02:41.520> your<00:02:41.670> own

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
from there and so try it out on your own

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.700 
from there and so try it out on your own
and<00:02:42.150> see<00:02:42.360> where<00:02:42.600> see<00:02:42.990> where<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.260> gets<00:02:43.500> ya

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
and see where see where that gets ya

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.820 
and see where see where that gets ya
thank<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.220> for<00:02:44.430> watching
