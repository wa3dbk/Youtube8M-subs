you don't want to slip and fall and that

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.120 
you don't want to slip and fall and that
be<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.170> reason<00:01:33.200> why<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.620> missed<00:01:33.950> that

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
be the reason why you missed that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.250 
be the reason why you missed that
thrower<00:01:34.430> reason<00:01:35.150> why<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.330> ball<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:35.900> taken<00:01:36.080> to

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
thrower reason why the ball is taken to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.840 
thrower reason why the ball is taken to
the<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:36.680> other<00:01:36.860> end<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.190> end<00:01:37.370> zone<00:01:37.550> so

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
the to the other end of the end zone so

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.460 
the to the other end of the end zone so
I<00:01:38.060> think<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.630> most<00:01:38.720> important<00:01:39.200> thing<00:01:39.229> is<00:01:39.440> to

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
I think the most important thing is to

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.710 
I think the most important thing is to
feel<00:01:39.979> that<00:01:40.430> comfort<00:01:40.910> but<00:01:41.030> also<00:01:41.210> feel<00:01:41.510> like<00:01:41.630> you

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
feel that comfort but also feel like you

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.780 
feel that comfort but also feel like you
have<00:01:41.870> that<00:01:42.020> grip<00:01:42.290> to<00:01:42.500> step<00:01:42.770> in<00:01:42.979> to<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.220> throw<00:01:43.550> and

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
have that grip to step in to a throw and

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.620 
have that grip to step in to a throw and
and<00:01:43.940> deliver<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.660> ball<00:01:44.810> when<00:01:45.050> you<00:01:45.110> need<00:01:45.260> to

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.300 

the<00:01:50.630> importance<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.200> ankle<00:01:51.560> stability<00:01:51.710> for<00:01:52.160> me

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
the importance to ankle stability for me

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.250 
the importance to ankle stability for me
is<00:01:52.430> really<00:01:52.730> really<00:01:52.820> important<00:01:53.390> obviously<00:01:53.960> I

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
is really really important obviously I
