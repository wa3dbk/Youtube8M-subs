think<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.480> good<00:02:46.690> now<00:02:47.080> will<00:02:47.860> get<00:02:48.100> better<00:02:48.580> in<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
think is good now will get better in the

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.820 
think is good now will get better in the
future<00:02:49.270> you<00:02:49.750> know<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.170> mean<00:02:50.530> that's<00:02:50.620> the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
future you know I mean that's the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.360 
future you know I mean that's the
expectation<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.880> work<00:02:52.660> at<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:52.990> every<00:02:53.170> day<00:02:53.380> I'm

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
expectation I work at it every day I'm

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.460 
expectation I work at it every day I'm
in<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.700> studio<00:02:54.760> every<00:02:55.300> day<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.959> as<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.290> can

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
in the studio every day and as you can

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.160 
in the studio every day and as you can
imagine<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:58.000> more<00:02:58.240> you<00:02:58.270> work<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.630> better<00:02:58.990> you

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170

imagine the more you work the better you
should<00:02:59.200> get<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:01.510> piece<00:03:01.930> was<00:03:02.560> started<00:03:03.660> maybe

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
should get this piece was started maybe

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.640 
should get this piece was started maybe
six<00:03:05.380> months<00:03:05.470> ago<00:03:05.980> then<00:03:06.670> put<00:03:06.970> aside<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.440> have

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
six months ago then put aside and I have

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.680 
six months ago then put aside and I have
returned<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.519> which<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:09.880> often<00:03:10.300> what

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
returned to it which is often what

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.500 
returned to it which is often what
happens<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:12.190> it's<00:03:12.370> hard<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.640> say<00:03:12.940> in<00:03:13.120> terms<00:03:13.300> of

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
happens so it's hard to say in terms of

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.020 
happens so it's hard to say in terms of
hours<00:03:13.989> you<00:03:14.709> know<00:03:14.830> literally<00:03:15.340> how<00:03:15.580> much<00:03:15.790> time

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
hours you know literally how much time

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.199 
hours you know literally how much time
it's<00:03:16.300> sort<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.570> working<00:03:17.350> on<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:17.950> then<00:03:18.850> putting

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
it's sort of working on it then putting

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.910 
it's sort of working on it then putting
it<00:03:19.360> aside<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.840> looking<00:03:20.290> at<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.470> for<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:20.860> long

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
it aside and looking at it for a long

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.860 
it aside and looking at it for a long
time<00:03:21.130> till<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.820> decide<00:03:22.209> what<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.540> next<00:03:22.570> move

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
instead of a horizontal but you usually

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.150

almost claustrophobic space but I

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.500 
almost claustrophobic space but I
thought<00:06:53.780> the<00:06:53.930> idea<00:06:54.080> of<00:06:54.590> seeing<00:06:55.300> seeing<00:06:56.300> the

always<00:07:23.510> fairly<00:07:24.020> clear<00:07:24.530> from<00:07:24.770> an<00:07:24.890> early<00:07:25.130> age

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:25.220

upon electronic devices and i think

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.920 
upon electronic devices and i think
that's<00:07:48.590> true<00:07:48.890> in<00:07:49.070> the<00:07:49.190> art<00:07:49.340> world<00:07:49.580> as<00:07:49.880> as<00:07:50.180> well

that's true in the art world as as well

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.990 
that's true in the art world as as well
