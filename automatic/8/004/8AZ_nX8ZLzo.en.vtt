kid here on the bottom is my brother he

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.959 
kid here on the bottom is my brother he
was<00:00:43.710> listening<00:00:44.040> he<00:00:44.370> didn't<00:00:44.520> even<00:00:44.610> watch<00:00:44.789> my

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
was listening he didn't even watch my

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.430 
was listening he didn't even watch my
video<00:00:45.239> he<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.660> listened<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:45.989> me<00:00:46.140> through<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
video he just listened to me through the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.369 
video he just listened to me through the
door<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.340> he<00:00:47.370> copied<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> team<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
door and then he copied the team and

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.630 
door and then he copied the team and
you'll<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.739> his<00:00:49.920> Gengar<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.370> actually

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
you'll see that his Gengar is actually

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.310 
you'll see that his Gengar is actually
different<00:00:50.789> than<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:51.059> Gengar<00:00:51.449> he<00:00:52.079> put<00:00:52.230> on

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
different than my Gengar he put on

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.590 
different than my Gengar he put on
shadow<00:00:52.590> ball<00:00:52.800> instead<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.010> sludge<00:00:53.250> bomb<00:00:53.600> which

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
shadow ball instead of sludge bomb which

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.029 
shadow ball instead of sludge bomb which
is<00:00:54.719> actually<00:00:54.989> probably<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.289> know<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.739> smart

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
is actually probably you know it's smart

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.819 
is actually probably you know it's smart
move<00:00:56.600> so<00:00:57.600> some<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.170> his<00:00:58.260> stuff<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.620> different

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
move so some of his stuff is different

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.810 
move so some of his stuff is different
so<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.100> didn't<00:00:59.280> really<00:00:59.430> know<00:00:59.550> what<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> expect

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
so I didn't really know what to expect

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.840 
so I didn't really know what to expect
besides<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.899> fact<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.680> knew<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
besides the fact that I knew this the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.810 
besides the fact that I knew this the
Gengar<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.600> liepard<00:01:03.930> combo<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:05.519> knew<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
Gengar and liepard combo and I knew the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.300 
Gengar and liepard combo and I knew the
the<00:01:06.090> politoed<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.080> amoonguss<00:01:07.770> combo<00:01:08.280> I

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the politoed and amoonguss combo I

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.980 
the politoed and amoonguss combo I
assumed<00:01:09.000> he<00:01:09.119> heard<00:01:09.330> me<00:01:09.450> talk<00:01:09.630> about<00:01:09.659> them

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
assumed he heard me talk about them

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.690 
assumed he heard me talk about them
through<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> door<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.950> figured<00:01:11.670> that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
through the door so I figured that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.890 
through the door so I figured that
that's<00:01:11.939> why<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> said<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.390> I'm<00:01:12.540> usually<00:01:12.689> not

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that's why I said this I'm usually not

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.420 
that's why I said this I'm usually not
this<00:01:12.960> rude<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.409> opponents<00:01:13.799> guys<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.310> when

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
this rude to my opponents guys but when

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.910 
this rude to my opponents guys but when
it's<00:01:14.549> my<00:01:14.610> brother<00:01:15.110> anything<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.380> happen<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
it's my brother anything can happen so

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
it's my brother anything can happen so
these<00:01:17.820> are<00:01:18.000> my<00:01:18.090> six<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.450> here

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
these are my six up here

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.160 
these are my six up here
these<00:01:19.080> are<00:01:19.200> his<00:01:19.320> six<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:21.080> clearly<00:01:22.080> I'm

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
these are his six and clearly I'm

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.390 
these are his six and clearly I'm
familiar<00:01:22.320> with<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> team<00:01:22.830> as<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.040> played<00:01:23.250> it

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
familiar with the team as I played it

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.670 
familiar with the team as I played it
but<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.939> wasn't<00:01:24.180> expecting<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.350> actually<00:01:25.619> be

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
but I wasn't expecting it to actually be

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
but I wasn't expecting it to actually be
different<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:26.009> all<00:01:26.100> until<00:01:26.460> he<00:01:26.610> pulls<00:01:27.150> out<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
different at all until he pulls out a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.929 
different at all until he pulls out a
move<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.290> different<00:01:28.560> than<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.829> had

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
move that is different than what I had

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.080 
move that is different than what I had
I'm<00:01:29.939> looking<00:01:30.270> through<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:32.090> very

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
I'm looking through here and I very

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.080 
I'm looking through here and I very
commonly<00:01:33.509> lead<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> meowstic<00:01:34.820> all<00:01:35.820> with<00:01:35.970> this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
commonly lead a meowstic all with this

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.880 
commonly lead a meowstic all with this
team<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> realized<00:01:37.290> immediately<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.740> I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
team but I realized immediately that I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.800 
team but I realized immediately that I
can't<00:01:38.220> afford<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.640> do<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.820> even<00:01:39.450> though<00:01:39.659> I'm

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
can't afford to do that even though I'm

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.710 
can't afford to do that even though I'm
afraid<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.200> getting<00:01:40.439> spord<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.270> have

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
afraid of getting spord I have to I have

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.300 
afraid of getting spord I have to I have
to<00:01:42.780> go<00:01:42.899> full-out<00:01:43.229> attack<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.829> really<00:01:44.100> need<00:01:44.220> to

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
to go full-out attack you really need to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.090 
to go full-out attack you really need to
do<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.610> much<00:01:44.880> damage<00:01:44.909> as<00:01:45.420> possible<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:47.070> I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
do as much damage as possible and so I

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.859 
do as much damage as possible and so I
knew<00:01:47.369> I'm<00:01:47.490> either<00:01:47.670> gonna<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:48.119> politoed<00:01:48.600> here

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
knew I'm either gonna see politoed here

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.990 
knew I'm either gonna see politoed here
or<00:01:49.049> I'm<00:01:49.170> gonna<00:01:49.320> see<00:01:49.530> Gengar<00:01:49.920> Gengar<00:01:50.820> most

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
or I'm gonna see Gengar Gengar most

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.550 
or I'm gonna see Gengar Gengar most
likely<00:01:51.270> paired<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.630> liepard<00:01:52.020> politoed

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
likely paired up with liepard politoed

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.520 
likely paired up with liepard politoed
most<00:01:52.829> likely<00:01:53.070> paired<00:01:53.280> up<00:01:53.430> with<00:01:53.520> amoonguss

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
most likely paired up with amoonguss

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.889 
most likely paired up with amoonguss
so<00:01:55.530> what<00:01:55.740> I'm<00:01:55.860> gonna<00:01:55.950> do<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.460> actually<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.600> end<00:01:57.810> up

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
so what I'm gonna do I actually I end up

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.499 
so what I'm gonna do I actually I end up
leading<00:01:58.049> with<00:01:58.290> my<00:01:58.439> own<00:01:58.560> Kangaskhan<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.509> Rotom

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
leading with my own Kangaskhan and Rotom

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.539 
leading with my own Kangaskhan and Rotom
heat<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> reason<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:02.070> this

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
heat and this is the reason for this

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.280 
heat and this is the reason for this
reason<00:02:02.880> because<00:02:03.180> Kangaskhan<00:02:03.689> has<00:02:03.810> got<00:02:03.990> fake

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
reason because Kangaskhan has got fake

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.929 
reason because Kangaskhan has got fake
out<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.770> if<00:02:05.009> he<00:02:05.100> doesn't<00:02:05.340> bring<00:02:05.430> his<00:02:05.579> fake<00:02:05.759> out

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
out and if he doesn't bring his fake out

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.429 
out and if he doesn't bring his fake out
or<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.210> buy<00:02:06.390> myself<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.840> turn<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.170> do<00:02:07.259> more

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
or I can buy myself a turn to do more

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.050 
or I can buy myself a turn to do more
damage<00:02:07.619> or<00:02:07.950> at<00:02:08.069> least<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.310> waste<00:02:08.520> his<00:02:08.700> initial

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.790 
damage or at least to waste his initial
protect<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:11.009> if<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.550> bring<00:02:11.730> some<00:02:11.910> mungus<00:02:12.270> and

protect and if you bring some mungus and
politoed<00:02:13.800> I

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
politoed I

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.550 
politoed I

the thunderbolt slash fire option here i
don't<00:02:16.890> really<00:02:17.160> don't<00:02:17.340> have<00:02:17.460> anything<00:02:17.700> else<00:02:17.970> to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
don't really don't have anything else to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.300 
don't really don't have anything else to
take<00:02:18.270> out<00:02:18.480> amoonguss<00:02:19.260> very<00:02:19.590> quickly<00:02:19.830> besides

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
take out amoonguss very quickly besides

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.840 
take out amoonguss very quickly besides
a<00:02:20.640> strong<00:02:21.090> return<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.810> like<00:02:22.230> an<00:02:22.350> overheat<00:02:22.850> so

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
a strong return and like an overheat so

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.720 
a strong return and like an overheat so
those<00:02:24.120> are<00:02:24.270> really<00:02:24.420> my<00:02:24.510> best<00:02:24.720> options<00:02:25.140> here

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
those are really my best options here

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.060 
those are really my best options here
and<00:02:26.840> then<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.020> back<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.410> bring<00:02:28.590> Salamence

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
and then in the back I bring Salamence

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.650 
and then in the back I bring Salamence
and<00:02:29.220> Ferrothorn<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.880> I'll<00:02:29.970> get<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.270> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
and Ferrothorn and I'll get to the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.210 
and Ferrothorn and I'll get to the
reason<00:02:30.990> for<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.530> second<00:02:31.920> but<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.130> do

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
reason for that in a second but I do

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.860 
reason for that in a second but I do
bring<00:02:32.550> Ferrothorn<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.330> back<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.780> is

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
bring Ferrothorn in the back and this is

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.050 
bring Ferrothorn in the back and this is
very<00:02:34.020> important<00:02:34.410> because<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.310> know<00:02:35.490> he's<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
very important because I know he's the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.240 
very important because I know he's the
slowest<00:02:36.450> thing<00:02:36.480> on<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> field<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.740> in<00:02:37.860> case<00:02:38.070> he

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
slowest thing on the field so in case he

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.680 
slowest thing on the field so in case he
gets<00:02:38.370> off<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.730> perish<00:02:38.970> song<00:02:39.150> takes<00:02:39.450> out<00:02:39.600> my

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.530 
ability so I'm not afraid of him
faking<00:03:10.770> me<00:03:10.920> out<00:03:11.070> like<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:11.489> just<00:03:11.760> like<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.390> I

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
faking me out like this just like that I

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.510 
faking me out like this just like that I
was<00:03:12.750> prepared<00:03:12.900> for<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.130> combo

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
was prepared for that for this combo

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.460 
was prepared for that for this combo
because<00:03:15.480> I'm<00:03:15.750> hitting<00:03:15.959> ability<00:03:16.290> which<00:03:16.380> is

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
because I'm hitting ability which is

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.030 
because I'm hitting ability which is
inner<00:03:16.590> focus

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
inner focus

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.910 
inner focus
I<00:03:17.220> also<00:03:18.150> that's<00:03:19.019> why<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:19.200> didn't<00:03:19.440> mega<00:03:19.680> evolve

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
I also that's why I didn't mega evolve

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.610 
I also that's why I didn't mega evolve
here<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:21.330> go<00:03:21.480> for<00:03:21.600> an<00:03:21.720> earthquake<00:03:21.900> another

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
here and I go for an earthquake another

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.020 
here and I go for an earthquake another
portion<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:23.070> leading<00:03:23.310> with<00:03:23.340> Rotom<00:03:23.670> heat<00:03:23.820> here

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
portion of leading with Rotom heat here

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.699 
portion of leading with Rotom heat here
so<00:03:24.239> I<00:03:24.299> knew<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.510> could<00:03:24.690> quake<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.380> can<00:03:25.560> hit

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
so I knew I could quake and I can hit

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.670 
so I knew I could quake and I can hit
Gengar<00:03:26.100> when<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.340> loses<00:03:26.600> levitate<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:28.410> let<00:03:28.620> me

go for the earthquake I hit him I hit

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.460 
go for the earthquake I hit him I hit
both<00:03:36.209> go<00:03:36.510> that's<00:03:36.660> really<00:03:37.049> good<00:03:37.200> look<00:03:37.350> he's

back<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.799> down<00:03:38.010> below<00:03:38.160> half<00:03:38.670> I<00:03:38.910> know<00:03:38.970> he<00:03:39.120> can't

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
back in down below half I know he can't

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.759 
back in down below half I know he can't
protect<00:03:39.480> all<00:03:39.780> 3<00:03:39.959> turns<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.320> I'll<00:03:40.410> probably<00:03:40.620> get

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
protect all 3 turns so I'll probably get

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.710 
protect all 3 turns so I'll probably get
the<00:03:40.890> K<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:41.220> him<00:03:41.370> somewhere<00:03:41.549> out<00:03:41.730> here<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.299> I

also go for an overheat here and of

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.410 
also go for an overheat here and of
course<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:46.350> misses<00:03:46.829> so<00:03:47.579> Gengar<00:03:47.940> still<00:03:48.180> alive

Ferrothorn<00:06:09.800> came<00:06:10.040> out<00:06:10.160> here<00:06:10.400> and<00:06:10.580> he<00:06:10.910> had

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
Ferrothorn came out here and he had

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.740 
Ferrothorn came out here and he had
these<00:06:11.450> two<00:06:11.950> the<00:06:12.950> game<00:06:13.070> is<00:06:13.220> pretty<00:06:13.340> much<00:06:13.430> over

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
these two the game is pretty much over

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.030 
these two the game is pretty much over
cuz<00:06:14.750> he<00:06:14.930> just<00:06:14.960> he<00:06:15.260> can't<00:06:15.530> parish<00:06:15.830> song

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
cuz he just he can't parish song

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.440 
cuz he just he can't parish song
actually<00:06:16.340> I<00:06:16.520> think<00:06:16.580> he<00:06:16.850> ends<00:06:17.000> up<00:06:17.060> going<00:06:17.210> for<00:06:17.420> a

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
actually I think he ends up going for a

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.820 
actually I think he ends up going for a
pair<00:06:17.600> of<00:06:17.630> song<00:06:17.840> I<00:06:17.960> think<00:06:18.110> he<00:06:18.170> realizes<00:06:18.530> it's

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
pair of song I think he realizes it's

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.100 
pair of song I think he realizes it's
hopeless<00:06:19.010> but<00:06:19.580> it's<00:06:20.570> just<00:06:20.750> the<00:06:20.840> kind<00:06:20.960> of<00:06:21.050> kid

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
hopeless but it's just the kind of kid

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.100 
hopeless but it's just the kind of kid
he<00:06:21.350> is<00:06:21.500> but<00:06:22.390> yeah<00:06:23.390> so<00:06:23.540> I'm<00:06:23.630> getting<00:06:23.780> that<00:06:23.870> leaf

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
he is but yeah so I'm getting that leaf

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.330 
he is but yeah so I'm getting that leaf
seed<00:06:24.320> app<00:06:24.440> it's<00:06:24.620> really<00:06:24.650> cool<00:06:24.920> I<00:06:24.950> can<00:06:25.160> just

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
seed app it's really cool I can just

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.890 
seed app it's really cool I can just
really<00:06:25.520> I<00:06:25.670> can<00:06:25.880> stall<00:06:26.090> him<00:06:26.330> out<00:06:26.420> now<00:06:26.570> he<00:06:26.630> goes

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
really I can stall him out now he goes

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
really I can stall him out now he goes
to<00:06:26.930> the<00:06:27.050> pair<00:06:27.200> of<00:06:27.260> song<00:06:27.410> knowing<00:06:27.650> he's<00:06:27.770> gonna

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
to the pair of song knowing he's gonna

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.650 
to the pair of song knowing he's gonna
lose<00:06:28.130> but

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
lose but

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.540 
lose but
Pio<00:06:29.810> tells<00:06:30.380> you<00:06:30.560> you<00:06:30.710> tie<00:06:30.890> so<00:06:31.160> I<00:06:31.190> think<00:06:31.310> he<00:06:31.430> was

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
Pio tells you you tie so I think he was

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.400 
Pio tells you you tie so I think he was
going<00:06:31.640> for<00:06:31.820> that<00:06:31.970> he<00:06:32.360> gigas<00:06:32.660> reins<00:06:32.930> to<00:06:33.200> try<00:06:33.350> to

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
going for that he gigas reins to try to

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.200 
going for that he gigas reins to try to
survive<00:06:33.830> my<00:06:34.160> attack<00:06:34.460> he<00:06:34.700> wants<00:06:34.910> to<00:06:35.000> survive

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
survive my attack he wants to survive

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.030 
survive my attack he wants to survive
two<00:06:35.390> attacks<00:06:35.750> here<00:06:36.020> in<00:06:36.170> order<00:06:36.470> to

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
two attacks here in order to

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.980 
two attacks here in order to
to<00:06:38.460> bring<00:06:38.670> down<00:06:38.700> a<00:06:38.850> parish<00:06:39.180> trap<00:06:39.450> or<00:06:39.720> to<00:06:39.840> bring

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
to bring down a parish trap or to bring

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.390 
to bring down a parish trap or to bring
down<00:06:40.110> a<00:06:40.170> pair<00:06:40.380> of<00:06:40.410> song<00:06:40.650> and<00:06:40.680> then<00:06:40.980> get<00:06:41.130> a<00:06:41.160> tie

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
down a pair of song and then get a tie

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.990 
down a pair of song and then get a tie
on<00:06:41.430> our<00:06:41.760> record<00:06:42.120> but<00:06:43.110> I<00:06:43.440> got<00:06:44.280> too<00:06:44.520> much<00:06:44.700> power

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
on our record but I got too much power

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.090 
on our record but I got too much power
in<00:06:45.210> my<00:06:45.870> diary<00:06:46.050> ball<00:06:46.380> and<00:06:46.620> it's<00:06:46.740> gonna<00:06:46.950> do

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
in my diary ball and it's gonna do

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.650 
in my diary ball and it's gonna do
enough<00:06:47.340> damage<00:06:47.370> here<00:06:47.760> when<00:06:48.120> he<00:06:48.240> can't<00:06:48.480> protect

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 
enough damage here when he can't protect

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.870 
enough damage here when he can't protect
I<00:06:49.080> think<00:06:49.290> he<00:06:49.380> fails<00:06:49.590> the<00:06:49.800> devil<00:06:50.100> or<00:06:50.670> he<00:06:50.730> goes

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 
I think he fails the devil or he goes

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.120 
I think he fails the devil or he goes
for<00:06:51.060> he<00:06:51.180> tries<00:06:51.360> to<00:06:51.420> get<00:06:51.480> a<00:06:51.540> little<00:06:51.690> health<00:06:52.130> it's

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
for he tries to get a little health it's

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.700 
for he tries to get a little health it's
not<00:06:53.220> gonna<00:06:53.430> be<00:06:53.580> enough<00:06:53.670> and<00:06:54.350> that's<00:06:55.350> gonna<00:06:55.530> be

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
not gonna be enough and that's gonna be

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:01.340 
not gonna be enough and that's gonna be
the<00:06:55.740> game<00:06:55.830> so<00:06:59.120> just<00:07:00.120> as<00:07:00.240> a<00:07:00.270> recap<00:07:00.510> what<00:07:00.900> I<00:07:00.930> did<00:07:01.170> I

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.150 
look at the pair of song errs very
commonly<00:07:10.260> they're<00:07:10.470> just<00:07:10.650> gonna<00:07:10.770> leave<00:07:10.950> it<00:07:10.980> the

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 
commonly they're just gonna leave it the

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.380 
commonly they're just gonna leave it the
pair<00:07:11.310> of<00:07:11.400> soccer<00:07:11.580> cuz<00:07:11.820> that's<00:07:12.000> their<00:07:12.210> whole

pair of soccer cuz that's their whole
strategy<00:07:12.600> you<00:07:13.080> know<00:07:13.230> I<00:07:13.580> would<00:07:14.580> have<00:07:14.640> been<00:07:14.790> a

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:14.970 
strategy you know I would have been a

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.340 
strategy you know I would have been a
little<00:07:15.150> bit<00:07:15.330> more<00:07:15.360> in<00:07:15.540> trouble<00:07:15.840> if<00:07:15.990> there<00:07:16.200> was

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
little bit more in trouble if there was

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.990 
little bit more in trouble if there was
rain<00:07:16.590> up<00:07:16.800> and<00:07:17.040> amoonguss<00:07:17.370> and<00:07:17.640> Paulo<00:07:17.790> Joe<00:07:17.940> to

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
rain up and amoonguss and Paulo Joe to

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.530 
rain up and amoonguss and Paulo Joe to
come<00:07:18.090> out

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:18.540 
come out

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.110 
come out
I<00:07:18.570> definitely<00:07:18.840> admit<00:07:19.230> that<00:07:19.440> I<00:07:19.940> would<00:07:20.940> have<00:07:21.030> had

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
I definitely admit that I would have had

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.230 
I definitely admit that I would have had
to<00:07:21.240> have<00:07:21.360> predict<00:07:22.220> the<00:07:23.220> the<00:07:23.670> protect<00:07:24.030> first

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
to have predict the the protect first

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.800 
to have predict the the protect first
turn<00:07:24.390> against<00:07:24.750> the<00:07:24.900> fake<00:07:25.710> out<00:07:26.660> but<00:07:27.660> once

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:27.810 
turn against the fake out but once

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.910 
turn against the fake out but once
you're<00:07:27.930> doing<00:07:28.020> that<00:07:28.170> kind<00:07:28.200> of<00:07:28.380> damage<00:07:28.500> and<00:07:28.830> you

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:28.920 
you're doing that kind of damage and you

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.170 
you're doing that kind of damage and you
have<00:07:29.010> the<00:07:29.100> slowest<00:07:29.460> thing<00:07:29.640> it's<00:07:29.940> very

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 
have the slowest thing it's very

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.280 
have the slowest thing it's very
important<00:07:30.450> to<00:07:30.510> bring<00:07:30.600> something<00:07:30.810> slower<00:07:31.080> than

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.290 
important to bring something slower than

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.050 
important to bring something slower than
them<00:07:31.410> in<00:07:31.440> the<00:07:31.620> back<00:07:31.800> if<00:07:32.100> you<00:07:32.130> don't<00:07:32.820> think

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 
them in the back if you don't think

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.310 
them in the back if you don't think
you're<00:07:33.180> going<00:07:33.300> to<00:07:33.390> wipe<00:07:33.570> you<00:07:33.930> know<00:07:34.050> the

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.320 
you're going to wipe you know the

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.450 
you're going to wipe you know the
majority<00:07:34.620> of<00:07:34.650> the<00:07:34.740> team<00:07:34.860> out<00:07:35.010> with<00:07:35.100> your<00:07:35.250> front

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.460 
majority of the team out with your front

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.000 
majority of the team out with your front
two<00:07:35.660> and<00:07:36.660> so<00:07:36.990> yeah<00:07:37.260> guys<00:07:37.440> that's<00:07:37.680> pretty<00:07:37.920> much
