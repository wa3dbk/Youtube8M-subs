00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.340
 hello today we are going to make the 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.590
 unboxing or unpacking the new 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.900
 microsoft console the xbox world 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.660
 fresh out of the store let's see 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.470
 that contains the box and we will see how 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.470
 nothing is nothing else has 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.590
 well let's see what the 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.370
 box as we can see 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.119
 the sides is a box is quite 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:33.329
 heavy what I thought four a little 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.989
 four kilos more or less 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.510
 here we see the content of the console the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.239
 kinect a wireless control the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.399
 Hearing aids hdmi cable capacity 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:53.789
 for wi-fi and the 500 gigs of hard disk 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:55.750
 ok it 's a pretty nice box yes yes we're going 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.500
 to open it 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.500
 no no no 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.540
 The first thing we see is 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.930
 the sensor 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.930
 have 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.280
 but first let's take out 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.619
 We have the quick configuration guide 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.579
 advertising manuals 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.579
 here comes the headband 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.000
 the excel to play to connect it to 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.860
 control also the control that we know 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.170
 has the power cord 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.729
 I play in the eliminator 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.950
 I do not understand why they keep doing 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.920
 these houses are many great campear 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.570
 but good 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.570
 and we have here an HDMI cable 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.780
 if they did not have service for wall 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.280
 we have here the control here is a 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.030
 little important with the control the 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.450
 control comes in its way 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.360
 with 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.430
 the space for double used batteries 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.459
 before you can find the package 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.840
 rechargeable that they sell in stores 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.430
 not to be spending anyway 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.400
 this initial package includes two 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.870
 materials of which we see here what 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.019
 which good can arrive and connect 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.019
 and I bought the package 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.010
 of rechargeable batteries design 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.550
 of control stays a little bit so that 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.120
 See it 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.120
 he is quite nice is father 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.959
 you see that it is quite comfortable ergonomic 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.420
 after confessing that long ago no no 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.000
 I used 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:55.420
 a xbox the medium I have gotten but 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.250
 this one looks pretty good I think it's 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.980
 already of the first generations that 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.040
 they are eliminating those famous 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.230
 select and start buttons which I 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.920
 it seems I think it's convenient because 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.040
 end we only use the start button 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.990
 in some occasions to put pause 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.880
 a very nice control 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.790
 the truth is that I liked it 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.170
 we keep highlighting this 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.090
 and back comes 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.099
 kinect 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.709
 how can you see if we will take it in 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.709
 consideration of the control then 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.610
 well this little night feels pretty 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:45.140
 heavy good the normal has its base 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.610
 he cites his cable and then nothing of the other 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.180
 the interesting thing will be to see it 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.180
 working 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.370
 then this what we have in the part 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.180
 from above we can lay this cardboard 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.180
 there is nothing 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.489
 Y 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.819
 in the bottom part comes the code 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:11.800
 downloadable to download fifa 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:14.550
 let's remove it and here it comes 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.550
 on the consoles 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.759
 the guarantee forget remember that it is in 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.759
 the chair 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.400
 these two we are going to remove this 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.880
 and let's do it 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.559
 it looks 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.320
 has the console 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.470
 the protections 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.030
 yes indeed it seems 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.990
 a 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.889
 VCR 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.440
 from hs 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.180
 lovely 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.700
 I put my fingers on top 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.780
 but good in the back of the 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:09.020
 tickets comes the energy has the 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.500
 hdmi that goes to the television the 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.750
 audio the optics of this from the 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.760
 cable that your health itself is very 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.870
 interesting let's see how about how 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.730
 it works two usb entries will have to see 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.120
 how can we use them to enter the 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.430
 kinect and the cable r does not also have 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.000
 here one to put a candadito like 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.470
 what you put on laptops 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.270
 i 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:40.449
 another USB input on this side a button 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.479
 that will allow us to expel him 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.449
 the disc that we have put certain 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.520
 has to expel this is not for that 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.340
 be but now we investigate 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.620
 and then nothing 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.500
 and nothing more 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.960
 nothing more this 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.700
 then as you can see it does not have 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:05.660
 enough little things we are going to connect it to 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.660
 see how it works 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.350
 to discover new things I'm going to wet the 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.470
 fifa also to see how it works and I 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:16.310
 I acquired separately the telephone rising 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:19.430
 also to have a good look 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.840
 let's see what happens that I hope that 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.760
 you liked this a boxing and 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.820
 we are also going to check the console more 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.920
 ahead 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.400
 Thank you 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.400
 ah
