that's that's like one of the WWE comics
but<00:03:46.020> uh<00:03:46.100> back<00:03:47.100> in<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.400> day<00:03:47.580> they<00:03:47.880> had<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.120> lot<00:03:48.450> of

but uh back in the day they had a lot of

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.530 
but uh back in the day they had a lot of
them<00:03:48.750> like<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.550> know<00:03:50.550> they<00:03:50.880> had<00:03:51.000> an<00:03:51.090> undertaker

won I think they had a Kevin Nash one at

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.480 
won I think they had a Kevin Nash one at
some<00:03:54.900> time<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.380> an<00:03:55.500> ultimate<00:03:55.860> warrior<00:03:56.250> one
