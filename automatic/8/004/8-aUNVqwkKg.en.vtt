but<00:00:25.210> here's<00:00:25.360> the<00:00:25.510> thing<00:00:25.720> what<00:00:26.050> happens<00:00:26.530> when

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
but here's the thing what happens when

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.170 
but here's the thing what happens when
you<00:00:26.770> buy<00:00:26.980> a<00:00:27.010> stock<00:00:27.370> that<00:00:27.400> files<00:00:27.970> for

you buy a stock that files for
bankruptcy<00:00:28.270> does<00:00:29.260> it<00:00:29.410> really<00:00:29.800> have<00:00:30.010> the

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
bankruptcy does it really have the

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.580 
bankruptcy does it really have the
chance<00:00:30.460> of<00:00:30.640> surviving<00:00:31.450> the<00:00:32.110> chapter<00:00:32.529> 11

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
chance of surviving the chapter 11

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.370 
chance of surviving the chapter 11
bankruptcy<00:00:33.430> and<00:00:34.000> coming<00:00:34.300> out<00:00:34.390> of<00:00:34.450> it<00:00:34.690> most

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
bankruptcy and coming out of it most

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.310 
bankruptcy and coming out of it most
likely<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.100> answer<00:00:36.130> is<00:00:36.730> no<00:00:37.060> now<00:00:37.780> keep<00:00:37.989> in<00:00:38.140> mind

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
likely the answer is no now keep in mind

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.350 
likely the answer is no now keep in mind
whenever<00:00:38.530> a<00:00:38.680> company<00:00:39.280> files<00:00:39.880> for<00:00:40.180> bankruptcy

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
whenever a company files for bankruptcy

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.640 
whenever a company files for bankruptcy
and<00:00:41.020> they're<00:00:41.140> going<00:00:41.320> through<00:00:41.470> this

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
and they're going through this

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.920 
and they're going through this
reorganization<00:00:42.150> it's<00:00:43.150> the<00:00:43.450> debt<00:00:43.690> holders

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
reorganization it's the debt holders

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.740 
reorganization it's the debt holders
that<00:00:44.290> are<00:00:44.350> first<00:00:44.830> aligned<00:00:45.190> to<00:00:45.430> claim<00:00:45.790> any<00:00:46.480> of

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
that are first aligned to claim any of

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.720 
that are first aligned to claim any of
the<00:00:46.960> debts<00:00:47.350> whenever<00:00:47.890> asked<00:00:48.340> this<00:00:48.430> were<00:00:48.520> to<00:00:48.610> be

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
the debts whenever asked this were to be

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.090 
the debts whenever asked this were to be
sold<00:00:48.910> so<00:00:49.750> the<00:00:49.780> common<00:00:50.350> shareholders<00:00:50.620> are

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
sold so the common shareholders are

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.420 
sold so the common shareholders are
actually<00:00:51.520> last<00:00:51.940> so<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:53.260> likelihood<00:00:54.070> of<00:00:54.100> them

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
actually last so the likelihood of them

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.390 
actually last so the likelihood of them
getting<00:00:54.460> out<00:00:54.970> of<00:00:55.330> it<00:00:55.540> is<00:00:55.750> slim<00:00:56.530> to<00:00:56.559> none<00:00:56.800> now

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
getting out of it is slim to none now

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.640 
getting out of it is slim to none now
does<00:00:57.550> that<00:00:57.610> mean<00:00:57.850> that<00:00:57.909> it<00:00:58.120> can't<00:00:58.449> happen<00:00:58.720> sure

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
does that mean that it can't happen sure

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.130 
does that mean that it can't happen sure
it<00:01:00.010> could<00:01:00.400> but<00:01:01.210> it's<00:01:01.360> not<00:01:01.510> something<00:01:01.960> that<00:01:02.080> I

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
it could but it's not something that I

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.340 
it could but it's not something that I
feel<00:01:02.769> is<00:01:03.190> most<00:01:03.489> likely<00:01:03.850> going<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.089> happen<00:01:04.350> so

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
feel is most likely going to happen so

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.140 
feel is most likely going to happen so
if<00:01:05.680> you<00:01:05.830> do<00:01:06.010> buy<00:01:06.040> some<00:01:06.460> American<00:01:06.850> Airlines

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
if you do buy some American Airlines

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.450 
if you do buy some American Airlines
stock<00:01:07.630> most<00:01:08.380> likely<00:01:08.680> will<00:01:08.920> happen<00:01:09.130> is<00:01:09.430> that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
stock most likely will happen is that

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.610 
stock most likely will happen is that
the<00:01:10.090> stock<00:01:10.390> that<00:01:10.570> you<00:01:10.720> own<00:01:10.900> so<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.380> paper

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
the stock that you own so the paper

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.800 
the stock that you own so the paper
certificate<00:01:12.310> that<00:01:12.460> you<00:01:12.550> own<00:01:12.760> will<00:01:13.390> become

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
certificate that you own will become

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.920 
certificate that you own will become
worthless<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.890> then<00:01:15.430> if<00:01:15.729> American<00:01:16.450> Airlines

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
worthless and then if American Airlines

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.050 
worthless and then if American Airlines
does<00:01:17.229> survive<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.130> bankruptcy<00:01:18.280> where<00:01:18.909> they

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
does survive the bankruptcy where they

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.180 
does survive the bankruptcy where they
sell<00:01:19.750> off<00:01:19.870> their<00:01:20.080> debts<00:01:20.290> and<00:01:20.650> just<00:01:20.860> get<00:01:21.010> rid<00:01:21.130> of

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
sell off their debts and just get rid of

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.190 
sell off their debts and just get rid of
all<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:22.030> junk<00:01:22.390> that<00:01:22.450> they<00:01:22.570> had<00:01:22.720> on<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.930> books

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
all the junk that they had on the books

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.440 
all the junk that they had on the books
then<00:01:23.979> what<00:01:24.370> will<00:01:24.520> most<00:01:24.700> likely<00:01:24.850> happen<00:01:25.330> is

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
then what will most likely happen is

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.719 
then what will most likely happen is
they'll<00:01:25.570> actually<00:01:25.720> reissue<00:01:26.409> new<00:01:27.040> stock<00:01:27.400> and

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
they'll actually reissue new stock and

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.880 
they'll actually reissue new stock and
then<00:01:28.150> if<00:01:28.330> you<00:01:28.450> want<00:01:28.660> to<00:01:28.840> buy<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:29.470> invest<00:01:29.710> back

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
then if you want to buy and invest back

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.680 
then if you want to buy and invest back
in<00:01:30.070> America<00:01:30.400> American<00:01:30.760> Airlines<00:01:31.090> you<00:01:31.570> would
