00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:11.100

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.040
 dr barbecue movie or german dr 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.630
 wiggle numbers 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.480
 made toy of hasbro and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.849
 suitable for children over three years and 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.939
 You can use it to visit a dentist 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.339
 reenact and imitate 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.579
 you have three pots of playbook stitching 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:35.850
 once in white for the teeth then gray 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:41.120
 make stuffing or caries and red 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:44.340
 for toothpaste or for the string or 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.699
 the wire because you too the patient 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.429
 you can miss a brace 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.239
 even drill into teeth and fill again 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:57.120
 myself last week at the dentist 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.219
 Therefore, I know only too well how the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.010
 Patient will feel at the treatment 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.839
 where we only borrow 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.020
 no idea they will do it again 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.290
 Still, a lot of fun would be and 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.280
 I'll take a look together with you 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.280
 everything is in it 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:43.480
 First and foremost, the patient platform 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.480
 but the teeth can produce 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:59.200
 a drill i see right here 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:59.200
 a battery purely a toothbrush 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:22.140
 gray clothes knead a big pot 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:24.989
 white playmate red play dough that will 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:31.500
 So be the tool for the brackets 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:36.060
 to fabricate these little notifying the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.440
 to hold the braces together then 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.440
 a pair of tweezers 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.610
 behind is an ear 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:03:05.660
 that 's her lower jaw and that will 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.940
 probably this thing would be something 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.300
 Dentists always use when drilled 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.910
 becomes 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:17.170
 So this sucker or something here 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.170
 a family 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.610

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.770
