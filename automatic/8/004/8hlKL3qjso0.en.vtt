00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.320
 the job the props knows that he 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.540
 must find practical solutions good 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.440
 play of the actors 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.390
 many people think that 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.699
 the accessory is obviously he who will 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.939
 accessorized the table obviously no 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.499
 it's the shelling team all of shelling the 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.569
 decorative chef who will hunt down the clans are 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:28.009
 billÃ¨re and all yesterday for example 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:30.289
 her job it's going to be to find at 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.960
 both the furniture the plates the 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.719
 green the cutlery everything there all that 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.250
 is around the table me my job is going 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.250
 to be managing them 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.130
 it was exciting to watch the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.170
 work of the propsman the management of 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.640
 all the power on the movie via a 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.160
 actor it's really like a product 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.010
 home food little faded during 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.810
 the time of the day as a dish 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.180
 we have before us or the sauces freezes 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.010
 and so we are we are on the same 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.730
 plan food and actors there must 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.730
 always be fresh 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.990
 so there are several meals at jean mid 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.420
 which is rather the most popular of the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.050
 band had the blaze that is when 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.270
 even a dish despite everything enough 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.490
 aesthetic there's a whole job I'm 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.710
 blame myself for not having seen a 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.540
 big reflection on the food and the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.770
 practical side ie the blaze 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.160
 I arrived in the morning 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:47.410
 well here we are, a culinary stylist 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:50.950
 so students who she thought was eating 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.380
 it's the consumables dish and I 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.350
 practical jelly reflection that morning in 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.880
 arriving we have five or six good we have a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.530
 the problem is that mussels 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.950
 as soon as we put them in place goes after 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.050
 five minutes 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.250
 it opens and so in five minutes it 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.130
 had to find a solution and our 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.990
 firmware takes a bag of moult it 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.270
 is cooked and empties them 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.530
 so we have spun the advice from 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.530
 the epo that seemed to me stuck us 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.300
 and iv when it's beef rib and 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.660
 fries 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.460
 since you rx and is appetizing 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.140
 but as anyone would have done to 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.150
 a rib of beef coup ci punishes with a 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.880
 little black but it looks a little 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.160
 appetizing all they meals that 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.620
 are good to each other here is the idea it's 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.250
 I do not think it sounds like a meal 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.250
 friendly and 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.790
 but
