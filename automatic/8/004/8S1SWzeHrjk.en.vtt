my already full general tab this is

my already full general tab this is
great<00:02:14.710> but<00:02:15.310> going<00:02:15.490> another<00:02:15.790> direction<00:02:16.210> with

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
great but going another direction with

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.780 
great but going another direction with
it<00:02:16.690> while<00:02:17.140> I'm<00:02:17.290> incredibly<00:02:17.920> grateful<00:02:18.010> for<00:02:18.580> the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
it while I'm incredibly grateful for the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.340 
it while I'm incredibly grateful for the
increase<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.360> vault<00:02:19.570> space<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.050> time

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
increase the vault space and the time

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.140 
increase the vault space and the time
that<00:02:20.380> they<00:02:20.650> took<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.580> think<00:02:22.060> it

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
that they took to do that I think it

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.000 
that they took to do that I think it
does<00:02:22.360> illustrate<00:02:22.600> that<00:02:23.020> Bungie<00:02:23.440> might<00:02:23.770> not

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
does illustrate that Bungie might not

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.740 
does illustrate that Bungie might not
have<00:02:24.160> expected<00:02:24.460> how<00:02:24.970> many<00:02:25.210> items<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
have expected how many items the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.140 
have expected how many items the
playerbase<00:02:26.050> likes<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.740> hold<00:02:26.860> on<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.340> even<00:02:28.060> with

playerbase likes to hold on to even with
the<00:02:28.240> increase<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.840> vault<00:02:29.050> space<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.440> can<00:02:29.650> see

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
the increase the vault space I can see

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.230 
the increase the vault space I can see
the<00:02:29.920> same<00:02:30.160> players<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.700> are<00:02:30.790> currently

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
the same players that are currently

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.690 
the same players that are currently
complaining<00:02:32.140> about<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.560> vault<00:02:32.770> sighs<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.580> be

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
complaining about the vault sighs to be

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.250 
complaining about the vault sighs to be
running<00:02:34.000> out<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.120> space<00:02:34.420> towards<00:02:34.840> comet

running out of space towards comet

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.650 
running out of space towards comet
release<00:02:35.680> maybe<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.790> current<00:02:37.090> solution<00:02:37.540> to

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
release maybe the current solution to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.810 
release maybe the current solution to
storing<00:02:37.990> items<00:02:38.140> isn't<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.890> best<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.490> they

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
storing items isn't the best and they

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.580 
storing items isn't the best and they
should<00:02:40.000> change<00:02:40.210> up<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.600> game<00:02:40.840> there<00:02:41.080> maybe

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
should change up the game there maybe

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.200 
should change up the game there maybe

as the game progresses they're clearly
going<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.700> be<00:02:57.790> limited<00:02:58.030> by<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.630> older

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
going to be limited by the older

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.750 
going to be limited by the older

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320
