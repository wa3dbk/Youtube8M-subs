00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.080
 the goal 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.080
 ae 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.030
 the goal 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.240
 i 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.250
 he 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.530
 ae 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.970
 i make a video of the music then playing 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.730
 in front of this version that I took from 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.040
 Sergio Reyes is the one who most approached the 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.989
 Accordion and I'll make a video then 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.070
 for you here in the tone of a greater 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.070
 then right here 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.329
 the goal 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.800
 she came out intense 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:07.800
 I used the octave to give a 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:11.640
 more only you can use only interests 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.640
 I think it's possible 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.020
 on the hill 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.020
 ae 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.510
 the other option would be to put on leave 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.670
 the mother 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:46.259
 The sixth one would be the low one descends the episode 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.240
 the goal 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.240
 I am 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.890
 however 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.890
 ae 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:21.109
 and there the call money or 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:40.330
 the keyboard will make the goal 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.650
 I think it looks pretty good there the first time. 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.650
 option the eighth 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.800
 the goal 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.819
 Hi 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.550
 is 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.830
 neither do I 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:13.170
 So I already stayed in New York. 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:16.140
 Nice thing is the lake C will stay one 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.630
 little but more calm will touch 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.320
 but also has the version played in docs 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.320
 Will you do the same? 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.310
 is 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.519
 ae 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.670
 O 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
 although 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.820
 now it interests another team and 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.820
 continue friday and tuesday 30 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:14.870
 It is easier because I am a natural and 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.870
 ii 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.010
 in a pretty cool version this would be it here 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.310
 ae 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.449
 ae 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.449
 in the intervals it did not look so good here 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:05:00.040
 ae 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:05:00.970
 It's the same one I did there then you there 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.320
 can 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.930
 already playing is a car left is father 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.280
 in the category also if you want 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:15.840
 check the last one I did 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.840
 here is cool too leaked at school 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.560
 the goal 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.220
 Then you can play ahead with 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.220
 sure and
