00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
best and that is infecting the entire

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.070 
best and that is infecting the entire
map<00:00:04.770> taking<00:00:05.549> over<00:00:05.879> creeping<00:00:06.720> out<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.930> whole

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
map taking over creeping out the whole

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.120 
map taking over creeping out the whole
thing<00:00:07.319> it<00:00:07.440> looks<00:00:07.620> like<00:00:07.740> he's<00:00:07.830> getting<00:00:08.069> another

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
thing it looks like he's getting another

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.799 
thing it looks like he's getting another
expansion<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.880> looks<00:00:09.059> like<00:00:09.179> he's<00:00:09.599> actually

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
expansion it looks like he's actually

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.810 
expansion it looks like he's actually
building<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.290> gold<00:00:10.469> expansion<00:00:10.920> as<00:00:11.040> well<00:00:11.190> these

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
building a gold expansion as well these

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.490 
building a gold expansion as well these
muta<00:00:12.120> Liske<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.450> really<00:00:12.750> like<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.259> i<00:00:13.290> also

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
muta Liske I really like this and i also

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.259 
muta Liske I really like this and i also
like<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.920> fact<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.219> all<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.880> his<00:00:14.969> ground

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
like the fact that all of his ground

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.210 
like the fact that all of his ground
units<00:00:15.540> are<00:00:15.660> hot<00:00:15.839> keyed<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.320> his<00:00:16.650> heirs<00:00:16.920> hot

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
units are hot keyed and his heirs hot

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.680 
units are hot keyed and his heirs hot
keyed<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.670> they're<00:00:18.029> both<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.390> two<00:00:18.539> different

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
keyed and they're both in two different

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.689 
keyed and they're both in two different
positions<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.680> when<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> ground<00:00:20.400> units

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
positions so that when the ground units

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.120 
positions so that when the ground units
going<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.090> attack<00:00:21.420> up<00:00:21.660> top<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:21.990> these<00:00:22.769> muta

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
going to attack up top here these muta

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.950 
going to attack up top here these muta
list<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.460> go<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.269> some<00:00:24.449> harassment<00:00:24.570> at

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
list can go in and do some harassment at

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.679 
list can go in and do some harassment at
the<00:00:25.050> same<00:00:25.260> time<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.800> basically<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:26.970> putting

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
the same time and basically just putting

the same time and basically just putting
putting<00:00:28.410> tret<00:00:28.800> sin<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.310> whole<00:00:29.519> cluster

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
putting tret sin to this whole cluster

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.540 
putting tret sin to this whole cluster
of<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:31.050> don't<00:00:31.500> know<00:00:31.619> where<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> go<00:00:32.040> don't

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
of just don't know where to go don't

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.880 
of just don't know where to go don't
know<00:00:32.730> exactly<00:00:33.540> what<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.840> do<00:00:33.989> kind<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.710> mode

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
know exactly what to do kind of mode

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.979 
know exactly what to do kind of mode
yeah<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.670> as<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.000> trites<00:00:36.750> getting

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
yeah and as you can see trites getting

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.180 
yeah and as you can see trites getting
out<00:00:37.079> here<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.410> getting<00:00:37.530> trying<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.980> get<00:00:38.100> rid

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
out here and getting trying to get rid

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.500 
out here and getting trying to get rid
of<00:00:38.250> some<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.399> these<00:00:38.520> creep<00:00:38.790> tumors<00:00:39.149> thinking

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
of some of these creep tumors thinking

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.540 
of some of these creep tumors thinking
about<00:00:39.660> maybe<00:00:39.899> making<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.350> push<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:41.430> he

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
about maybe making a push and really he

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.220 
about maybe making a push and really he
should<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.910> pushing<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.480> at<00:00:42.570> least<00:00:42.719> scouting

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
should be pushing or at least scouting

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.660 
should be pushing or at least scouting
because<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.710> don't<00:00:43.860> think<00:00:43.980> he<00:00:44.040> knows<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:44.370> any

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
because I don't think he knows about any

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.639 
because I don't think he knows about any
of<00:00:44.820> these<00:00:44.940> expansions<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.079> know<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
of these expansions and you know what a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.459 
of these expansions and you know what a
wise<00:00:47.250> black<00:00:47.579> man<00:00:47.820> once<00:00:48.450> told<00:00:48.660> me<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.079> in

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
wise black man once told me that in

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.319 
wise black man once told me that in
order<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.770> win<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> game<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.250> starcraft<00:00:50.730> you

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
order to win the game of starcraft you

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.470 
order to win the game of starcraft you
have<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.629> go<00:00:51.750> attack<00:00:53.030> dropping<00:00:54.030> knowledge<00:00:54.149> on

know what it looks like we got some
harassment<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.370> by<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.520> meter<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:02.910> they

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
harassment up here by the meter but they

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.640 
harassment up here by the meter but they
are<00:01:03.210> running<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.110> not<00:01:04.260> want<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> get

those<00:01:04.799> killed<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.280> want<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.549> use<00:01:05.670> those<00:01:05.820> as

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
those killed you want to use those as

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.969 
those killed you want to use those as
effectively<00:01:06.659> as<00:01:06.869> possible<00:01:06.930> even<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.950> only

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
effectively as possible even if it only

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.800 
effectively as possible even if it only
means<00:01:08.369> pissing<00:01:09.030> off<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.180> opponent<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
means pissing off your opponent and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.359 
means pissing off your opponent and
getting<00:01:10.320> him<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.530> go<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.770> top<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.010> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
getting him to go up top here and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.580 
getting him to go up top here and
basically<00:01:12.049> best-case<00:01:13.049> scenario<00:01:13.380> would<00:01:13.530> be

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
basically best-case scenario would be

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.469 
basically best-case scenario would be
for<00:01:13.860> dis<00:01:13.979> right<00:01:14.189> now<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> kind<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.330> him

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
for dis right now is to kind of get him

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.270 
for dis right now is to kind of get him
to<00:01:15.540> take<00:01:15.780> out<00:01:15.990> half<00:01:16.409> his<00:01:16.439> units<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.070> top<00:01:17.250> here

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to take out half his units up top here

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.070 
to take out half his units up top here
leaving<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> other<00:01:18.210> half<00:01:18.479> down<00:01:18.659> here<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
leaving the other half down here and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.749 
leaving the other half down here and
then<00:01:19.439> doing<00:01:19.590> attack<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.580> want<00:01:20.729> to

be up there and that could cause a

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.340 
be up there and that could cause a
little<00:02:15.670> bit<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.850> problems<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.690> as<00:02:16.930> we<00:02:17.050> see<00:02:17.200> the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
little bit of problems and as we see the

little bit of problems and as we see the
disk<00:02:17.590> saying<00:02:17.950> there<00:02:18.160> is<00:02:18.250> some<00:02:18.430> lag<00:02:18.610> not

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
disk saying there is some lag not

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.390 
disk saying there is some lag not
surprising<00:02:19.510> because<00:02:19.660> disk<00:02:20.560> actually<00:02:21.130> playing

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
surprising because disk actually playing

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.100 
surprising because disk actually playing

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.510 
basically can do whatever the hell he
wants<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:50.140> do<00:02:50.230> into<00:02:50.710> this<00:02:50.830> Terran<00:02:51.100> player<00:02:51.190> I

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
wants to do into this Terran player I

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.890 
wants to do into this Terran player I
don't<00:02:51.790> know<00:02:51.880> if<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.090> agree<00:02:52.210> with<00:02:52.360> going<00:02:52.690> up<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
don't know if I agree with going up the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.210 
don't know if I agree with going up the
middle<00:02:53.020> here<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.350> would<00:02:53.590> actually<00:02:53.980> probably

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
middle here I would actually probably

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.880 
middle here I would actually probably
rather<00:02:54.670> see<00:02:54.940> him<00:02:55.090> do<00:02:55.240> some<00:02:55.450> classic<00:02:55.930> Terran

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
rather see him do some classic Terran

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.880 
rather see him do some classic Terran
play<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.400> creep<00:02:57.820> if<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.240> may<00:02:58.450> say<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:59.530> Terran

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
play and creep if I may say the Terran

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.710 
play and creep if I may say the Terran
way<00:03:00.010> getting<00:03:00.400> some<00:03:00.640> tank<00:03:00.880> slowly<00:03:01.360> working<00:03:01.630> his

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
way getting some tank slowly working his

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.240 
way getting some tank slowly working his
way<00:03:01.810> up<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.110> map<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.560> has<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:02.890> forward<00:03:03.190> to

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
way up the map and has the forward to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.190 
way up the map and has the forward to
back<00:03:03.430> him<00:03:03.640> up<00:03:03.790> it's<00:03:04.270> probably<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.720> much<00:03:04.930> better

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
back him up it's probably a much better

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.570 
back him up it's probably a much better
way<00:03:05.410> than<00:03:05.590> coming<00:03:05.860> up<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.040> middle<00:03:06.160> here<00:03:06.370> he's

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
way than coming up the middle here he's

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.830 
way than coming up the middle here he's
just<00:03:06.760> going<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:06.970> get<00:03:07.060> trapped<00:03:07.330> if<00:03:07.540> he's<00:03:07.690> not

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
just going to get trapped if he's not

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.170 
just going to get trapped if he's not
careful<00:03:08.080> yeah<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.310> see<00:03:09.490> look<00:03:09.700> as<00:03:09.880> soon<00:03:10.060> as

occur if I traits is careful and does as
much<00:03:39.010> micro<00:03:39.640> as<00:03:39.760> he<00:03:39.880> possibly<00:03:40.060> can<00:03:40.420> even

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
much micro as he possibly can even

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
much micro as he possibly can even
though<00:03:40.780> he<00:03:40.870> doesn't<00:03:41.020> have<00:03:41.200> any<00:03:41.350> hot<00:03:41.500> keys

though he doesn't have any hot keys
micros<00:03:42.640> properly<00:03:43.300> he<00:03:43.660> could<00:03:43.900> be<00:03:44.050> okay<00:03:44.380> but<00:03:44.590> if

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
micros properly he could be okay but if

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.320 
micros properly he could be okay but if
he's<00:03:44.800> not<00:03:44.830> careful<00:03:45.190> this<00:03:45.820> could<00:03:45.880> end<00:03:46.209> very

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
he's not careful this could end very

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.030 
he's not careful this could end very
badly<00:03:46.720> for<00:03:47.050> him<00:03:47.200> he's<00:03:47.350> putting<00:03:47.590> himself<00:03:47.680> in<00:03:47.980> a

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
badly for him he's putting himself in a

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.890 
badly for him he's putting himself in a
very<00:03:48.250> vulnerable<00:03:48.550> position<00:03:48.940> right<00:03:49.420> now<00:03:49.450> one

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
very vulnerable position right now one

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.060 
very vulnerable position right now one
thing<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.140> I<00:03:50.290> will<00:03:50.380> say<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.620> traits<00:03:50.950> is

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
thing that I will say that traits is

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.740 
thing that I will say that traits is
doing<00:03:51.370> extremely<00:03:51.670> well<00:03:52.030> right<00:03:52.270> now<00:03:52.330> is<00:03:52.570> he's

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
doing extremely well right now is he's

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.260 
doing extremely well right now is he's
doing<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:53.080> scan<00:03:53.440> before<00:03:53.620> he<00:03:53.890> pushes<00:03:54.220> up<00:03:54.370> you

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
doing that scan before he pushes up you

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.400 
doing that scan before he pushes up you
know<00:03:55.390> what<00:03:55.570> when<00:03:55.810> you're<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.990> Terran<00:03:56.320> player

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
know what when you're a Terran player

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.750 
know what when you're a Terran player
you've<00:03:56.830> got<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.100> be<00:03:57.190> worried<00:03:57.430> about<00:03:57.490> those

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
you've got to be worried about those

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.670 
you've got to be worried about those
those<00:03:58.209> burrowed<00:03:58.570> banelings<00:03:58.780> because<00:03:59.530> if

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
those burrowed banelings because if

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.930 
those burrowed banelings because if
they're<00:03:59.830> underneath<00:04:00.130> there<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.610> they<00:04:00.670> pop<00:04:00.880> up

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
they're underneath there and they pop up

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.610 
they're underneath there and they pop up
that<00:04:01.540> could<00:04:01.780> be<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.959> end<00:04:01.990> of<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.200> game<00:04:02.230> right

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
that could be the end of the game right

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.500 
that could be the end of the game right
there<00:04:02.740> so<00:04:02.950> he<00:04:03.130> is<00:04:03.160> doing<00:04:03.520> a<00:04:03.610> fantastic<00:04:03.970> job<00:04:04.180> at

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
there so he is doing a fantastic job at

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.560 
there so he is doing a fantastic job at
scanning<00:04:05.500> before<00:04:05.830> he<00:04:06.010> moves<00:04:06.310> up<00:04:06.550> and<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:07.390> looks

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
scanning before he moves up and it looks

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.330 
scanning before he moves up and it looks
like<00:04:07.750> these<00:04:07.840> mutants<00:04:08.290> are<00:04:08.410> going<00:04:08.680> down<00:04:08.860> of

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
like these mutants are going down of

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.820 
like these mutants are going down of
course<00:04:09.700> these<00:04:10.030> creeps<00:04:10.420> saw<00:04:10.959> that<00:04:11.170> this<00:04:11.350> this

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
course these creeps saw that this this

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.110 
course these creeps saw that this this
command<00:04:12.040> center<00:04:12.310> was<00:04:12.430> floating<00:04:12.760> down<00:04:12.850> so<00:04:13.000> he's

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
command center was floating down so he's

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.230 
command center was floating down so he's
going<00:04:13.239> to<00:04:13.300> try<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.510> go<00:04:13.630> over<00:04:13.780> there<00:04:13.900> juice

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
going to try to go over there juice

mean<00:06:04.970> as<00:06:05.150> we<00:06:05.300> can<00:06:05.420> see<00:06:05.600> almost<00:06:05.900> doubling

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
mean as we can see almost doubling

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.860 
mean as we can see almost doubling
traits<00:06:07.130> and<00:06:07.310> economy<00:06:07.790> right<00:06:07.970> now<00:06:08.030> and<00:06:08.480> almost

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
traits and economy right now and almost

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.200 
traits and economy right now and almost
tripling<00:06:09.380> him<00:06:09.770> in<00:06:09.890> gas<00:06:10.130> there<00:06:10.790> is<00:06:10.970> virtually

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
tripling him in gas there is virtually

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.320 
tripling him in gas there is virtually
no<00:06:11.510> reason<00:06:12.140> why<00:06:12.590> disk<00:06:13.070> should<00:06:13.580> not<00:06:13.790> absolutely

Troy cesare me coming down here to try
and<00:07:15.500> defend<00:07:15.830> this<00:07:16.070> expansion<00:07:16.520> but<00:07:17.150> you<00:07:17.240> know

and defend this expansion but you know
what<00:07:17.630> i<00:07:17.810> think<00:07:17.900> we're<00:07:18.440> probably<00:07:18.470> oh<00:07:18.890> there's

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 
what i think we're probably oh there's

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.430 
what i think we're probably oh there's
the<00:07:19.340> brood<00:07:19.580> lords<00:07:19.940> this<00:07:20.510> is<00:07:20.690> not<00:07:20.900> going<00:07:21.170> to<00:07:21.290> end

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 
the brood lords this is not going to end

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.720 
the brood lords this is not going to end
well<00:07:21.560> i<00:07:21.830> think<00:07:21.920> he<00:07:22.100> also<00:07:22.280> might<00:07:22.550> have

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:22.730 
well i think he also might have

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.910 
well i think he also might have
ultralisks<00:07:23.270> come<00:07:23.600> out<00:07:23.780> I<00:07:24.020> think<00:07:24.560> he<00:07:24.620> just<00:07:24.740> had

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:24.920 
ultralisks come out I think he just had

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.710 
ultralisks come out I think he just had
four<00:07:25.280> built<00:07:25.610> if<00:07:25.790> I<00:07:25.880> saw<00:07:26.030> in<00:07:26.150> the<00:07:26.210> production's

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 
four built if I saw in the production's

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.780 
four built if I saw in the production's
tab<00:07:26.930> so<00:07:27.440> this<00:07:27.650> is<00:07:27.860> not<00:07:28.070> going<00:07:28.400> to<00:07:28.490> end<00:07:28.700> well

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:28.790 
tab so this is not going to end well
