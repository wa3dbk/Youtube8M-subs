Jefferson film has it is a curve door
opening<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.180> its<00:00:42.329> radius<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.440> see

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
opening and on its radius you can see

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.700 
opening and on its radius you can see
that<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.579> space<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.059> will<00:00:45.629> really<00:00:46.379> get<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that this space here will really get a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.160 
that this space here will really get a
lot<00:00:47.039> closer<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.879> open<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.180> door<00:00:48.450> nice

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
lot closer as we open the door nice

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.150 
lot closer as we open the door nice
solution<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> very<00:00:50.989> complex<00:00:51.989> door<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
solution to a very complex door and it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.590 
solution to a very complex door and it
take<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.670> show<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.210> some<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
take you up and show you some of the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.209 
take you up and show you some of the
details<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.320> door<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.739> take<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
details of this door and take on the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.139 
details of this door and take on the
inside<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.149> inside<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> store

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
inside to the inside of the store

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.209 
inside to the inside of the store
looking<00:01:00.149> at<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> detail<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.289> door<00:01:01.559> there

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
looking at the detail of this door there

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.680 
looking at the detail of this door there
was<00:01:02.340> two<00:01:02.550> challenges<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.329> kind<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.539> want

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
was two challenges that I kind of want

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.289 
was two challenges that I kind of want
to<00:01:03.750> point<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.769> first<00:01:05.010> one<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.820> need

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
to point out the first one was the need

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.570 
to point out the first one was the need
for<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> door<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.070> doorstop<00:01:08.070> when<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
for the door to have a doorstop when it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.280 
for the door to have a doorstop when it
was<00:01:08.700> coming<00:01:09.000> out<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.630> keep<00:01:09.840> going

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
was coming out and not just keep going

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.100 
was coming out and not just keep going
and<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.979> other<00:01:11.100> was<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.340> physical<00:01:12.180> aspect<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and the other was the physical aspect of

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.950 
and the other was the physical aspect of
having<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.439> curved<00:01:13.770> or<00:01:14.100> go<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:15.570> we've<00:01:15.750> got

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
having a curved or go in what we've got

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.070 
having a curved or go in what we've got
is<00:01:16.200> we've<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> door<00:01:17.310> stop<00:01:17.610> dropping<00:01:18.119> so

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
is we've got the door stop dropping so

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.600 
is we've got the door stop dropping so
then<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.290> don't<00:01:19.380> trip<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.040> when<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> go<00:01:20.400> in

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
then you don't trip on it when you go in

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.580 
then you don't trip on it when you go in
but<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.299> always<00:01:21.450> wanted<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> bring<00:01:22.229> your

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
but I always wanted you to bring your

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.740 
but I always wanted you to bring your
attention<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.610> aspect<00:01:23.939> right<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:24.509> so

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
attention to this aspect right here so

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.539 
attention to this aspect right here so
close<00:01:25.110> they<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.409> together<00:01:25.619> because<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> door

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
close they are together because the door

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.210 
close they are together because the door
to<00:01:26.640> actually<00:01:26.970> get<00:01:27.270> closer<00:01:27.720> together<00:01:28.080> as<00:01:28.500> they

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
to actually get closer together as they

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.370 
to actually get closer together as they
move<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.850> their<00:01:30.030> radius<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.079> pretty

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
move in on their radius so pretty

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.060 
move in on their radius so pretty
interesting<00:01:32.180> solution<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.390> both<00:01:33.540> problems

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
doors we also have a issue of having

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.510 
doors we also have a issue of having
ventilation<00:01:46.030> in<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.270> house<00:01:47.159> well<00:01:48.159> we<00:01:48.250> chose

ventilation in the house well we chose

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.100 
ventilation in the house well we chose
to<00:01:48.670> do<00:01:48.790> is<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.090> rather<00:01:49.270> than<00:01:49.479> looking<00:01:49.840> through

to do is the rather than looking through

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.170 
to do is the rather than looking through
the<00:01:50.259> screen<00:01:50.619> all<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.950> time<00:01:51.130> you<00:01:51.729> kind<00:01:52.000> of<00:01:52.030> came

the screen all the time you kind of came
up<00:01:52.300> with<00:01:52.450> this<00:01:52.540> idea<00:01:52.720> you<00:01:53.440> know<00:01:53.560> when<00:01:53.800> I<00:01:53.830> wore<00:01:54.250> a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
up with this idea you know when I wore a

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.370 
up with this idea you know when I wore a
little<00:01:54.520> bit<00:01:54.610> Marcy<00:01:55.180> just<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:55.990> stage
