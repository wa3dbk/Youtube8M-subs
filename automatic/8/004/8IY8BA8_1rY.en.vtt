this guy has a crazy trait for his
damaged<00:03:44.709> power<00:03:44.910> essentially<00:03:45.910> what<00:03:46.120> it's

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
damaged power essentially what it's

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.060 
damaged power essentially what it's
saying<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:47.080> can<00:03:47.290> make<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.920> can

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
target a square up too far away that's

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.050 
target a square up too far away that's
his<00:03:50.110> range<00:03:50.320> value<00:03:50.769> and<00:03:50.950> make<00:03:51.550> an<00:03:51.640> attack<00:03:51.880> on

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
his range value and make an attack on

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.340 
his range value and make an attack on
that<00:03:52.239> square<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:52.630> you're<00:03:52.750> going<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.900> roll<00:03:52.959> just

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
that square so you're going to roll just

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.680 
that square so you're going to roll just
like<00:03:53.530> normal<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.040> then<00:03:54.610> every<00:03:55.239> character

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
like normal and then every character

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.840 
like normal and then every character
that's<00:03:55.900> in<00:03:56.080> that<00:03:56.290> line<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.680> fire<00:03:56.890> four<00:03:57.550> squares

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
that's in that line of fire four squares

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.699 
that's in that line of fire four squares
away<00:03:57.970> or<00:03:58.300> adjacent<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:58.930> line<00:03:59.110> of<00:03:59.140> fire<00:03:59.440> is

away or adjacent to that line of fire is

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.830 
away or adjacent to that line of fire is
going<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.040> be<00:04:00.160> compared<00:04:00.580> to<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.880> roll<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.269> now

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
going to be compared to the roll and now

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.210 
going to be compared to the roll and now
if<00:04:02.050> they're<00:04:02.230> in<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:02.410> line<00:04:02.799> they're<00:04:03.040> going<00:04:03.160> to

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
if they're in that line they're going to

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.650 
if they're in that line they're going to
take<00:04:03.400> three<00:04:03.730> if<00:04:03.850> they're<00:04:04.060> hit<00:04:04.239> if<00:04:04.450> they're

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
take three if they're hit if they're

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.630 
take three if they're hit if they're
outside<00:04:05.170> adjacent<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.010> that<00:04:06.220> line<00:04:06.459> they're

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
outside adjacent to that line they're

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.729 
outside adjacent to that line they're
going<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:06.850> take<00:04:06.970> one<00:04:07.269> and<00:04:07.480> so<00:04:08.350> what<00:04:08.500> makes<00:04:08.620> this

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
going to take one and so what makes this

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.800 
going to take one and so what makes this
power<00:04:09.010> really<00:04:09.610> pretty<00:04:09.850> crazy<00:04:10.180> doesn't<00:04:10.540> matter

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
power really pretty crazy doesn't matter

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.090 
power really pretty crazy doesn't matter
if<00:04:10.930> he's<00:04:11.049> base<00:04:11.320> doesn't<00:04:11.650> matter<00:04:11.890> just

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
if he's base doesn't matter just

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.220 
if he's base doesn't matter just
hindering<00:04:12.549> up<00:04:12.910> in<00:04:13.209> there<00:04:13.330> four<00:04:13.570> squares<00:04:13.900> he's

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
hindering up in there four squares he's

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.480 
hindering up in there four squares he's
still<00:04:14.470> going<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.650> make<00:04:14.770> the<00:04:14.890> attack<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.430> it's

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
still going to make the attack and it's

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.340
