the other things you've trained in
through<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.870> years<00:01:48.110> well<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.440> know<00:01:48.590> our

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
through the years well you know our

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.670 
through the years well you know our
Western<00:01:49.730> horses<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.450> hundred<00:01:50.780> horses<00:01:51.050> we

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
Western horses and hundred horses we

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.500 
Western horses and hundred horses we
always<00:01:52.040> use<00:01:52.250> basic<00:01:52.850> even<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.390> English

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
always use basic even the English

pleasure horses always use basic

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.150 
pleasure horses always use basic
dressage<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:56.990> my<00:01:57.170> beginning<00:01:57.710> three-year-old

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
dressage so my beginning three-year-old

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.580 
dressage so my beginning three-year-old
Western<00:01:58.490> horses<00:01:58.760> could<00:01:59.120> do<00:01:59.300> basic<00:02:00.200> dressage

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
Western horses could do basic dressage

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.470 
Western horses could do basic dressage
maneuvers<00:02:01.190> or<00:02:01.220> training<00:02:01.670> level<00:02:02.120> dressage

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
maneuvers or training level dressage

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.290 
maneuvers or training level dressage
anyway<00:02:03.470> so<00:02:03.830> we<00:02:04.010> we've<00:02:04.640> been<00:02:04.670> using<00:02:05.060> this

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
anyway so we we've been using this

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.830 
anyway so we we've been using this
forever<00:02:06.040> in<00:02:07.040> our<00:02:07.280> training<00:02:07.730> methods<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.300> love

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
forever in our training methods and love

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.420 
forever in our training methods and love
it<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.170> then<00:02:09.350> when<00:02:09.500> we<00:02:09.619> got<00:02:09.740> hooked<00:02:09.950> up<00:02:10.160> with<00:02:10.310> a

it and then when we got hooked up with a
time<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:11.210> was<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.360> very<00:02:11.480> good<00:02:11.810> friend<00:02:11.960> of<00:02:12.230> mine

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
time it was a very good friend of mine

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.640 
time it was a very good friend of mine
we<00:02:13.520> saw<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:14.060> whole<00:02:14.540> new<00:02:14.720> venue<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.410> world

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
we saw a whole new venue and world

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.560 
we saw a whole new venue and world
because<00:02:16.430> he's<00:02:16.640> using<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.330> as<00:02:17.450> an

in a Western corsage clinic something

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.720 
in a Western corsage clinic something
specifically<00:02:42.170> that's<00:02:42.860> changing<00:02:43.490> their

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
specifically that's changing their

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
experience with reports well you know we

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.730 
experience with reports well you know we
teach<00:02:46.760> them<00:02:46.940> basic<00:02:47.180> dressage<00:02:47.870> maneuvers<00:02:48.530> in

teach them basic dressage maneuvers in

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.130 
teach them basic dressage maneuvers in
the<00:02:49.010> very<00:02:49.250> beginning<00:02:49.430> we'll<00:02:50.360> do<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.660> circles

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
the very beginning we'll do the circles

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.630 
the very beginning we'll do the circles
till<00:02:51.380> they<00:02:51.500> can<00:02:51.650> actually<00:02:52.010> bend<00:02:52.280> their<00:02:52.459> horse

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
till they can actually bend their horse

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.699 
till they can actually bend their horse
on<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:52.940> circle<00:02:53.300> correctly<00:02:53.780> using<00:02:54.410> their

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
on the circle correctly using their

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.730 
on the circle correctly using their

rein<00:02:58.070> for<00:02:58.310> direction<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.090> we'll<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.170> from

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
rein for direction and we'll and from

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.770 
rein for direction and we'll and from
there<00:03:00.680> we'll<00:03:00.890> go<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.130> just<00:03:02.060> little<00:03:02.390> basic

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
there we'll go to just little basic

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.420 
there we'll go to just little basic
maneuvers<00:03:03.200> turn<00:03:03.410> on<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.650> floor<00:03:03.860> hand<00:03:04.130> turn<00:03:04.280> on

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
maneuvers turn on the floor hand turn on

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.760 
maneuvers turn on the floor hand turn on
the<00:03:04.520> haunches<00:03:04.940> shoulder<00:03:05.870> in<00:03:06.080> launches<00:03:06.590> end

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
the haunches shoulder in launches end

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.010 
the haunches shoulder in launches end
down<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:06.980> rail<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.640> then<00:03:08.120> we<00:03:08.300> combine<00:03:08.780> those

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
down a rail and then we combine those

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.520 
down a rail and then we combine those
maneuvers<00:03:10.000> into<00:03:11.000> larger<00:03:11.750> maneuvers<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.170> worry

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
maneuvers into larger maneuvers to worry

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.729 
maneuvers into larger maneuvers to worry
eventually<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.489> can<00:03:13.520> do<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.790> P<00:03:14.030> off<00:03:14.380> leg<00:03:15.380> yields

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
eventually you can do a P off leg yields

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.510 
eventually you can do a P off leg yields
on<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.340> Trotter<00:03:16.670> or<00:03:17.239> a<00:03:17.300> lope<00:03:17.709> into<00:03:18.709> your<00:03:18.860> can

kind<00:03:21.530> of<00:03:21.560> thing

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
kind of thing

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.370 
kind of thing
what<00:03:22.730> is<00:03:22.880> this<00:03:23.120> bringing<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.810> the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
what is this bringing to the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.930 
what is this bringing to the
because<00:03:24.920> I've<00:03:25.040> heard<00:03:25.250> people<00:03:25.520> talk<00:03:25.730> about

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
because I've heard people talk about

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.060 
because I've heard people talk about
this<00:03:26.360> as<00:03:26.570> actually<00:03:26.780> they're<00:03:27.560> encouraged

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
this as actually they're encouraged

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.950 
this as actually they're encouraged
about<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.640> isn't<00:03:29.390> what<00:03:29.660> it's<00:03:29.810> going<00:03:29.900> to

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
about this isn't what it's going to

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.320 
about this isn't what it's going to
bring<00:03:30.110> to<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.440> actual<00:03:31.090> biomechanics<00:03:32.090> of<00:03:32.210> the

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
bring to the actual biomechanics of the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.860 
bring to the actual biomechanics of the
workers

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
workers

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.510 
workers
well<00:03:33.050> it's<00:03:33.200> bringing<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.680> connection<00:03:34.310> between

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
well it's bringing a connection between

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.150 
well it's bringing a connection between
the<00:03:34.820> horse<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.210> the<00:03:35.270> rider<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:36.160> connection

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
the horse and the rider and connection

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.430 
the horse and the rider and connection
is<00:03:37.460> everything<00:03:37.970> if<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.750> hit<00:03:38.960> don't<00:03:39.170> have<00:03:39.410> a

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
is everything if you hit don't have a
