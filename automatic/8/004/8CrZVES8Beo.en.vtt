 recording legend after 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.480
 an attempt to quit the PC that almost 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.070
 it's good secret but luckily 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.320
 it was not the hard drive I did not lose anything 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.590
 and well he can fix it and here 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.119
 we are already with him with the new episode 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.450
 from the ronaldinho series 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.820
 we are going to the first game and you see how 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.230
 we have scored 10 goals 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.170
 is 20 to overcome the block of 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.900
 flamengo and good then in this episode 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.670
 we are going to touch the truth 2 good three 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.860
 teams the three teams that touch us 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.430
 they are quite original for what 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.809
 we are used to see for fifa 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.050
 and well, here you are seeing this 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:54.670
 team with a hybrid there of bundesliga 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.620
 the English league and serious and the truth then 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.120
 well, at least it's something different 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.000
 it's something you're not used to seeing 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.460
 is not something new do not play against the 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.809
 same always and well, it's new 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.640
 but good to ronaldinho gives 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.130
 exactly the same minute 18 and so on 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.750
 easy or you catch the ball to make a 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.510
 cow tail and stick it there stuck to 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.729
 stick and then run the chec but hey 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.300
 the flamengo centrals that was not 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.150
 very for the 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.540
 to make a great episode and the goalie 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.430
 you will not see either later 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.500
 they will give him cross a goal and good 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.610
 so 45 minute so we're going to go after 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.840
 Rest 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.940
 adriana is a spectacular play 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.800
 even those in fences but defense to 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.100
 final does not manage to take the one who 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.260
 appears as not ronaldinho with this 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.570
 gesture team instinct scorer who looks 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.979
 that he has in fifa and he gets 12 and 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.320
 well then after that occasion that you have 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.880
 seen there is going to end the game the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.000
 There really was not much more 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.800
 the people who are made to heat up the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.479
 head in making equipment of this style 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.420
 because they are usually the truth rivals 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.250
 quite strong and then well neither 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.830
 you can create many occasions and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.229
 well then let's go to the next 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.690
 We've already scored 12 goals 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.880
 8 to get to the last block that 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.070
 is the one from the athletic mineiro that's good 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.020
 Well, I really want to get to 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.060
 him because I have several bosses bought and 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.130
 so, well, let's play against 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.980
 this silver equipazo and you are watching 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.010
 with three is killers 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.030
 up front plus tom 4 and then 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.780
 well several all go dyck 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.940
 forster foster's tots and milton tots and 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.200
 Well, to begin with, I was the felipe 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.879
 there that will clear to the center what 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.739
 normal that you usually make felipe in a 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.480
 party in which in which he does not want 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.730
 stop or me what the fuck is what happens 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.340
 but good minute 45 ronaldinho 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.290
 appears there to put things 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.299
 tied and eyes because a 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.549
 golazo is the best goal they make me 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.720
 a lot of time there we see the ball pass 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.549
 so that the 20 the good that is going to 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.069
 escape makes me a dribble part on 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.640
 defense is going to go from the other and eye there 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.790
 for ronaldo shop or send my rival to 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:03.829
 by ice ronaldo chop so 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.329
 applaud the rival but well I do not know if it 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.769
 you have forgotten that you are ronaldinho 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.019
 well then it appears and hits the goal 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.510
 from 30 meters so good then 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.370
 tie two minutes 77 then the opponent 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.010
 was going to scratch a little I do not know why 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.980
 because he gave the extension at the beginning and 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.530
 extend the age profe that penaltis well 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.709
 that the match ended 2 to 2 but let's go the 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.299
 Bol that marked me the truth that as I say 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.170
 the best goal that I have scored in a lot 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:32.680
 time without center without pass without pitch 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.840
 just two dribbles a defense with 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.939
 with rupture of hip rupture in 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.950
 enter the nearest hospital that 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.799
 spectacular balls and well let's go to the 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.989
 last game and here you are seeing that 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.879
 is against a team of Dutch and 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.549
 then tádic a and without rapport here 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.470
 they are going to score me another goal is a little 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.180
 also error in the output of me and I do not know 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.849
 without felipe can do something more but beware 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.159
 there is tádic the mete shot from outside to the 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.230
 squad you are always in doubt that 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.909
 that goalie can do something more then to 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.500
 ronaldinho minute 15 then he will have it 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.000
 send it to the crossbar you will have put it 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.000
 more complicated that is there 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.730
 and the most complicated yet but good 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.890
 there he sent it to the crossbar and not the 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.519
 get put inside the goal and 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.959
 check and remove yourself from half blind that goes 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.299
 to ronaldinho that ronaldinho runs 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.430
 fifty and a few fifty and a lot of 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.100
 what you run tenor example you can stop 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.080
 that is totally useless and good for 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.380
 here we go and the extension minutes 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.230
 101 match and well then there for 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.050
 vary the removed took it out badly I lose it and 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.090
 Well, the friend felipe who is still in 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.680
 constant collaboration and good then there 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.390
 He told me to shut up and what can happen to you 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.180
 When you send someone because that silence 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.860
 the 17th minute appears to ronaldinho that 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.540
 you when you see it at the beginning before 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.250
 start the game says already this is the 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.960
 typical slow that nothing more than that base 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.550
 of dribble as good as the typical 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.169
 slow that only dribbling is stuck 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.419
 two goals and right now you're going to go 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.620
 to penalties because of him and good 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.300
 Well, there's going to be a batch here 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.770
 spectacular to me usually I do not know 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.470
 well they give penalties but hey you there 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.600
 DiPai will first remember that he me 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.730
 he scored 2-1 in extra time and sent me 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.760
 shut up Vice Adrián to the launching of 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.500
 penalty for me because 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.810
 and I did not want to throw it at the center what 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.670
 happens that as the indicator does not stop at 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.110
 I did not want to adjust it much 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.940
 and I was very focused and that's why I 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.980
 stopped there he's going to throw it to the center and 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.410
 up but it happened because I started to step 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.350
 high and went to the crossbar now goes the 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.210
 amigo gabriel on this occasion with cross 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.090
 under sticks and now yes that's where the 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.200
 I wanted to shoot the first penalty but 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.060
 I tell you that as it seems 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.210
 yellow can not adjust so much because 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.890
 I had options for him to go out and 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.100
 here with narcisse the unemployment 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:44.200
 obviously remember I'll come back to 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.960
 say what he told me to shut up after 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.310
 mark me in extra time and well then it goes 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.220
 to ronaldinho that obviously therefore 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.660
 the pulse trembles and he shoots the penalty very 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.990
 bad and it will almost be for the goalie but 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.940
 we go 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.190
 note the irony and well then it goes 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.860
 sneijder and now if I tell this one goes away 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.030
 to go to the center again and I do not know 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.860
 I feel very good about the penalties because 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.040
 I get to win the criminal things are 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.050
 that has the fifa and well, I do not know if 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.230
 it's the final calm because the truth is 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.660
 that I was quite comfortable after 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.550
 win the kid this he sent me to 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.710
 silenced after extra - time goal not 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.000
 he only marked him in 118 I think with 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.190
 ronaldinho but above all 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.070
 he won on penalties and he does not 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.720
 none so come on I think that better 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.620
 taste of what impossible to finish 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.660
 the episode and nothing then with 16 goals we 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.860
 we were only 4 to overcome this block 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.710
 and it's fine as usual favorite 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.270
 he likes video and nothing in the 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.830
 description you have my twitter rascanya 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.670
