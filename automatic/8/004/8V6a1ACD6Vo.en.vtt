 thing 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.959
 after I think that we are good 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.450
 first half we have opportunities 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.280
 unfortunately we are not at the bottom and 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.320
 then in the second half good 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.240
 the essential we do not let go we do not chop 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.860
 the piece and then 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.600
 final I think it's a good result 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.240
 the essential thing is not to have lost even 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.700
 if we could have left with three 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.650

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.850
