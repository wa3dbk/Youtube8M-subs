level 5 goblins
let's<00:00:40.559> begin<00:00:42.050> it<00:00:43.050> could<00:00:43.500> take<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> while<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
let's begin it could take a while to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.080 
let's begin it could take a while to
find<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.850> good<00:00:45.059> match<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.680> as<00:00:46.879> you<00:00:47.879> know

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
find a good match because as you know

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.910 
find a good match because as you know
goblins<00:00:48.690> only<00:00:49.020> go<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.620> resources<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
goblins only go to the resources and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:01.189 
goblins only go to the resources and
yeah<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:56.070> could<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.520> hard<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:57.199> get<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.440> 1<00:00:58.949> star<00:01:00.199> so

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
yeah it could be hard to get a 1 star so

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.920 
yeah it could be hard to get a 1 star so
let's<00:01:01.410> hope<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.890> best

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.680 

and<00:01:09.250> maybe<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:10.610> lightning<00:01:11.030> spell<00:01:11.420> could

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
and maybe that lightning spell could

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.230 
and maybe that lightning spell could
come<00:01:11.960> up<00:01:12.110> handy<00:01:14.229> cuz<00:01:15.640> Florida<00:01:16.640> can<00:01:16.850> castle
