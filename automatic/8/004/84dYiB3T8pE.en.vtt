00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
you do this three times so 3 times 4 is

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.280

12<00:02:42.200> we<00:02:42.350> do<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.530> 12<00:02:42.769> sets<00:02:43.010> okay<00:02:43.959> each<00:02:44.959> time

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
12 we do in 12 sets okay each time

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.509 
12 we do in 12 sets okay each time
remember<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:45.920> increase<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.610> weight<00:02:48.519> since

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
remember to increase the weight since

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.460 
remember to increase the weight since
this<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.880> very<00:02:50.150> strenuous<00:02:50.810> routine<00:02:51.200> it's

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
this is a very strenuous routine it's

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.410 
this is a very strenuous routine it's
very<00:02:51.620> important<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.220> drink<00:02:52.580> your<00:02:52.730> me<00:02:52.880> no<00:02:52.940> acids

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
very important to drink your me no acids

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.880 
very important to drink your me no acids
between<00:02:54.080> sets<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:54.650> also<00:02:54.980> flex<00:02:55.340> as<00:02:55.580> many<00:02:56.000> times

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
between sets and also flex as many times

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.920 
between sets and also flex as many times
so<00:02:57.890> between<00:02:58.160> these<00:02:58.400> back<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.880> back<00:02:58.910> sets<00:02:59.360> you

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
so between these back to back sets you

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.260 
so between these back to back sets you
should<00:03:00.170> basically<00:03:00.500> rashed<00:03:01.010> about<00:03:01.370> 30<00:03:01.670> seconds

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
should basically rashed about 30 seconds

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.750 
should basically rashed about 30 seconds
