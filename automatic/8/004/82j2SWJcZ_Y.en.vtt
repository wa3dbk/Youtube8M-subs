rocket science again if I can do it all
you<00:01:28.700> need<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:29.030> do<00:01:29.119> is<00:01:29.270> just<00:01:29.540> trace<00:01:30.020> an<00:01:30.200> outline

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
you need to do is just trace an outline

with a pencil a pen won't work and then

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.719 
with a pencil a pen won't work and then
you<00:01:34.790> could<00:01:35.030> cut<00:01:35.420> just<00:01:35.690> within<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.320> outline<00:01:36.800> so

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
you could cut just within the outline so

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.969 
you could cut just within the outline so
that<00:01:37.759> you<00:01:38.060> have<00:01:38.270> something<00:01:38.540> like<00:01:38.900> this<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:39.890> you

dust<00:02:13.400> these<00:02:13.670> sides<00:02:14.000> with<00:02:14.269> flour<00:02:14.570> we'll<00:02:15.380> take

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
dust these sides with flour we'll take

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.280 
dust these sides with flour we'll take
just<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.920> little<00:02:16.190> bit<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.400> flour<00:02:16.579> put<00:02:17.060> it

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
just a little bit of flour put it

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.940 
just a little bit of flour put it
somewhere<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:20.170> then<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.350> want<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.709> shake

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
somewhere and then you want to shake

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.449 
somewhere and then you want to shake
this<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.870> then<00:02:23.870> we<00:02:24.019> want<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.530> tiny<00:02:25.130> bit<00:02:25.310> of

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
this and then we want this tiny bit of

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.630 
this and then we want this tiny bit of
flour<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.940> coat<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.360> sides<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.959> this<00:02:27.160> pan<00:02:28.160> so

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
flour to coat the sides of this pan so

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.390 
flour to coat the sides of this pan so
now<00:02:28.820> this<00:02:29.060> pan<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.600> now<00:02:29.810> coated<00:02:30.739> with<00:02:31.070> flour

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
now this pan is now coated with flour

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.660 
now this pan is now coated with flour
and<00:02:31.670> it's<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.720> really<00:02:33.320> thin<00:02:33.769> film<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.160> flour

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
and it's a really thin film of flour

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.880 
and it's a really thin film of flour
here<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.360> do<00:02:35.480> not<00:02:35.600> want<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:36.170> lot<00:02:36.380> of<00:02:36.500> flour<00:02:36.709> here

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
here you do not want a lot of flour here

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.039 
here you do not want a lot of flour here
or<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.489> going<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.730> make<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.360> crust<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.870> your

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
or it is going to make the crust of your

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.039 
or it is going to make the crust of your
cake<00:02:39.920> really<00:02:40.130> thick<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:40.910> unappealing<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:41.959> you

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
cake really thick and unappealing so you

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.550 
cake really thick and unappealing so you
do<00:02:42.170> not<00:02:42.290> want<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.850> we<00:02:44.150> need<00:02:44.299> to<00:02:44.510> just<00:02:45.200> wrap

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
do not want that so we need to just wrap

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.440 
do not want that so we need to just wrap
it<00:02:45.590> against<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.160> counter<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:46.820> the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
it against the counter so that the

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.910 
it against the counter so that the
excess<00:02:47.690> flour<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.140> all<00:02:48.350> shaken<00:02:48.739> off<00:02:49.989> so<00:02:50.989> this

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
excess flour is all shaken off so this

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.300 
excess flour is all shaken off so this
is<00:02:52.160> your<00:02:52.610> raw<00:02:53.090> pan<00:02:53.989> which<00:02:54.320> has<00:02:54.500> been<00:02:54.709> lined<00:02:55.070> at

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
is your raw pan which has been lined at

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.150 
is your raw pan which has been lined at
the<00:02:55.489> bottom<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.060> flooded<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.870> sides<00:02:57.160> greased

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
the bottom and flooded the sides greased

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.949 
the bottom and flooded the sides greased
and<00:02:58.340> floured<00:02:58.400> at<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:58.940> sides<00:02:59.180> another

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
and floured at the sides another

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.940 
and floured at the sides another
alternative<00:03:00.500> would<00:03:00.680> be<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:01.100> just<00:03:01.459> spray<00:03:02.269> some

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
alternative would be to just spray some

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.650 
alternative would be to just spray some
baking<00:03:03.950> spray<00:03:04.220> like<00:03:04.519> this<00:03:04.700> on<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.030> sides<00:03:05.299> and

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
baking spray like this on the sides and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.170 
baking spray like this on the sides and
then<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.380> would<00:03:06.500> not<00:03:06.680> need<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.220> grease<00:03:07.970> or

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
then you would not need to grease or

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.720 
then you would not need to grease or
flour<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.660> sides<00:03:08.959> now<00:03:09.560> baking<00:03:10.010> spray<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.489> not

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
flour the sides now baking spray is not

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.340 
flour the sides now baking spray is not
only<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.269> mixture<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:12.579> fat<00:03:13.579> and<00:03:13.910> some<00:03:14.299> flour<00:03:14.600> so

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
only a mixture of fat and some flour so

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.500 
only a mixture of fat and some flour so
you<00:03:15.410> could<00:03:15.709> use<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.070> instead<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.430> greasing<00:03:17.359> and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
you could use it instead of greasing and

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.589 
you could use it instead of greasing and
flouring<00:03:17.900> your<00:03:18.049> tin

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.039 

and<00:03:25.319> when<00:03:26.189> we<00:03:26.310> bake<00:03:26.519> brownies<00:03:26.790> we<00:03:27.689> need<00:03:27.810> to

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
and when we bake brownies we need to

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.199 
and when we bake brownies we need to
line<00:03:28.469> the<00:03:28.680> pants<00:03:29.159> in<00:03:29.370> such<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.579> way<00:03:29.819> that<00:03:29.849> you

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
line the pants in such a way that you

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.119 
line the pants in such a way that you
will<00:03:30.329> be<00:03:30.359> able<00:03:30.629> to<00:03:30.900> lift<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.290> entire<00:03:31.439> brownies

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
will be able to lift the entire brownies

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.160 
will be able to lift the entire brownies
out<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.459> pan<00:03:32.700> after<00:03:33.180> they<00:03:33.510> cool<00:03:33.750> so<00:03:34.019> that

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
out of the pan after they cool so that

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.990 
out of the pan after they cool so that
he<00:03:34.260> could<00:03:34.409> cut<00:03:34.650> them<00:03:34.859> into<00:03:35.010> neat<00:03:35.219> squares<00:03:35.700> and

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
he could cut them into neat squares and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.420 
he could cut them into neat squares and
no<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.019> can't<00:03:37.379> invert<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.950> pan<00:03:38.099> of<00:03:38.250> brownies

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
no you can't invert the pan of brownies

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.149 
no you can't invert the pan of brownies
onto<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.090> rack<00:03:39.359> because<00:03:39.599> then<00:03:40.530> you'll<00:03:40.680> lose<00:03:40.920> the

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
onto a rack because then you'll lose the

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.429 
onto a rack because then you'll lose the
shiny<00:03:41.430> really<00:03:42.120> appealing<00:03:42.599> crust<00:03:42.989> on<00:03:43.170> top<00:03:43.200> of

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 
shiny really appealing crust on top of

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.679 
shiny really appealing crust on top of
the<00:03:43.530> brownies<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:44.939> is<00:03:45.090> how<00:03:45.239> we<00:03:45.299> line<00:03:45.659> a

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
the brownies so this is how we line a

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.839 
the brownies so this is how we line a
pan<00:03:46.019> for<00:03:46.319> baking<00:03:46.500> brownies<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.430> other<00:03:47.579> bars

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
pan for baking brownies and other bars

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.500 
pan for baking brownies and other bars
and<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:49.470> when<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:49.680> want<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:49.980> bake<00:03:50.099> brownies

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
and so when you want to bake brownies

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.440 
and so when you want to bake brownies
first<00:03:51.510> place<00:03:51.900> this<00:03:52.370> tin<00:03:53.370> on<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.969> baking

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
first place this tin on the baking

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.500 
first place this tin on the baking
parchment<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.670> then<00:03:56.670> trace<00:03:56.939> the<00:03:57.060> outline

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
parchment and then trace the outline

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:05.869 
parchment and then trace the outline
just<00:04:01.639> hold<00:04:02.639> this<00:04:02.760> up<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.209> make<00:04:03.720> sure<00:04:03.989> that<00:04:04.879> the

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
just hold this up to make sure that the

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.909 
just hold this up to make sure that the
parchment<00:04:06.480> comes<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.930> little<00:04:07.049> above<00:04:07.680> these

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
parchment comes a little above these

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:08.899 
parchment comes a little above these
sides<00:04:08.189> of<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.489> tin

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
sides of the tin

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.909 
sides of the tin
like<00:04:09.269> this<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.750> then<00:04:10.079> you<00:04:10.200> could<00:04:10.319> approximate

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
like this and then you could approximate

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:18.890 
like this and then you could approximate
where<00:04:11.129> you<00:04:11.250> could<00:04:11.569> cut<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.720> parchment<00:04:17.900> we'll

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
where you could cut the parchment we'll

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.710 
where you could cut the parchment we'll
just<00:04:19.109> fold<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.560> parchment<00:04:20.449> exactly<00:04:21.449> on<00:04:21.570> the

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
just fold the parchment exactly on the

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.779 
just fold the parchment exactly on the
lines<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.139> have<00:04:22.169> traced<00:04:25.160> and<00:04:26.160> then<00:04:26.400> remember

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
lines you have traced and then remember

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.969 
lines you have traced and then remember
there<00:04:26.970> are<00:04:27.090> multiple<00:04:27.509> ways<00:04:27.690> of<00:04:27.960> lining<00:04:28.740> tins

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
there are multiple ways of lining tins
