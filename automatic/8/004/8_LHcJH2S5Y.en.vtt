goals but this time it was a great
defensive<00:03:20.560> effort<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:22.480> substitute

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
defensive effort and the substitute

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.870 
defensive effort and the substitute
player<00:03:23.260> we<00:03:23.470> get<00:03:23.620> from<00:03:23.769> Czech<00:03:23.980> Republic<00:03:24.459> was<00:03:24.820> a

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
player we get from Czech Republic was a

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.120 
player we get from Czech Republic was a
striker<00:03:25.390> he's<00:03:25.900> not<00:03:26.140> better<00:03:26.440> than<00:03:26.590> my<00:03:26.769> striker

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
striker he's not better than my striker

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.120 
striker he's not better than my striker
so<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:28.030> said<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.019> know<00:03:29.200> what<00:03:29.440> he<00:03:29.799> could<00:03:29.950> be<00:03:30.100> a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
so I said you know what he could be a

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.830 
so I said you know what he could be a
substitute<00:03:30.760> player<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:31.150> that's<00:03:31.239> what<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.540> did

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
substitute player so that's what I did

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.140 
substitute player so that's what I did
after<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.380> game<00:03:32.680> I<00:03:32.739> had<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.100> unlock<00:03:33.459> Scotland

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
after that game I had to unlock Scotland

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.690 
after that game I had to unlock Scotland
because<00:03:34.510> before<00:03:34.989> we<00:03:35.230> can<00:03:35.410> go<00:03:35.560> play<00:03:35.829> Spain<00:03:36.250> we

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
because before we can go play Spain we

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.670 
because before we can go play Spain we
gotta<00:03:36.970> be<00:03:37.209> Scotland<00:03:37.720> at<00:03:37.810> least<00:03:37.959> one<00:03:38.200> more<00:03:38.380> time

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
gotta be Scotland at least one more time

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.879 
gotta be Scotland at least one more time
so<00:03:38.890> we<00:03:38.920> could<00:03:39.160> build<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.910> road<00:03:40.269> to<00:03:41.109> Spain<00:03:41.620> but

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
so we could build the road to Spain but

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.920 
so we could build the road to Spain but
before<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.400> we<00:03:42.579> played<00:03:42.790> Czech<00:03:43.000> Republic<00:03:43.569> for
