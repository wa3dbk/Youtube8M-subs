00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.970
 a new report empty granaries 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.309
 it's Saturday, May 24 today 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.349
 I visited in the first two I you 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.870
 tell me I did not find anything it was a 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.240
 huge fast trash stuff 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.619
 frankly to dump direction if 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.410
 I was in the sellers' place 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.539
 if I had found ps2 games but I 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.330
 you guessed the games in question 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.130
 it was fifa pes and game that more 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.510
 nobody even wants a euro fifty 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.689
 centimes me it's niet 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.009
 so I could visit a second one and 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.690
 I still found small 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.550
 things I'm still happy with my 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.290
 finds especially the last lock I 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.239
 you showed up in the end are you gone 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.190
 for this report empty attics 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.500
 sponsored by cash converters only 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.829
 never worn until the yellow bag at 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.530
 cash 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.600
 we start with a book for one euro 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.149
 but it amused me when I saw 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.390
 a threat stand and minotaur and 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.219
 especially slang paul I laughed when 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.430
 I saw that I asked you did 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.680
 how much a euro has hair what 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.149
 the rich widowed story the father of douglas 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.700
 has just remarried the difficult to 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.860
 conceal the name of his wife finally good 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.270
 the minotaur what is it ugly 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.020
 by cons you can as muscular as him 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.700
 too bad 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.200
 that's it for a euro that's 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.979
 frankly the joke of the day 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.759
 we continue with a game pc put in a 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.140
 case style aps so expand to 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.369
 the reverse is youtube 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.159
 so that's going to be okay going for a 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.729
 friend who is a fan of idiots poor case 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.040
 to the wishes of the styles 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:36.329
 on the other hand he had served a double 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.439
 casing but the game and in one cd the 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.820
 time I open watching oops 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.340
 look to know that I would have 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.979
 always so on the cdi scored zero 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.600
 dvd number 1 yielded 1 of 2 but the eye 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.270
 bequeathed nothing at all so I got 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.659
 so I think this game is playing what 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.219
 on a cd me not only him diot I 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.450
 do not even know the rules of the game me 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.920
 I know just magic the assembly is 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.149
 quickly pokemon pokemon I remember 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.170
 more rules do not remember against 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.829
 the magic the assembly 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.430
 and that's the 5 hl ha duel season of 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.190
 giants 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.319
 so that I already bought for 2 euros that 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.460
 it's not for me it's for a friend 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.250
 continue with 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.080
 games psp medievil resurrection at 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.420
 medievil years I remember medievil 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.680
 it was my first game on the psa the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.500
 very first of the cities tests it was 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.330
 good I do not know if the elections network 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.040
 is actually the first but not lead 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.270
 the pressure because his city not in 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.640
 the ps1 version this little mini games or the 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.350
 cie or there it makes me remember the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.100
 level of scarecrow with in the field 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.500
 and that it tells me nothing at all that either 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.750
 Well, we'll see it bluffed me for 2 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.610
 euros complete good condition but divine are 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.890
 thought game we go on with I 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.690
 found that a gamepad gamecube 3 euros 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.170
 and people go on board it's going to go wrong 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.030
 and in Arabic 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.300
 we continue with the joysticks with a 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.890
 pc bag of form ps2 I will go a big 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.630

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.640
 troch master a little rotten who me 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.720
 hurt the thumb by force 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.040
 to use so I took what was 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.120
 maybe who will be a little bit more 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.770
 handy for 2 euros 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.020
 I always protested for that too 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.080
 still walking we continue with a 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.150
 little game ds for 4 euros mark hurd ds 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.920
 so I try to recover because 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.290
 so we're on the ds games to 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.690
 many with my brothers and friends 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.370
 but I was gaby for example and suddenly 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.500
 we try to find the hands of emma 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.450
 in kart ds several copies for 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.300
 to be able to play more than one 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.980
 stuck with the broken mesh eg 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.170
