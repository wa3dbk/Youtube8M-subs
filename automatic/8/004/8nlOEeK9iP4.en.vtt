 Y 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.080
 the oil in your vacuum pump is what 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.020
 keeps pumping and not all oil for 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.420
 vacuum pump is created equal hi I am 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.100
 Paul again the oil in a pump 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.750
 of vacuum fulfills a number of roles 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.210
 different in the life of your pump 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.490
 empty and not all oils have the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.750
 physical and chemical properties 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.670
 necessary to give you the level of 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.760
 performance that you need for your 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.070
 vacuum pump 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.109
 the oil for ice vacuum pump 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.329
 since it is specially formulated in 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.190
 the us and has been tested under 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.500
 strict engineering measures and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.960
 Performance in vacuum pumps bolt 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.420
 and super ivac until it meets all 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.760
 the specifications 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.469
 the oil is made with components 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.269
 highly refined that have a 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.640
 unique combination of low pressure 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.859
 steam and moisture content along with 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.449
 a high boiling point and level of 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.880
 oxidation stability 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.860
 in other words it allows the bomb 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.690
 vacuum can reach vacuum levels 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.240
 deeper than most others 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.430
 oils in addition to lubricating your pump and 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.680
 absorb pollutants including 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.600
 humidity this means that the pump is going to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.060
 work better and more efficiently 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.429
 even after the pump heats up 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.289
 using a vacuum fluid extremely 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.330
 pure and clear means that you have a 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.610
 Integrated visual indicator of when it is 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.929
 time to change the oil the oil 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.700
 the ice vacuum pump since 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.770
 works independently of the type of 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.360
 oil used in the system can be 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.950
 use in any air unit 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.690
 conditioning or refrigeration 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.459
 any manufacturer and in any 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.399
 situation where a deep void is 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.990
 required last we can not stop 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.729
 talk about the pump oil 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.929
 empty without mentioning also the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.390
 Importance of changing the oil 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.549
 often as a vacuum pump 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.469
 does not have a filter the oil can be 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.710
 quickly saturate moisture and others 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.119
 contaminants these pollutants 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.859
 reduce the oil yield and 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.079
 the pump until you can no longer make a 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.369
 deep vacuum we recommend that 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.890
 get into the habit of changing the oil 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.259
 after each job that's all for 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.350
 now until the next thanks for your 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.350
 Attention
