watering fertilizing light temperature
and<00:00:36.630> humidity<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.290> then<00:00:37.680> there's<00:00:37.890> also

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.389 
out of the video so let's cover the
basics<00:00:44.309> first<00:00:44.579> light<00:00:45.360> they<00:00:45.840> love<00:00:46.230> nice<00:00:46.620> strong

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
basics first light they love nice strong

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.160 
basics first light they love nice strong
light<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.030> if<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.719> give<00:00:48.870> them<00:00:49.020> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
light so if you can give them a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.380 
light so if you can give them a
south-facing<00:00:49.410> window<00:00:50.160> citruses<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:51.030> going

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
south-facing window citruses are going

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.110 
south-facing window citruses are going
to<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.809> great<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:53.100> south-facing<00:00:53.309> window

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
to do great in a south-facing window

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.930 
to do great in a south-facing window
also<00:00:54.780> since<00:00:55.020> Larry's<00:00:55.500> orchids<00:00:55.860> plants<00:00:56.820> are

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
also since Larry's orchids plants are

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.959 
also since Larry's orchids plants are
all<00:00:57.210> dwarf<00:00:58.050> or<00:00:58.230> semi<00:00:58.559> dwarf<00:00:58.739> plants<00:00:59.550> they're

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.590 
carry them in and out and they're going
to<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:04.799> be<00:01:04.949> too<00:01:05.129> heavy<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.700> too<00:01:05.909> bulky<00:01:06.180> for

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
to not be too heavy and too bulky for

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.780 
to not be too heavy and too bulky for
you<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> carry<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.619> if<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.400> get<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.729> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
you to carry so if you can get it out to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.810 
you to carry so if you can get it out to
your<00:01:09.000> patio<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:10.110> even<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> couple<00:01:11.189> weeks<00:01:11.490> or<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
your patio for even a couple weeks or a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.789 
your patio for even a couple weeks or a
month<00:01:12.060> or<00:01:12.540> two<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.650> ideal

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
month or two it's going to be ideal

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.130 
month or two it's going to be ideal
because<00:01:14.340> nothing<00:01:14.820> beats<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.240> sunlight<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
because nothing beats the sunlight the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.249 
because nothing beats the sunlight the
strong<00:01:16.439> real<00:01:16.920> sunlight<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.049> also

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
strong real sunlight and then also

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.010 
strong real sunlight and then also
another<00:01:19.680> thing<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.520> when<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.630> comes<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
another thing is is when it comes to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.830 
another thing is is when it comes to
sunlight<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.920> get<00:01:23.100> heat<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.670> heat<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.630> so

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
sunlight you get heat and heat is so

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.230 
sunlight you get heat and heat is so
important<00:01:25.439> when<00:01:25.920> growing<00:01:26.250> your<00:01:26.460> orchids<00:01:26.909> they

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
important when growing your orchids they

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330 
important when growing your orchids they
do<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.900> cold<00:01:28.290> drafts<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.100> they<00:01:29.159> don't

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
do not like cold drafts and they don't

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.330 
do not like cold drafts and they don't
like<00:01:29.640> dry<00:01:30.090> air<00:01:30.509> they<00:01:31.140> are<00:01:31.380> growing<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.100> place

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
like dry air they are growing in a place

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.539 
like dry air they are growing in a place
that<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.759> humid<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.540> tropical<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.250> that's

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
that is humid and tropical and so that's

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.969 
that is humid and tropical and so that's
normally<00:01:36.060> warm<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.930> humid<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.619> they<00:01:37.710> like

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
normally warm and humid and they like

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.890 
normally warm and humid and they like
that<00:01:38.250> if<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.090> next<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.630> door<00:01:39.869> that

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
that if you have a next to a door that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.899 
that if you have a next to a door that
gets<00:01:40.229> some<00:01:40.500> cold<00:01:41.070> air<00:01:41.220> during<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> winter

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
gets some cold air during the winter

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.490 
gets some cold air during the winter
you're<00:01:42.420> going<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.750> notice<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.049> your<00:01:43.290> leaves

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
you're going to notice that your leaves

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
you're going to notice that your leaves
are<00:01:43.680> going<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.979> curl<00:01:44.280> upwards<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.939> drop

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
are going to curl upwards and drop

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.600 
are going to curl upwards and drop
that's<00:01:46.079> never<00:01:46.439> good<00:01:46.799> obviously<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.520> it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
that's never good obviously because it

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.859 
that's never good obviously because it
can<00:01:47.700> eventually<00:01:47.850> kill<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.420> plant<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.750> it's

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
can eventually kill the plant if it's

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.840 
can eventually kill the plant if it's
not<00:01:48.990> corrected<00:01:49.530> another<00:01:50.369> thing<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.729> people

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
not corrected another thing is people

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.380 
not corrected another thing is people
think<00:01:51.090> dry<00:01:51.840> warm<00:01:52.649> air<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.670> going<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.060> fine

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
think dry warm air is going to be fine

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.179 
think dry warm air is going to be fine
because<00:01:54.899> they<00:01:55.140> put<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.380> next<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.740> warm<00:01:56.009> air

because they put it next to a warm air

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.800 
because they put it next to a warm air
vent<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.579> they<00:01:56.640> think<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.299> warm<00:01:57.509> air

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
vent and they think they like warm air

vent and they think they like warm air
however<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.100> warm<00:01:59.850> air<00:02:00.000> coming<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.509> your

however the warm air coming out of your

however the warm air coming out of your
hot<00:02:00.869> air<00:02:01.049> vent<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.469> very<00:02:02.070> very<00:02:02.430> dry<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.240> that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
hot air vent is very very dry and that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.679 
hot air vent is very very dry and that
will<00:02:03.990> also<00:02:04.369> kill<00:02:05.369> these<00:02:05.670> plants<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.420> want<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
will also kill these plants you want to

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.919 
will also kill these plants you want to
make<00:02:06.810> sure<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:08.509> away<00:02:09.509> from<00:02:09.539> those

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
make sure that it's just away from those

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.290 
make sure that it's just away from those
places<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:10.860> much<00:02:11.039> as<00:02:11.190> possible<00:02:11.400> they're<00:02:11.970> very

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
places as much as possible they're very

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.280 
places as much as possible they're very
versatile<00:02:12.780> plants

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
versatile plants

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.559 
versatile plants
long<00:02:13.469> as<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.769> stick<00:02:14.489> away<00:02:14.640> from<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.090> very<00:02:15.299> few

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
long as you stick away from the very few

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.809 
long as you stick away from the very few
things<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.959> can<00:02:16.170> kill<00:02:16.409> them<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:17.579> another

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
things that can kill them so another

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.839 
things that can kill them so another
thing<00:02:17.879> is<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.569> when<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.290> comes<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.489> light

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
thing is is when it comes with the light

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.349 
thing is is when it comes with the light
and<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:22.950> temperature<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.120> humidity

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
and the the temperature is the humidity

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.240 
and the the temperature is the humidity
you<00:02:24.959> want<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.200> give<00:02:25.349> them<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> nice<00:02:25.769> humid

environment and I just try to replicate

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.559 
environment and I just try to replicate
it<00:02:40.859> as<00:02:41.010> much<00:02:41.159> as<00:02:41.310> possible<00:02:41.489> however<00:02:42.299> if<00:02:42.480> you

the nutrients out with it because of

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.990 
the nutrients out with it because of
that<00:03:33.599> so<00:03:34.250> one<00:03:35.250> way<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.579> we<00:03:35.729> like<00:03:35.970> to

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
that so one way that we like to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.569 
that so one way that we like to
fertilize<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:36.959> we<00:03:37.470> like<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.739> use<00:03:37.859> a<00:03:38.010> citrus

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
fertilize is we like to use a citrus

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.699 
fertilize is we like to use a citrus
specific<00:03:39.060> fertilizer<00:03:39.569> and<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.199> is<00:03:40.379> so

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
specific fertilizer and this is so

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.430 
specific fertilizer and this is so
crucial<00:03:41.120> because<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.359> fact<00:03:42.599> that<00:03:42.750> citrus

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
crucial because of the fact that citrus

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.710 
crucial because of the fact that citrus
is<00:03:43.739> have<00:03:44.010> very<00:03:44.430> specific<00:03:44.879> requirements<00:03:45.569> as<00:03:45.659> to

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
is have very specific requirements as to

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.140 
is have very specific requirements as to
a<00:03:46.590> lot<00:03:47.159> of<00:03:47.250> different<00:03:47.519> plants<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:47.849> don't

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
a lot of different plants that don't

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.909 
a lot of different plants that don't
citruses<00:03:48.959> are<00:03:49.199> one<00:03:49.349> of<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.500> few<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:49.889> you

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
citruses are one of the few that you

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.890 
citruses are one of the few that you
don't<00:03:50.280> want<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.519> give<00:03:50.699> just<00:03:51.449> any<00:03:51.720> old

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
don't want to give just any old

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.990 
don't want to give just any old
fertilizer<00:03:52.349> to<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:53.400> is<00:03:53.549> going<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.879> be

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
fertilizer to so this is going to be

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.330 
fertilizer to so this is going to be
good<00:03:54.209> we<00:03:54.930> carry<00:03:55.139> this<00:03:55.319> on<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.739> store<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.189> is

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
good we carry this on the store this is

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.309 
good we carry this on the store this is
a<00:03:56.370> grow<00:03:56.669> more<00:03:56.909> citrus<00:03:57.359> specific<00:03:57.840> fertilizer

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
a grow more citrus specific fertilizer

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.960 
a grow more citrus specific fertilizer
it's<00:03:58.919> going<00:03:59.189> to<00:03:59.250> also<00:03:59.400> be<00:03:59.639> good<00:03:59.729> for<00:03:59.790> your

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
it's going to also be good for your

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.289 
it's going to also be good for your
avocados<00:04:00.689> because<00:04:01.349> they<00:04:01.560> like<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.829> same

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
avocados because they like the same

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.390 
avocados because they like the same
grain<00:04:03.299> conditions<00:04:03.780> as<00:04:03.959> well<00:04:04.169> you<00:04:05.129> want<00:04:05.340> to

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
grain conditions as well you want to

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.240 
grain conditions as well you want to
make<00:04:05.489> sure<00:04:05.519> you<00:04:05.849> fertilize<00:04:06.720> about<00:04:07.650> every

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
make sure you fertilize about every

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.759 
make sure you fertilize about every
three<00:04:08.609> weeks<00:04:08.819> you<00:04:09.239> don't<00:04:09.389> want<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:10.049> let<00:04:10.620> them

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
three weeks you don't want to let them

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:11.749 
three weeks you don't want to let them
go<00:04:10.889> any<00:04:11.040> further<00:04:11.220> than<00:04:11.579> that

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:11.759 
go any further than that

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.219 
go any further than that
otherwise<00:04:12.389> you're<00:04:12.629> going<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.840> notice<00:04:13.019> that

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
otherwise you're going to notice that

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.170 
otherwise you're going to notice that
the<00:04:13.349> growth<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.709> going<00:04:13.859> to<00:04:13.949> slow<00:04:14.250> down<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:15.030> you

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
the growth is going to slow down and you

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.789 
the growth is going to slow down and you
might<00:04:15.299> even<00:04:15.449> have<00:04:15.659> some<00:04:15.689> lower<00:04:16.139> yellowing<00:04:16.680> of

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
might even have some lower yellowing of

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.710 
might even have some lower yellowing of
leaves<00:04:17.130> if<00:04:17.699> you<00:04:17.880> notice<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.389> your<00:04:18.539> leaves

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
leaves if you notice that your leaves

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.719 
leaves if you notice that your leaves
are<00:04:18.930> turning<00:04:19.199> yellow

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
are turning yellow

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.279 
are turning yellow
make<00:04:20.729> sure<00:04:21.030> however<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:21.659> it's<00:04:21.810> not<00:04:21.959> giving

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
make sure however that it's not giving

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.080 
make sure however that it's not giving
them<00:04:22.380> too<00:04:22.560> much<00:04:22.710> water<00:04:23.039> so<00:04:23.370> if<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.880> haven't

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
them too much water so if you haven't

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.029 
them too much water so if you haven't
been<00:04:24.300> giving<00:04:24.539> them<00:04:24.659> too<00:04:24.810> much<00:04:24.900> water<00:04:25.039> it's

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
been giving them too much water it's

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.200 
been giving them too much water it's
probably<00:04:26.279> fertilizer<00:04:26.700> make<00:04:27.060> sure

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
probably fertilizer make sure

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.540 
probably fertilizer make sure
you<00:04:27.330> fertilize<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:28.050> again<00:04:28.800> we<00:04:28.979> do<00:04:29.100> carry<00:04:29.370> this

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
you fertilize and again we do carry this

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.430 
you fertilize and again we do carry this
in<00:04:29.789> a<00:04:30.000> small<00:04:30.630> container<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.229> large

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.279 
container on lorries Larry's Orcas calm
and<00:04:34.560> then<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.400> last<00:04:35.610> thing<00:04:35.910> is<00:04:36.120> watering<00:04:37.020> so

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
and then the last thing is watering so

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:38.870 
and then the last thing is watering so
we<00:04:37.380> touched<00:04:37.590> on<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:37.800> briefly<00:04:37.979> with<00:04:38.610> the

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
we touched on it briefly with the

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.909 
we touched on it briefly with the
fertilizing<00:04:39.840> but<00:04:40.259> you<00:04:40.380> want<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.560> make<00:04:40.710> sure

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
fertilizing but you want to make sure

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.610 
fertilizing but you want to make sure
that<00:04:41.099> you<00:04:41.220> give<00:04:41.490> them<00:04:41.699> good<00:04:42.180> water<00:04:42.660> they<00:04:43.289> like

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
that you give them good water they like

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.339 
that you give them good water they like
to<00:04:43.889> be<00:04:44.069> fed<00:04:44.310> alot<00:04:45.060> since<00:04:45.300> they're<00:04:45.509> subtropical

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
to be fed alot since they're subtropical

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.740 
to be fed alot since they're subtropical
they<00:04:46.500> get<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.680> lot<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:46.860> rain<00:04:47.160> however<00:04:48.030> the

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
they get a lot of rain however the

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.770 
they get a lot of rain however the
potting<00:04:49.620> soil<00:04:49.860> also<00:04:50.400> drains<00:04:50.759> very<00:04:51.240> freely<00:04:51.569> as

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
potting soil also drains very freely as

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.990 
potting soil also drains very freely as
well<00:04:51.960> so<00:04:52.169> put<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.500> saucer<00:04:53.099> or<00:04:53.550> something<00:04:53.910> to

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
well so put a saucer or something to

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.850 
well so put a saucer or something to
catch<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.449> water<00:04:54.630> on<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.960> bottom<00:04:55.289> but<00:04:55.710> make

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
catch the water on the bottom but make

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.499 
catch the water on the bottom but make
sure<00:04:55.889> that<00:04:56.130> it<00:04:56.430> flows<00:04:56.789> through<00:04:56.819> the<00:04:57.180> bottom

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
sure that it flows through the bottom

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.710 
sure that it flows through the bottom
pretty<00:04:57.750> regularly<00:04:58.289> just<00:04:58.590> because<00:04:59.340> the<00:05:00.000> if<00:05:00.509> you

you let that dry out it's going to

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.420 
you let that dry out it's going to
stress<00:05:09.449> the<00:05:09.599> plant<00:05:09.720> out<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:11.009> plant<00:05:11.250> will

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
stress the plant out and the plant will

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.400 
stress the plant out and the plant will
only<00:05:11.639> grow<00:05:12.000> as<00:05:12.180> much<00:05:12.360> as<00:05:12.539> the<00:05:12.660> root<00:05:12.840> system<00:05:13.199> can

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
only grow as much as the root system can

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.230 
only grow as much as the root system can
sustain<00:05:13.830> since<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.430> root<00:05:14.610> system<00:05:15.000> is<00:05:15.120> the

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
sustain since the root system is the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.420 
sustain since the root system is the
heart<00:05:15.419> of<00:05:15.539> the<00:05:15.599> plant<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:17.130> last<00:05:17.310> thing

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.680 
heart of the plant and the last thing
I'm<00:05:17.520> going<00:05:17.639> to<00:05:17.699> specify<00:05:17.849> that<00:05:18.150> I<00:05:18.419> think<00:05:18.630> I

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
I'm going to specify that I think I

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.779 
I'm going to specify that I think I
forgot<00:05:18.900> is<00:05:19.340> temperature<00:05:20.340> you<00:05:20.490> want<00:05:20.639> to<00:05:20.699> make

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
forgot is temperature you want to make

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.969 
forgot is temperature you want to make
sure<00:05:20.820> that<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.240> temperature<00:05:21.750> stays<00:05:22.169> pretty

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
sure that the temperature stays pretty

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.189 
sure that the temperature stays pretty
warm<00:05:23.520> however<00:05:24.240> they<00:05:24.360> are<00:05:24.509> more<00:05:24.720> versatile

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
warm however they are more versatile

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.050 
warm however they are more versatile
than<00:05:25.349> most<00:05:25.680> plants<00:05:26.250> are<00:05:26.340> that<00:05:26.580> are<00:05:26.669> in<00:05:26.909> the

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
than most plants are that are in the

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.490 
than most plants are that are in the
tropical<00:05:27.630> kind<00:05:28.199> of<00:05:28.819> group<00:05:29.819> here<00:05:30.240> so<00:05:30.479> when<00:05:31.470> you

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
tropical kind of group here so when you

tropical kind of group here so when you
are<00:05:31.830> growing<00:05:32.159> your<00:05:32.340> tropicals<00:05:33.090> you<00:05:33.330> want<00:05:33.509> to

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
are growing your tropicals you want to

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.249 
are growing your tropicals you want to
make<00:05:33.720> sure<00:05:33.930> that<00:05:34.080> they<00:05:34.259> stay<00:05:34.490> around<00:05:35.810> 75<00:05:36.810> to<00:05:36.840> 80

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
make sure that they stay around 75 to 80

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.860 
make sure that they stay around 75 to 80
degrees<00:05:37.800> however<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:38.820> subtropical<00:05:39.659> plant

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
degrees however this subtropical plant

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.020 
degrees however this subtropical plant
is<00:05:40.020> a<00:05:40.050> great<00:05:40.560> plant<00:05:41.280> to<00:05:41.490> grow<00:05:41.610> if<00:05:42.000> you

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
is a great plant to grow if you

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.629 
is a great plant to grow if you
sometimes<00:05:42.690> have<00:05:43.469> temperature<00:05:44.130> swings<00:05:44.430> that

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
sometimes have temperature swings that

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.909 
sometimes have temperature swings that
can<00:05:44.789> go<00:05:44.880> down<00:05:45.000> into<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.300> 60s<00:05:45.690> and<00:05:45.840> 50s<00:05:46.020> they

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
can go down into the 60s and 50s they

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.980 
can go down into the 60s and 50s they
don't<00:05:47.219> like<00:05:47.430> it<00:05:47.580> any<00:05:47.699> colder<00:05:48.180> than<00:05:48.330> 40<00:05:48.870> and

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
don't like it any colder than 40 and

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.749 
don't like it any colder than 40 and
they<00:05:49.409> shouldn't<00:05:49.860> be<00:05:49.949> sustained<00:05:50.520> at<00:05:50.639> that

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
they shouldn't be sustained at that

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:52.129 
they shouldn't be sustained at that
temperature<00:05:51.210> for<00:05:51.240> more<00:05:51.539> than<00:05:51.659> a<00:05:51.719> couple<00:05:51.900> days

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
temperature for more than a couple days

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.170 
temperature for more than a couple days
however<00:05:52.860> they<00:05:53.130> won't<00:05:53.310> die<00:05:53.669> like<00:05:53.699> most

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
however they won't die like most

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.330 
however they won't die like most
tropicals<00:05:54.659> will<00:05:54.840> so<00:05:54.990> it's<00:05:55.139> a<00:05:55.199> great<00:05:55.680> thing<00:05:56.280> to

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
tropicals will so it's a great thing to

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.469 
tropicals will so it's a great thing to
grow<00:05:56.759> if<00:05:57.449> you<00:05:57.659> have<00:05:57.990> it<00:05:58.110> on<00:05:58.199> a<00:05:58.229> patio<00:05:58.530> and<00:05:59.479> and

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
grow if you have it on a patio and and

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.399 
grow if you have it on a patio and and
it<00:06:00.870> just<00:06:01.110> can<00:06:01.860> sway<00:06:02.250> from<00:06:02.509> you<00:06:03.509> know<00:06:03.599> maybe<00:06:03.780> 70

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.409 
it just can sway from you know maybe 70

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.420 
it just can sway from you know maybe 70
to<00:06:04.680> 60<00:06:05.159> or<00:06:05.340> 80<00:06:06.030> to<00:06:06.539> 50<00:06:07.020> those<00:06:07.889> rapid

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
to 60 or 80 to 50 those rapid

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.219 
to 60 or 80 to 50 those rapid
temperature<00:06:09.210> fluctuations<00:06:09.840> are<00:06:09.930> usually

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
temperature fluctuations are usually

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:11.749 
temperature fluctuations are usually
what<00:06:10.349> kills<00:06:10.590> plants<00:06:10.770> but<00:06:11.280> you<00:06:11.310> won't<00:06:11.550> find

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
what kills plants but you won't find

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.399 
what kills plants but you won't find
that<00:06:11.880> it'll<00:06:12.090> kill<00:06:12.240> these<00:06:12.449> because<00:06:12.900> they're

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
that it'll kill these because they're

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:15.230 
that it'll kill these because they're
used<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:13.770> it<00:06:13.979> and<00:06:14.130> that's<00:06:14.729> what<00:06:14.909> makes
