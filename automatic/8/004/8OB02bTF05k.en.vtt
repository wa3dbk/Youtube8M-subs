miles on enf freaked out so I know the
lines<00:05:07.190> and<00:05:07.930> how<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:08.990> car<00:05:09.320> should<00:05:09.530> feel<00:05:09.770> and

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
lines and how the car should feel and

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.430 
lines and how the car should feel and
sitting<00:05:10.190> circumstance<00:05:10.730> in<00:05:10.880> corners<00:05:11.330> so<00:05:11.540> yeah

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
sitting circumstance in corners so yeah

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.280 
sitting circumstance in corners so yeah
I<00:05:12.800> mean<00:05:13.040> I<00:05:13.250> think<00:05:13.430> if<00:05:14.060> I<00:05:14.210> met<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.390> second<00:05:14.780> set<00:05:15.020> and

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
I mean I think if I met a second set and

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.400 
I mean I think if I met a second set and
some<00:05:15.710> free<00:05:15.950> air<00:05:16.160> would<00:05:16.430> have<00:05:16.520> been<00:05:17.410> the

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
some free air would have been the

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.159 
some free air would have been the
perfect<00:05:19.360> opportunity<00:05:20.360> to<00:05:20.690> go<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:21.050> quicker

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
perfect opportunity to go the quicker

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.380 
perfect opportunity to go the quicker
this<00:05:21.980> is<00:05:22.100> a<00:05:22.130> fortune<00:05:22.520> and<00:05:22.610> just<00:05:22.760> go<00:05:22.910> traffic<00:05:23.150> in

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
this is a fortune and just go traffic in

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.230 
this is a fortune and just go traffic in
the<00:05:23.450> second<00:05:23.780> sector<00:05:23.960> but<00:05:24.580> yeah<00:05:25.580> went<00:05:25.850> with

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
the second sector but yeah went with

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.360 
the second sector but yeah went with
purple<00:05:26.840> sector<00:05:27.110> were<00:05:27.350> knifing<00:05:27.680> people<00:05:27.710> sector

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
purple sector were knifing people sector

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.510 
purple sector were knifing people sector
three<00:05:28.640> so<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.690> cars<00:05:29.960> fast<00:05:30.320> much<00:05:31.190> better<00:05:31.430> than

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
three so the cars fast much better than

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.600 
three so the cars fast much better than
what<00:05:31.669> was<00:05:31.850> last<00:05:32.060> year<00:05:32.330> so<00:05:33.370> just<00:05:34.370> all<00:05:34.490> about

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
what was last year so just all about

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.180 
what was last year so just all about
whoever<00:05:34.940> starting<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.270> recent<00:05:35.650> Saturday<00:05:36.650> to

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
whoever starting the recent Saturday to

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.520 
whoever starting the recent Saturday to
see<00:05:37.400> our<00:05:37.520> trouble<00:05:37.790> the<00:05:37.880> first<00:05:38.360> few<00:05:39.080> laps<00:05:39.290> the

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
see our trouble the first few laps the

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.129 
see our trouble the first few laps the
first<00:05:39.740> hour

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
first hour

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.790 
first hour
then<00:05:41.770> we<00:05:41.919> can<00:05:42.069> start<00:05:42.449> picking<00:05:43.449> off<00:05:43.539> people<00:05:43.900> but

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
then we can start picking off people but

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.860 
then we can start picking off people but
obviously<00:05:45.370> jumping<00:05:45.819> out<00:05:45.909> of<00:05:46.030> a<00:05:46.090> Down<00:05:46.569> falls

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
obviously jumping out of a Down falls

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.170 
obviously jumping out of a Down falls
car<00:05:47.110> into<00:05:47.469> a<00:05:47.499> gt3<00:05:48.159> it<00:05:48.669> must<00:05:48.849> be<00:05:48.969> quite

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
car into a gt3 it must be quite

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.300 
car into a gt3 it must be quite
difficult<00:05:49.389> to<00:05:49.830> differentiate<00:05:50.830> different

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
difficult to differentiate different

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.890 
difficult to differentiate different
driving<00:05:51.520> styles<00:05:52.029> different<00:05:52.240> techniques<00:05:52.689> to

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
driving styles different techniques to

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.749 
driving styles different techniques to
actually<00:05:53.020> drive<00:05:53.710> the<00:05:53.860> car<00:05:54.069> both<00:05:54.340> cars<00:05:54.610> so

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
actually drive the car both cars so

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:55.830 
actually drive the car both cars so
they're<00:05:54.879> all<00:05:54.999> term<00:05:55.180> how<00:05:55.300> do<00:05:55.360> you<00:05:55.509> adjust<00:05:55.719> to

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
they're all term how do you adjust to

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.980 
they're all term how do you adjust to
that<00:05:55.990> well<00:05:56.409> I<00:05:56.439> think<00:05:56.529> it<00:05:56.830> was<00:05:57.360> wasn't<00:05:58.360> that<00:05:58.419> big

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
that well I think it was wasn't that big

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.529 
that well I think it was wasn't that big
of<00:05:59.020> a<00:05:59.169> deal<00:05:59.319> because<00:05:59.560> i<00:06:00.069> was<00:06:00.610> looking<00:06:01.029> to<00:06:01.120> do<00:06:01.240> dt

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
of a deal because i was looking to do dt

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.719 
of a deal because i was looking to do dt
last<00:06:01.749> year<00:06:01.990> so<00:06:02.110> i<00:06:02.139> know<00:06:02.469> the<00:06:02.860> general<00:06:03.129> gist<00:06:03.580> of

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
last year so i know the general gist of

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.089 
last year so i know the general gist of
how<00:06:03.909> to<00:06:03.969> do<00:06:04.270> things<00:06:04.479> and<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:05.050> fact<00:06:05.409> that<00:06:05.529> you

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
how to do things and the fact that you

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.679 
how to do things and the fact that you
have<00:06:06.279> to<00:06:06.460> move<00:06:06.610> the<00:06:06.669> way<00:06:06.909> around<00:06:07.060> to<00:06:07.330> get<00:06:07.539> the

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:07.689 
have to move the way around to get the

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:10.379 
have to move the way around to get the
car<00:06:07.949> pointed<00:06:08.949> where<00:06:09.129> you<00:06:09.189> wanted<00:06:09.460> to<00:06:09.490> go<00:06:09.610> so<00:06:10.120> i

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
car pointed where you wanted to go so i

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.899 
car pointed where you wanted to go so i
think<00:06:10.659> it<00:06:10.870> would<00:06:10.960> be<00:06:11.110> more<00:06:11.139> difficult<00:06:11.909> had

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
think it would be more difficult had

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.670 
think it would be more difficult had
I've<00:06:13.060> done<00:06:13.240> single-seaters<00:06:13.930> last<00:06:14.169> year<00:06:14.439> and

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
I've done single-seaters last year and
