minecraft tutorial today we're gonna be
learning<00:00:11.280> how<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.550> build<00:00:11.910> well<00:00:12.750> I've<00:00:12.809> got<00:00:12.960> two

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
learning how to build well I've got two

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.110 
learning how to build well I've got two
different<00:00:13.469> versions<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.160> puddle<00:00:14.820> jumping

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
different versions of the puddle jumping

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.660 
different versions of the puddle jumping
from<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> Stargate<00:00:15.750> Atlantis<00:00:15.900> series<00:00:16.800> so

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
from the Stargate Atlantis series so

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.210 
from the Stargate Atlantis series so
I've<00:00:17.760> got<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> smaller<00:00:18.210> one<00:00:18.420> which<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.900> more

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
I've got a smaller one which is more

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.320 
I've got a smaller one which is more
this<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> cloak<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.760> kind<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.119> closer

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
this is the cloak that kind of closer

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.849 
this is the cloak that kind of closer
one<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> actual<00:00:22.109> scale<00:00:22.380> where<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.710> can

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
one to the actual scale where you can

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.500 
one to the actual scale where you can
actually<00:00:23.100> walk<00:00:23.250> around<00:00:23.400> but<00:00:24.150> if<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.300> go<00:00:24.420> on

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
actually walk around but if you go on

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.390 
actually walk around but if you go on
the<00:00:24.630> inside<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.199> only<00:00:25.320> got<00:00:25.500> one<00:00:25.710> side<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.340> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the inside it's only got one side of the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.830 
the inside it's only got one side of the
bench<00:00:26.580> isn't<00:00:26.789> sand<00:00:27.029> you've<00:00:27.119> got<00:00:27.210> one<00:00:27.390> seat<00:00:27.779> in

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
bench isn't sand you've got one seat in

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.589 
bench isn't sand you've got one seat in
the<00:00:28.080> actual<00:00:28.609> policy<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:29.880> actually<00:00:30.150> upscaled

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
the actual policy so actually upscaled

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.620 
the actual policy so actually upscaled
one<00:00:30.869> as<00:00:31.080> well<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.850> this<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.969> more<00:00:33.149> accurate<00:00:33.540> to

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
one as well so this is more accurate to

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.000 
one as well so this is more accurate to
the<00:00:33.719> actual<00:00:33.930> size<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.680> one's<00:00:34.890> more

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
the actual size and this one's more

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.670 
the actual size and this one's more
accurate<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> actual<00:00:35.910> interior<00:00:36.530> as<00:00:37.530> it

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
accurate to the actual interior as it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.580 
accurate to the actual interior as it
has<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> actual<00:00:38.010> back<00:00:38.280> section<00:00:38.730> full<00:00:39.270> ramp

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
has the actual back section full ramp

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.869 
has the actual back section full ramp
all<00:00:40.590> they're<00:00:40.829> kind<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.010> seeing<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.640> sides

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
all they're kind of seeing on the sides

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.299 
all they're kind of seeing on the sides
and<00:00:42.120> also<00:00:42.440> two<00:00:43.440> places<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> actual

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
and also two places for the actual

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.190 
and also two places for the actual
people<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.210> sit<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> cockpit<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.050> this

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
people to sit in the cockpit so this

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.799 
people to sit in the cockpit so this
one's<00:00:46.379> more<00:00:47.030> kind<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.059> closer<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
one's more kind of closer to it on the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.260 
one's more kind of closer to it on the
inside<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> interiors<00:00:49.890> done<00:00:50.180> so<00:00:51.180> I'm

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
inside and the interiors done so I'm

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270 
inside and the interiors done so I'm
actually<00:00:51.420> used<00:00:51.809> green<00:00:52.230> stained<00:00:52.590> clay<00:00:52.980> for

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
actually used green stained clay for

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.880 
actually used green stained clay for
this<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:54.719> let's<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:55.050> started<00:00:55.410> I've<00:00:55.559> built

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
this one so let's get started I've built

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.290 
this one so let's get started I've built
a<00:00:56.010> smaller<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.399> first<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.940> then<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.180> going

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
a smaller one first and then I'm going

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.479 
a smaller one first and then I'm going
to<00:00:57.329> build<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> big<00:00:57.719> one<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.020> let's<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.489> okay

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to build the big one so let's do it okay

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.619 
to build the big one so let's do it okay
so<00:00:59.520> we're<00:00:59.730> going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> build<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> small<00:01:00.449> one

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
so we're going to build the small one

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.849 
so we're going to build the small one
first<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.199> do<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.620> gonna<00:01:01.710> lay<00:01:01.829> down

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
first we can do it's just gonna lay down

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.260 
first we can do it's just gonna lay down
nine<00:01:02.280> blocks<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.730> got<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.030> two<00:01:03.239> three

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
nine blocks so you got one two three

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.840 
nine blocks so you got one two three
four<00:01:03.600> five<00:01:04.170> six<00:01:04.409> seven<00:01:04.710> eight<00:01:04.949> nine<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.670> could

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
four five six seven eight nine you could

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.340 
four five six seven eight nine you could
also<00:01:05.970> build<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.390> out<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> green<00:01:06.960> wall<00:01:07.229> as

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350

again and this one's gonna go over by

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.600 
again and this one's gonna go over by
one<00:01:39.990> block<00:01:42.560> just<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
one block just like that and then in the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.190 
one block just like that and then in the
gap<00:01:44.760> what<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.060> gonna<00:01:45.119> do<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.869> gonna<00:01:46.020> have

gap what you gonna do is just gonna have

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.859 
gap what you gonna do is just gonna have
two<00:01:46.440> blocks<00:01:46.650> went<00:01:46.979> over<00:01:50.150> like<00:01:51.150> this<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.630> this

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
two blocks went over like this and this

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.109 
two blocks went over like this and this
will<00:01:52.080> be<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.410> block<00:01:52.619> sure<00:01:53.610> again<00:01:53.910> see

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
will be one block sure again see

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.630 
will be one block sure again see
creating<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.600> kind<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:55.490> not<00:01:56.490> really

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
creating that kind of not really

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.430 
creating that kind of not really
occurred<00:01:56.940> but<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.330> can<00:01:57.509> overhand<00:01:58.170> going<00:01:58.320> up

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
occurred but I can overhand going up

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.680 
occurred but I can overhand going up
you're<00:01:58.920> also<00:01:59.040> going<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.250> need<00:01:59.430> stone<00:02:00.360> slabs

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
you're also going to need stone slabs

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.060 
you're also going to need stone slabs
which<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.930> completely<00:02:01.259> forgot<00:02:01.560> about<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.009> you

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
which I completely forgot about so you

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.730 
which I completely forgot about so you
just<00:02:02.250> didn't<00:02:02.430> put<00:02:02.550> these<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> sides<00:02:03.119> I

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
just didn't put these on the sides I

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.080 
just didn't put these on the sides I
tell<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.800> we<00:02:04.950> get<00:02:05.100> kind<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.369> proper<00:02:05.759> colored

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
tell you we get kind of proper colored

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.999 
tell you we get kind of proper colored
slabs<00:02:06.690> unfortunately<00:02:07.259> stone<00:02:07.500> slabs<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.890> can

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
slabs unfortunately stone slabs I can

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.630 
slabs unfortunately stone slabs I can
I'm<00:02:08.780> gonna<00:02:09.780> have<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.320> just<00:02:11.070> like<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
I'm gonna have to do just like that and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.340 
I'm gonna have to do just like that and
then<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.360> between<00:02:12.630> these<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:13.080> nip<00:02:13.200> put

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
then in between these you just nip put

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.699 
then in between these you just nip put
in<00:02:13.440> your<00:02:13.530> glass<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.930> then<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.350> did<00:02:16.560> for<00:02:16.680> a

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
in your glass and then all I did for a

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.290 
in your glass and then all I did for a
ramps<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.130> just<00:02:17.280> put<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.520> two<00:02:17.610> more<00:02:17.910> slabs<00:02:18.180> so

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
ramps I just put in two more slabs so

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.050 
ramps I just put in two more slabs so
you<00:02:18.390> could<00:02:18.510> actually<00:02:18.660> have<00:02:19.340> more<00:02:20.340> slabs<00:02:20.730> but

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
you could actually have more slabs but

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.180 
you could actually have more slabs but
it<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.570> doesn't<00:02:21.750> look<00:02:21.989> quite<00:02:22.320> right<00:02:22.440> and

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
it just doesn't look quite right and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.760 
it just doesn't look quite right and
then<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:24.060> just<00:02:24.900> laid<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.140> interior<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.620> mind

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
then I just laid the interior and mind

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.560 
then I just laid the interior and mind
is<00:02:25.950> there's<00:02:26.220> absolutely<00:02:26.670> pretty<00:02:27.209> much<00:02:27.330> no

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
is there's absolutely pretty much no

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.600 
is there's absolutely pretty much no
interior<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.110> just<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.320> cut<00:02:28.500> fourth<00:02:28.709> seats

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
interior on it just to cut fourth seats

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.190 
interior on it just to cut fourth seats
they<00:02:29.880> can<00:02:30.030> have<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> partition<00:02:30.540> here<00:02:31.019> and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
they can have a partition here and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.039 
they can have a partition here and
that's<00:02:32.040> all<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.220> got<00:02:32.459> for<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.690> so<00:02:33.690> let's<00:02:33.870> move

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
that's all I got for that so let's move

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.900 
that's all I got for that so let's move
on<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.560> bigger<00:02:34.739> one<00:02:34.920> okay<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.760> big

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
on to the bigger one okay so the big

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.640 
on to the bigger one okay so the big
ones<00:02:36.090> pretty<00:02:36.390> much<00:02:36.600> exactly<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.140> same<00:02:37.230> just

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
ones pretty much exactly the same just

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.530 
ones pretty much exactly the same just
you<00:02:37.920> know<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.220> bit<00:02:38.430> upscale<00:02:38.940> as<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.269> can<00:02:39.390> see

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
you know a bit upscale as you can see

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.620 
you know a bit upscale as you can see
from<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.870> size<00:02:40.769> difference<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.519> scaled<00:02:42.360> kind

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
from the size difference is scaled kind

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.880 
from the size difference is scaled kind
of<00:02:42.690> up<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> bit<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.230> what<00:02:43.320> you<00:02:43.410> can<00:02:43.500> do<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.769> just

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
of up a bit so what you can do is just

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.070 
of up a bit so what you can do is just
lay<00:02:44.160> down<00:02:44.190> ten<00:02:44.610> blocks<00:02:44.850> one<00:02:45.090> two<00:02:45.360> three<00:02:45.780> four

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
lay down ten blocks one two three four

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.140 
lay down ten blocks one two three four
five<00:02:46.410> six<00:02:46.650> seven<00:02:47.070> eight<00:02:47.190> nine<00:02:47.489> ten

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
five six seven eight nine ten

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.390 
five six seven eight nine ten
the<00:02:48.810> scary<00:02:49.080> five<00:02:49.380> wide<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.769> totally<00:02:50.070> go<00:02:50.190> one

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
the scary five wide and totally go one

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.319 
the scary five wide and totally go one
two<00:02:50.670> three<00:02:50.700> four<00:02:51.299> five<00:02:52.579> so<00:02:53.579> just<00:02:53.760> fill<00:02:53.940> all<00:02:54.269> of

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
two three four five so just fill all of

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.729 
two three four five so just fill all of
this<00:02:54.570> floor<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.079> this<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.500> floor

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
this floor and this is just the floor

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.920 
this floor and this is just the floor
it'll<00:02:56.130> crack<00:02:56.370> yourself

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.360 

so<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.080> then<00:03:01.260> on<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.500> wolf<00:03:01.740> what<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.130> do<00:03:02.310> is

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
so that then on the wolf what you do is

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.460 
so that then on the wolf what you do is
you<00:03:02.459> go<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.550> come<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:02.819> one<00:03:03.030> from<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.270> front

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
you go to come in one from the front

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.360 
you go to come in one from the front
bring<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:04.560> all<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.740> way<00:03:04.800> straight<00:03:05.130> back

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
bring this all the way straight back

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.710 
bring this all the way straight back
same<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.450> other<00:03:06.569> side<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:09.480> they're<00:03:09.630> gonna

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
same the other side and they're gonna

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.050 
same the other side and they're gonna
come<00:03:09.990> in<00:03:10.020> again<00:03:10.470> one<00:03:10.800> more<00:03:10.980> block<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:12.000> time

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
come in again one more block this time

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.850 
come in again one more block this time
this<00:03:12.330> was<00:03:12.480> going<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.630> go<00:03:12.780> over<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.770> actually

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
this was going to go over and actually

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.940 
this was going to go over and actually
hang<00:03:14.250> by<00:03:14.700> one<00:03:14.880> block<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:19.200> then<00:03:19.380> in<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.739> kind

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
hang by one block and then in the kind

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.830 
hang by one block and then in the kind
of<00:03:20.010> middle<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.150> there's<00:03:21.300> nearly<00:03:21.420> free<00:03:21.720> of

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
of middle of it there's nearly free of

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.540 
of middle of it there's nearly free of
these<00:03:21.959> blocks<00:03:22.319> and<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.280> just<00:03:23.400> going<00:03:23.489> to

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
these blocks and this is just going to

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.580 
these blocks and this is just going to
come<00:03:23.840> all<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.930> way<00:03:24.959> from<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.260> back<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.530> this

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
come all the way from the back of this

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.550 
come all the way from the back of this
going<00:03:25.800> one<00:03:25.980> block<00:03:26.220> short<00:03:27.020> of<00:03:28.020> the<00:03:28.170> front<00:03:28.410> like

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
going one block short of the front like

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.080 
going one block short of the front like
this<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.220> then<00:03:29.550> you're<00:03:29.640> gonna<00:03:29.760> crack<00:03:29.970> your

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
this and then you're gonna crack your

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.040 
this and then you're gonna crack your
stone<00:03:30.330> slabs<00:03:30.600> but<00:03:30.840> these<00:03:31.019> on<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.320> side<00:03:33.050> on

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
stone slabs but these on the side on

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.800 
stone slabs but these on the side on
both<00:03:34.290> sides<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.739> course<00:03:35.060> if<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.300> ramp<00:03:36.480> itself

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
both sides of course if the ramp itself

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.920 
both sides of course if the ramp itself
actually<00:03:37.050> didn't<00:03:37.440> go<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:38.390> says<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.510> locks<00:03:39.720> us

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
actually didn't go to says it locks us

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.070 
actually didn't go to says it locks us
as<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:40.650> upscale<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.190> does<00:03:41.310> look<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:42.300> fits

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
as it is upscale it does look just fits

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.500 
as it is upscale it does look just fits
the<00:03:43.260> actual<00:03:43.470> vault<00:03:43.650> itself<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.269> we<00:03:45.360> need

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
the actual vault itself and that we need

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
the actual vault itself and that we need
to<00:03:45.600> do<00:03:45.720> is<00:03:45.840> just<00:03:46.080> put<00:03:46.380> on<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.880> glass<00:03:47.880> block<00:03:48.530> for

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
to do is just put on the glass block for

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.590 
to do is just put on the glass block for
the<00:03:49.620> actual<00:03:49.860> front<00:03:50.130> itself<00:03:50.550> so<00:03:51.330> that's<00:03:51.420> how

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
the actual front itself so that's how

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.970 
the actual front itself so that's how
you<00:03:51.660> do<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.840> without<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.230> drive<00:03:52.440> fought<00:03:52.680> so

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
you do it without the drive fought so

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.930 
you do it without the drive fought so
both<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.190> them<00:03:53.340> I'm<00:03:53.459> just<00:03:53.519> going<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.790> show<00:03:53.880> you

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
both of them I'm just going to show you

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.800 
both of them I'm just going to show you
how<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.090> did<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.450> drive<00:03:54.630> pods<00:03:54.870> on<00:03:55.140> both<00:03:55.800> now

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
how I did the drive pods on both now

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.020 
how I did the drive pods on both now
okay<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:57.870> for<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.290> big<00:03:58.530> ones<00:03:58.769> dr+<00:03:59.760> you're

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
okay so for the big ones dr+ you're

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.250 
okay so for the big ones dr+ you're
actually<00:04:00.269> having<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.569> flying

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
actually having it flying

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.690 
actually having it flying
if<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.709> haven't<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:01.950> landing<00:04:02.310> it's<00:04:02.430> probably

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
if you haven't it landing it's probably

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.699 
if you haven't it landing it's probably
best<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:03.239> leave<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.720> drive<00:04:03.930> pods<00:04:04.140> out<00:04:04.410> of<00:04:04.560> it

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
best to leave the drive pods out of it

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.380 
best to leave the drive pods out of it
so<00:04:04.950> what<00:04:05.130> you<00:04:05.160> can<00:04:05.280> do<00:04:05.400> is<00:04:05.519> you<00:04:05.640> count<00:04:05.970> from<00:04:06.269> the

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
so what you can do is you count from the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.150 
so what you can do is you count from the
back<00:04:06.540> leave<00:04:06.870> two<00:04:07.110> blocks<00:04:07.410> then<00:04:07.769> you<00:04:07.829> go<00:04:07.920> get<00:04:08.070> to

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
back leave two blocks then you go get to

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.319 
back leave two blocks then you go get to
the<00:04:08.220> third<00:04:08.400> one<00:04:08.430> there's<00:04:08.850> gonna<00:04:08.970> be<00:04:09.060> three<00:04:09.239> of

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
the third one there's gonna be three of

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.479 
the third one there's gonna be three of
these<00:04:09.480> blocks<00:04:09.780> like<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.190> I'm<00:04:11.190> going<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.370> do

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
these blocks like this I'm going to do

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:12.860 
these blocks like this I'm going to do
is<00:04:11.579> you<00:04:11.670> could<00:04:11.820> come<00:04:11.970> out<00:04:12.000> as<00:04:12.420> if<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.690> sun's

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
is you could come out as if the sun's

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.729 
is you could come out as if the sun's
going<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.019> curving<00:04:13.350> around

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
going to curving around

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.099 
going to curving around
it's<00:04:14.489> gonna<00:04:14.579> stick<00:04:14.910> over<00:04:15.150> by<00:04:15.420> one<00:04:15.660> on<00:04:15.900> this

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
it's gonna stick over by one on this

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.930 
it's gonna stick over by one on this
side<00:04:16.380> but<00:04:16.919> on<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.280> other<00:04:17.400> side<00:04:17.489> what<00:04:17.760> you<00:04:17.850> can

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
side but on the other side what you can

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.900 
side but on the other side what you can
do<00:04:18.000> is<00:04:18.060> gonna<00:04:18.180> put<00:04:18.479> glowstone<00:04:18.930> block<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.910> then

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
do is gonna put glowstone block and then

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.790 
do is gonna put glowstone block and then
put<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.120> trapdoor<00:04:21.419> like<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.229> so<00:04:22.470> that's<00:04:22.590> how<00:04:22.770> I

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
put a trapdoor like that so that's how I

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.890 
put a trapdoor like that so that's how I
did<00:04:23.039> that<00:04:23.490> kind<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:23.760> drove<00:04:24.150> what's<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.660> same

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
did that kind of drove what's the same

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.480 
did that kind of drove what's the same
on<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.260> other<00:04:25.289> side<00:04:25.620> as<00:04:25.770> well<00:04:25.950> so<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.250> leave

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
on the other side as well so you leave

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.529 
on the other side as well so you leave
two<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.820> these<00:04:27.080> free<00:04:28.080> slabs<00:04:29.270> you<00:04:30.270> know<00:04:30.360> come

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
two of these free slabs you know come

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.719 
two of these free slabs you know come
out<00:04:30.570> with<00:04:30.840> your<00:04:31.039> stained<00:04:32.039> clay<00:04:32.340> or<00:04:32.490> whatever

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
you've used come forth by one and then

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.260 
you've used come forth by one and then
on<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:34.979> back<00:04:35.130> just<00:04:35.370> like<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.700> low<00:04:35.820> stone<00:04:36.030> block

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
on the back just like a low stone block

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.969 
on the back just like a low stone block
will<00:04:36.510> have<00:04:36.570> a<00:04:36.660> trapdoor<00:04:36.900> on<00:04:37.200> it<00:04:37.380> or<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:37.890> can

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
will have a trapdoor on it or you can

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.700 
will have a trapdoor on it or you can
just<00:04:38.100> have<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.310> glowstone<00:04:38.729> block<00:04:39.650> for<00:04:40.650> the

just have the glowstone block for the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.110 
just have the glowstone block for the
smaller<00:04:40.979> one<00:04:41.190> it's<00:04:41.340> pretty<00:04:41.550> much<00:04:41.640> exactly<00:04:41.789> the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
smaller one it's pretty much exactly the

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.790 
smaller one it's pretty much exactly the
same<00:04:42.180> except<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:42.630> leave<00:04:43.020> -<00:04:43.260> and<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.500> just<00:04:43.530> go

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
- then you've got four in total inside

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.140 
- then you've got four in total inside
the<00:04:46.770> actual<00:04:46.890> five<00:04:47.250> blocks<00:04:47.580> in<00:04:47.700> total<00:04:47.970> that<00:04:48.090> you

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
the actual five blocks in total that you

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.510

you know a couple of chairs at the front
and<00:04:55.830> a<00:04:55.919> couple<00:04:56.130> of<00:04:56.250> these<00:04:56.370> you<00:04:56.580> could<00:04:56.729> if<00:04:56.880> you

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
and a couple of these you could if you

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.200 
and a couple of these you could if you
wanted<00:04:57.150> to

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
wanted to

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.719 
wanted to
switch<00:04:59.020> this<00:04:59.199> out<00:04:59.410> if<00:04:59.979> I<00:05:00.100> just<00:05:00.130> do<00:05:00.460> this<00:05:00.490> on

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
switch this out if I just do this on

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.790 
switch this out if I just do this on
this<00:05:00.880> build<00:05:01.180> quickly<00:05:01.449> kids<00:05:02.229> switch<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.590> cell

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800
