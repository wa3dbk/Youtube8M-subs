00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
bunch of codes Oh two sensors and then

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.069 
bunch of codes Oh two sensors and then
it<00:00:51.629> started<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:53.120> you<00:00:54.120> know<00:00:54.239> three<00:00:54.719> five

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
it started to be you know three five

it started to be you know three five
just<00:00:55.410> weren't<00:00:55.620> hitting<00:00:59.449> cylinder<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:00.660> seemed

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
just weren't hitting cylinder one seemed

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.319 
just weren't hitting cylinder one seemed
fine<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.800> she<00:01:01.980> threw<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> random<00:01:02.789> misfires

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
fine but she threw the random misfires

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.300 
fine but she threw the random misfires
on<00:01:03.660> three<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.170> five<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.710> real<00:01:05.519> rough<00:01:05.760> idle<00:01:07.310> so

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
on three and five and real rough idle so

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.810 
on three and five and real rough idle so
if<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.490> got<00:01:08.700> around<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> tickler<00:01:10.049> part<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
if I got around to a tickler part and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.399 
if I got around to a tickler part and
this<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.880> what<00:01:12.390> she<00:01:12.600> looks<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.930> when<00:01:13.260> these

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
this is what she looks like when these

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:28.010 
this is what she looks like when these
leaked<00:01:13.680> oil<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.030> your<00:01:15.180> coil<00:01:15.540> pack<00:01:17.810> delay

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.780 

which<00:01:28.380> right<00:01:28.590> there<00:01:28.830> will<00:01:29.010> make<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.340> hard<00:01:29.610> for

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
which right there will make it hard for

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:40.890 
which right there will make it hard for
your<00:01:32.210> your<00:01:33.510> to<00:01:33.659> hit

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
big clips off pull this back if you

00:01:49.060 --> 00:02:16.330 
big clips off pull this back if you
can<00:01:49.210> get<00:01:49.390> these<00:01:49.600> off<00:01:50.700> be<00:01:51.700> geared<00:01:52.150> up
