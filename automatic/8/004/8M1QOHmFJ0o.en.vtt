00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
as it's been expecting two eyes I have

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.689 
as it's been expecting two eyes I have
just<00:01:01.559> reviewed<00:01:01.770> chamber<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.430> could<00:01:02.670> be

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
just reviewed chamber so that could be

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.429 
just reviewed chamber so that could be
why<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.910> fell<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> bit<00:01:03.300> sluggish<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.229> didn't

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
why I fell a bit sluggish but it didn't

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.750 
why I fell a bit sluggish but it didn't
seem<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.739> quite<00:01:04.830> as<00:01:05.100> much<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.369> an<00:01:05.460> impact

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
seem to have quite as much of an impact

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.070 
seem to have quite as much of an impact
as<00:01:06.000> his<00:01:06.119> first<00:01:06.330> inform<00:01:06.689> did<00:01:06.840> when<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> first

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
as his first inform did when I first

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.929 
as his first inform did when I first
used<00:01:07.380> him<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.549> said<00:01:08.700> about<00:01:08.850> the

used him and as I said about the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.010 
used him and as I said about the
dribbling<00:01:09.210> he<00:01:09.299> keeps<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> ball<00:01:09.689> close<00:01:09.869> to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
dribbling he keeps the ball close to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.660 
dribbling he keeps the ball close to
employ<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.710> runs<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.400> these<00:01:11.549> like

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
employ like it runs in like these like

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.490 
employ like it runs in like these like
rigid<00:01:12.150> ways<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:13.049> takes<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.380> these

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
rigid ways like it takes like these

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.350 
rigid ways like it takes like these
diagonal<00:01:14.100> steps<00:01:14.369> which<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.549> quite<00:01:14.790> weird<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
diagonal steps which is quite weird and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.570 
diagonal steps which is quite weird and
just<00:01:15.509> awkward<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.229> talk<00:01:16.259> about<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.860> crossing

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
just awkward to talk about and crossing

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.370 
just awkward to talk about and crossing
wise<00:01:17.759> he's<00:01:18.210> got<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> really<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:18.960> weird

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
wise he's got a really really weird

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.380 
wise he's got a really really weird
cross<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.009> always<00:01:20.280> seems<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.790> find<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.180> head

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
cross but it always seems to find a head
