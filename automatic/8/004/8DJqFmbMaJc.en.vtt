00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.390 
hi I'm yawns of new gadgets 30 i'm here

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.920 
hi I'm yawns of new gadgets 30 i'm here
at<00:00:12.510> the<00:00:12.540> sous<00:00:13.230> booth<00:00:13.530> at<00:00:13.800> ciba<00:00:14.340> 2011<00:00:15.180> and<00:00:15.720> we're

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
at the sous booth at ciba 2011 and we're

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.920 
at the sous booth at ciba 2011 and we're
going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.350> have<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> look<00:00:16.740> at<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.130> epc<00:00:17.790> 10-15<00:00:18.600> d

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
going to have a look at the epc 10-15 d

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.340 
going to have a look at the epc 10-15 d
so<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:20.400> equipped<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> new<00:00:21.210> AMD<00:00:21.720> brazos

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
so it's equipped with the new AMD brazos

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.310 
so it's equipped with the new AMD brazos
platform<00:00:22.860> so<00:00:23.070> it's<00:00:23.360> there's<00:00:24.360> an<00:00:24.480> APU<00:00:24.840> inside

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
platform so it's there's an APU inside

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.249 
platform so it's there's an APU inside
so<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.740> comes<00:00:26.070> it's<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.430> combination<00:00:26.669> between

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
so it comes it's a combination between

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:33.170 
so it comes it's a combination between
CPU<00:00:28.259> and<00:00:28.560> GPU<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:31.009> let's<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.279> look<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:33.060> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
CPU and GPU so let's have a look so the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.930 
CPU and GPU so let's have a look so the
CPU<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.810> browser<00:00:34.050> c30<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.220> 1.2
