which<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:34.020> nice<00:01:34.200> because<00:01:34.530> then<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> don't

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
which can be nice because then you don't

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.370 
which can be nice because then you don't
accidentally<00:01:35.700> press<00:01:36.119> these<00:01:36.329> buttons<00:01:36.390> while

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
playing games are doing anything else

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.130 
playing games are doing anything else
since<00:01:40.320> they're<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.799> physical<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.780> then<00:01:42.780> on

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
since they're all physical and then on

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.080 
since they're all physical and then on
the<00:01:43.470> right<00:01:43.710> side<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.159> phone<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the right side of the phone you have the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.270 
the right side of the phone you have the
camera<00:01:45.540> button<00:01:45.720> which<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> little

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
camera button which can be a little

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.060 
camera button which can be a little
tricky<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.030> press<00:01:48.420> because<00:01:48.750> pressing<00:01:49.590> halfway

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
tricky to press because pressing halfway

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.999 
tricky to press because pressing halfway
down<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.549> pretty<00:01:51.450> similar<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.960> pressing<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
down is pretty similar to pressing the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.310 
down is pretty similar to pressing the
button<00:01:53.310> full<00:01:53.640> way<00:01:53.820> down<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.869> tough<00:01:55.110> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
button full way down so it's tough to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.080 
button full way down so it's tough to
focus<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.009> without<00:01:56.280> actually<00:01:56.670> taking<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
focus it without actually taking a

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
buttons on the right side too and those

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.760 
buttons on the right side too and those
feel<00:02:03.580> pretty<00:02:03.880> nice<00:02:04.120> and<00:02:04.480> then<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.530> power
