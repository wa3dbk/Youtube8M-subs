00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.399
 the 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.810
 the rotterdammer by the happening 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.650
 the first to the last 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.439
 turn to Croatia end up the can at the pick up 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.309
 and then we bring to the vet nice in july when i'm done with 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.470
 my bring you home 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.470
 yes, of course, wait 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.439
 but you are 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.190
 wild card built 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.190
 together with your husband I have the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.230
 these animals 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.850
 this animal ambulance 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.230
 twelve years ago twelve years in prison 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.390
 in in Rotterdam 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.510
 and why 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.250
 we found that 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.820
 that they are easier two veterinarians and the other as if there could be enough 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.940
 work before and that was also shown in practice 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.580
 to be there anyway the alderman gives may be something 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.580
 We thought that one with another country in Rotterdam was not enough 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.400
 and so there could also be real women around the audience 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.660
 and that's here if 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.860
 and then indeed it became apparent that there was a need for a second animal ambulance 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.500
 got into his car 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.540
 what exactly is the work that you say do 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.080
 well actually only is for 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.460
 and leaders fifteen notifications and then you go he is arrested 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.730
 you not only get an honor from the family 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.360
 the vet must 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.140
 with four 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.250
 For more information 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.440
 obedience is much more effective everyone 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.669
 He stated that he was home again 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.329
 that is actually too high a matter 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.149
 and in addition, your aunt indicates you want to get it stately 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:15.749
 and let you act as a player 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:19.139
 they catch the animal they catch with songs that people can see 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.139
 just before he goes to the animal protection 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.739
 almost all the ducks we go here 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:30.849
 ingrids is also accommodating and they stay and we shouldn't make it here 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.779
 be turned off 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:36.909
 that was all your work and then I will get you last on your deceased animals 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.259
 of people at home 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.349
 leather must be cremated 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.469
 or who thinks on the street are flattened after bringing around you that goes 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.549
 all to a rendering company 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:49.490
 the property 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.490
 see where they open again 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.139
 work 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.099
 we have been there for a long time 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.099
 Who 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.310
 goods 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.310
 but you are asking 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:13.869
 leo heere 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:14.939
 that's a decline 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.319
 well if the media 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.929
 he would then be on his way there 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:22.479
 We are now Thursday to Tatia which is the pet crematorium we have 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:26.919
 just in the old members dog picked up and they go more for those people there 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.669
 the implementation plan 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.609
 We are going to Dennis Bergkamp 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.139
 next month is the two years 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.559
 and why 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:37.559
 because i like a lot of these 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.019
 picque 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:05.279

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.279
 what for you for it 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.089
 what 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:13.049
 the presale 10 euros 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.969
 yes it is always there 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:17.539
 it is being has not worked 6 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.539
 did not think the incident led 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.340
 the idea that this summer 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:26.960
 we're going to be with now 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.900
 now we go to a park 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.550
 and a modern one there 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.490
 that could end
