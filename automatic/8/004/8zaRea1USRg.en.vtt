biggest inconveniences is charging the
batteries<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:07.760> have<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.030> take<00:01:08.210> it<00:01:08.360> out<00:01:08.480> of<00:01:08.510> the

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
batteries you have to take it out of the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.170 
batteries you have to take it out of the
case<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.290> you<00:01:09.560> have<00:01:09.650> to<00:01:09.800> plug<00:01:10.010> it<00:01:10.190> in<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.550> it's

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
case and you have to plug it in and it's

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.240 
case and you have to plug it in and it's
a<00:01:11.330> bit<00:01:11.510> of<00:01:11.630> a<00:01:11.720> hassle<00:01:11.900> so<00:01:12.320> we<00:01:12.470> decided<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:13.040> come

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
a bit of a hassle so we decided to come

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.220 
a bit of a hassle so we decided to come
together<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:13.880> develop<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.660> wirelessly

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the jolt battery all you have to do is

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.880 
the jolt battery all you have to do is
replace<00:01:45.090> your<00:01:45.360> regular<00:01:45.780> GoPro<00:01:46.230> battery<00:01:46.590> with

replace your regular GoPro battery with
the<00:01:46.920> jolt<00:01:47.310> powder<00:01:47.580> and<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.510> can<00:01:48.660> throw<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.870> on

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
the jolt powder and you can throw it on

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.800 
the jolt powder and you can throw it on
the<00:01:49.200> pad<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.650> it<00:01:49.800> wirelessly<00:01:50.460> charge<00:01:50.810> we

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the pad and it wirelessly charge we

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.690 
the pad and it wirelessly charge we
tried<00:01:52.080> several<00:01:52.350> designs<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.250> dual

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
tried several designs for the dual

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.550 
tried several designs for the dual
charger<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.630> concluded<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.380> most

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
charger and we concluded that most

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.770 
charger and we concluded that most
people<00:01:55.980> have<00:01:56.010> more<00:01:56.370> than<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.760> device<00:01:57.450> that

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
people have more than one device that

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.200 
people have more than one device that
they<00:01:57.900> need<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.080> charge<00:01:58.410> at<00:01:58.620> any<00:01:58.860> given<00:01:59.250> time<00:01:59.460> so

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
they need to charge at any given time so

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.300 
they need to charge at any given time so
we<00:02:00.390> designed<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.410> final<00:02:01.590> design<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
we designed the the final design was to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.180 
we designed the the final design was to
have<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> multi-station<00:02:03.750> charger<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.620> that<00:02:04.800> it

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
have a multi-station charger so that it

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.910 
have a multi-station charger so that it
can<00:02:05.340> charge<00:02:05.520> two<00:02:05.640> cameras<00:02:06.390> or<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.500> can<00:02:07.680> turn

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
can charge two cameras or it can turn

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.070 
can charge two cameras or it can turn

needs<00:02:10.380> gold<00:02:11.250> has<00:02:11.430> chosen<00:02:11.790> mojo<00:02:12.210> technology

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
needs gold has chosen mojo technology

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.040 
needs gold has chosen mojo technology
for<00:02:12.990> three<00:02:13.230> main<00:02:13.440> reasons<00:02:13.640> firstly<00:02:14.640> our

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
for three main reasons firstly our

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.930 
for three main reasons firstly our
technology<00:02:16.050> allows<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:17.160> device<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.610> be

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
technology allows the device to be

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.730 
technology allows the device to be
charged<00:02:18.480> when<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.020> is<00:02:19.140> placed<00:02:19.350> at<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> distance

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
charged when it is placed at a distance

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.210 
charged when it is placed at a distance
from<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.400> charger<00:02:20.870> secondly<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.560> device<00:02:22.950> can

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
from the charger secondly the device can

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.670 
from the charger secondly the device can
be<00:02:23.280> charged<00:02:23.880> when<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.570> placed<00:02:24.810> anywhere<00:02:25.290> on

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
be charged when it is placed anywhere on

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.610 
be charged when it is placed anywhere on
a<00:02:25.740> charger<00:02:26.250> path<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.760> thirdly<00:02:27.540> because<00:02:27.960> we

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
a charger path and thirdly because we

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.170 
a charger path and thirdly because we
can<00:02:28.830> charge<00:02:29.130> multiple<00:02:29.850> devices

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
can charge multiple devices

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.270 
can charge multiple devices

in my spare time and I would use to make
my<00:02:36.990> own<00:02:37.040> dive<00:02:38.040> housings<00:02:38.580> for<00:02:38.670> cameras<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:39.989> now

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
my own dive housings for cameras but now

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.840 
my own dive housings for cameras but now
that<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.410> GoPro<00:02:40.830> cameras<00:02:41.250> come<00:02:41.459> along<00:02:41.700> I

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
that the GoPro cameras come along I

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.490 
that the GoPro cameras come along I
don't<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.150> make<00:02:42.420> those<00:02:42.630> anymore<00:02:42.840> but<00:02:43.470> I

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
don't have make those anymore but I

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.140 
don't have make those anymore but I
still<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.010> same<00:02:44.160> problem<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.880> seal

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
still have the same problem of the seal

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.360 
still have the same problem of the seal
being<00:02:45.480> compromised<00:02:46.200> when<00:02:46.800> I'm<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.190> dive

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
being compromised when I'm on the dive

50<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:55.000> sounds<00:02:55.360> amazing<00:02:55.570> I<00:02:55.990> think<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.410> would

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
50 that sounds amazing I think it would

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.020 
50 that sounds amazing I think it would
be<00:02:56.560> great<00:02:56.740> you<00:02:57.160> know<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.310> wouldn't<00:02:57.610> have<00:02:57.760> fig

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
be great you know I wouldn't have fig
