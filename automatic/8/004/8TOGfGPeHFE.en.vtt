00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.480
 having designed the model r8 e-tron company 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.759
 audi you can say looked into the future and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.470
 showed how dynamic sports 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.470
 maybe an electric car 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.260
 he is for us r8 e-tron top 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.599
 technological thought flagship in the field 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.610
 automotive and all new ideas 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.530
 which we develop and test 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.700
 can be used for development 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.830
 our production 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.220
 experience may come in handy. 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.260
 creating future production models 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.440
 torque limit 820 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.050
 newton meters and power 313 horse 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.860
 power reserve electric car two hundred 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.860
 fifteen kilometers 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.890
 here the central tunnel is located 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.019
 battery it has 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.089
 n-shaped and that means that it 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.129
 begins here ahead consists of 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.380
 two sections stretches towards the trunk 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.810
 battery cell consisting of 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.120
 four sections located rear 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.500
 behind the seats the battery weighs five hundred 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.290
 seventy seven kilos is 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.700
 practically the heart of the car you mods 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.460
 the engine consists of two electric motors 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.710
 one mounted on the left the other to the right, both 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.240
 independent of each other that is right 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.770
 driving right wheel left 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.549
 respectively left is small 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.650
 feature 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.960
 so we can implement here 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.039
 the principle of bargaining factoring is vectoring 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.570
 torque 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.850
 that is, when the car enters 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.409
 turn right for example left and distant 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.159
 the wheel gets extra energy 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.200
 it increases power and bator and 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.859
 involve we have the opportunity 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.990
 use 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:47.060
 and energy recovery during normal 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.009
 operation of the vehicle in normal 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.439
 Riding is mainly used rear 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.659
 brakes and braking 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.700
 energy through the electric motor and they 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.399
 directly connected to the wheels 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.450
 will return back to the battery 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:06.770
 ndn he is up to 9 in real consumption spice 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.229
 today r8 e-tron car 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.030
 just released a limited batch 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.030
 13 machines manufactured 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.660
 the model was developed in parallel with 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.370
 ordinary r8 does this mean in serial 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.770
 car for this car took only 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.990
 the door and everything else we see here 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.020
 Made of carbon fiber made by hand 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.630
 yes and the car interior compared to 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.730
 the normal version is completely redesigned 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.680
 specifically for r8 we developed 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.150
 rims while parking they 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.750
 open so that the brakes remain 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.030
 cold 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.920
 but starting at a speed of 50 kilometers in 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.530
 hour the centrifugal force begins to press on 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.500
 petals they are pressed against iori dynamics 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.290
 Improved fixes must weight 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.180
 car one thousand seven hundred and eighty 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.150
 kilograms everything is balanced mass 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.340
 body including side elements 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.550
 200 kilograms and that's at 23 kilograms 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.620
 less than usual r8 even back 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.360
 glass in order to facilitate construction 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.360
 was replaced by carbon fiber 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:13.469
 i'm we blackboards here we have a camera so 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.180
 like a rearview in the cabin there is no camera 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:17.099
 Projects what is happening on the screen 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.650
 mounted inside the machine 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.379
 here is where the mirror usually hangs we 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.500
 see the display the system was tested on 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:29.159
 car r18 estuary then used 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.340
 should create r8 pox has bulkiness 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:36.299
 Achtuba new to one hundred kilometers per hour 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:42.599
 r8 e-tron dispersed for 4.2 seconds and 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:44.280
 how does the car sound motor 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.049
 car we hear was 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.480
 specially designed so we 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.189
 tried to create a combination 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.870
 futuristic sound and normal sound 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:55.859
 internal combustion engine 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.060
 boom heard even during the stop 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.730
 quiet roar of the motor 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.000
 so that pedestrians can hear and notice 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.939
 machine of max sums argonauta fatca 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.079
 cut sound also depends on how 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.030
 I press hard on the gas 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.739
 how much energy do i use 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.479
 feel the speed of the car 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.000
 hyundai malefice 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:17.880
 completion of skalsky movies without difficulty 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.829
 usa movie so now the task is auto 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.780
 engineers use accumulated experience 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.620
 to produce already strong 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.620
 electric cars
