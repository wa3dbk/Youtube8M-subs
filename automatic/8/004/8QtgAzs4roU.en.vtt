00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
custom and this kit I basically just

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.160 
custom and this kit I basically just
battle-damaged<00:00:19.949> very<00:00:20.520> very<00:00:20.880> heavily<00:00:21.180> where

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
battle-damaged very very heavily where

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.950 
battle-damaged very very heavily where
it<00:00:22.289> was<00:00:22.439> just<00:00:22.470> about<00:00:22.830> destroyed<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.539> put<00:00:24.840> it

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
it was just about destroyed and I put it

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.640 
it was just about destroyed and I put it
in<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.680> forest<00:00:26.550> II<00:00:26.760> kind<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.060> scene<00:00:27.650> where

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
in this forest II kind of scene where

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.140 
in this forest II kind of scene where
it's<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:28.890> laying<00:00:29.189> down<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.640> stuff<00:00:29.849> as<00:00:30.000> you

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
it's just laying down and stuff as you

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.760 
it's just laying down and stuff as you
can<00:00:30.300> see<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:32.210> this<00:00:33.210> took<00:00:33.540> me<00:00:33.780> about<00:00:34.020> four

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
can see and this took me about four

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.400 
can see and this took me about four
weeks<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:35.730> which<00:00:36.480> most<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:36.989> time<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> was

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
weeks to do which most of the time I was

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.369 
weeks to do which most of the time I was
just<00:00:37.440> working<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:37.890> weekends<00:00:38.399> though<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.379> I

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
just working on weekends though and I

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.979 
just working on weekends though and I
think<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.860> turned<00:00:41.040> out<00:00:41.160> pretty<00:00:41.340> well<00:00:41.690> now<00:00:42.690> this

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
think it turned out pretty well now this

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.090 
think it turned out pretty well now this
is<00:00:43.430> like<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.489> said<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.879> my<00:00:45.000> second<00:00:45.420> one<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
is like I said this is my second one and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.729 
is like I said this is my second one and
my<00:00:47.100> first<00:00:47.340> one<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.090> winged<00:00:48.870> zero<00:00:49.170> custom

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
my first one was the winged zero custom

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.779 
my first one was the winged zero custom
and<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:51.180> one<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.710> kind<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.250> learned<00:00:53.489> from

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and this one I I kind of learned from

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.150 
and this one I I kind of learned from
what<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> did<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.170> winged<00:00:55.350> zero<00:00:55.590> custom<00:00:56.039> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
what I did on the winged zero custom and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.819 
what I did on the winged zero custom and
the<00:00:56.670> few<00:00:56.940> things<00:00:57.059> better<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.510> think<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.710> you

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the few things better I think and as you

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.369 
the few things better I think and as you
can<00:00:58.920> see<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.760> with<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.149> little<00:01:00.719> details<00:01:01.230> of

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
can see like with the little details of

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.590 
can see like with the little details of
the<00:01:01.469> kit<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:03.619> like<00:01:04.619> put<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> took<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.180> chunk<00:01:06.390> out<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the kit I like put a took a chunk out of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.880 
the kit I like put a took a chunk out of
the<00:01:07.189> left<00:01:08.189> shoulder<00:01:08.549> armor<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.320> I<00:01:10.320> took<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.650> big

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
guns while it's off to the side of the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.100 
guns while it's off to the side of the
Gundam<00:01:36.060> itself<00:01:36.509> where<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.720> had<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:36.930> been

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
Gundam itself where it had just been

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.249 
Gundam itself where it had just been
like<00:01:37.290> shot<00:01:37.890> off<00:01:38.070> or<00:01:38.280> something<00:01:38.659> or<00:01:39.659> tore<00:01:39.869> off<00:01:40.079> I

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
like shot off or something or tore off I

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:40.850 
like shot off or something or tore off I
don't<00:01:40.439> know

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
don't know

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.359 
don't know
and<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.689> also<00:01:42.960> destroyed<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> bunch<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> head

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
and I also destroyed a bunch of the head

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.380 
and I also destroyed a bunch of the head
part<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.570> Gundam<00:01:46.100> just<00:01:47.100> tore<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.000> down<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
part of the Gundam just tore it down and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.340 
part of the Gundam just tore it down and
stuff<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.490> all<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.759> looks<00:01:51.000> pretty<00:01:51.720> nice<00:01:52.020> I

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
stuff and all that looks pretty nice I

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.399 
stuff and all that looks pretty nice I
think<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:53.430> pictures<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.840> don't<00:01:55.140> exactly

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
think the pictures on this don't exactly

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.219 
think the pictures on this don't exactly
do<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.549> real<00:01:57.210> great<00:01:57.420> justice<00:01:57.869> because<00:01:58.020> my

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
do it real great justice because my

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.800 
do it real great justice because my
camera<00:01:58.770> isn't<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.399> best<00:01:59.640> I'm<00:01:59.880> hoping<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.719> get

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
camera isn't the best I'm hoping to get

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.959 
camera isn't the best I'm hoping to get
a<00:02:00.869> new<00:02:01.020> camera<00:02:01.259> or<00:02:01.439> something<00:02:01.920> at<00:02:02.579> least<00:02:02.610> find

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
a new camera or something at least find

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.880 
a new camera or something at least find
something<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.509> takes<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.810> little<00:02:03.960> better

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
something that takes a little better

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.160 
something that takes a little better
high-definition<00:02:05.610> pictures

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
high-definition pictures

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.290 
high-definition pictures
now<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.220> big<00:02:08.369> things<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.759> did<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.090> this

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
now one of the big things I did on this

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.690 
now one of the big things I did on this
Gundam<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.050> didn't<00:02:10.740> do<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.100> my<00:02:11.250> wing<00:02:11.430> 0

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
Gundam that I didn't do on my wing 0

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.770 
Gundam that I didn't do on my wing 0
custom<00:02:12.240> is<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:13.319> lined<00:02:13.890> all<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:15.000> corners<00:02:15.600> and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
custom is I lined all the corners and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.260 
custom is I lined all the corners and
stuff<00:02:16.020> where<00:02:16.890> there's<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.310> rust<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.970> all

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
stuff where there's like rust and all

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.250 
stuff where there's like rust and all
that<00:02:18.870> with<00:02:19.530> silver<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:21.540> really<00:02:21.840> brought

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
that with silver and it really brought

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.460 
that with silver and it really brought
out<00:02:22.500> like<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:24.030> made<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.600> look<00:02:24.780> like<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.140> metal

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
out like it made it look like the metal

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.000 
out like it made it look like the metal
had<00:02:25.830> been<00:02:26.040> torn<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.730> all<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.950> where<00:02:28.950> it

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
had been torn and all that and where it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.710 
had been torn and all that and where it
was<00:02:29.100> just<00:02:29.280> like<00:02:29.430> real<00:02:29.640> damaged<00:02:30.060> especially<00:02:30.600> on

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
was just like real damaged especially on

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.990 
was just like real damaged especially on
the<00:02:30.810> head<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.140> looks<00:02:31.170> really<00:02:31.980> nice<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.550> think

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the head it looks really nice I think

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.449 
the head it looks really nice I think
and<00:02:33.680> like<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.709> said<00:02:34.830> I'm<00:02:34.950> not<00:02:35.070> sure<00:02:35.130> if<00:02:35.340> you'll

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
and like I said I'm not sure if you'll

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.770 
and like I said I'm not sure if you'll
be<00:02:35.550> able<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.760> see<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> pictures<00:02:36.510> real

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
be able to see it in the pictures real

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.130 
be able to see it in the pictures real
well<00:02:36.989> or<00:02:37.140> not<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:38.630> that's<00:02:39.630> something<00:02:40.020> about

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
well or not but that's something about

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.440 
well or not but that's something about
us<00:02:40.380> about<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:40.830> kit<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.580> did<00:02:42.209> for<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
us about this kit that I did for the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.640 
us about this kit that I did for the
first<00:02:42.600> time<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.230> one

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
first time on this one

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.390 
first time on this one
that<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.459> think<00:02:44.940> turned<00:02:45.180> out<00:02:45.300> real<00:02:45.510> well<00:02:45.660> on<00:02:46.400> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
that I think turned out real well on the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.660 
that I think turned out real well on the
diorama<00:02:47.640> itself<00:02:48.480> i<00:02:48.750> all<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.709> rocks<00:02:50.100> i<00:02:50.370> make<00:02:50.580> it

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
diorama itself i all the rocks i make it

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.100 
diorama itself i all the rocks i make it
out<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.790> like<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> plaster<00:02:51.660> thing<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.019> then

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
out of like a plaster thing and then

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.229 
out of like a plaster thing and then
painted<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:54.830> grass<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.250> all<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.670> was<00:02:56.880> just

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
painted the grass and all that was just

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.470 
painted the grass and all that was just
like<00:02:57.390> dried<00:02:58.100> dried<00:02:59.100> moss<00:02:59.430> or<00:02:59.700> something<00:03:00.390> like

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
like dried dried moss or something like

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.820 
like dried dried moss or something like
that<00:03:00.540> got<00:03:01.230> from<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.440> hobby<00:03:01.650> store<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.780> i<00:03:03.830> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
that got from a hobby store and i the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.350 
that got from a hobby store and i the
water<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.489> i<00:03:05.610> don't<00:03:05.760> think<00:03:05.820> it<00:03:05.970> looks<00:03:06.060> real

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
water on it i don't think it looks real

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.090 
water on it i don't think it looks real
good<00:03:06.390> but<00:03:06.660> i<00:03:06.900> was<00:03:07.050> just<00:03:07.230> experimenting<00:03:07.650> with

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
good but i was just experimenting with

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.070 
good but i was just experimenting with
some<00:03:08.280> things<00:03:08.519> because<00:03:09.420> i<00:03:09.510> didn't<00:03:09.720> really<00:03:09.840> know

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
some things because i didn't really know

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.130 
some things because i didn't really know
how<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.350> would<00:03:10.739> make<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.190> water<00:03:11.430> on<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.880> but<00:03:12.810> I

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
how I would make the water on it but I

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.259 
how I would make the water on it but I
ended<00:03:13.650> up<00:03:13.709> trying<00:03:14.010> out<00:03:14.310> just<00:03:14.489> like<00:03:14.610> candle<00:03:15.120> wax

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
ended up trying out just like candle wax

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.539 
ended up trying out just like candle wax
and<00:03:15.739> painting<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:16.920> then<00:03:17.070> putting<00:03:17.280> more<00:03:17.519> on

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
and painting it and then putting more on

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.699 
and painting it and then putting more on
the<00:03:17.760> top<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:19.079> mean<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.410> doesn't<00:03:19.590> look

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
the top and I mean it doesn't look

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.620 
the top and I mean it doesn't look
horrible<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.280> don't<00:03:20.489> think<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.269> could<00:03:21.540> have

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
horrible I don't think but it could have

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.930 
horrible I don't think but it could have
been<00:03:21.690> better<00:03:21.920> but<00:03:22.920> I<00:03:22.980> don't<00:03:23.130> have<00:03:23.400> any<00:03:23.610> of<00:03:23.790> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
been better but I don't have any of the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.960 
been better but I don't have any of the
like<00:03:24.299> actual<00:03:24.660> diorama<00:03:25.530> water<00:03:25.860> making<00:03:26.310> kit

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
like actual diorama water making kit

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.720 
like actual diorama water making kit
stuff<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.630> don't<00:03:28.590> have<00:03:28.680> anywhere<00:03:28.950> around<00:03:29.280> where

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
stuff I don't have anywhere around where

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.360 
stuff I don't have anywhere around where
I<00:03:29.760> live<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.239> get<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:30.510> kind<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.780> thing

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
I live to get that kind of thing

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.340 
I live to get that kind of thing
so<00:03:32.370> for<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.610> most<00:03:32.790> part<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.840> think<00:03:34.170> this

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
so for the most part I I think this

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.460 
so for the most part I I think this
turned<00:03:34.590> out<00:03:34.769> better<00:03:34.829> than<00:03:35.160> my<00:03:35.850> first<00:03:36.209> kit<00:03:36.510> the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
turned out better than my first kit the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.870 
turned out better than my first kit the
wings<00:03:37.709> you're<00:03:37.860> accustomed<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:40.459> know<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.579> lot

wings you're accustomed and I know a lot

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.640 
wings you're accustomed and I know a lot
of<00:03:41.910> people<00:03:42.239> don't<00:03:42.420> aren't<00:03:43.019> big<00:03:43.290> um<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.530> whole
