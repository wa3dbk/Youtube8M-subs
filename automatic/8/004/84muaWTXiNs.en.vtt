00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
multi colors we're going to use a number

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.029 
multi colors we're going to use a number
of<00:00:24.779> different<00:00:24.869> colors<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.680> give<00:00:25.800> something

works acrylics again but we're going to
dilute<00:00:35.219> these<00:00:35.640> slightly<00:00:36.210> now<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.020> soften<00:00:37.469> that

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
red down I'm going to put a small amount

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.319 
red down I'm going to put a small amount
of<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.079> brown<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.559> now<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.730> will<00:00:41.910> turn<00:00:42.149> it

of the brown in now that will turn it

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:56.210 
of the brown in now that will turn it
into<00:00:42.510> more<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.379> rusty<00:00:44.100> looking<00:00:44.399> color

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.680 

as<00:00:57.220> you<00:00:57.340> can<00:00:57.430> see<00:00:57.640> I<00:00:57.670> have<00:00:57.910> now<00:00:58.060> mixed<00:00:58.390> up<00:00:58.540> my

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
as you can see I have now mixed up my

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.920 
as you can see I have now mixed up my
colors<00:00:59.460> tone<00:01:00.460> matured<00:01:00.910> colors<00:01:01.300> together<00:01:01.480> here

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
colors tone matured colors together here

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.900 
colors tone matured colors together here
these<00:01:02.320> are<00:01:02.560> straight<00:01:02.860> colors<00:01:03.280> but<00:01:03.760> I've<00:01:03.880> just

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
these are straight colors but I've just

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.790 
these are straight colors but I've just
watered<00:01:04.450> them<00:01:04.600> down<00:01:04.809> just<00:01:05.140> that<00:01:05.320> slight

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
watered them down just that slight

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.410 
watered them down just that slight
little<00:01:05.860> bit<00:01:06.430> just<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.760> give<00:01:06.910> us<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.120> bit<00:01:07.240> of<00:01:07.270> an

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
little bit just to give us a bit of an

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.680 
little bit just to give us a bit of an
even<00:01:07.690> flow<00:01:07.870> and<00:01:08.910> as<00:01:09.910> I<00:01:10.060> was<00:01:10.180> saying<00:01:10.390> with<00:01:10.570> the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
even flow and as I was saying with the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.800 
even flow and as I was saying with the
black<00:01:10.900> we<00:01:11.200> just<00:01:11.440> finished<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.920> sides<00:01:12.190> off

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
black we just finished the sides off

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.670 
black we just finished the sides off
because<00:01:13.810> there's<00:01:13.990> always<00:01:14.110> some<00:01:14.440> paint

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
because there's always some paint

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.630 
because there's always some paint
running<00:01:15.070> over<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.400> edge<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:18.130> blend<00:01:18.460> it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
running over the edge and just blend it

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.150 
running over the edge and just blend it
in<00:01:18.760> just<00:01:19.150> like<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.360> did<00:01:19.630> on<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.870> top<00:01:20.160> this

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
in just like you did on the top this

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.680 
in just like you did on the top this
time<00:01:21.400> we're<00:01:21.580> going<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.760> have<00:01:21.910> more<00:01:22.360> Sun

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
time we're going to have more Sun

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.080 
time we're going to have more Sun
because<00:01:23.200> this<00:01:23.410> is<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:24.010> Sun<00:01:24.280> here<00:01:24.640> this<00:01:24.910> was

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
because this is the Sun here this was

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.170 
because this is the Sun here this was
just<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.480> reflection<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:27.220> we<00:01:27.400> need<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.790> put<00:01:28.030> a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
just the reflection so we need to put a

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.680 
just the reflection so we need to put a
lot<00:01:28.479> more<00:01:28.510> yellow<00:01:28.960> on<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.820> I'm<00:01:31.030> allowing<00:01:31.330> for

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
lot more yellow on and I'm allowing for

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.330 
lot more yellow on and I'm allowing for
the<00:01:31.780> Sun<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.140> be<00:01:32.170> here<00:01:32.530> with<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.770> reflection

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
the Sun to be here with the reflection

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.090 
the Sun to be here with the reflection
running<00:01:33.640> across<00:01:34.090> so<00:01:34.900> we<00:01:35.080> put<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.470> Sun<00:01:35.680> more<00:01:35.890> in

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
running across so we put the Sun more in

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.719 
running across so we put the Sun more in
the<00:01:36.220> middle<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.840> start<00:01:38.229> filling<00:01:39.130> in<00:01:39.460> the

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
the middle you start filling in the

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.240 
the middle you start filling in the
yellow<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.630> red<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.050> blending<00:01:41.500> now<00:01:42.160> we

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
yellow to the red and blending now we

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.490 
yellow to the red and blending now we
can<00:01:42.520> make<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.940> sunset<00:01:43.660> as<00:01:43.900> yellow<00:01:44.320> as<00:01:44.470> you

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
can make the sunset as yellow as you

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.609 
can make the sunset as yellow as you
like<00:01:44.860> or<00:01:45.130> we<00:01:45.520> can<00:01:45.729> really<00:01:46.119> soften<00:01:46.510> it<00:01:46.630> down<00:01:46.900> so

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
like or we can really soften it down so

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.920 
like or we can really soften it down so
it<00:01:47.770> just<00:01:48.010> depends<00:01:48.460> on<00:01:48.550> how<00:01:48.610> you<00:01:49.240> blend<00:01:49.510> and<00:01:49.750> mix

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
it just depends on how you blend and mix

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.859 
it just depends on how you blend and mix
now<00:01:50.590> we<00:01:50.650> do<00:01:50.979> this<00:01:51.280> with<00:01:51.760> very<00:01:51.790> light<00:01:52.450> brush

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
now we do this with very light brush

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.870 
now we do this with very light brush
strokes<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.920> know<00:01:54.010> something<00:01:54.430> that<00:01:54.460> we

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
strokes you know something that we

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.279 
strokes you know something that we
haven't<00:01:55.210> put<00:01:55.420> in<00:01:55.600> here<00:01:55.960> is<00:01:56.080> any<00:01:57.040> reflection

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
haven't put in here is any reflection

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.160 
haven't put in here is any reflection
from<00:01:59.289> here<00:01:59.789> this<00:02:00.789> is<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.030> beach<00:02:01.270> scene<00:02:01.660> this<00:02:02.020> is

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
from here this is a beach scene this is

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.830 
from here this is a beach scene this is
the<00:02:02.320> ocean<00:02:02.740> turning<00:02:03.550> in<00:02:03.670> tonight<00:02:03.970> so<00:02:04.630> we<00:02:04.720> just

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
the ocean turning in tonight so we just

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.540 
the ocean turning in tonight so we just
want<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.050> couple<00:02:05.229> of<00:02:05.350> waves<00:02:05.619> there<00:02:06.130> just<00:02:06.399> to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
want a couple of waves there just to

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.090 
want a couple of waves there just to
give<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.850> bit<00:02:07.000> of<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.179> feel<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:07.810> just<00:02:08.770> as<00:02:08.950> we

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
give it a bit of a feel and just as we
