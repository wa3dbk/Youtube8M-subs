00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.080
 and there guys ex gamer here again and 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.259
 today I wanted to show some of the game 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.990
 star trek it was produced by digital 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.430
 extremes and published by namco bandai 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.199
 games is available for pc xbox 360 and 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.060
 Playstation 3 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.300
 This game is based on the movie Star Trek. 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.590
 launched in 2009 and takes place after 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.080
 events in this movie 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.780
 after the success of the first film and with 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.520
 arrival of the second and now in June that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.059
 it was expected that one was released 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.309
 The game based on this series of movies is 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.250
 I played about three hours. 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.469
 of the game and have to say that unfortunately 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.230
 with a wide variety of games 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.210
 based on movies there is also no 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.120
 Big Deal 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.520
 The Star Trek is a third shooting game 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.260
 cooperative person in which you can 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.210
 choose between kirk and spock captain 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.129
 Unfortunately, this option 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.299
 Nothing changes in the game. 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.909
 in case you play with his partner 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.689
 will play with another character if not the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.549
 computer to assume this position is 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.650
 graphically how you can see the 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.460
 game is very simple and textures and details 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.439
 they are not the best and the game is full 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.710
 of bugs like I'll show you now 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.710
 there 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:55.170
 I see the sound part of the game 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:58.110
 It's cool, shall we say, the weapons and the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.820
 sound effects reminds the movie of 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.130
 It's not a voiceover made by the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.409
 actors actors of the film state what was 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.319
 very cool and we bring the actors 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.149
 the movie is a pity that the 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.489
 facial movement of the characters does not 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.420
 it seems natural that mk tells us 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.420
 quite strange 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.850
 the game has a fairly varied gameplay 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.290
 only it is very simple is the combat 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.290
 as you can see now there 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.860
 a system of equipment upgrades 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.920
 that uses little experience that you 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.330
 wins the game either by eliminating some 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.200
 enemies discover some items scan 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.580
 some items with the equipment finally the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.580
 from platform 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.610
 some puzzles to unlock 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:19.910
 doors and disable devices all right 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:22.550
 simple and even a combat part 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.640
 space that is really nothing more than a 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:31.610
 mini game and aim and draw water not 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:34.400
 has nothing innovative about it but even with 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.890
 this variety the game in my opinion 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.920
 can not hold the attention and is 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.320
 quite clever a try 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.120
 failure to make a game in style 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.720
 more effect 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.020
 only the star trek universe in general 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.770
 I do not recommend the game. 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.050
 especially when the game has a 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.300
 price equal to games the games 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.610
 excellent and how the tube rider is 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.370
 leaving for the same price and in steam 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.930
 the version for PC which is a shame since the 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.200
 quality of the two is totally 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.970
 different and they are charging in a 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:14.000
 price that I find kind of absurd for a 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:16.400
 half- mouth game that is the star trek is good 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.260
 This video was not meant to be very long. 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.049
 your child from my first 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.500
 first impressions regarding the game 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:27.320
 unfortunately not only the best then I 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.690
 ending the video here and hope 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.510
 You liked the video at least 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.580
 It was informative, that's it, people. 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.240
 See you 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.240
 went
