00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
the sticky from the sides and I have the

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.950 
the sticky from the sides and I have the
orientation<00:00:33.129> that<00:00:33.160> you<00:00:33.399> see<00:00:33.760> closely

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.319 

this<00:00:39.590> guy

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.740 

there's<00:00:42.930> two<00:00:43.200> sides<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.860> one<00:00:44.129> side<00:00:44.719> has<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
there's two sides of it one side has a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.360 
there's two sides of it one side has a
bottom<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:46.379> side<00:00:46.530> at<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> top<00:00:46.920> one<00:00:47.190> sides

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
bottom on one side at the top one sides

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.910 
bottom on one side at the top one sides
bigger<00:00:47.730> than<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.970> other<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.020> fits<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
bigger than the other and it fits in the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.960 
bigger than the other and it fits in the
footprint<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:51.500> like<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.940> don't

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
footprint just like that so you don't

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.040 
footprint just like that so you don't
want<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.269> get<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.449> make<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> step<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.840> want<00:00:54.989> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
want to get that make a step you want to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
want to get that make a step you want to
make<00:00:55.140> sure<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.500> taller<00:00:55.769> tab<00:00:56.160> we've<00:00:56.760> had

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
make sure that the taller tab we've had

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.990 
make sure that the taller tab we've had
this<00:00:57.059> longer<00:00:57.780> goes<00:00:58.589> on<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.769> top<00:00:59.040> it<00:00:59.790> should

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
this longer goes on the top it should

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.850 
this longer goes on the top it should
just<00:01:00.180> fit<00:01:00.449> right<00:01:00.839> into<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.140> hole<00:01:01.409> if<00:01:01.739> it

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
just fit right into that hole if it

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.430 
just fit right into that hole if it
doesn't<00:01:02.100> fit<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.489> its<00:01:02.790> kind<00:01:02.970> of<00:01:03.199> sitting<00:01:04.199> on

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
doesn't fit in its kind of sitting on

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.780 
doesn't fit in its kind of sitting on
level<00:01:04.860> then<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.430> you're<00:01:05.580> having

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
level then you know that you're having

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.249 
level then you know that you're having
it<00:01:05.880> backwards<00:01:06.300> so<00:01:06.479> make<00:01:06.750> sure<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.900> sitting

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
it backwards so make sure that sitting

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.639 
it backwards so make sure that sitting
correctly<00:01:09.050> then<00:01:10.050> also<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.380> want<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> make

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
correctly then also you want to make

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.370 
correctly then also you want to make
sure<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:11.100> ribbon<00:01:11.340> cables<00:01:11.759> are<00:01:11.909> all<00:01:12.000> in

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
sure that your ribbon cables are all in

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.800 
sure that your ribbon cables are all in
nicely<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:14.250> added<00:01:14.490> some<00:01:14.880> extra<00:01:15.619> tape<00:01:16.619> here

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
nicely I have added some extra tape here

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.790 
nicely I have added some extra tape here
here<00:01:18.810> here<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:20.009> then<00:01:21.259> gone<00:01:22.259> ahead<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.530> put

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
here here and then gone ahead and put

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.859 
here here and then gone ahead and put
tape<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.789> along<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.390> edges<00:01:25.850> you<00:01:26.850> see<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.600> this

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
tape all along the edges you see on this

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.870 
tape all along the edges you see on this
side<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.259> can't<00:01:28.560> see<00:01:28.710> any<00:01:28.890> black<00:01:29.250> along<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
side you can't see any black along the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.260 
side you can't see any black along the
rim<00:01:30.149> but<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.050> have<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> edge<00:01:32.610> so

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
rim but I have it just on the edge so

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.960 
rim but I have it just on the edge so
that<00:01:33.300> it's<00:01:34.020> as<00:01:34.229> close<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> glass<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.759> you

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that it's as close to the glass that you

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.889 
that it's as close to the glass that you
see<00:01:36.090> there<00:01:36.270> as<00:01:36.360> possible<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:39.420> tape<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.810> I'm

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
see there as possible the tape that I'm

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.590 
see there as possible the tape that I'm
using<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.500> probably<00:01:41.009> seen<00:01:41.280> online<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:42.360> just

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
using you probably seen online it's just

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.940 
using you probably seen online it's just
this<00:01:42.750> roll<00:01:43.080> of<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.590> thin<00:01:44.000> tape<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.950> black

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
this roll of really thin tape it's black

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.389 
this roll of really thin tape it's black
on<00:01:47.160> one<00:01:47.280> side<00:01:48.110> has<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.470> white<00:01:49.709> peel<00:01:50.009> up<00:01:50.130> there

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
on one side has the white peel up there

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.339 
on one side has the white peel up there
so<00:01:51.179> this<00:01:51.390> stuff's<00:01:51.569> pretty<00:01:51.720> good<00:01:51.989> if<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.170> want

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
so this stuff's pretty good if you want

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.949 
so this stuff's pretty good if you want
to<00:01:52.440> use<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.819> I'll<00:01:53.819> show<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.179> some<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:54.690> pros

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
to use it I'll show you some the pros

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.139 
to use it I'll show you some the pros
and<00:01:55.080> cons<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.590> using<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.920> method<00:01:56.280> instead<00:01:57.060> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
and cons to using this method instead of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.529 
and cons to using this method instead of
going<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.569> back<00:01:57.720> down<00:01:57.959> with<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.670> type<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> UV

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
going it back down with the type of UV

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:01.820 
going it back down with the type of UV
adhesive<00:02:01.050> or<00:02:01.140> something<00:02:01.410> that<00:02:01.530> you've<00:02:01.619> seen

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
adhesive or something that you've seen

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.940 
adhesive or something that you've seen
before<00:02:03.500> all<00:02:04.500> right<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.800> guy<00:02:06.319> goes<00:02:07.319> ahead<00:02:07.530> it

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
before all right this guy goes ahead it

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.580 
before all right this guy goes ahead it
goes<00:02:08.160> into<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.640> glass

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.770 

again<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:15.030> one<00:02:15.270> has<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:16.020> bottom<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.400> top

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
again this one has a bottom and a top

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.570 
again this one has a bottom and a top
the<00:02:18.780> bottom<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.670> going<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.760> be<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
the bottom is going to be the the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:31.180 
the bottom is going to be the the
thicker<00:02:24.180> side<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:27.239> go<00:02:27.510> ahead<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:28.010> put<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.190> in

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
thicker side so go ahead and put that in

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.259 
thicker side so go ahead and put that in
you<00:02:32.190> don't<00:02:32.340> want<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.519> make<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.940> want<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.120> make

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
you don't want to make you want to make

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.360 
you don't want to make you want to make
sure<00:02:33.390> not<00:02:33.599> put<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.050> backwards<00:02:34.500> because

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
sure not put that in backwards because

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.740 
sure not put that in backwards because
that'll<00:02:35.760> get<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.030> trouble<00:02:36.120> as<00:02:36.330> well<00:02:36.450> if<00:02:36.660> it

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
that'll get you in trouble as well if it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.910 
that'll get you in trouble as well if it
doesn't<00:02:37.019> fit<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.290> you're<00:02:37.380> trying<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.590> push<00:02:37.769> it

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
doesn't fit and you're trying to push it

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.800 
doesn't fit and you're trying to push it
down<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.880> actually<00:02:39.000> crack<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.540> glass

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
down you can actually crack the glass

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.800 
down you can actually crack the glass
again<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.030> again<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.330> said<00:02:42.450> have<00:02:42.569> cleaned

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
again so again like I said have cleaned

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.360 
again so again like I said have cleaned
off<00:02:42.959> everything<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:43.709> I'm<00:02:43.890> not<00:02:44.040> going<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.250> waste

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
off everything so I'm not going to waste

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.120 
off everything so I'm not going to waste
your<00:02:44.430> time<00:02:44.580> doing<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.849> so<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.739> can<00:02:46.739> peel<00:02:47.010> these

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
your time doing that so I can peel these

00:02:47.130 --> 00:03:09.910 
your time doing that so I can peel these
off<00:02:47.310> now

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.150 

and<00:03:10.400> I've<00:03:10.490> cut<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:11.410> corners<00:03:12.410> at<00:03:12.530> 45-degree

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
and I've cut the corners at 45-degree

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.180 
and I've cut the corners at 45-degree
angles<00:03:13.460> so<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.670> they<00:03:13.760> fit<00:03:14.030> together<00:03:14.120> nicely

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
angles so that they fit together nicely

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.260 
angles so that they fit together nicely
you<00:03:16.190> don't<00:03:16.370> necessarily<00:03:16.490> have<00:03:16.850> to<00:03:17.030> do<00:03:17.120> that

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
you don't necessarily have to do that

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:24.820 
you don't necessarily have to do that
just<00:03:17.920> something<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.690> did

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.170 

all<00:03:25.400> right<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:26.360> now<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.980> tape<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.520> ready

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.960 
to get stuck on there I'm gonna just one
more<00:03:33.080> time<00:03:33.440> look<00:03:34.130> over<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:34.520> make<00:03:34.790> sure

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
there's a couple of pieces of wood that

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.990 
there's a couple of pieces of wood that
landed<00:03:47.140> so<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.230> could<00:03:48.380> pick<00:03:48.500> up<00:03:48.680> this<00:03:48.970> make<00:03:49.970> sure

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
landed so I could pick up this make sure

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.280 
landed so I could pick up this make sure
it's<00:03:50.330> a<00:03:50.420> spotless<00:03:51.020> as<00:03:51.200> possible<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:57.200> way

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
it's a spotless as possible that way

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.230 
it's a spotless as possible that way
when<00:03:57.440> I<00:03:57.470> close<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:57.890> up<00:03:58.160> there's<00:03:58.430> nothing<00:03:58.910> in

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
when I close it up there's nothing in

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:07.050 
when I close it up there's nothing in
between<00:03:59.800> the<00:04:00.800> lens<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:01.820> LCD<00:04:03.910> all<00:04:04.910> right

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
between the lens and the LCD all right

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.730 
between the lens and the LCD all right
