noticed in fifa 12 is that chipping the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.630 
noticed in fifa 12 is that chipping the
keeper<00:00:30.539> seems<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.990> lot<00:00:31.260> harder<00:00:31.500> there<00:00:32.489> are<00:00:32.610> a

keeper seems a lot harder there are a
few<00:00:32.880> different<00:00:33.000> animations<00:00:33.750> for<00:00:33.960> chipping

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
the keeper this time round but for some

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.299 
the keeper this time round but for some
reason<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.020> seems<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.590> lot<00:00:37.890> harder<00:00:38.160> I

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
reason it just seems a lot harder I

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.369 
reason it just seems a lot harder I
don't<00:00:38.640> know<00:00:38.790> why<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.210> or<00:00:39.719> whatever<00:00:40.020> but

i felt those know

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.220 
i felt those know
I'm<00:02:13.769> really<00:02:14.010> having<00:02:14.189> him<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.700> team

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
I'm really having him in the team

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.899 
I'm really having him in the team
Sissoko<00:02:16.230> has<00:02:16.379> 86<00:02:16.980> pace<00:02:17.250> now<00:02:17.430> that's<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.730> lot<00:02:17.879> of

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
Sissoko has 86 pace now that's a lot of

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.780 
Sissoko has 86 pace now that's a lot of
pace<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:19.109> plan<00:02:19.379> on<00:02:19.530> using<00:02:19.680> Sissoko<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.609> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
pace and I plan on using Sissoko in the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.000 
pace and I plan on using Sissoko in the
center<00:02:21.120> defensive<00:02:21.569> midfield<00:02:21.959> role<00:02:22.079> he's<00:02:22.769> got

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
center defensive midfield role he's got

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.860 
center defensive midfield role he's got
like<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.609> said<00:02:23.790> he's<00:02:23.909> got<00:02:24.060> good<00:02:24.269> pace<00:02:24.510> on<00:02:24.750> him

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
like I said he's got good pace on him

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.110 
like I said he's got good pace on him
and<00:02:25.019> he's<00:02:25.500> actually<00:02:25.650> got<00:02:25.890> i<00:02:26.010> believe<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.549> 85

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
and he's actually got i believe it's 85

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.330 
and he's actually got i believe it's 85
defending<00:02:27.719> so<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.140> mean<00:02:28.469> he<00:02:28.590> can<00:02:28.769> get<00:02:28.890> back<00:02:29.069> and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
defending so I mean he can get back and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.309 
defending so I mean he can get back and
help<00:02:29.370> out<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.969> back<00:02:30.120> as<00:02:30.299> well<00:02:30.329> so<00:02:30.689> that<00:02:30.870> was<00:02:31.200> so

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
help out the back as well so that was so

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.809 
help out the back as well so that was so
but<00:02:31.469> that<00:02:31.590> was<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.799> plan<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.219> why<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.400> had<00:02:32.609> him

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
but that was the plan and why I had him

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.160 
but that was the plan and why I had him
and<00:02:33.000> I'm<00:02:33.060> just<00:02:33.239> fast<00:02:33.450> forwarding<00:02:33.870> all<00:02:33.989> this

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
and I'm just fast forwarding all this

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.720 
and I'm just fast forwarding all this
because<00:02:34.290> penalties<00:02:35.040> usually<00:02:35.400> do<00:02:35.519> take<00:02:35.700> a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
because penalties usually do take a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.849 
because penalties usually do take a
little<00:02:35.909> while<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.359> I<00:02:36.389> just<00:02:36.569> decided<00:02:36.719> it<00:02:37.049> fast

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
little while so I just decided it fast

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.039 
little while so I just decided it fast
forward<00:02:38.129> but<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.489> decided<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.150> let<00:02:39.450> Gonzalez

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
forward but I decided to let Gonzalez

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.690 
forward but I decided to let Gonzalez
step<00:02:40.260> up<00:02:40.439> here<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.889> get<00:02:41.159> a<00:02:41.189> goal<00:02:41.400> for<00:02:41.549> himself

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
step up here and get a goal for himself

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.910 
step up here and get a goal for himself
I<00:02:42.120> usually<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:42.870> don't<00:02:43.200> know<00:02:43.290> why<00:02:43.439> it<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.620> it's<00:02:43.859> a

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
I usually I don't know why it is it's a

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.490 
I usually I don't know why it is it's a
bit<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.129> OCD<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.849> I<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.870> make<00:02:46.019> sure<00:02:46.079> each

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
bit of OCD but I like to make sure each

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.530 
bit of OCD but I like to make sure each
player<00:02:46.799> gets<00:02:46.829> their<00:02:47.250> fair<00:02:47.459> chance<00:02:47.819> Eagles<00:02:48.239> so

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
player gets their fair chance Eagles so

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.690 
player gets their fair chance Eagles so
for<00:02:49.139> example<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.530> Briana's<00:02:49.980> got<00:02:50.159> a<00:02:50.189> few<00:02:50.489> in<00:02:50.609> the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
for example if Briana's got a few in the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.830 
for example if Briana's got a few in the
game<00:02:50.849> then<00:02:51.030> i'll<00:02:51.120> give<00:02:51.269> it<00:02:51.299> to<00:02:51.419> someone<00:02:51.510> else

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
game then i'll give it to someone else

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.869 
game then i'll give it to someone else
just<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.260> be<00:02:52.349> kind<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:52.919> that's<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.549> a<00:02:53.700> weird

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
just to be kind but that's just a weird

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.960 
just to be kind but that's just a weird
sort<00:02:54.629> of<00:02:54.720> OCD<00:02:55.230> thing<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.709> have<00:02:55.980> and

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
sort of OCD thing that I have and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.879 
sort of OCD thing that I have and
unfortunately<00:02:57.599> get<00:02:57.750> another<00:02:58.109> penalty<00:02:58.500> here

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
unfortunately get another penalty here

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.800 
unfortunately get another penalty here
if<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.700> wasn't<00:02:59.849> for<00:03:00.000> penalties<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.569> don't<00:03:00.750> know

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
if it wasn't for penalties I don't know

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.240 
if it wasn't for penalties I don't know
how<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:00.959> would<00:03:01.139> have<00:03:01.230> done<00:03:01.409> in<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.680> game<00:03:01.889> but<00:03:02.069> I

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
how I would have done in this game but I

one<00:03:27.060> obviously<00:03:27.569> depends<00:03:28.229> on<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.409> angle<00:03:28.560> and

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
one obviously depends on the angle and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.399 
one obviously depends on the angle and
it<00:03:29.459> depends<00:03:29.790> on<00:03:29.909> the<00:03:29.970> entire<00:03:30.269> situation<00:03:30.540> but

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
it depends on the entire situation but

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.500 
it depends on the entire situation but
for<00:03:31.439> me<00:03:31.739> briand<00:03:32.189> he<00:03:32.489> has<00:03:32.579> got<00:03:32.760> great<00:03:32.909> finishing

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
for me briand he has got great finishing

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.259 
for me briand he has got great finishing
and<00:03:33.689> I<00:03:33.750> do<00:03:33.810> recommend<00:03:34.260> just<00:03:34.949> using<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.639> what

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
and I do recommend just using the what

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.849 
and I do recommend just using the what
you<00:03:36.299> call<00:03:36.419> it<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.780> right<00:03:37.109> bumpers<00:03:37.560> for<00:03:37.769> the

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
you call it the right bumpers for the

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.559 
you call it the right bumpers for the
finesse<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.430> as<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:38.909> can<00:03:39.030> see<00:03:39.060> GU<00:03:39.329> cough

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
finesse and as you can see GU cough

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.599 
finesse and as you can see GU cough
smashes<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.139> in<00:03:40.260> which<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.650> good<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.400> see<00:03:41.430> that

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
smashes it in which is good to see that

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.729 
smashes it in which is good to see that
you<00:03:41.790> can<00:03:41.970> do<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.180> but<00:03:42.359> as<00:03:42.449> you<00:03:42.840> can<00:03:42.930> see<00:03:43.139> i<00:03:43.169> often

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
you can do it but as you can see i often

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.050 
you can do it but as you can see i often
use<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.919> finesse<00:03:44.340> when<00:03:44.519> i<00:03:44.549> take<00:03:44.759> it<00:03:44.939> round

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
use the finesse when i take it round

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.330 
use the finesse when i take it round
keepers<00:03:45.509> and<00:03:45.659> I<00:03:46.319> might<00:03:46.590> start<00:03:46.889> using<00:03:47.129> the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
keepers and I might start using the

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.429 
keepers and I might start using the
powershot<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.359> bit<00:03:48.629> more<00:03:48.870> when<00:03:49.049> it<00:03:49.139> comes<00:03:49.319> up

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 
powershot a bit more when it comes up

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.619 
powershot a bit more when it comes up
two<00:03:49.560> goalkeepers<00:03:49.799> because<00:03:50.459> gold<00:03:50.790> keepers

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
two goalkeepers because gold keepers

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.780 
two goalkeepers because gold keepers
because<00:03:51.959> i<00:03:51.989> find<00:03:52.349> that<00:03:52.530> finish<00:03:53.400> shots<00:03:53.609> around

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
because i find that finish shots around

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.039 
because i find that finish shots around
bronze<00:03:54.120> keepers<00:03:54.509> are<00:03:54.629> doable<00:03:54.840> because

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
bronze keepers are doable because

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.740 
bronze keepers are doable because
they're<00:03:55.290> diving<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.949> reflexes<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.639> it<00:03:57.090> isn't

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
they're diving and reflexes a it isn't

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.240 
they're diving and reflexes a it isn't
as<00:03:57.840> high<00:03:57.959> but<00:03:58.169> when<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.349> come<00:03:58.439> across<00:03:58.709> gold

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
as high but when you come across gold

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.640 
as high but when you come across gold
keepers<00:03:59.699> you<00:03:59.819> will<00:03:59.970> find<00:04:00.299> that<00:04:00.540> they<00:04:01.109> do<00:04:01.169> stop

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
keepers you will find that they do stop

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.890 
keepers you will find that they do stop
a<00:04:01.829> lot<00:04:02.009> more<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.340> your<00:04:02.609> finesses<00:04:03.120> but<00:04:03.299> if<00:04:03.750> you

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
a lot more of your finesses but if you

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.210 
a lot more of your finesses but if you
look<00:04:04.049> at<00:04:04.199> here<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:04.409> guys<00:04:04.530> see<00:04:04.799> i'm<00:04:04.979> always

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
look at here you guys see i'm always

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.069 
look at here you guys see i'm always
choosing<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.909> ones<00:04:06.090> with<00:04:06.299> lower<00:04:06.449> chemistry

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
choosing the ones with lower chemistry

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.809 
choosing the ones with lower chemistry
and<00:04:07.199> that's<00:04:07.379> what<00:04:07.530> i've<00:04:07.620> done<00:04:07.769> here<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:08.639> gives

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
and that's what i've done here it gives

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.050 
and that's what i've done here it gives
myself<00:04:09.209> an<00:04:09.329> advantage<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.250> so<00:04:11.250> i<00:04:11.280> think<00:04:11.790> it

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
myself an advantage and so i think it

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.520 
myself an advantage and so i think it
was<00:04:12.209> i<00:04:12.449> think<00:04:12.840> it's<00:04:12.930> an<00:04:13.019> important<00:04:13.379> thing<00:04:13.500> to

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
was i think it's an important thing to

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.430 
was i think it's an important thing to
do<00:04:13.739> but<00:04:14.340> i<00:04:14.400> come<00:04:14.609> up<00:04:14.729> against<00:04:15.440> Javier
