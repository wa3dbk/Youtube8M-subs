I don't know I never tried this hair
before<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.009> I'm<00:01:47.159> often<00:01:47.850> scared<00:01:48.570> when<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.810> try

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
before and I'm often scared when I try

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.929 
before and I'm often scared when I try
new<00:01:49.140> hairs<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.189> some<00:01:50.310> reason<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> just

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
new hairs but for some reason I just

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.120 
new hairs but for some reason I just
thought<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:52.409> was<00:01:52.590> gonna<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.829> really

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
thought that this was gonna be really

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.969 
thought that this was gonna be really
good<00:01:53.369> hair<00:01:53.610> because<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.439> came<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> box

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
good hair because it came in the box

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.609 
good hair because it came in the box
instead<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.060> regular<00:01:57.090> packet<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.110> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
instead of just a regular packet and it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.709
