that's<00:05:16.380> been<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:17.250> spirit<00:05:17.790> of<00:05:17.940> downtown<00:05:18.780> LA

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.920 
that's been the spirit of downtown LA
for<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:20.010> lot<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.640> years<00:05:21.030> it<00:05:21.360> doesn't<00:05:21.720> matter

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
for a lot of years it doesn't matter

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.360 
for a lot of years it doesn't matter
whether<00:05:22.200> what<00:05:22.470> you're<00:05:22.650> doing<00:05:23.160> is<00:05:23.250> really

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
whether what you're doing is really

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.760 
whether what you're doing is really
commercially<00:05:24.090> viable<00:05:24.270> you<00:05:24.780> just<00:05:25.020> try<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.590> make

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
commercially viable you just try to make

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.520 
commercially viable you just try to make
it<00:05:25.919> happen<00:05:26.040> by<00:05:26.430> any<00:05:26.580> means<00:05:26.820> necessary<00:05:27.080> you<00:05:28.080> as

it happen by any means necessary you as
an<00:05:28.680> LA<00:05:28.950> artist<00:05:29.310> don't<00:05:29.640> feel<00:05:30.090> pushed<00:05:30.840> to<00:05:31.380> go<00:05:32.310> in

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
an LA artist don't feel pushed to go in

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.480 
an LA artist don't feel pushed to go in
a<00:05:32.520> specific<00:05:32.669> direction<00:05:33.630> I<00:05:33.810> think<00:05:33.990> that<00:05:34.490> my
