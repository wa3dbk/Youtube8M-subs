00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
at cards now to me the quintessential

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.250 
at cards now to me the quintessential
cheating<00:01:04.439> concept<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.129> think<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.580> stacking<00:01:06.260> one

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
cheating concept I think is stacking one

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.210 
cheating concept I think is stacking one
hand<00:01:07.670> like<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> four<00:01:09.090> aces<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:10.560> fall<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.979> me<00:01:11.130> in

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
hand like the four aces to fall to me in

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.450 
hand like the four aces to fall to me in
a<00:01:11.310> game<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.700> cards<00:01:12.229> but<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.830> doesn't<00:01:14.070> seem

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
a game of cards but it just doesn't seem

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.560 
a game of cards but it just doesn't seem
it<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.390> doesn't<00:01:15.659> seem<00:01:15.810> sporting<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.710> mean

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
it just doesn't seem sporting I mean

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.640 
it just doesn't seem sporting I mean
there<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:18.659> magicians<00:01:18.780> I'm<00:01:19.320> sorry<00:01:19.530> they're

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
there are magicians I'm sorry they're

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.929 
there are magicians I'm sorry they're
gamblers<00:01:20.100> we're<00:01:20.250> gonna<00:01:20.340> actually<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.759> that

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
gamblers we're gonna actually do that

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.630 
gamblers we're gonna actually do that
stuff<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.540> think<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.439> much<00:01:22.619> more<00:01:22.680> magical<00:01:23.460> if

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
stuff I think it's much more magical if

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.740 
stuff I think it's much more magical if
we<00:01:23.759> take<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.119> four<00:01:24.330> aces

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
we take the four aces

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.429 
we take the four aces
first<00:01:25.619> lose<00:01:25.950> them<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> deck<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:27.439> then

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
first lose them in the deck then then

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.760 
first lose them in the deck then then
then<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> think<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.670> enough<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.840> where<00:01:31.680> you

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
then I think it's enough of a where you

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.640 
then I think it's enough of a where you
say<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> challenge<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.810> get<00:01:33.960> those<00:01:34.140> four<00:01:34.439> aces

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
say a challenge to get those four aces

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.069 
say a challenge to get those four aces
to<00:01:34.979> fall<00:01:35.299> to<00:01:36.299> our<00:01:36.840> hero<00:01:37.250> that'll<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.369> me<00:01:38.549> today

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
to fall to our hero that'll be me today

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.190 
to fall to our hero that'll be me today
in<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> course<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.729> game<00:01:42.020> so<00:01:43.020> not

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
in the in the course of a game so not

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.410 
in the in the course of a game so not
only<00:01:43.439> do<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.710> yeah<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.909> think<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.329> more

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
only do we yeah I just think it's more

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.319 
only do we yeah I just think it's more
fair<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.780> way<00:01:45.950> we<00:01:46.950> lose<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.369> aces<00:01:47.700> shuffle

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
fair that way we lose the aces shuffle

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.090 
fair that way we lose the aces shuffle
them<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> couple<00:01:48.689> times<00:01:48.810> give<00:01:49.710> them<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> straight

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
them a couple times give them a straight

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.149 
them a couple times give them a straight
cut<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.960> then<00:01:52.280> let's<00:01:53.280> see<00:01:53.869> if<00:01:54.869> uncle<00:01:55.439> Kent<00:01:55.829> is

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
cut and then let's see if uncle Kent is

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.069 
cut and then let's see if uncle Kent is
lucky<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> great<00:01:58.020> gambler<00:01:59.570> I'm<00:02:00.570> thinking

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
lucky or a great gambler I'm thinking

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.340 
lucky or a great gambler I'm thinking
what<00:02:01.530> probably<00:02:02.009> won't<00:02:02.219> cut<00:02:02.610> it

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
what probably won't cut it

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.140 
what probably won't cut it
but<00:02:04.350> nonetheless<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:05.280> me<00:02:06.799> this
