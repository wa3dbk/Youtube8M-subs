00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
exactly sure let's go back maybe it's a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.960 
exactly sure let's go back maybe it's a
suit<00:01:10.100> maybe<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.640> not<00:01:11.880> sure<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:13.970> actually

no he looks the same it's just that his
suit<00:01:17.820> kind<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.270> makes<00:01:18.450> them<00:01:18.600> look<00:01:18.659> bigger<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
suit kind of makes them look bigger in a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.020 
suit kind of makes them look bigger in a
way<00:01:21.799> so<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> back<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:23.460> you're<00:01:23.610> wondering

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
way so the back if you're wondering

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.440 
way so the back if you're wondering
that's<00:01:24.150> what<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.450> looks<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:27.030> coloring

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
that's what it looks like the coloring

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.060 
that's what it looks like the coloring
is<00:01:27.689> much<00:01:28.020> darker<00:01:28.470> compared<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> other<00:01:29.850> one

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.010 

370<00:01:35.070> power<00:01:35.340> index<00:01:35.970> science<00:01:36.900> class<00:01:38.689> 1674<00:01:39.689> is

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
370 power index science class 1674 is

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.200 
370 power index science class 1674 is
the<00:01:40.650> half<00:01:41.600> 155<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.439> attack<00:01:43.880> safeguard<00:01:44.880> is

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
the half 155 as the attack safeguard is

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.950 
the half 155 as the attack safeguard is
the<00:01:45.479> ability<00:01:45.750> special<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.860> guess<00:01:47.820> what<00:01:48.329> he<00:01:48.509> does

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the ability special I guess what he does

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.069 
the ability special I guess what he does
have<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.920> different<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.640> bleed<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.960> this

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
have that is different is bleed so this

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.590 
have that is different is bleed so this
guy<00:01:52.259> can<00:01:52.320> bleed<00:01:52.710> his<00:01:53.549> second<00:01:53.970> attack<00:01:54.210> bleeds

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
guy can bleed his second attack bleeds

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.810 
guy can bleed his second attack bleeds
apparently<00:01:55.110> not<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.219> that's<00:01:56.549> too

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
apparently not that that's too

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.880 
apparently not that that's too
interesting<00:01:57.420> because<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.560> know<00:01:58.590> they

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
interesting because it you know they

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.249 
interesting because it you know they
they<00:01:59.189> didn't<00:01:59.399> want<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.759> make<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.180> rehash<00:02:00.630> they

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
they didn't want to make a rehash they

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.530 
they didn't want to make a rehash they
didn't<00:02:01.469> want<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.680> go<00:02:01.770> hey<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.759> guys<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.270> put

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
didn't want to go hey you guys just put

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
another skin on it right so they did it

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.270 
another skin on it right so they did it

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
they didn't want you to say that that's

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.910 
they didn't want you to say that that's
why<00:02:08.520> they<00:02:08.879> added<00:02:09.000> bleed<00:02:09.479> into<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.440> second

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
why they added bleed into the second

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.430 
why they added bleed into the second
attack<00:02:11.280> which<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.760> she'll<00:02:12.480> toss

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
attack which is she'll toss

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.650 
attack which is she'll toss
he<00:02:13.890> has<00:02:13.980> no<00:02:14.130> bonuses<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.850> don't<00:02:15.330> see<00:02:15.450> anything

does<00:02:37.440> have<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:41.250> stars<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.850> different<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.330> think

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950

the<00:02:43.950> shield

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
the shield

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.850 
the shield
the<00:02:44.940> thing<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.360> World<00:02:45.930> War<00:02:46.140> two<00:02:46.350> Captain

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.130 
the thing is World War two Captain
America<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.220> think<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.550> shield<00:02:48.020> should<00:02:49.020> be

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
America I think the shield should be

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.830 
America I think the shield should be
different<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.830> markings<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.420> yeah<00:02:51.510> how

here
I<00:03:34.370> am<00:03:35.370> looking<00:03:35.790> for<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:37.280> guess<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.640> countless

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
I am looking for I guess this countless

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.970 
I am looking for I guess this countless
so<00:03:39.330> might<00:03:39.540> as<00:03:39.660> well<00:03:39.690> just<00:03:39.900> do<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.170> run<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.650> quick

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
so might as well just do a run a quick

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.090 
so might as well just do a run a quick
run<00:03:41.360> we<00:03:42.360> were<00:03:42.480> going<00:03:42.780> through<00:03:42.990> the<00:03:43.590> stage<00:03:43.860> with

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
run we were going through the stage with

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.100 
run we were going through the stage with
the<00:03:44.220> iron<00:03:44.400> patriot<00:03:45.209> but<00:03:45.330> now<00:03:45.540> we<00:03:45.600> have<00:03:45.900> the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
thing nothing keep different here we do

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.500 
thing nothing keep different here we do
have<00:04:34.630> a<00:04:34.840> bonus<00:04:35.430> which<00:04:36.430> I<00:04:36.580> don't<00:04:36.790> I<00:04:36.970> don't<00:04:37.300> know

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510

if it's good or bad

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.879
