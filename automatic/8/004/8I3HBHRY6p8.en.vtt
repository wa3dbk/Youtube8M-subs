know unitard kind of thing basically and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.720 
know unitard kind of thing basically and
I<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.469> reading<00:00:55.710> comments<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.399> people<00:00:56.640> were

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
I was reading comments and people were

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.189 
I was reading comments and people were
saying<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.180> were<00:00:57.210> having<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.629> lot<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.809> issues

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
saying they were having a lot of issues

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.830 
saying they were having a lot of issues
with<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> fit<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.820> think<00:01:00.449> they<00:01:00.570> were<00:01:00.660> just

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
with the fit but I think they were just

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.569 
with the fit but I think they were just
ordering<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> wrong<00:01:01.410> size<00:01:01.649> because<00:01:02.129> it's

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
ordering the wrong size because it's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.980 
ordering the wrong size because it's
just<00:01:02.879> fine<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:06.260> this<00:01:07.260> fits<00:01:08.869> perfectly<00:01:09.869> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
just fine like this fits perfectly I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.630 
just fine like this fits perfectly I
mean<00:01:10.290> people<00:01:10.680> were<00:01:10.770> saying<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> stitching

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
mean people were saying the stitching

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640 
mean people were saying the stitching
was<00:01:11.760> breaking<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.630> they're<00:01:13.229> having<00:01:13.320> all

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
was breaking and they're having all

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.460 
was breaking and they're having all
kinds<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.159> issues<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.869> wore<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> dress<00:01:15.960> like

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
kinds of issues but I wore a dress like

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.230 
kinds of issues but I wore a dress like
half<00:01:16.650> now<00:01:16.890> when<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.220> first<00:01:17.460> got<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.180> I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
half now when I first got it to see if I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.539 
half now when I first got it to see if I
could<00:01:18.299> try<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.540> break<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> stitch<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:20.340> could

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
could try to break a stitch so I could

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.980 
could try to break a stitch so I could
just<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.850> my<00:01:21.030> boyfriend's<00:01:21.450> mom<00:01:21.540> fix<00:01:21.840> it

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
just have my boyfriend's mom fix it

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.350 
just have my boyfriend's mom fix it
because<00:01:22.170> she<00:01:22.470> does<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.070> kind<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.400> stuff<00:01:23.460> but

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
because she does that kind of stuff but

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.910 
because she does that kind of stuff but
no<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.720> don't<00:01:24.869> break<00:01:25.049> anything<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.680> still

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
no I don't break anything and I still

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.920 
no I don't break anything and I still
haven't<00:01:26.100> broken<00:01:26.400> any<00:01:26.700> stitches<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.479> am<00:01:27.750> not

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
haven't broken any stitches so I am not

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.170 
haven't broken any stitches so I am not
worried<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:30.049> it's<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.790> it's<00:01:32.790> not<00:01:32.909> an

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
worried and it's not like it's not an

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.640 
worried and it's not like it's not an
itchy<00:01:33.390> material<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.200> actually<00:01:34.290> pretty

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
itchy material it's actually pretty

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.140 
itchy material it's actually pretty
comfortable<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.460> gets<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.729> little<00:01:35.850> warm

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
comfortable it just gets a little warm

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.749 
comfortable it just gets a little warm
because<00:01:36.470> when<00:01:37.470> my<00:01:37.619> computer<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.250> my<00:01:38.310> TV<00:01:38.610> is
