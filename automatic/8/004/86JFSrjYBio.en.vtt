00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
customers send in theirs to us we didn't

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.470 
customers send in theirs to us we didn't
really<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.500> any<00:00:31.500> use<00:00:31.619> for<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.030> we

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
really have any use for this one so we

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.830 
really have any use for this one so we
wanted<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.989> do<00:00:34.170> something<00:00:34.500> fun<00:00:34.739> with<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.840> we

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
wanted to do something fun with it we

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.569 
wanted to do something fun with it we
did<00:00:37.020> all<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.200> our<00:00:37.380> standard<00:00:37.890> Vader's<00:00:38.280> vault

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
did all of our standard Vader's vault

did all of our standard Vader's vault
conversion<00:00:39.300> upgrades<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.430> reinforced<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
conversion upgrades I reinforced the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.729 
conversion upgrades I reinforced the
rear<00:00:42.210> grip<00:00:42.510> here<00:00:42.840> since<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
rear grip here since this is a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.010 
rear grip here since this is a
generation<00:00:44.340> one<00:00:44.550> machine<00:00:45.210> defect<00:00:45.600> Starkiller

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
generation one machine defect Starkiller

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.950 
generation one machine defect Starkiller
is<00:00:46.170> actually<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.559> two-piece<00:00:47.070> design<00:00:47.960> whereas

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
is actually a two-piece design whereas

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.709 
is actually a two-piece design whereas
the<00:00:49.050> new<00:00:49.200> ones<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.829> solid<00:00:50.420> tube<00:00:51.420> all<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the new ones it's one solid tube all the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.959 
the new ones it's one solid tube all the
way<00:00:51.809> down<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.160> doesn't<00:00:53.399> come<00:00:53.489> apart<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
way down so it doesn't come apart in the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.010 
way down so it doesn't come apart in the
middle<00:00:54.090> anymore

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
middle anymore

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.069 
middle anymore
but<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.500> one<00:00:55.649> does<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:57.059> way<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> comes

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
but this one does and the way it comes

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.639 
but this one does and the way it comes
from<00:00:58.440> machined<00:00:59.250> FX<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.660> set<00:01:01.410> screw

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
from machined FX is that a set screw

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.880 
from machined FX is that a set screw
holds<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.449> tubing<00:01:03.960> with<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.710> some

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
holds on the tubing with just some

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.310 
holds on the tubing with just some
pressure<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.570> they<00:01:06.570> eventually<00:01:06.810> usually

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
pressure and they eventually usually

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.800 
pressure and they eventually usually
fail<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.979> because<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> two<00:01:09.150> pieces<00:01:09.390> don't<00:01:09.689> fit

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
fail so because the two pieces don't fit

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.690 
fail so because the two pieces don't fit
together<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.409> really<00:01:10.530> tight<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.280> what<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> did

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
together it really tight so what I did

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.870 
together it really tight so what I did
was<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.390> neural<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.409> inner<00:01:13.560> tube<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.640> raise

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
was a neural of the inner tube to raise

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.030 
was a neural of the inner tube to raise
it<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.509> tighten<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.470> two<00:01:16.619> pieces

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
it up and tighten the two pieces

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.399 
it up and tighten the two pieces
together<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.670> then<00:01:18.330> secured<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
together and then secured it with the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.320 
together and then secured it with the
button<00:01:19.979> cap<00:01:20.250> screw<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.000> goes<00:01:21.119> all

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
