00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
grain going to sit on top of that and

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.660 
grain going to sit on top of that and
two<00:02:47.489> piece<00:02:47.700> false<00:02:47.970> bottom<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:49.290> then<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:50.520> the

two piece false bottom and then on the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.360 
two piece false bottom and then on the
other<00:02:50.700> side<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.360> wall<00:02:51.560> okay<00:02:52.560> always<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
other side of this wall okay always the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.960 
other side of this wall okay always the
net<00:02:54.709> that's<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.010> that's<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.340> wall<00:02:56.550> right<00:02:56.790> there

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
net that's so that's a wall right there

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.930 
net that's so that's a wall right there
yeah<00:02:57.300> it's<00:02:57.630> only<00:02:57.900> halfway<00:02:58.110> through<00:02:58.350> the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
yeah it's only halfway through the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.750 
yeah it's only halfway through the
contraption<00:02:59.940> correct<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:01.430> heating<00:03:02.430> element

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
contraption correct the heating element

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
make too many of these basically because

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.800 
make too many of these basically because
it<00:03:26.930> costs<00:03:27.140> as<00:03:27.319> much<00:03:27.349> makes<00:03:28.099> it<00:03:28.280> even<00:03:28.370> bigger

it costs as much makes it even bigger
