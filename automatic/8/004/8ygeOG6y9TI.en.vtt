00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.969
 Hello my dears 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.229
 Enter bees 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.539
 conservationists 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.919
 whether you allow it 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.230
 Painted limited 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.580
 I have to have it as gÃ¤b's castle as times at the test 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.370
 and indeed I have kept these in the mix 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.060
 but before 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.660
 Maria Carlsson on 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.660
 negative pressure 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.420
 where is she 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.530

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.800
 serious 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.800
 Yate's father stabbed 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.610
 Straka, I speak that 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.820
 I have two rings 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.080
 bare 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.010
 and I got there with the Butterberg 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.010
 this positive 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.390
 and in the first place 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.620
 transparent 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.620
 nail polish 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.940
 there is there 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.670
 really should not have much 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:13.939
 the players splashed hopes 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.939
 and yet he is a target 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.699
 from Schlecker 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.699
 b bought that too in my 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.089
 incredible 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.089
 practical piece of contemporary history costs and 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:34.589
 I just have that 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.739
 Just entertain me with something 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.499
 and is it based on the markets 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:58.779
 it is not difficult it is 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.779
 a lka spokesman 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:03.989
 but pretty fast 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.989
 Emsteks off 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.969
 be careful in the mystery that 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.569

 Richstein most difficult 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.389
 climb a bit 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.549
 her conclusion the 2 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.949
 that's nice 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.949
 it is still there 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.509
 that's what Tel looks like 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:01.249
 damaged areas 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.519
 that's how it looks 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.519
 Finally quite nice 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:15.239

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.400

 cold ice off with their kids 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.020
 Main thing screens judgment 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:24.339
 you see, it is quite right 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.199
 500 million 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.199
 but as tame 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.849
 so excess fat 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:09.559
 Lucia sank 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:12.559
 the handle heavily prepared coup is nonsense 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.180
 as a result 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.680
 the proximity to 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.639

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.009

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.919
 to paint all nails 

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:59.089
 To survive Itasca 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:02.460
 and around 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.460
