Motors bought few parks for this 1915
and<00:00:17.840> stumbled<00:00:18.840> onto<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.430> well<00:00:20.430> we've<00:00:20.670> got

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
and stumbled onto this well we've got

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.950 
and stumbled onto this well we've got
some<00:00:21.000> original<00:00:22.910> TRW<00:00:23.910> exhaust<00:00:24.240> valves<00:00:24.660> for<00:00:24.810> our

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
some original TRW exhaust valves for our

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.900 
some original TRW exhaust valves for our
heads<00:00:26.359> isn't<00:00:27.359> as<00:00:27.420> simple<00:00:27.599> as<00:00:27.900> those<00:00:28.769> were<00:00:29.039> old

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
heads isn't as simple as those were old

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.020 
heads isn't as simple as those were old
new<00:00:30.300> old<00:00:30.480> stock<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.309> were<00:00:32.460> able<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.820> get

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
new old stock so we were able to get

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.080 
new old stock so we were able to get
four<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.570> those

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
four of those

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.970 
four of those
however<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.239> bearing<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:37.620> become<00:00:37.739> an

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
however the bearing we have become an

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.310 
however the bearing we have become an
issue<00:00:38.300> this<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.480> something<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> noticed

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
issue this is something that I noticed

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.240 
issue this is something that I noticed
these<00:00:40.559> are<00:00:41.690> steel<00:00:42.690> back<00:00:42.930> bearings<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:46.250> they

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
these are steel back bearings and they

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.770 
these are steel back bearings and they
hold<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:47.640> very<00:00:47.670> well<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.360> know<00:00:48.480> some

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
hold up very well you know some

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.840 
hold up very well you know some
applications<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> oil<00:00:50.039> pumps<00:00:50.399> not<00:00:50.579> right

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
applications if the oil pumps not right

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.430 
applications if the oil pumps not right
and<00:00:51.059> whatever<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.840> will<00:00:52.110> get<00:00:52.289> some

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and whatever you know you will get some

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.850 
and whatever you know you will get some
bearing<00:00:52.739> wearing<00:00:53.070> these<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.710> don't<00:00:55.710> think

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
bearing wearing these and I don't think

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.260 
bearing wearing these and I don't think
the<00:00:56.039> bearing<00:00:56.370> something<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.090> could

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the bearing something that you could

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.389 
the bearing something that you could
cheapen<00:00:58.579> however<00:00:59.579> I<00:01:00.680> just<00:01:01.680> bought<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.070> set

little discolored probably from sitting
more<00:01:36.840> than<00:01:37.049> anything<00:01:38.329> but<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.780> same

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
more than anything but this is the same

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.690 
more than anything but this is the same
bearing<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> center<00:01:41.100> main<00:01:41.280> bearing

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
bearing this is a center main bearing

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.420 
bearing this is a center main bearing
and<00:01:42.170> they've<00:01:43.170> redesigned<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:44.070> bearing

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and they've redesigned this bearing

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.170 
and they've redesigned this bearing
quite<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> bit<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:47.250> used<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.579> feed<00:01:47.790> through<00:01:48.060> this

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
quite a bit it used to feed through this

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.810 
quite a bit it used to feed through this
oil<00:01:48.450> hole<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.320> then<00:01:49.590> fill<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.220> line<00:01:50.520> up

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
oil hole here and then fill this line up

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.190 
oil hole here and then fill this line up
and<00:01:51.090> would<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.140> reservoir<00:01:52.649> oil<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:54.200> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
and would have a reservoir oil and the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.130 
and would have a reservoir oil and the
crank<00:01:55.500> would<00:01:55.649> ride<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.009> here<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:58.020> would

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
crank would ride in here and it would

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.819 
crank would ride in here and it would
grab<00:01:58.380> its<00:01:58.590> oil<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.250> Croft<00:02:00.829> they've

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
grab its oil out of this Croft they've

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.100 
grab its oil out of this Croft they've
taken<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.250> line<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> bearing<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
taken the line out of the bearing and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.550 
taken the line out of the bearing and
moved<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.100> back<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.549> bearing<00:02:05.909> now<00:02:06.560> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
moved to the back of the bearing now and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.160 
moved to the back of the bearing now and
I'm<00:02:08.550> assuming<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.390> oil<00:02:09.509> feeds<00:02:09.929> up

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
I'm assuming that the oil feeds up

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.520 
I'm assuming that the oil feeds up
through<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.500> channel<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.190> into<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.819> hole

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
through this channel and into this hole

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.290 
through this channel and into this hole
into<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> bearing<00:02:14.310> surface<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.000> little

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
into the bearing surface and this little

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.590 
into the bearing surface and this little
duck<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.720> they<00:02:15.900> have<00:02:16.080> here<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:20.570> we've<00:02:21.570> got

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
duck that they have here and we've got

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.300 
duck that they have here and we've got
something<00:02:22.050> like<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.410> in<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.860> case<00:02:23.100> that

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
something like that in the case that

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.220 
something like that in the case that
that<00:02:26.310> doesn't<00:02:26.760> bother<00:02:26.940> me<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.510> much<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:28.080> know

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
that doesn't bother me so much you know

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.290 
that doesn't bother me so much you know
I<00:02:28.260> mean<00:02:28.680> looks<00:02:29.550> like<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.910> might<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:30.120> a

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
I mean looks like you might have a

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.940 
I mean looks like you might have a
little<00:02:30.480> more<00:02:30.600> bearing<00:02:31.110> surface<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.680> way<00:02:31.920> a

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
little more bearing surface this way a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.370 
little more bearing surface this way a
little<00:02:32.190> more<00:02:32.459> support<00:02:32.940> for<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.209> crank<00:02:33.510> that's

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
little more support for the crank that's

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.310

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
like the fact that it's an aluminum

78 couple grams lighter even the
aluminum<00:04:03.690> is<00:04:03.780> lighter<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:04.880> I<00:04:05.880> don't<00:04:06.060> know<00:04:06.180> I

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
aluminum is lighter so I don't know I

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.160 
aluminum is lighter so I don't know I
don't<00:04:07.950> know<00:04:08.420> just<00:04:09.420> something<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.750> stumbled

onto<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.709> take<00:04:11.220> these<00:04:11.430> out<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:11.820> they<00:04:11.910> feel<00:04:12.120> like

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
onto I take these out and they feel like

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.949 
onto I take these out and they feel like
there's<00:04:12.959> nothing<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.380> okay

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
there's nothing to okay

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.150 
there's nothing to okay
they're<00:04:15.959> almost<00:04:18.229> 60<00:04:19.229> grams<00:04:19.470> lighter<00:04:19.769> than<00:04:20.010> the

old ones the old German ones
so<00:04:24.240> there<00:04:24.390> you<00:04:24.420> go<00:04:24.600> that's<00:04:24.780> what<00:04:24.990> happens<00:04:25.290> when

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
so there you go that's what happens when

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.660 
so there you go that's what happens when
somebody<00:04:25.650> buys<00:04:25.950> company<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:27.950> uses<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.070> boxes

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
somebody buys company and uses the boxes

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.340 
somebody buys company and uses the boxes
and<00:04:32.180> takes<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.330> good<00:04:33.510> part<00:04:33.780> out<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.080> puts<00:04:34.260> the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
and takes the good part out and puts the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.810 
and takes the good part out and puts the
shitty<00:04:34.560> part<00:04:34.620> in<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.330> like<00:04:36.510> that<00:04:36.720> kind<00:04:37.820> so

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
shitty part in and I like that kind so

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.520 
shitty part in and I like that kind so
now<00:04:38.850> we<00:04:39.030> got<00:04:39.270> a<00:04:39.300> problem<00:04:39.660> problem<00:04:40.200> with<00:04:40.350> that

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
now we got a problem problem with that

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.930 
now we got a problem problem with that
we<00:04:40.770> got<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:40.980> figure<00:04:41.190> out<00:04:41.310> what<00:04:41.460> we're<00:04:41.580> gonna<00:04:41.670> do

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
gotten the new run of bearings I guess

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.030

particular<00:05:07.830> motor<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.370> don't<00:05:08.640> want<00:05:08.760> to<00:05:08.820> take

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
particular motor I don't want to take

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.500 
particular motor I don't want to take
any<00:05:09.180> chances<00:05:09.750> this<00:05:10.050> was<00:05:10.260> a<00:05:10.290> good<00:05:10.830> friend<00:05:11.510> on

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
any chances this was a good friend on

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.210 
any chances this was a good friend on
the<00:05:12.660> YouTube<00:05:12.960> bridge<00:05:13.140> and<00:05:13.770> we<00:05:13.830> want<00:05:14.010> to<00:05:14.070> make

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
the YouTube bridge and we want to make

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.420 
the YouTube bridge and we want to make
sure<00:05:14.370> his<00:05:14.640> stuff<00:05:15.420> runs<00:05:15.750> correctly<00:05:16.280> for<00:05:17.280> awhile

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
sure his stuff runs correctly for awhile

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.490 
sure his stuff runs correctly for awhile
and<00:05:18.030> I<00:05:19.820> would<00:05:20.820> think<00:05:20.970> of<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.300> steel<00:05:22.230> back

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
and I would think of the steel back

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.590 
and I would think of the steel back
bearing<00:05:22.890> would<00:05:23.040> only<00:05:23.220> go<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:23.520> know<00:05:23.790> 50<00:05:24.180> 70

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
bearing would only go you know 50 70

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.110 
bearing would only go you know 50 70
thousand<00:05:25.110> miles<00:05:25.340> this<00:05:26.340> bearing<00:05:26.730> is<00:05:26.820> gonna<00:05:27.000> be

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
thousand miles this bearing is gonna be

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.940 
thousand miles this bearing is gonna be
much<00:05:27.330> shorter<00:05:27.600> lived<00:05:28.820> so<00:05:30.230> yeah<00:05:31.260> that's<00:05:31.710> not<00:05:31.920> a

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
much shorter lived so yeah that's not a

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.800 
much shorter lived so yeah that's not a
good<00:05:32.160> deal<00:05:32.430> so<00:05:33.030> I<00:05:33.090> don't<00:05:33.330> know<00:05:33.420> if<00:05:33.510> anybody

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
good deal so I don't know if anybody

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.810 
good deal so I don't know if anybody
else<00:05:34.020> is<00:05:34.200> running<00:05:34.530> to<00:05:34.650> this<00:05:34.770> issue<00:05:35.010> or<00:05:35.340> not<00:05:35.490> but

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
else is running to this issue or not but

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.510 
else is running to this issue or not but
uh<00:05:37.580> not<00:05:38.580> good<00:05:39.590> we've<00:05:40.590> got<00:05:40.740> several<00:05:41.040> bearings

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
uh not good we've got several bearings

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:53.600 
uh not good we've got several bearings
in<00:05:41.700> here<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:44.360> here's<00:05:45.360> the<00:05:45.540> new<00:05:45.720> design<00:05:48.230> and<00:05:52.610> so

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
in here and here's the new design and so

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.430 
in here and here's the new design and so
they've<00:05:53.880> taken<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.360> new<00:05:54.540> design<00:05:54.900> one<00:05:55.140> step

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
they've taken the new design one step

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.790 
they've taken the new design one step
further<00:05:55.710> and<00:05:58.520> cheeping<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.610> process<00:06:00.800> and

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
further and cheeping the process and

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.620 
further and cheeping the process and
made<00:06:01.980> it<00:06:02.100> lighter<00:06:02.340> took<00:06:02.820> all<00:06:03.000> the<00:06:03.120> steel<00:06:03.390> out

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
made it lighter took all the steel out

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.740 
made it lighter took all the steel out
so<00:06:03.960> instead<00:06:04.320> of<00:06:04.380> having<00:06:05.240> layers<00:06:06.240> of<00:06:06.510> steel

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
so instead of having layers of steel

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.750 
so instead of having layers of steel
Babbitt<00:06:09.750> no<00:06:10.650> it's<00:06:10.830> just<00:06:10.950> one<00:06:11.160> big<00:06:11.370> piece<00:06:11.580> of

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
Babbitt no it's just one big piece of

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.500 
Babbitt no it's just one big piece of
aluminum<00:06:12.240> in<00:06:12.360> there<00:06:12.540> like<00:06:12.870> a<00:06:12.900> shim<00:06:14.240> so<00:06:15.240> this<00:06:15.360> is

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
aluminum in there like a shim so this is

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.530 
aluminum in there like a shim so this is
sort<00:06:15.720> of<00:06:15.780> odd<00:06:16.430> I'm<00:06:17.430> sure<00:06:17.640> other<00:06:17.880> guys<00:06:18.150> have<00:06:18.360> run

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
sort of odd I'm sure other guys have run

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.030 
sort of odd I'm sure other guys have run
into<00:06:18.690> this<00:06:18.990> that<00:06:19.260> build<00:06:19.440> more<00:06:19.680> murders<00:06:20.010> than

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
into this that build more murders than

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.210 
into this that build more murders than
me<00:06:20.400> and

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.120 

I<00:06:26.310> don't<00:06:26.940> know<00:06:27.060> figure<00:06:27.480> something<00:06:27.810> out<00:06:28.230> to<00:06:28.980> be

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
I don't know figure something out to be

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.730 
I don't know figure something out to be
