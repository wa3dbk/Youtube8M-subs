what I mean so I like I made this

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.759 
what I mean so I like I made this
project<00:00:12.179> because<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.599> really<00:00:12.929> like<00:00:13.139> space<00:00:13.559> and

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
project because I really like space and

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.990 
project because I really like space and
it<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.280> very<00:00:14.639> fun<00:00:15.949> so<00:00:16.949> these<00:00:17.369> are<00:00:17.580> all<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
it is very fun so these are all the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.840 
it is very fun so these are all the
models<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.779> planet<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.710> Sun<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.550> hot

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
models of the planet the Sun is so hot

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.740 
models of the planet the Sun is so hot
it<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.130> put<00:00:23.400> these<00:00:23.580> slips<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
it and you can put these slips of the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.009 
it and you can put these slips of the
distance<00:00:25.619> if<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.859> want<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
distance if you want to

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.890 
distance if you want to
so<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.349> first<00:00:28.650> planet<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.519> mercury<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.720> is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
so the first planet is mercury and it is

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.540 
so the first planet is mercury and it is
the<00:00:31.080> eight<00:00:31.349> bodies<00:00:32.279> from<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.120> planets

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
the eight bodies from all the planets

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.530 
the eight bodies from all the planets
next<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.760> Venus<00:00:36.680> Venus<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> six<00:00:38.700> largest<00:00:39.180> of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
next is Venus Venus is a six largest of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.410 
next is Venus Venus is a six largest of
all<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.379> planets

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
all the planets

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.690 
all the planets
next<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.570> Earth<00:00:42.950> earth<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> only<00:00:44.399> planet

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
next is Earth earth is the only planet

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.750 
next is Earth earth is the only planet
we<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.660> live<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.289> because<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.190> air<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
we can live in because we have air and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.410 
we can live in because we have air and
gravity<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.379> stay<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.059> fifth

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
gravity to stay on and it's a fifth

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.880 
gravity to stay on and it's a fifth
largest<00:00:53.030> also<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:55.020> make<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> moon<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.829> you

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
largest also you can make a moon if you

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.860 
largest also you can make a moon if you
want<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.460 

next<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.050> Mars<00:01:01.969> Mars<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.719> seventh<00:01:04.170> largest

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
next is Mars Mars is the seventh largest

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.000 
next is Mars Mars is the seventh largest
planet<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.240> mystery<00:01:06.689> nobody<00:01:07.170> knows<00:01:07.500> if

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
planet it is a mystery nobody knows if

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.310 
planet it is a mystery nobody knows if
there's<00:01:08.340> life<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.420> Mars

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
there's life on Mars

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
there's life on Mars
but<00:01:10.650> scientists<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.369> discovering<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:13.340> next

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
but scientists are discovering it next

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.260 
but scientists are discovering it next

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
one is Cupid cupid is the largest planet

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
one is Cupid cupid is the largest planet
of<00:01:18.689> all<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.729> sort<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.570> solar<00:01:21.840> system<00:01:22.409> next

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
of all the sort of the solar system next

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.010 
of all the sort of the solar system next
to<00:01:23.400> Saturn<00:01:23.850> Saturn<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.479> four<00:01:24.720> beautiful

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
to Saturn Saturn are four beautiful

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.370 
to Saturn Saturn are four beautiful
wings<00:01:25.619> that's<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.580> many<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> second

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
wings that's so many it is the second

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.060 
wings that's so many it is the second
largest<00:01:31.369> next<00:01:32.369> comes<00:01:32.670> Uranus<00:01:33.470> Uranus<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
largest next comes Uranus Uranus is the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.319 
largest next comes Uranus Uranus is the
seventh<00:01:35.939> largest<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.659> all<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.869> planet<00:01:37.470> and

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
seventh largest of all the planet and

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.569 
seventh largest of all the planet and
then<00:01:39.329> last<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:40.970> Neptune<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.890> fifth<00:01:44.220> one

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
then last is Neptune it is the fifth one

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.380 
then last is Neptune it is the fifth one
that<00:01:44.850> tune<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.540> very<00:01:45.810> cold<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.549> Pluto<00:01:47.549> also

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that tune is very cold but Pluto also

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.760 
that tune is very cold but Pluto also
comes<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> source<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.770> done<00:01:50.450> Pluto

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
comes in the source is done Pluto

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.859 
comes in the source is done Pluto
some<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.250> eighth<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:53.790> ninth<00:01:54.149> planet<00:01:54.420> cuz

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
some is the eighth or ninth planet cuz

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.420 
some is the eighth or ninth planet cuz
it<00:01:55.200> causes

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
it causes

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.650 
it causes
-<00:01:56.550> sometimes<00:01:57.120> only<00:01:57.450> for<00:01:57.660> a<00:01:57.690> short<00:01:57.720> time<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
- sometimes only for a short time and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.750 
- sometimes only for a short time and
Pluto<00:02:00.660> is<00:02:00.870> a<00:02:00.900> dwarf<00:02:01.590> planet<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.250> has<00:02:02.460> been

Pluto is a dwarf planet that has been

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
Pluto is a dwarf planet that has been
