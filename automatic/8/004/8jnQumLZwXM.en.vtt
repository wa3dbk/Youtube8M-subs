a screen how the actor was behaving in

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.800 
a screen how the actor was behaving in
flight<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.680> helps<00:01:16.890> us<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.159> preparing<00:01:17.810> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
flight and it helps us in preparing the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.530 
flight and it helps us in preparing the
service<00:01:19.229> aircraft<00:01:19.680> when<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.920> lands<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:21.150> an

airport so when the aircraft land and
the<00:01:24.780> pilots<00:01:25.170> even<00:01:25.920> before<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.280> opens<00:01:26.670> its

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the pilots even before you opens its

the pilots even before you opens its
mouth<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.150> tell<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.900> engineer<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.100> the

mouth to tell the engineer what is the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.530 
mouth to tell the engineer what is the
problem<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> engineer<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.000> call<00:01:30.240> himself

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
problem the engineer can call himself

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.660 
problem the engineer can call himself
captain<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.740> think<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.310> disease

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
captain I think you have this disease

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.450 
captain I think you have this disease
this<00:01:32.850> problem<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.390> think<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:34.130> this<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
this problem and I think you this is the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.640 
this problem and I think you this is the
possible<00:01:35.880> solution<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.689> apply<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
possible solution that I can apply and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.670 
possible solution that I can apply and
you'll<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.460> amazed<00:01:38.820> sometimes<00:01:39.500> even<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
you'll be amazed sometimes even the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.990 
you'll be amazed sometimes even the
captain<00:01:40.920> himself<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:42.000> surprise<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.759> shows

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
captain himself a surprise so it shows

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.380 
captain himself a surprise so it shows
us<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> level<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:46.610> technology<00:01:47.610> used<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
us the level of technology used on the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.660 
us the level of technology used on the
747

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
747

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.300

that<00:01:50.270> we<00:01:50.390> have<00:01:50.570> today<00:01:50.830> what<00:01:51.830> many<00:01:52.100> people

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
that we have today what many people

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.800 
that we have today what many people
don't<00:01:52.610> know<00:01:52.790> about<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:53.030> 747<00:01:53.960> was<00:01:54.140> dead<00:01:54.350> when

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
don't know about a 747 was dead when

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.859 
don't know about a 747 was dead when
they<00:01:56.810> change<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:57.740> aircraft<00:01:58.130> from<00:01:58.869> 747-300

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
they change the aircraft from 747-300

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.429 
they change the aircraft from 747-300
series<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.740> 747<00:02:01.490> 400<00:02:01.729> series<00:02:02.210> they<00:02:03.020> remove

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
series to 747 400 series they remove

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.120 
series to 747 400 series they remove
about<00:02:03.710> 3<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.640> 400<00:02:05.170> switches<00:02:06.170> from<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.890> cockpit

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
about 3 to 400 switches from the cockpit

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.070 
about 3 to 400 switches from the cockpit
and<00:02:08.470> that<00:02:09.940> reduced<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.030> need<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.660> flight

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
and that reduced the need of a flight

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.420 
and that reduced the need of a flight

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
on this aircraft for the last 30 odd

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.809 
on this aircraft for the last 30 odd
years<00:02:27.400> flown<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.760> as<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:28.940> passenger

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
years flown in it as a passenger

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.440 
years flown in it as a passenger
stripped<00:02:31.819> it<00:02:31.970> apart<00:02:32.299> put<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.110> back<00:02:33.230> again<00:02:34.450> look

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
stripped it apart put it back again look

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.650 
stripped it apart put it back again look
for<00:02:35.660> faults<00:02:35.959> with<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.730> think<00:02:37.730> it's<00:02:38.060> gonna<00:02:38.269> be

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
for faults with it I think it's gonna be
