and<00:02:18.960> ultimate<00:02:19.960> echo<00:02:20.230> echo<00:02:20.310> here<00:02:21.310> has<00:02:21.670> some

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
and ultimate echo echo here has some

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.610 
and ultimate echo echo here has some
articulation<00:02:23.260> like<00:02:24.130> his<00:02:24.820> head<00:02:25.060> does<00:02:25.330> go<00:02:25.620> 360

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
articulation like his head does go 360

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.880 
articulation like his head does go 360
degrees<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:29.820> his<00:02:30.820> are<00:02:31.270> his<00:02:31.660> shoulders<00:02:32.110> though

362<00:02:33.580> they<00:02:34.150> go<00:02:34.300> up<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.630> down

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
362 they go up and down

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.270 
362 they go up and down
there's<00:02:35.560> no<00:02:35.740> elbow<00:02:36.370> joints<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.560> then<00:02:38.560> you

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
there's no elbow joints and then you

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.390 
there's no elbow joints and then you
could<00:02:39.490> pretty<00:02:39.880> post<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.690> could<00:02:40.870> pose<00:02:41.020> him

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
could pretty post you could pose him

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.610 
could pretty post you could pose him
like<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.700> then<00:02:42.910> his<00:02:43.150> legs<00:02:43.480> go<00:02:43.780> up<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.350> his

like and then his legs go up and his
knees<00:02:44.890> go<00:02:45.310> down<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:48.280> he<00:02:48.460> is<00:02:48.580> very<00:02:48.610> he's

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
knees go down so he is very he's

00:02:49.510 --> 00:03:00.390 
knees go down so he is very he's
possible<00:02:54.180> like<00:02:55.350> that's<00:02:56.350> one<00:02:56.590> pose<00:02:59.400> they're

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
possible like that's one pose they're

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.930 
possible like that's one pose they're
nice<00:03:01.710> 15<00:03:02.710> blue<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:04.150> then<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.810> see<00:03:05.020> his

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
nice 15 blue and then you see his

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.450 
nice 15 blue and then you see his
Ultimatrix<00:03:07.170> symbol<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.850> his<00:03:09.960> new<00:03:10.960> like<00:03:11.740> place

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
Ultimatrix symbol and his new like place

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.540 
Ultimatrix symbol and his new like place
where<00:03:12.640> he<00:03:12.700> could<00:03:12.790> put<00:03:13.150> his<00:03:13.360> speaker's<00:03:14.110> now<00:03:15.010> he
