when<00:00:00.690> we<00:00:00.810> approach<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.290> trailer<00:00:01.530> we

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
when we approach the trailer we

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.500 
when we approach the trailer we
brainstormed<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:02.790> kind<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.060> came<00:00:03.240> up<00:00:03.330> with<00:00:03.419> a

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
brainstormed and kind of came up with a

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.700 
brainstormed and kind of came up with a
list<00:00:03.659> of<00:00:03.780> what<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.049> it<00:00:04.230> that<00:00:04.350> we<00:00:04.440> want<00:00:04.560> to

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
list of what is it that we want to

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.400 
list of what is it that we want to
convey<00:00:04.980> in<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.220> trailer<00:00:05.609> we<00:00:06.410> questioned

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
convey in this trailer we questioned

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.320 
convey in this trailer we questioned
whether<00:00:07.890> we<00:00:08.099> should<00:00:08.280> put<00:00:08.429> infected<00:00:08.970> in<00:00:09.090> or<00:00:09.210> not

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
whether we should put infected in or not

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.870 
whether we should put infected in or not
because<00:00:09.800> that's<00:00:10.800> not<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.160> focus<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.700> game

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
because that's not the focus of the game

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.030 
because that's not the focus of the game
it's<00:00:12.660> it's<00:00:12.960> part<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.290> backstory<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.889> what

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
it's it's part of the backstory and what

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.259 
it's it's part of the backstory and what
applies<00:00:14.309> pressure<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:14.969> will<00:00:15.150> be

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
applies pressure and you will be

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.609 
applies pressure and you will be
fighting<00:00:15.450> these<00:00:15.719> things<00:00:15.780> but<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.500> really

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
fighting these things but it really

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.200 
fighting these things but it really
isn't<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.920> focus<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:17.550> like<00:00:17.670> do<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.000> leave

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
isn't the focus so it's like do we leave

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.730 
isn't the focus so it's like do we leave
that<00:00:18.330> out<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.690> trailer<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.080> then<00:00:19.380> show<00:00:19.619> it

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
that out of the trailer and then show it

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.099 
that out of the trailer and then show it
later<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.580> didn't<00:00:20.789> want<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.000> like<00:00:21.270> here's<00:00:21.990> this

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
later we didn't want to like here's this

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.990 
later we didn't want to like here's this
grounded<00:00:22.470> world<00:00:22.680> only<00:00:22.949> has<00:00:23.100> human<00:00:23.580> characters

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
grounded world only has human characters

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.700 
grounded world only has human characters
and<00:00:24.210> all<00:00:24.269> sudden<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.810> show<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> demo<00:00:25.410> later

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and all sudden we like show a demo later

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.050 
and all sudden we like show a demo later
or<00:00:25.920> something<00:00:26.279> people<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.849> figure

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
or something people see it and figure

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.730 
or something people see it and figure
out<00:00:27.090> what<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.109> hell<00:00:28.230> where<00:00:28.380> did<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.560> come

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
out what the hell where did that come

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.029 
out what the hell where did that come
from

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
from

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.700 
from
so<00:00:29.609> first<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.939> was<00:00:30.029> important<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.710> not

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
so first it was important to just not

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.650 
so first it was important to just not
tease<00:00:32.189> too<00:00:32.520> much<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> infect<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.450> just

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
tease too much of the infect and just

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.810 
tease too much of the infect and just
show<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:33.960> full<00:00:34.440> screen<00:00:34.770> right<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:35.730> long

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
show it full screen right because long

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.580 
show it full screen right because long
times<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.149> see<00:00:36.450> where<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> focus<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
times you see where the focus is the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.680 
times you see where the focus is the
creature<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:39.149> Godzilla<00:00:39.480> movie

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
creature that like the Godzilla movie

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.060 
creature that like the Godzilla movie
right<00:00:39.930> they<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:40.440> spent<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.829> long<00:00:41.040> time

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
right they what they spent a long time

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.459 
right they what they spent a long time
not<00:00:41.640> showing<00:00:42.059> Godzilla<00:00:42.480> when<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.200> was<00:00:43.290> coming

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
not showing Godzilla when it was coming

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.380 
not showing Godzilla when it was coming
out<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.610> became<00:00:44.910> din<00:00:45.120> chicken

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
out and like that became din chicken

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.639 
out and like that became din chicken
it's<00:00:45.480> all<00:00:45.570> about<00:00:45.719> Godzilla<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.260> wasn't<00:00:46.500> really

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
it's all about Godzilla it wasn't really

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.139 
it's all about Godzilla it wasn't really
about<00:00:46.739> these<00:00:47.010> other<00:00:47.160> characters<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.059> us

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
about these other characters but for us

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.940 
about these other characters but for us
it<00:00:48.270> was<00:00:48.360> important<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:48.930> let's<00:00:49.350> show<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
it was important to just let's show the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.189 
it was important to just let's show the
infected<00:00:50.460> full<00:00:51.059> screen<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.809> get<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> out

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
infected full screen and just get it out

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.689 
infected full screen and just get it out
of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> way<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.620> there's<00:00:53.010> no<00:00:53.219> more<00:00:53.460> kind<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
of the way so there's no more kind of

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.160 
of the way so there's no more kind of
question<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.420> thing<00:00:54.629> looks<00:00:54.899> how<00:00:55.050> it
