00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.120 
the yard sit along the edge here and
I'll<00:00:09.690> get<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.019> morning's<00:00:10.559> Sun<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.830> little<00:00:11.040> bit

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
I'll get this morning's Sun a little bit

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.930 
I'll get this morning's Sun a little bit
earlier

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.240 

won't<00:00:15.940> block<00:00:16.209> the<00:00:17.050> front<00:00:17.349> of<00:00:17.470> the<00:00:17.619> garden

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
won't block the front of the garden

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.820 
won't block the front of the garden
there<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:19.570> to<00:00:19.689> put<00:00:19.869> a<00:00:19.900> raised<00:00:20.140> bed<00:00:20.170> where<00:00:20.710> the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
there like to put a raised bed where the

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.999 
there like to put a raised bed where the
birdbath<00:00:21.039> is<00:00:21.490> right<00:00:21.730> now<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.500> let's<00:00:23.710> see<00:00:23.829> if<00:00:23.919> I

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
birdbath is right now so let's see if I

00:00:24.009 --> 00:01:29.280 
birdbath is right now so let's see if I
can<00:00:24.189> move<00:00:24.310> this<00:00:24.369> with<00:00:24.789> a<00:00:24.820> two-wheel<00:00:25.300> handcart

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.750 

well<00:01:29.860> that<00:01:30.070> might<00:01:30.250> have<00:01:30.400> been<00:01:30.550> a<00:01:30.580> mistake

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
well that might have been a mistake

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.180 
well that might have been a mistake
there<00:01:31.240> were<00:01:31.330> two<00:01:31.480> large<00:01:31.690> roots<00:01:32.190> growing

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
there were two large roots growing

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.800 
there were two large roots growing
through<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.550> pot<00:01:33.880> that<00:01:34.270> I<00:01:34.300> broke<00:01:34.690> off<00:01:36.660> maybe<00:01:37.660> I

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
through the pot that I broke off maybe I

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.580 
through the pot that I broke off maybe I
should<00:01:38.050> have<00:01:38.170> left<00:01:38.350> left<00:01:39.070> it<00:01:39.250> right<00:01:39.820> there<00:01:40.590> as

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
should have left left it right there as

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.820 
should have left left it right there as
they<00:01:41.800> were<00:01:41.860> pretty<00:01:42.070> substantial<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.380> now<00:01:44.680> I'm

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
they were pretty substantial and now I'm

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.720 
they were pretty substantial and now I'm
thinking<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.460> just<00:01:46.000> going<00:01:46.180> ahead<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:47.320> putting

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
thinking of just going ahead and putting

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.210 
thinking of just going ahead and putting
the<00:01:48.730> peach<00:01:48.940> tree<00:01:49.330> in<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.570> ground<00:01:49.980> about<00:01:50.980> that

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
the peach tree in the ground about that

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.180 
the peach tree in the ground about that
location<00:01:51.640> right<00:01:52.090> there<00:01:55.830> that<00:01:56.830> might<00:01:56.980> be<00:01:57.010> a

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
location right there that might be a

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:08.930 
location right there that might be a
good<00:01:57.400> idea<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.729> roots<00:02:06.940> weren't<00:02:07.330> too

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
good idea the roots weren't too

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.510 
good idea the roots weren't too
substantial<00:02:10.050> at<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.350> they<00:02:12.070> were<00:02:12.130> going<00:02:12.430> to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
substantial at that they were going to

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.440 
substantial at that they were going to
be<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.640> lot<00:02:12.880> bigger<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:15.150> hopefully<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.210> didn't

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
be a lot bigger so hopefully I didn't

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.270 
be a lot bigger so hopefully I didn't
stress<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.990> tree<00:02:17.200> too<00:02:17.440> much<00:02:17.650> by<00:02:17.890> breaking

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
stress the tree too much by breaking

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.470 
stress the tree too much by breaking
these<00:02:18.400> roots<00:02:18.670> off<00:02:20.310> we'll<00:02:21.310> find<00:02:21.610> out<00:02:21.820> and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
these roots off we'll find out and

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.150 
these roots off we'll find out and
probably<00:02:22.990> that's<00:02:23.080> why<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:23.470> best<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.800> get<00:02:23.980> it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
probably that's why it's best to get it

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.210 
probably that's why it's best to get it
in<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.310> ground<00:02:24.490> anyways<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:26.040> can<00:02:27.040> use<00:02:27.190> that

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
in the ground anyways I can use that

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.500 
in the ground anyways I can use that
container<00:02:27.760> for<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.510> fake<00:02:28.959> tree

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.759 

so<00:02:32.050> I'm<00:02:32.349> thinking<00:02:33.959> I'm<00:02:34.959> going<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.290> put<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.560> on

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
so I'm thinking I'm going to put this on

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.399 
so I'm thinking I'm going to put this on
the<00:02:35.860> ground<00:02:36.159> right<00:02:36.580> right<00:02:37.150> about<00:02:37.360> there

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.660 

stead<00:02:41.409> of<00:02:41.440> leaving<00:02:41.799> it<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.159> container

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.380 

tricky<00:02:45.670> part<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.090> going<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.420> be<00:02:48.000> getting<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.269> on

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
tricky part is going to be getting it on

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.880 
tricky part is going to be getting it on
its<00:02:49.599> side<00:02:52.170> without<00:02:53.170> losing<00:02:53.620> too<00:02:53.769> many

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
its side without losing too many

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:43.130 
its side without losing too many
features<00:02:54.190> are<00:02:54.549> breaking<00:02:54.970> any<00:02:55.390> branches

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.200 

well<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.920> ended<00:03:44.250> up<00:03:44.370> being<00:03:44.580> easier<00:03:44.970> than<00:03:45.120> I

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
well that ended up being easier than I

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.350 
well that ended up being easier than I
thought<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.510> was<00:03:45.570> going<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.960> be

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:05:20.189 

maybe<00:03:50.960> this<00:03:51.080> was<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.290> good<00:03:51.410> idea

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.600 

looks<00:05:21.199> like<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:21.500> got<00:05:21.680> that<00:05:21.860> bitch<00:05:22.070> crazy<00:05:22.400> in

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
looks like I got that bitch crazy in

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.610 
looks like I got that bitch crazy in
this<00:05:22.759> behind

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
this behind

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:33.300 
this behind
getting<00:05:25.280> water<00:05:25.520> there

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.770 

so<00:05:34.310> it's<00:05:34.490> an<00:05:34.610> even<00:05:34.970> darning<00:05:35.450> with<00:05:35.630> the

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
so it's an even darning with the

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.670 
so it's an even darning with the
container<00:05:36.410> lady<00:05:37.160> who<00:05:37.460> keeps<00:05:37.670> free<00:05:38.440> now<00:05:39.440> in<00:05:39.620> the

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
container lady who keeps free now in the

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.879 
container lady who keeps free now in the
ground

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.819 

thanks<00:05:46.580> for<00:05:46.729> watching
