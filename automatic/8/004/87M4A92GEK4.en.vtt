have gotten something out of this coming
into<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> end<00:01:33.450> they<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.869> weren't

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
into it but in the end they just weren't

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.810 
into it but in the end they just weren't
strong<00:01:34.350> enough<00:01:34.409> things<00:01:35.189> didn't<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.549> go

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
strong enough things didn't really go

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.999 
strong enough things didn't really go
their<00:01:36.150> way<00:01:36.329> said<00:01:36.689> done<00:01:36.900> fo<00:01:37.079> there<00:01:37.860> was<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
their way said done fo there was a

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.679 
their way said done fo there was a
couple<00:01:38.189> thing<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.640> know<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.850> did<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.180> weren't

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
couple thing you know we did we weren't

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.600 
couple thing you know we did we weren't
able

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
able

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.160 
able
which<00:01:40.910> doesn't<00:01:41.270> make<00:01:41.330> an<00:01:41.480> easy

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
which doesn't make an easy

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.780 
which doesn't make an easy
he<00:01:42.560> started<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.009> cut<00:01:43.189> up<00:01:43.340> straight<00:01:43.670> away

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
he started to cut up straight away

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.240 
he started to cut up straight away
really<00:01:44.150> so<00:01:44.630> I<00:01:45.439> mean<00:01:46.150> it's<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.270> same<00:01:47.450> for<00:01:47.600> both

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
really so I mean it's the same for both

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.480 
really so I mean it's the same for both
don't<00:01:49.810> know<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.840> think<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:51.350> was<00:01:51.500> more<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:52.399> the

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
don't know I think it was more of the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.280 
don't know I think it was more of the
the<00:01:52.850> first<00:01:53.000> 15<00:01:53.479> minutes<00:01:53.689> where<00:01:53.869> we<00:01:53.990> came<00:01:54.140> off

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
the first 15 minutes where we came off

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.889 
the first 15 minutes where we came off
flattened<00:01:54.710> all<00:01:54.799> day<00:01:55.090> they<00:01:56.090> came<00:01:56.299> in<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:56.720> put<00:01:56.840> a

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
flattened all day they came in and put a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.749 
flattened all day they came in and put a
little<00:01:57.080> pressure<00:01:57.290> on<00:01:57.530> us<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:58.040> I<00:01:58.310> don't<00:01:58.670> think

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
little pressure on us and I don't think

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.940 
little pressure on us and I don't think
we<00:01:58.940> we<00:01:59.180> dealt<00:01:59.420> with<00:01:59.479> it<00:01:59.659> as<00:02:00.380> good<00:02:00.530> as<00:02:00.680> we<00:02:00.770> should

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
we we dealt with it as good as we should

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.340 
we we dealt with it as good as we should
have<00:02:01.039> and<00:02:01.789> I<00:02:01.880> think<00:02:01.909> we<00:02:02.180> built<00:02:02.840> ourselves<00:02:02.990> back

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
have and I think we built ourselves back

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.749 
have and I think we built ourselves back
into<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.710> game<00:02:03.830> we<00:02:04.009> play<00:02:04.159> some<00:02:04.369> good<00:02:04.520> things

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
into the game we play some good things

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.060 
into the game we play some good things
and<00:02:05.020> created<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.049> little<00:02:06.259> bit<00:02:06.350> of<00:02:06.439> chances<00:02:06.890> but

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
and created a little bit of chances but

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.490 
and created a little bit of chances but
I<00:02:07.399> think<00:02:07.939> going<00:02:08.479> from<00:02:08.720> here<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.080> next<00:02:09.200> game<00:02:09.470> we

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
I think going from here the next game we

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.380 
I think going from here the next game we
have<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.800> be<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.950> little<00:02:10.130> bit<00:02:10.310> more<00:02:10.459> wary<00:02:11.239> of

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
have to be a little bit more wary of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.809 
have to be a little bit more wary of
having<00:02:12.019> a<00:02:12.080> good<00:02:12.230> start<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:13.160> Canadians<00:02:13.610> not

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
having a good start the Canadians not

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.729 
having a good start the Canadians not
feeling<00:02:14.300> down<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.600> out<00:02:14.959> about<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.440> at<00:02:15.620> all

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
feeling down and out about this at all

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.170 
feeling down and out about this at all
they<00:02:15.980> actually<00:02:16.280> feel<00:02:16.430> pretty<00:02:16.489> confident

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
they actually feel pretty confident

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.790 
they actually feel pretty confident
going<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.510> their<00:02:17.630> next<00:02:17.959> game<00:02:18.140> they<00:02:18.410> will<00:02:18.560> face

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
going to their next game they will face

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.270 
going to their next game they will face

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.789 
up playing with one man down very early
in<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.680> game<00:02:48.859> and<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:50.660> was<00:02:50.840> hard<00:02:51.049> for<00:02:51.109> us<00:02:51.230> we

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
in the game and it was hard for us we
