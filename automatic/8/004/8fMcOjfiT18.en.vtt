so it's often useful just to format the
device<00:00:24.210> which<00:00:24.779> will<00:00:24.930> basically<00:00:25.080> make<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
device which will basically make it the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.740 
device which will basically make it the
same<00:00:26.400> way<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.699> was<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.090> day<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.300> took<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.630> out

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
