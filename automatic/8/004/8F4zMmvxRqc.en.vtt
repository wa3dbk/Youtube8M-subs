more<00:02:20.920> laymen<00:02:21.310> here<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:21.909> I<00:02:21.939> think<00:02:22.209> they're

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
more laymen here so I think they're

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.360 
more laymen here so I think they're
planning<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.079> they're<00:02:23.560> working<00:02:23.950> really<00:02:24.219> well

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
planning and they're working really well

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.890 
planning and they're working really well
together<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.969> lines<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.390> think<00:02:25.420> they<00:02:25.659> did<00:02:25.870> a

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
together the lines I think they did a

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.199 
together the lines I think they did a
very<00:02:26.049> good<00:02:26.379> attack<00:02:26.829> method<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.400> suppose<00:02:27.700> so

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
very good attack method I suppose so

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.429 
very good attack method I suppose so
unless<00:02:28.390> you've<00:02:28.569> done<00:02:28.719> in<00:02:28.870> here<00:02:29.019> so<00:02:29.200> here<00:02:29.379> we

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439 
unless you've done in here so here we

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
have the light blue and they're just

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.380

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
gonna fight that back in 1 meter which

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.209 
gonna fight that back in 1 meter which
often<00:02:34.840> three<00:02:35.140> forces<00:02:35.620> may<00:02:35.769> be<00:02:35.799> right<00:02:36.069> in<00:02:36.159> the

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:36.219 
often three forces may be right in the

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.099 
often three forces may be right in the
video<00:02:36.459> there<00:02:36.670> all<00:02:37.060> right<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:37.239> what's<00:02:37.540> the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
moment I've done actually see the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.759 
moment I've done actually see the
magenta<00:02:39.819> dearmasa<00:02:40.239> just<00:02:40.659> revealing<00:02:41.109> more<00:02:41.560> and

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
magenta dearmasa just revealing more and

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.199 
magenta dearmasa just revealing more and
more<00:02:41.920> damage<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:42.459> here<00:02:42.670> what<00:02:42.790> we<00:02:42.879> have<00:02:43.030> we<00:02:43.180> have

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
more damage so here what we have we have

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.830 
more damage so here what we have we have
the<00:02:43.510> lively<00:02:43.989> first<00:02:44.379> like<00:02:44.620> 10<00:02:45.010> lines<00:02:45.790> is<00:02:46.090> crazy

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
the lively first like 10 lines is crazy

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.809 
the lively first like 10 lines is crazy
ah<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.230> think<00:02:47.620> if<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.859> lines<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.219> just<00:02:48.400> keep<00:02:48.639> to

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
ah I think if the lines is just keep to

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.059 
ah I think if the lines is just keep to
this<00:02:48.909> strategy<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.569> flame<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.170> groups<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.859> think

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
this strategy of flame in groups I think

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.949 
this strategy of flame in groups I think
they<00:02:51.129> could<00:02:51.340> probably<00:02:51.609> win<00:02:51.849> it<00:02:51.969> so<00:02:52.569> for<00:02:52.840> our

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
they could probably win it so for our

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.839 
they could probably win it so for our
see<00:02:53.109> they<00:02:53.230> do<00:02:53.409> pretty<00:02:53.650> well<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.310> magenta

here<00:02:58.689> we<00:02:58.780> have<00:02:58.930> few<00:02:59.169> my<00:02:59.650> gentle<00:03:00.189> are<00:03:00.340> things<00:03:00.579> be

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
here we have few my gentle are things be

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.119 
here we have few my gentle are things be
attacking<00:03:01.419> this<00:03:01.510> line<00:03:01.989> learning<00:03:02.319> lime<00:03:02.829> in<00:03:03.010> the

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
attacking this line learning lime in the

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.949 
attacking this line learning lime in the
middle<00:03:03.489> my<00:03:04.000> gosh<00:03:04.180> he<00:03:04.329> lost<00:03:04.540> his<00:03:04.659> grip

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
middle my gosh he lost his grip

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.500 
middle my gosh he lost his grip
I'll<00:03:05.139> think<00:03:05.409> okay<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.159> I<00:03:06.700> think<00:03:06.819> if<00:03:07.090> they<00:03:07.269> keep

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
I'll think okay so I think if they keep

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.360 
I'll think okay so I think if they keep
going<00:03:07.540> like<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:07.989> they<00:03:08.290> might<00:03:08.439> cheat<00:03:08.769> end<00:03:09.069> up

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
going like this they might cheat end up

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.280 
going like this they might cheat end up
losing<00:03:09.669> the<00:03:09.909> faster<00:03:10.180> today<00:03:10.329> to<00:03:10.450> life<00:03:10.689> but<00:03:11.169> if

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
losing the faster today to life but if

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.479 
losing the faster today to life but if
they<00:03:11.469> stay<00:03:11.709> in<00:03:11.739> group<00:03:12.040> something<00:03:12.340> knows

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
they stay in group something knows

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.099 
they stay in group something knows
definitely<00:03:12.969> I<00:03:13.209> think<00:03:13.299> this<00:03:13.659> they're<00:03:13.840> just<00:03:13.870> a

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
definitely I think this they're just a

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.990 
definitely I think this they're just a
few<00:03:14.319> more<00:03:14.469> like<00:03:14.709> magenta<00:03:15.040> left<00:03:15.310> alive<00:03:15.639> believe

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
few more like magenta left alive believe

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.670 
few more like magenta left alive believe
it<00:03:16.150> okay<00:03:16.299> well<00:03:16.629> there's<00:03:16.840> very<00:03:16.959> much<00:03:17.200> attacking

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
it okay well there's very much attacking

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.559 
it okay well there's very much attacking
like<00:03:17.799> all<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.099> groups<00:03:18.340> at<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.519> same<00:03:18.760> time<00:03:19.000> it's

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
like all the groups at a same time it's

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.539 
like all the groups at a same time it's
probably<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:20.139> bad<00:03:20.409> strategy<00:03:20.709> because<00:03:21.430> they

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
probably a bad strategy because they

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.129 
probably a bad strategy because they
could<00:03:21.700> use<00:03:21.879> a<00:03:21.909> lot<00:03:22.120> of<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.629> know<00:03:22.780> soldiers

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
could use a lot of you know soldiers

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.589 
could use a lot of you know soldiers
really<00:03:23.560> fast<00:03:23.980> but<00:03:24.310> so<00:03:24.790> far<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.180> lime<00:03:25.329> doing

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
really fast but so far the lime doing

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.360 
really fast but so far the lime doing
pretty<00:03:25.810> much<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.019> best<00:03:26.319> job<00:03:26.650> in<00:03:26.799> here<00:03:26.979> its

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
pretty much the best job in here its

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.339
