 Exited have always worked me 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.530
 The only fault that is is who has 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.380
 hung up because sometimes the car is very 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.320
 down and the wheels touch and it's ugly 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.930
 good but I notice with all the cars and 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.820
