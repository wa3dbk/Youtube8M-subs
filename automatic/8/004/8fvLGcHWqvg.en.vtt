the rhetoric and the boat rig basically
it's<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.830> sliding<00:00:32.099> bull<00:00:32.430> rig<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:32.969> call<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.239> a

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
it's a sliding bull rig they call it a

it's a sliding bull rig they call it a
shocker<00:00:33.600> rig<00:00:34.640> what<00:00:35.640> happens<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.649> fish

then<00:00:40.379> all<00:00:40.559> sudden<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.670> bead<00:00:41.969> will<00:00:42.180> hold<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
then all sudden the bead will hold the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.350 
then all sudden the bead will hold the
lightweight<00:00:42.960> place<00:00:43.350> creating<00:00:44.070> bull<00:00:44.489> ring<00:00:44.730> so

that's for definite weary fish a lot of
times<00:00:48.450> renderings<00:00:48.930> work<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.379> great<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:49.770> then

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
times renderings work so great but then

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.490 
times renderings work so great but then
it<00:00:50.010> relies<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> do<00:00:51.809> all<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> work<00:00:52.230> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
lot of times that fish picks it up moves

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.450 
lot of times that fish picks it up moves
and<00:00:55.199> then<00:00:55.260> drops<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.829> set<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.190> time<00:00:56.370> you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and then drops it set by the time you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.520 
and then drops it set by the time you
hit<00:00:56.579> your<00:00:56.760> rod<00:00:56.910> try<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.690> set<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> hook<00:00:58.260> it's

this<00:00:59.910> rig<00:01:00.180> eliminates<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.840> problem<00:01:00.930> so

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
this rig eliminates that problem so

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.880 
this rig eliminates that problem so
let's<00:01:02.160> get<00:01:02.280> started<00:01:02.730> very<00:01:03.449> simple<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
let's get started very simple to do and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.440 
let's get started very simple to do and
then<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.070> takes<00:01:05.250> about<00:01:05.400> 30<00:01:05.700> seconds<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.360> change

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
then it takes about 30 seconds to change

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.399 
then it takes about 30 seconds to change

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
make sure they're larger than the part

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.530 
make sure they're larger than the part
that's<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.400> stop<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.210> too<00:01:36.390> small

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that's going to stop if it's too small

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.010 
that's going to stop if it's too small
it<00:01:36.810> might<00:01:36.990> actually<00:01:37.170> go<00:01:37.530> through<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:39.020> when

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it might actually go through and when

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.359 
it might actually go through and when
you<00:01:40.110> look<00:01:40.259> at<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> bead<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:40.860> see<00:01:41.159> where<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
you look at the bead here see where the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.520 
you look at the bead here see where the
hole<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.780> we're<00:01:42.780> actually<00:01:42.930> getting<00:01:43.170> through

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
hole is we're actually getting through

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.679 
hole is we're actually getting through
the<00:01:43.680> rubber<00:01:43.890> itself<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:45.090> will<00:01:45.329> actually

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
the rubber itself this will actually

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.350 
the rubber itself this will actually
hold<00:01:46.350> its<00:01:46.590> place<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> line<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.240> go

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
hold its place on the line if you go

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.700 
hold its place on the line if you go
through<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> hole<00:01:48.780> obviously<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.649> to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
through the hole obviously it's going to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.260 
through the hole obviously it's going to
slide<00:01:49.920> through<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.299> saw<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.600> hooked<00:01:51.899> it

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
slide through so I saw it hooked it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.940 
slide through so I saw it hooked it
grab<00:01:54.270> your<00:01:54.479> line

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:06.100 

Scrabble<00:01:57.729> like<00:01:57.970> that

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.350 

just<00:02:06.710> kind<00:02:06.950> of<00:02:06.980> pinch<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:07.340> in<00:02:07.460> half<00:02:07.640> like<00:02:07.940> so

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.890 

and<00:02:11.360> then<00:02:11.750> we're<00:02:11.900> sliding<00:02:12.170> our<00:02:12.410> beat<00:02:12.620> up<00:02:13.900> onto

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
and then we're sliding our beat up onto

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.380 
and then we're sliding our beat up onto
the<00:02:14.990> main<00:02:15.470> line<00:02:15.500> there<00:02:17.230> okay

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.340 

and<00:02:21.960> just<00:02:22.230> pull<00:02:22.470> through<00:02:26.630> okay<00:02:27.630> right<00:02:28.110> now<00:02:28.290> we

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
and just pull through okay right now we

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.850 
and just pull through okay right now we
have<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:28.920> our<00:02:28.950> main<00:02:29.220> line<00:02:30.530> okay<00:02:31.530> slide

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
have that on our main line okay slide

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.060 
have that on our main line okay slide
that<00:02:32.040> back<00:02:33.440> next<00:02:34.440> we're<00:02:34.530> going<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.680> put<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
that back next we're going to put on the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.680 
that back next we're going to put on the
lead<00:02:35.250> weight<00:02:35.400> we<00:02:35.610> want<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.880> use<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.180> like<00:02:36.300> using

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
lead weight we want to use I like using

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.760 
lead weight we want to use I like using
in<00:02:36.840> lines<00:02:37.050> for<00:02:37.170> these<00:02:38.960> just<00:02:39.960> use<00:02:40.110> an<00:02:40.260> inline

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
in lines for these just use an inline

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.670 
in lines for these just use an inline
cube<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:42.650> just<00:02:43.650> slide<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.040> down<00:02:45.470> okay

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
cube and just slide that down okay

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.340 
cube and just slide that down okay
next<00:02:47.310> thing<00:02:47.430> we<00:02:47.550> want<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.790> do<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.870> part<00:02:49.140> isn't

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
next thing we want to do this part isn't

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.720 
next thing we want to do this part isn't
so<00:02:49.620> much<00:02:49.650> important<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.310> know<00:02:50.370> where<00:02:50.520> we<00:02:50.580> have

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
so much important you know where we have

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.060 
so much important you know where we have
to<00:02:50.850> side<00:02:51.030> hook<00:02:51.270> this<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:52.380> can<00:02:52.560> go<00:02:52.680> through<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
to side hook this you can go through the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.440 
to side hook this you can go through the
hole<00:02:53.250> itself<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:55.370> slide<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.580> down<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
hole itself and slide that down the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.300 
hole itself and slide that down the
reason<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.810> put<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.260> bead<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:58.830> end<00:02:59.100> is

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
reason I put a bead on this end is

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.420 
reason I put a bead on this end is
because<00:03:00.000> if<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.360> don't<00:03:00.860> is<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:02.040> leg<00:03:02.280> weight

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
because if you don't is that leg weight

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.040 
because if you don't is that leg weight
comes<00:03:02.700> up<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.090> can<00:03:03.239> get<00:03:03.360> stuck<00:03:03.690> in<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:04.020> swivel

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
comes up it can get stuck in the swivel

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.710 
comes up it can get stuck in the swivel
and<00:03:07.050> we<00:03:07.140> don't<00:03:07.320> want<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.690> we're<00:03:09.690> just

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
and we don't want that so we're just

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.030 
and we don't want that so we're just
going<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.020> tie<00:03:10.200> this<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.590> real<00:03:10.830> quick

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040

definitely wedding that down any time so
what<00:03:38.879> happens<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:40.079> cast<00:03:40.349> out<00:03:40.620> this<00:03:40.920> all

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
what happens is you cast out this all

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:47.089 
what happens is you cast out this all
slides<00:03:41.400> down<00:03:43.400> so<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.459> have<00:03:45.379> the<00:03:46.379> quick<00:03:46.590> link<00:03:46.829> a

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
slides down so you have the quick link a

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.440 
slides down so you have the quick link a
beat<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.299> will<00:03:48.480> fruit<00:03:49.170> freely<00:03:49.829> slide<00:03:50.450> you

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
beat that will fruit freely slide you

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.899 
beat that will fruit freely slide you
have<00:03:51.599> your<00:03:51.900> wait<00:03:52.139> that<00:03:53.040> lands<00:03:53.280> out<00:03:53.519> there<00:03:53.700> like

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
have your wait that lands out there like

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.409 
have your wait that lands out there like
that<00:03:55.129> because<00:03:56.129> you<00:03:56.310> have<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.430> bead<00:03:56.669> here<00:03:56.939> this

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
that because you have a bead here this

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.929 
that because you have a bead here this
won't<00:03:57.689> get<00:03:57.870> stuck<00:03:58.200> into<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.650> swivel<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.159> used

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
won't get stuck into the swivel I used

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.750 
won't get stuck into the swivel I used
to<00:04:00.060> not<00:04:00.239> put<00:04:00.450> a<00:04:00.530> beat<00:04:01.530> there<00:04:01.769> but<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.609> one<00:04:02.730> time

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
to not put a beat there but the one time

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.720 
to not put a beat there but the one time
I<00:04:02.939> wrote<00:04:03.269> in<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:04.650> was<00:04:04.829> stuck<00:04:05.370> into<00:04:05.549> this

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
all the sudden it fills all that weight

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.730 
all the sudden it fills all that weight
because<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.120> was<00:04:33.330> side<00:04:33.900> rigged<00:04:34.199> through<00:04:34.620> the

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
because I was side rigged through the

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.089 
because I was side rigged through the
bead<00:04:35.180> it<00:04:36.180> won't<00:04:36.389> allow<00:04:36.659> the<00:04:37.080> lead<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.650> slide<00:04:37.919> up

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
bead it won't allow the lead to slide up

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.520 
bead it won't allow the lead to slide up
there<00:04:38.280> now<00:04:38.909> it<00:04:39.539> will<00:04:39.659> fill<00:04:39.900> would<00:04:40.050> get<00:04:40.199> snagged

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
there now it will fill would get snagged

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.129 
there now it will fill would get snagged
up<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.099> break<00:04:41.280> off<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:42.210> will<00:04:42.419> slide<00:04:42.720> up<00:04:42.930> with<00:04:43.110> a

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
up and break off it will slide up with a

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.879 
up and break off it will slide up with a
lot<00:04:43.380> of<00:04:43.409> force<00:04:44.599> but<00:04:45.599> for<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.990> initial<00:04:46.409> pick<00:04:46.620> up

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.740 

the<00:04:49.889> initial<00:04:50.310> pick<00:04:50.490> up<00:04:50.669> of<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.300> fish<00:04:53.750> yeah

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
the initial pick up of the fish yeah

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.040 
the initial pick up of the fish yeah
that's<00:04:54.990> going<00:04:55.110> to<00:04:55.169> feel<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.530> full<00:04:55.740> weight<00:04:57.050> so
