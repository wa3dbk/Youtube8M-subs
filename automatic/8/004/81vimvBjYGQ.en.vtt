have all right but he sees he reached
back<00:01:23.549> everything<00:01:24.149> he's<00:01:24.240> coming<00:01:24.569> in<00:01:24.749> notice

what<00:01:25.560> he<00:01:25.710> did<00:01:25.920> very<00:01:26.249> similar<00:01:26.969> to<00:01:27.030> what<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.359> do

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
what he did very similar to what we do

what he did very similar to what we do
against<00:01:27.869> our<00:01:27.990> bursting<00:01:28.530> 10<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:29.130> almost<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
against our bursting 10 it's almost the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.300 
against our bursting 10 it's almost the
exact<00:01:29.850> same<00:01:29.880> thing<00:01:30.359> he's<00:01:31.020> isolating<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.829> target

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
exact same thing he's isolating a target

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.249 
exact same thing he's isolating a target

he's cut off that angle he's minimized a
tangled<00:01:48.719> The<00:01:49.200> Closer<00:01:49.439> he<00:01:49.619> starts<00:01:50.069> to<00:01:50.189> get<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
tangled The Closer he starts to get to

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.910 
tangled The Closer he starts to get to
me<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.939> even<00:01:51.359> minimize<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.079> even<00:01:52.289> more<00:01:52.499> there's

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
me is even minimize it even more there's

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.279 
me is even minimize it even more there's
no<00:01:53.189> way<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.520> get<00:01:54.299> over<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.990> make<00:01:55.139> the

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
no way I can get over that to make the

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.699 
no way I can get over that to make the
attack<00:01:55.619> ok<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.999> that's<00:01:57.450> again<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.139> basic

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
attack ok so that's again the basic

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:00.889 
attack ok so that's again the basic
principle<00:01:58.979> or<00:01:59.579> concept<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.569> what<00:02:00.719> we're<00:02:00.869> doing

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
principle or concept of what we're doing

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.349 
principle or concept of what we're doing
and<00:02:01.380> then<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.039> just<00:02:02.159> becomes<00:02:02.429> recognition<00:02:03.240> I'm

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
and then it just becomes recognition I'm

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.300 
and then it just becomes recognition I'm
here<00:02:03.929> with<00:02:03.959> him<00:02:04.259> I'm<00:02:04.409> talking<00:02:04.829> she<00:02:05.100> sees<00:02:05.279> me

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
here with him I'm talking she sees me

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.849 
here with him I'm talking she sees me
gold<00:02:05.609> fringe<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.299> grabs<00:02:06.659> now<00:02:06.990> he's<00:02:07.469> basically

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
gold fringe and grabs now he's basically

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.059 
gold fringe and grabs now he's basically
the<00:02:08.100> same<00:02:08.280> control<00:02:08.700> boat<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.720> were

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
the same control boat that we were

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.170 
the same control boat that we were
before<00:02:11.069> we're<00:02:11.459> doing<00:02:11.700> bursting

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
before we're doing bursting

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.990 
before we're doing bursting
360<00:02:12.959> were<00:02:13.079> capturing<00:02:13.829> the<00:02:13.980> weapon<00:02:14.280> all<00:02:14.790> right

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
360 were capturing the weapon all right

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.339 
360 were capturing the weapon all right
so<00:02:15.540> let's<00:02:15.689> take<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.900> look<00:02:16.109> at<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.200> couple

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
so let's take a look at a couple

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.020 
so let's take a look at a couple
different<00:02:16.560> possibilities<00:02:17.370> once<00:02:17.609> again<00:02:17.849> from

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
different possibilities once again from

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.459 
different possibilities once again from
this<00:02:18.180> side<00:02:18.390> here<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:18.659> move<00:02:18.959> our<00:02:19.109> saying<00:02:19.349> a

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
this side here I move our saying a

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.559 
this side here I move our saying a
little<00:02:19.709> bit<00:02:19.859> John<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.909> up<00:02:21.000> with<00:02:21.180> him<00:02:21.269> he<00:02:21.359> sees

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
little bit John it up with him he sees

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.440 
little bit John it up with him he sees
me<00:02:21.599> go<00:02:21.810> here<00:02:22.079> and<00:02:22.379> he's<00:02:22.650> grabbing<00:02:23.519> Jami<00:02:23.819> he's

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
me go here and he's grabbing Jami he's

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.240 
me go here and he's grabbing Jami he's
got<00:02:24.659> total<00:02:24.870> control<00:02:25.079> right<00:02:25.620> now<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.099> can

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
got total control right now and you can

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.449 
got total control right now and you can
mount<00:02:26.730> attacks<00:02:27.090> or<00:02:27.390> do<00:02:27.510> what's<00:02:27.719> necessary

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
mount attacks or do what's necessary

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.879 
mount attacks or do what's necessary
let's<00:02:29.459> say<00:02:29.609> for<00:02:29.849> some<00:02:30.000> reason<00:02:30.469> I'm<00:02:31.469> carrying

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
let's say for some reason I'm carrying

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:36.349 
let's say for some reason I'm carrying
it<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:32.310> front<00:02:32.639> or<00:02:33.650> heavy<00:02:34.650> reach<00:02:34.950> across<00:02:35.359> okay

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
it in front or heavy reach across okay

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.179 
it in front or heavy reach across okay
right<00:02:36.540> now<00:02:36.719> you<00:02:36.780> can<00:02:37.049> see<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.379> so<00:02:37.889> he<00:02:38.040> knows

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
right now you can see it so he knows

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.860 
right now you can see it so he knows
that<00:02:38.370> there's<00:02:38.579> a<00:02:38.639> night<00:02:38.819> there<00:02:39.000> by<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.180> way<00:02:39.389> if

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
that there's a night there by the way if

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.240 
that there's a night there by the way if
this<00:02:40.049> should<00:02:40.230> be<00:02:40.349> someone<00:02:40.650> walks<00:02:40.889> up<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.099> me

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
this should be someone walks up to me

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.709 
this should be someone walks up to me
I'm<00:02:41.459> taking<00:02:41.639> that<00:02:41.879> night<00:02:42.150> before<00:02:42.540> they<00:02:42.629> even

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
I'm taking that night before they even

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.409 
I'm taking that night before they even
think<00:02:43.200> about<00:02:43.319> taking<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:44.549> so<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.879> emphasis

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:45.419 
think about taking just so that emphasis

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.059 
think about taking just so that emphasis
a<00:02:45.510> little<00:02:45.750> food<00:02:45.930> for<00:02:46.139> thought<00:02:46.349> it's<00:02:46.799> too<00:02:47.040> much

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
a little food for thought it's too much

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.720 
a little food for thought it's too much
of<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.400> dangerous<00:02:47.790> weapon<00:02:48.019> all<00:02:49.019> right<00:02:49.230> now<00:02:50.069> as<00:02:50.430> I

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.369 
of a dangerous weapon all right now as I
start<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.060> reach<00:02:51.359> he's<00:02:51.900> just<00:02:52.079> going<00:02:52.169> to<00:02:52.230> reach

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
start to reach he's just going to reach

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.860 
start to reach he's just going to reach
across<00:02:52.579> very<00:02:53.579> similar<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.359> you<00:02:54.480> see<00:02:54.659> in<00:02:54.780> our
