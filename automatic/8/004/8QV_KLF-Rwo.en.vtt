00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
thousand million power pack so it weighs

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.300 
thousand million power pack so it weighs
41<00:01:56.149> pounds<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:57.560> just<00:01:57.740> looks<00:01:57.860> awesome<00:01:58.250> in

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
41 pounds and it just looks awesome in
