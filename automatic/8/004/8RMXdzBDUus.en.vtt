00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.180
 very good kids here we are with 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.090
 another video more and good we are in the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.720
 Experience map with the scratch is what 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.180
 that I bring you basically is a nuclear 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.010
 a little bit slower more slow in 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.930
 those that only go up three minutes 50 I think 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.570
 which is the nuclear but good is not 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.070
 not bad at all so in short it's a 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.040
 little bit so deep that I want to tell you about 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.720
 a subject that is not asked from time to time 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.210
 when and good recently begins to 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.950
 do it the subject of promotions worth 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.240
 elaborate put in the title because some 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.970
 Interests I guess you will have come in to see 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.950
 that and before I start I would like to say 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.930
 also that I do not know why I lost a 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.910
 thing the filter of one or something like that 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.340
 micro and I do not know if how are you going to hear this 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.860
 but good to see the issue of 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.510
 promotions much less you ask than good 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.670
 talk more about this instead of 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:59.160
 just do them and such and say what 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.140
 the promotions of not having 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.120
 two of the promotions I made up 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.550
 now if the two I've done up 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.960
 now it's been because these kids 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.460
 they promoted to me also that they had 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.650
 the same subscribers that I almost 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.120
 interest I also exist the favor ok 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.770
 interest as of now since I 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.900
 you have talked about the subject what I am going to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.090
 do is that promoted to you 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.060
 It's worth promoting good, I already have some 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.369
 Subscribers 2,300 is not bad at all and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.650
 Well, I 'm not complaining, it's one that I think 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.380
 a pass so to thank you for a 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.540
 little since if you a thousand subscribers 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.000
 I'm going to promote or, well, what 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.500
 I will explain a little bit simply 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.300
 I explain in this video it's worth not 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.060
 it's very complicated just tell you 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.570
 that to see the requirements although the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.950
 quality be completely h of these 15 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.160
 720 p is not worth mobile I do not worth a 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.530
 capturing that does not record 720p is worth I think 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.119
 that this is a requirement that is good 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.590
 time to say it in the times that 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.690
 we are now from youtube that all the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.750
 world uploads the expendable videos 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.230
 have good quality because if it's not worth it 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.620
 I'm not sorry it's not quality 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.210
 and finally 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.580
 the other requirement is that it be Carlos 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.320
 giusti since that's what I go up and it's what 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.150
 that to my superiors is to say to you 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.830
 we like it then I will not promote 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.670
 something that people will not like 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.170
 because we would have no sense do not 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.150
 it matters what time of departure is worth 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.070
 if you want to pass me my things but about 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.510
 everything is very impressive is to try 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.490
 it's fun that I explain many 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.209
 times the first because the same 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.209
 yes the funny videos 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.120
 one thing that I also want to know is that if 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.030
 me panda is a game in which you 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.150
 do more than 100 casualties and there are less 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.850
 of 20 deaths let's say less than 15 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.950
 deaths is what I leave the grapes there 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.840
 obstruction or insurance less than 15 deaths 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.380
 and more than 100 casualties will secure production 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.240
 what camps is clear to me and I teach 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.580
 you pass it to me I commented what 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.560
 You do not know if I can manage that 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.630
 cut something what can happen I'll talk 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.880
 and that 's always a little whenever 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.460
 it is solved between the person who 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.290
 go to official and good basically 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.320
 that's fine you can send me any type 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.880
 from starting tell me a little before 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.350
 to not record the commented video for 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.060
 nothing is worth seeing you know that you are going to 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.720
 comment you front as if it were 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.370
 for my channel and that's worth kids I hope 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.310
 that at least but I would like 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.100
 you will learn a little to put it that way 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.800
 gesture worth not deserved with this that 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.330
 say that I am a child of the functional type 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.550
 well, nothing happens to see us 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.530
 just deserved what 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.540
 of a promotion that maybe we 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.670
 I'd really appreciate it if the subject 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.890
 of the nonsense the book is for my 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.320
 videos since I would not like that it does not leave 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.790
 to tell people that I am 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.530
 promoting voucher to help them and such 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.190
 because good demotivates a little to do 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.320
 this kind of thing what is all worth 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.900
 send me universitat dale I like to 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.430
 video a good nuclear and do not feel 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.430
 greetings and goodbye
