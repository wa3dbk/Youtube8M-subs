00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.350
 hi everyone today I want to start a 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.460
 series of presentations that we are going to go 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.650
 doing from the page of lay m 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.920
 so that many people who come to 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.220
 we can see and verify that 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.740
 still 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.950
 practically the entire series of leica that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.200
 they have been manufactured are operational and that 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.970
 even the oldest ones like the first 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.290
 what are we going to see today from the law k 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.650
 one 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.200
 you can take 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.270
 when dividing it can become used 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.920
 without major problem with logically their 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.330
 limitations but it is operative in the 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.870
 concrete model that I am going to teach is 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.320
 a standard leica that within the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.739
 series 1 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.040
 it's a bit special because it was from 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.630
 of that model when 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.060
 start 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.880
 and incorporate optical feel to the champion 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.010
 well albeit previous to this model that 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.670
 it's series 1 as I said 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.860
 of icaa and 10 was exactly the first 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.390
 scholarship that was made 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.400
 and this does not differ 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.770
 and a lot of the first series of 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.550
 basically has the controls 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.790
 and functions 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.370
 first that developed this type 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.560
 of cameras that like most of them opened 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.970
 by itself 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.400
 a model from which 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 they developed all the beds at 35 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.720
 the most indicative controls that they have in 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.390
 its part in the top lid for a 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.560
 part is the rewind command is 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.560
 this press conference 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.210
 allows effectively as it says 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.250
 to return the movie 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.030
 the next one that exists is a viewer and 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.030
 just very simple 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.640
 direct 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.190
 a flash shoe obviously without 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.450
 No contact yet 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.569
 simply as flash support 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.020
 one of the most important commands that is 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.130
 the shutter speeds 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:28.350
 how is the speed go from 30 a 30 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.350
 or up to 500 and then have a 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.739
 moscada that puts of 20-1 for 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.150
 slow speeds but that this camera 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.600
 still of logically by me 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.450
 incorporated 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.710
 the fundamental firing button and he 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.400
 but the charge control 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.370
 of the film to be able to advance 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.940
 as is the case 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.940
 I can shoot 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:05.350
 super basic and super simple and other 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.620
 small command that you can appreciate here 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.090
 It is a lever that helps us 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.090
 lock and unlock the clutch 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.630
 that we can review once we have 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.820
 finish 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.520
 36 or the 24 photos we have in 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.760
 negative then we move forward to 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.760
 rewind 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.740
 the people 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.950
 it gives them equal power 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:33.630
 the movie in the chassis again in the 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.630
 front only the objective 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.320
 actively 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.900
 the command in this case is a very 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.650
 old sea 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.510
 to 50 millimeters 5 centimeters to kill 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.680
 foods 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:55.900
 this particular objective is of the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:59.800
 first series of 1934 and the camera is 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.590
 one year after 1935 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.860
 since then have not much more of a 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.950
 camera 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.580
 very basic and simple to everyone 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.290
 approaching the world may seem strange 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.260
 that this still works but 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:20.470
 most forgotten the most significant thing that 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.720
 they have all the leica cameras 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.850
 of the telemetric type although this one does not 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.320
 but still I had elements Well 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.320
 the one that apart from that developed 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.340
 The housing corp by telemeter indicates that 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.780
 is the charging system if the public does not 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.310
 has appeared and that the private one that 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.710
 makes the town logically result 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.110
 they are both 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.230
 with this command that I have here gave me 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.260
 turn the apron of this stage and that 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.210
 access stage 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.100
 the inside of the body in which 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:58.740
 we have two spaces clearly 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:02.070
 differentiated to the right and left and 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.670
 by which we have to load the chassis 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.670
 of film 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:10.129
 to the south is an error and nothing 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.880
 the movie is simple 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.840
 all stuck 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.840
 the movie 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:41.630
 small sheet that presses 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.630
 the negative and there 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.870
 we incorporate 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.330
 both negative chassis as I could them 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.169
 of regulator 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.169
 to your site 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.580
 move along 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.840
 we had the flare ready to shoot
