00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.030
 a new video of my aquarium 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.559
 You can see the relationship of the plants 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.559
 here a bomb 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.349
 the same meter 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.349
 sometimes double pencils 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.260
 tilt 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.260
 once and 3 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.880
 and points 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.880
 half white 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.720
 isner jazz glasses 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.740
 do not hide the background 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.740
 luke videos 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.190
 is the trunk where parenthesis 3 good 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.190
 will have come down to be expected 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.390
 his cucumber shoes that I give to this 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.050
 hour 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.980
 in doubt 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.750
 we can look like the knobs x are 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:24.650
 10 in total 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.650
 the detail is in my neon is everyone 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.509
 it seems that a 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.700
 and this is their own territory had 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.280
 what we see in the image 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.680
 for just like the others 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.750
 protecting the front of the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.830
 aquarium that its territory 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.700
 for this until the other 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.530
 same 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.430
 losing himself to the other by the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.030
 territory 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.030
 Fight 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.510
 if one animal in the other's territory 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.450
 pond they fight 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:03.140
 and here is the other there are six in total and 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.920
 each one defends a piece of the aquarium 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.770
 it's something curious I would like you 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.670
 friends of the forum tell me what it is that 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.740
 is happening 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.440
 I had never had this neon case 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.030
 that are territorial and that defend 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.030
 a territory like these 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.850
 and suddenly they will see another fight 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.800
 I am entering the territory of the other 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.310
 to eat he still does not see it 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.310
 magazine 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.540
 if the plants are fine 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.670
 in transit 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.670
 fellini with 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.680
 what is a tetra de loreto is not 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.680
 will tire to see 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.140
 do not 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.799
 he is the only one who had sneaked in 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.799
 Sirs 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.930
 the resolution of the camera is very good 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:34.560
 but here I leave a video 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:37.520
 more highlight x2 x 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.520
 where 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:47.090
 of another species in it seems to me not 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.090
 we take x I do not know what others will say 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.970
 I think the volumes are 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.970
 good is everything
