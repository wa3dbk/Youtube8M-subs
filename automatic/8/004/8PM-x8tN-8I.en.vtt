cross pieces I'm just kind of digging it

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.150 
cross pieces I'm just kind of digging it
up<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.350> hooking<00:00:49.350> them<00:00:49.410> together<00:00:49.620> I'll<00:00:49.950> bend

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
up and hooking them together I'll bend

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160 
up and hooking them together I'll bend
the<00:00:50.280> back<00:00:50.430> I'll<00:00:50.670> probably<00:00:50.930> maybe<00:00:51.930> put<00:00:52.140> a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the back I'll probably maybe put a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.290 
the back I'll probably maybe put a
little<00:00:52.230> tack<00:00:52.590> weld<00:00:52.829> back<00:00:53.610> there<00:00:53.850> with<00:00:54.120> my

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
little tack weld back there with my

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.979 
little tack weld back there with my
welder<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:56.180> seal<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.329> up<00:00:57.390> again<00:00:58.370> and<00:01:00.170> yeah

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
welder to seal that up again and yeah

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.609 
welder to seal that up again and yeah

way to hook it on the outside of the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.899 
way to hook it on the outside of the
wheel<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:56.939> put<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.180> zip<00:01:57.420> tie<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
wheel just put a zip tie on there to

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.600 
wheel just put a zip tie on there to
kind<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> hold<00:02:00.090> it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610

pretty<00:02:04.610> good<00:02:11.500> regular<00:02:12.500> set<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.770> chains<00:02:14.800> should

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
pretty good regular set of chains should

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.540 
pretty good regular set of chains should
be<00:02:15.920> alright<00:02:16.090> now<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.570> make<00:02:17.690> another<00:02:17.780> one

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
be alright now to make another one
