00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.190
 ag know guide first I want 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.230
 say that canon for me one of the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.910
 strongest adecco it is above all things 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.670
 against his hair because of his hard 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.620
 crowd control and the crowd control 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.340
 demonstrated by the fact that it can very open 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.779
 your mainstay is the wsb you will 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.710
 then the eu will go first as well 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.109
 and also the cake and of course 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.029
 mainly the uli and in the following 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.820
 i will give you the space as well as home 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.980
 stories and a perfect every picture 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.199
 then I'll show you a few more 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.270
 perfect supporter for you to dissolve 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.170
 and I hope I would round a 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.170
 make little fun 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.790
 esp makes extra with every fifth car 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.950
 damage in percentage of your 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.390
 attack man and he does 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.480
 at the same time once the storm on one 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.070
 opponent what makes you very easy 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.239
 The opponent is together if you then 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.700
 Once again the reactivated comes in 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.310
 another time 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.170
 in connection with your football is one 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.420
 very strong combination because then the opponent 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.950
 Automatically confessed immediately and you can 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.650
 continue to turn on him and who to whom 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.120
 occurred faster again 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.710
 esp gives pass speed and resistances 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.380
 and is thus the perfect chase and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.090
 escape special 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.920
 let us now come to the championships 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.990
 and succeeded in the highest priority 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.829
 in the course of skill is of course in the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.259
 multi after that comes your w and your e and 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.970
 Last but not least the crew at the 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.079
 I strongly recommend championships 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.259
 21 90 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:30.710
 because on ag it also strengthens yours 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.259
 war damage because that gets mrd 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.509
 offers little and of course the nine 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.640
 the fans score for the opponent 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.929
 not so much harm and suffer 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.689
 also the support and extra 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.179
 we are now coming to the internet and to life 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:48.020
 the glory of canon starts at the beginning 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.789
 blade with a display of a korans 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.409
 if your supporter is here, though 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.520
 only if he can not do that already 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.369
 and drink trinity 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.220
 then comes the frost basin and then 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.429
 You buy yourself so if it goes with 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.959
 Sega boots and steady Steve then want 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.030
 her with a blood test the phantom 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:09.649
 Dancers I think that's the best 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.660
 damage car damage car good to 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.519
 then an infiniti age one takes place 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.290
 plaintiff finiteness for the high war 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.660
 damage and the tank for not the blade 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.269
 of the lich king recommend in the rest 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.100
 I in the essen ag in the sign ag 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:27.260
 the seal amor so sea life on ear 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.079
 and the lion commend I recommend 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.269
 magic resistance at level 18 for the 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:37.850
 necessary strength in the endgame he is not 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.920
 other word to 1 liked as support 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.700
 for canon I strongly recommend tarik 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.130
 because this can then and channel what 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.190
 the beginning for canon with a display 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.160
 but in the blade well possible then can 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.930
 he still the one the resistance of the 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.790
 lower opponents and he also gives 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.530
 still hd and ap for know what to be 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.459
 Damage maximized in both respects 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.650
 However, tarik is not the only one 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.660
 support for know good alternatives 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.670
 are for example also morgana or 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.950
 Leona which was not recommended 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.370
 is so rare because you can get it again 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.810
 give 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.700
 Let us now come to the obvious ones 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.900
 benefits for canon on the hotline as 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.699
 ag carey for one, he has no 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.590
 resource so no painter but only 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:25.230
 energy as a resource 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.209
 and it regenerates naturally 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.300
 pretty fast and he can not 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.300
 bypass 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.160
 that makes them natural for you 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.510
 behave very strongly as will 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.040
 bit lifestyle and agile and 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.349
 Supporter he can almost forever 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.090
 the rest stay 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.430
 Furthermore, it had a very high crowd 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.959
 control and his multi almost leaves him 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.860
 every broadline fight was for itself 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.269
 so we decide too 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.580
 actually at the end of the guide 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.430
 arrived because I really see 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:01.049
 disadvantages for know but his something 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.220
 low tech range and i would like me 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.560
 very happy if one or the other 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.940
 of you tried the guide here 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.310
 because I have already pretty much 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.590
 good results can be achieved then 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.269
 For example, a conclusion as a video 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.959
 send answer or in the comments 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.849
 Post 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.739
 I hope it pleases and then 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.919
 until next time with your chains 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.919
 kia
