00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.080
 so I'm still here again 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.490
 painting the seven with you 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.400
 and today I came to bring a special tip 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.560
 how to leave a shoe much more 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.690
 delicious in detail 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.600
 I'm going to use simple things that people 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.240
 can find in the day to day out there that is 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.179
 a tape that is a biased tip that I 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.019
 I paid super cheap it's 70 cents thing 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:33.480
 5 near these metal parts 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.829
 I bought the rounds but you can 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.410
 meet different market 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.440
 as the main ones are super trendy 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.199
 I will use a pair of scissors and some 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.910
 schools and a party in the range of $ 1 2 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.789
 real in the market that we are going to do 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.449
 a loop and this one will be the center of 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:04.170
 my side 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:08.360
 So let's start, I'll get the tape. 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:17.130
 and I'm going to tie her up I'm going to get her 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:18.600
 the first loop of the loop and cut using 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.290
 this necklace that is a necklace glue 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.290
 fabric 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.950
 and this little pebble will now be the center 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.950
 by my side 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.720
 this tie we will go it will be 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.830
 put here will make all the difference 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.200
 in the shoe 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.410
 a tip is also you put it here 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:11.860
 Look, there's just a different way. 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:15.370
 to apply it and leave it the charming 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.560
 Luckily I'll apply the parts 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.000
 Metallic in the shoe I'll wear this 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.520
 glue here 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.100
 is the most resistant glue with this type 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.680
 material I will not take the risk of 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.610
 after she quit when using the 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:35.880
 shoe is good I'll apply here 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.880
 side on the back of the shoe 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.260
 I'll apply on this side and here 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.549
 also on the back of the shoe 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.970
 looks just gives all accessory difference 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.519
 a piece that you apply in the shoe 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.349

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.349
