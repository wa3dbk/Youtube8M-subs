00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.509
 today we will learn to make us a cake 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:12.930
 need in each row of 42 modules such 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.880
 next we have to collect 4 collect 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.699
 we put on the short side 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.589
 This module for a long and collect so 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.630
 three full rows closes the ring then 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.819
 fourth row we also collect two 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.579
 module of the same size only through 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:31.079
 every 6 modules we insert the module 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:36.450
 another color here for example 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:44.960
 orange module now we are these rows 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:48.380
 I will gather a little bit together with you 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.400
 will continue to collect with you 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:57.720
 we collect as usual 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:12.539
 collected before in all fakes first 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:16.799
 row 2 3 here on these two fists 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:21.689
 and then we also collect 4 row but when 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:24.539
 we collect 4 row we every 6 here 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.420
 collect 6 white set color module 6 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.630
 whites color module now i will 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.119
 collect then show what happened that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.749
 do further with our assembled modules 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.420
 Well, I collected 4 rows 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:43.289
 came out 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.859
 now we need to collect 5th row for the fifth 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:50.029
 row I take modules 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:53.389
 Orange I take 2 orange modules only 

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:56.159
 a sheet of paper is not one to four 

00:01:53.389 --> 00:02:02.450
 cut one to eight in a rectangle 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:07.009
 I made an A4 sheet and put these corners on 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.009
 orange white one 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:23.620
 live white and so i put on everything 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.319
 orange corners 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.519
 all those orange corners and here I wear 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:38.090
 white modules which are made 116 of 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:42.290
 A4 sheet I put on all white wolves 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.379
 circle in the total number of these modules 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.409
 of course there will be 42 together if you fold them 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:52.129
 Now I will collect all this and then 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:54.700
 let's see what we will do next now 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.859
 we will collect the top of the cake 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:03.519
 assembly principle later only 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:08.120
 differ in module sizes 1 to 8 and 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:12.739
 22 modules must be in each row 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:16.370
 collect 5 rows of 22 modules and closes 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:21.049
 in the sixth row ring we will collect 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.840
 also 22 modules but the size of the modules will be 1 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:30.790
 to 16 they will be even less 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.790
 5 rows collect their closable in a ring and 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:40.560
 then we will collect the sixth row 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.700
 with small modules and turns it like this 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.300
 the same way crafts 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:52.970
 as we turned on the lower tier of the cake 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.970
 we collect now I collected 5 rows 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:03.750
 sixth row we take less and modules 116 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:12.050
 which these were one to eight this 1 in 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:15.500
 16 and one more circle we string 22 modules 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.500
 on the corners 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:26.510
 so we continue until I meet 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.510
 Here I strung all the modules 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:53.520
 fake now we it will be the top 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:56.250
 tier cake that's what's the point here and 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.510
 cut out such a circle and made just such 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.720
 portion with modules 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.260
 Now I will stick it all on the circle gray 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.160
 inside 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:14.070
 then put the cake so I stuck 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:18.200
 Crite now inside this ring 1 tier 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.200
 port here sheets just fine 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.670
 became neat scott now on this 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.470
 tier need to put 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:36.090
 represent less so that it was visible 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:40.290
 here we have pockets and here in each 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.920
 Pocket need to put a corner here I am 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.020
 put in 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.590
 don't forget to insert the main thing 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:50.040
 through the module because we have here 42 a 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.090
 here 22 and it turns the skull through the groove in 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.520
 these 2 put 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.300
 this missed leave the widow left 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.270
 this missed 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.620
 Well, now let 's do the decoration 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.520
 now we will make our green 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.130
 petals on a toothpick require us 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:16.520
 leg module 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:19.730
 cheat it too cheat then 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.730
 grease glue 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:39.939
 paste each other glue and here here 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:46.930
 there are edges too we stick out 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:54.430
 such petals are double for analyze 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:59.529
 red modules also cheat on 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:04.330
 toothpick turn to petal 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:09.400
 It turned out and we stick it on the circle like this 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:18.610
 preferably 5 petals stick the middle 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:21.389
 and get a rosette decorate the cake well 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:26.949
 so I decorated the cake with roses 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:32.430
 This cake turned out pretty I think 

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:32.430
 you will get even better
