well<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.790> recommend<00:01:27.299> use<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> longer<00:01:28.170> blade<00:01:28.290> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
well we recommend use a longer blade and

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
inch length blade is fine it then takes

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.170 
inch length blade is fine it then takes
a<00:02:00.060> section<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.020> he's<00:02:01.200> able<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.560> cut<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.180> very
