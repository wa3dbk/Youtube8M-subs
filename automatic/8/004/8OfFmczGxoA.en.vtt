00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 I wish you all good health 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.240
 share the way of planting seedlings 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.400
 celery 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.170
 in fact, everything is very simple no 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.540
 absolutely nothing complicated 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.450
 first you need to take the usual plate 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.470
 that is, more precisely, this saucer on a saucer 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.810
 put the usual paper napkin further 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.900
 take it neatly moisten this whole thing 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.310
 to completely wet the cloth 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.230
 after that and so that the bottom was 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.630
 a little bit more like a puddle 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.000
 a little water then you're on this wet 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.510
 napkin once and water celery seeds and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.719
 in this mode, they should lie in this 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.730
 wet environment three days naturally need 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.920
 make sure that the humidity is 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.230
 constant that is if there you are 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.199
 water evaporates if you are very room 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.140
 it is hot therefore it is necessary from time to time 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.320
 water add took a teaspoon and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.270
 wet gently with a tablespoon 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.699
 napkin naturally on wet 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.900
 the napkin will get wet 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:09.350
 celery seeds here is the first stage 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.200
 such a regime for three days are seeds 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.470
 then they need you all and vat in the ground 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.619
 second stage seedling tank 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.700
 I poured here ordinary land which 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.460
 took on a handful that made me a mole 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.520
 I need the land, I stood for two days with me 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.860
 warmed to room temperature 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.930
 surf she dried out a little and i need 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.930
 moisten it for something i use normal 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:43.229
 pshikalka but you can some kind of mini cure in 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.619
 nursery or pot but what would u 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.619
 who have 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:59.490
 after moistening the land you need for this 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:05.100
 No need to disperse seeds in wet ground 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:10.010
 sow too thick and can be clearly seen on 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.010
 wet earth and so little by little 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:23.400
 dissipate after i scattered 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:26.790
 seeds do not need to cover this container 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.650
 cover with some kind of film before us 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.560
 I have a large capacity so I took 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.560
 big pack and so here I put it on 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.560
 capacity 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:51.500
 Now I will align and then turn on the camera 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:55.730
 that's how it all looks like an extra packet i 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.090
 so took and wrapped the film needed for 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.620
 to protect the earth from evaporation 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.620
 moisture only in that state 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.250
 seeds will be 5-7 days later 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.310
 5-7 days they will begin to germinate pro by 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.550
 at least I plan so from time 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.069
 time you need to remove this film and again 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.989
 same this squirter and moisten the earth 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.350
 so that the seeds are not dry 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:28.040
 at this stage for seed germination 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.410
 sunlight is not needed so i dont 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.989
 I will store this capacity seedlings on 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.690
 windowsill and just put in the kitchen 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.690
 for example on the floor and so at room 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.870
 the temperature of the seeds poked up and then 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.489
 already when we do not start to grow 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.190
 put on the window sill closer to 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.859
 sunlight after seeds 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.970
 ascend a little start Russia will appear 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.950
 two leaves celery seedlings need 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.060
 dive but it is already completely different 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.780
 the story is quite another video thanks that 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.590
 watched 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.590
 see you bye
