00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:25.769 

let's<00:00:05.760> try<00:00:05.970> it<00:00:06.029> up<00:00:06.210> here

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.639 

none<00:00:26.779> of<00:00:26.810> the<00:00:26.990> middle<00:00:27.320> is<00:00:27.380> a<00:00:27.439> good<00:00:27.650> thing<00:00:29.649> check

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:30.649 
none of the middle is a good thing check

00:00:30.649 --> 00:01:25.090 
none of the middle is a good thing check
it<00:00:30.770> out<00:00:30.860> we<00:00:31.040> can<00:00:31.489> starve<00:00:31.759> it<00:00:31.880> out<00:00:32.000> almost<00:00:32.329> like

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.770 

then<00:01:26.100> if<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.340> take<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.760> up<00:01:26.880> probably<00:01:27.450> get<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> lot

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
then if we take it up probably get a lot

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:56.010 
then if we take it up probably get a lot
more<00:01:27.810> break<00:01:28.170> up<00:01:28.410> in<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:29.070> plane

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.480 

so<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.140> gets<00:01:57.259> up<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.710> dirty<00:01:57.979> part<00:01:58.310> and

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
so it gets up to that dirty part and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.279 
so it gets up to that dirty part and
then<00:01:58.579> you<00:01:58.729> can<00:01:58.850> go<00:01:59.000> down<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.450> dirty<00:01:59.990> side

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
then you can go down to the dirty side

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.749 
then you can go down to the dirty side
and<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:00.829> can<00:02:00.920> kind<00:02:01.070> of<00:02:01.189> pick<00:02:01.340> up<00:02:01.399> where<00:02:01.549> you

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
and you can kind of pick up where you

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.600 
and you can kind of pick up where you
left<00:02:01.850> off<00:02:02.530> start<00:02:03.530> with<00:02:03.649> a<00:02:03.679> loud<00:02:03.920> volume<00:02:04.429> and

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
left off start with a loud volume and

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:24.039 
left off start with a loud volume and
bring<00:02:04.789> your<00:02:04.880> gain<00:02:05.119> up<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.540> one<00:02:23.720> thing<00:02:23.750> in

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
bring your gain up so the one thing in

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.320 
bring your gain up so the one thing in
the<00:02:24.110> bugs<00:02:24.350> me<00:02:24.560> about<00:02:24.590> answers<00:02:25.250> if<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.120> all

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
the bugs me about answers if it all

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.059 
the bugs me about answers if it all
comes<00:02:26.360> from<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.930> output<00:02:27.140> transformer

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
comes from the output transformer

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.990 
comes from the output transformer
instead<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.580> preamp<00:02:29.769> so<00:02:30.769> I<00:02:30.799> figured<00:02:31.220> got<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:31.910> be

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
instead of preamp so I figured got to be

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.490 
instead of preamp so I figured got to be
able<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.239> get<00:02:32.450> your<00:02:32.720> tone<00:02:32.959> at<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.200> small

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
able to get your tone at the small

00:02:33.500 --> 00:03:10.760 
able to get your tone at the small
volumes

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.220 

one<00:03:11.770> question<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:12.250> get<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.430> how<00:03:12.700> loud<00:03:12.910> can<00:03:12.940> go<00:03:13.360> my

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
one question I get is how loud can go my

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:28.430 
one question I get is how loud can go my
thing<00:03:14.470> is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.600 

I

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:42.440
