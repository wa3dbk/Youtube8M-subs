00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
nice or background and I'm also trying

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.610 
nice or background and I'm also trying
to<00:00:44.850> get<00:00:45.090> better<00:00:45.239> lighting<00:00:45.600> right<00:00:46.350> now<00:00:46.500> I'm

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
to get better lighting right now I'm

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.160 
to get better lighting right now I'm
using<00:00:46.739> an<00:00:47.010> LED<00:00:47.520> light<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.690> great<00:00:48.930> is

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
using an LED light and not that great is

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.500 
using an LED light and not that great is
really<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.890> washes<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.270> color

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
really like washes out all of the color

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.080 
really like washes out all of the color
so<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.160> deal<00:00:53.309> with<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
so you have to deal with that just for a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.819 
so you have to deal with that just for a
little<00:00:54.239> while<00:00:54.360> longer<00:00:54.660> but<00:00:55.350> enough<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.770> that

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
little while longer but enough of that

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.250 
little while longer but enough of that

see I have my lawn today usually when I

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
see I have my lawn today usually when I
film<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> video<00:01:04.320> i<00:01:04.530> wear<00:01:04.860> my<00:01:05.010> contacts<00:01:05.489> and

film a video i wear my contacts and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.399 
film a video i wear my contacts and
that's<00:01:06.360> because<00:01:06.540> i<00:01:06.810> want<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.080> see<00:01:07.200> what<00:01:07.320> I'm

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
that's because i want to see what I'm

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.039 
that's because i want to see what I'm
doing<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:08.490> I'm<00:01:08.700> not<00:01:08.729> wearing<00:01:09.150> my<00:01:09.240> glasses<00:01:09.299> or

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
doing if I'm not wearing my glasses or

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.950 
doing if I'm not wearing my glasses or
contacts<00:01:10.710> I'm<00:01:10.950> pretty<00:01:11.250> much<00:01:11.510> blind<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> bat

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
contacts I'm pretty much blind as a bat

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.190 
contacts I'm pretty much blind as a bat
so<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.729> hard<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:15.180> doing<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.600> tutorial

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
so it was hard to doing this tutorial

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.980 
so it was hard to doing this tutorial
without<00:01:17.189> my<00:01:17.430> glasses<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:18.060> or<00:01:18.270> any<00:01:18.509> contacts

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
without my glasses on or any contacts

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.710 
without my glasses on or any contacts
but<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.259> think<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.590> came<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.890> pretty<00:01:19.950> decent<00:01:20.720> so

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
but I think it came out pretty decent so

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.090 
but I think it came out pretty decent so
