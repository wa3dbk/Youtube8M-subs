the gauze two thousand eight hundred and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.330 
the gauze two thousand eight hundred and
I<00:01:09.870> thought<00:01:10.050> that's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.320> bit<00:01:10.470> strange<00:01:10.800> sure<00:01:11.160> you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
I thought that's a bit strange sure you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.610 
I thought that's a bit strange sure you
must<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.580> been<00:01:11.760> faster<00:01:12.210> than<00:01:12.330> me<00:01:12.450> no<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:13.560> I

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
must have been faster than me no and I

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.410 
must have been faster than me no and I
wasn't<00:01:14.010> under<00:01:14.370> cent<00:01:14.610> sure<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.270> was

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
wasn't under cent sure if that was

that I found the manual for it and it

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.470 
that I found the manual for it and it
says<00:01:30.690> this<00:01:30.840> particular<00:01:31.110> motor<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:34.040> at<00:01:35.480> will

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
says this particular motor here at will

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.270 
says this particular motor here at will
make<00:01:36.630> four<00:01:36.960> kilowatts<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.560> power<00:01:37.620> which<00:01:38.190> is

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
make four kilowatts of power which is

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.250 
make four kilowatts of power which is
roughly<00:01:38.430> 5.5<00:01:39.270> horsepower<00:01:39.480> which<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.110> what

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
roughly 5.5 horsepower which is what

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.880 
roughly 5.5 horsepower which is what
this<00:01:40.380> motor<00:01:40.620> is<00:01:40.800> I<00:01:40.890> believe<00:01:41.810> so<00:01:42.890> four

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
this motor is I believe so four

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.110 
this motor is I believe so four
kilowatts<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.280> power<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.930> 3600<00:01:45.930> rpm<00:01:46.640> yeah<00:01:47.700> hmm

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
kilowatts of power of 3600 rpm yeah hmm

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.710 
kilowatts of power of 3600 rpm yeah hmm
I'm<00:01:48.240> thinking<00:01:48.380> it's<00:01:49.380> only<00:01:49.560> spinning<00:01:50.010> out<00:01:50.720> 2800

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
I'm thinking it's only spinning out 2800

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.200 
I'm thinking it's only spinning out 2800

thousand<00:01:55.770> six<00:01:55.860> hundred<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.370> 600<00:01:56.670> like

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
thousand six hundred is like 600 like

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.170 
thousand six hundred is like 600 like
freaking<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:58.170> know<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.770> 800<00:01:59.430> rpm<00:01:59.820> something

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
freaking you know it's 800 rpm something

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.360 
freaking you know it's 800 rpm something
you<00:02:00.240> know<00:02:00.360> 700<00:02:00.930> rpm

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
you know 700 rpm

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.580 
you know 700 rpm
difference<00:02:01.640> there<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:03.050> got<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.290> digital

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
difference there so I got the digital

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.640 
difference there so I got the digital
taco<00:02:04.010> air<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:04.460> I<00:02:04.850> bumped<00:02:05.090> up<00:02:05.300> speed<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:06.020> 3000

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
taco air and I bumped up speed to 3000

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.440 
taco air and I bumped up speed to 3000
December<00:02:07.040> 3600<00:02:08.320> 3522<00:02:09.320> ish<00:02:09.790> now<00:02:10.790> as<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.270> found

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
December 3600 3522 ish now as I found

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.910 
December 3600 3522 ish now as I found
out<00:02:11.600> before<00:02:11.990> that<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.290> engine<00:02:12.590> was<00:02:12.680> only

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
out before that the engine was only

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.670 
out before that the engine was only
spinning<00:02:13.340> at<00:02:14.680> 2800<00:02:15.680> rpm<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:17.350> it's<00:02:18.350> supposedly

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
spinning at 2800 rpm and it's supposedly

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.360 
spinning at 2800 rpm and it's supposedly
apparently<00:02:19.520> meant<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.730> spin<00:02:19.940> at<00:02:20.200> 3600<00:02:21.370> so

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
apparently meant to spin at 3600 so

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.730 
apparently meant to spin at 3600 so
that's<00:02:22.550> about<00:02:22.790> sort<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.060> 800<00:02:23.600> ish<00:02:23.750> rpm<00:02:24.470> or<00:02:24.590> so

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
that's about sort of 800 ish rpm or so

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.680 
that's about sort of 800 ish rpm or so
difference<00:02:25.250> now<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:28.070> know<00:02:28.370> from<00:02:28.730> past

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
difference now that I know from past

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.840 
difference now that I know from past
almost<00:02:30.050> like<00:02:30.620> even<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:30.980> couple<00:02:31.280> hundred<00:02:31.400> rpm

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
almost like even a couple hundred rpm

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.340 
almost like even a couple hundred rpm
makes<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.210> makes<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.570> a<00:02:32.600> noticeable

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
makes it makes it a noticeable

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.380 
makes it makes it a noticeable
difference<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:34.040> about<00:02:34.280> 800<00:02:34.760> rpm<00:02:35.150> so<00:02:35.360> I

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
difference so it is about 800 rpm so I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.990 
difference so it is about 800 rpm so I
think<00:02:35.660> that's<00:02:36.650> going<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.800> make<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.000> significant

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
think that's going to make a significant

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.580 
think that's going to make a significant
difference<00:02:38.270> in<00:02:38.600> it<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:38.990> did<00:02:39.140> make<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.320> big

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
difference in it and it did make a big

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.100 
difference in it and it did make a big
difference<00:02:39.850> so<00:02:40.850> what<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.090> need<00:02:41.210> to<00:02:41.330> do<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.630> set

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
difference so what you need to do to set

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.060 
difference so what you need to do to set
this<00:02:42.260> is<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:42.530> need<00:02:42.770> yourself<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.570> these

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
this is you need yourself a these

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.640 
this is you need yourself a these
tamper-proof<00:02:46.070> bits<00:02:46.520> or<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.970> Torx<00:02:47.300> bits<00:02:47.650> and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
tamper-proof bits or the Torx bits and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.230 
tamper-proof bits or the Torx bits and
they<00:02:48.710> have<00:02:48.800> that<00:02:48.980> funny<00:02:49.220> star<00:02:49.520> shape<00:02:49.850> sort<00:02:50.150> of

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
they have that funny star shape sort of

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.780 
they have that funny star shape sort of
head<00:02:50.420> on<00:02:50.540> them<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:51.650> these<00:02:52.100> bits<00:02:52.370> there's<00:02:52.670> a

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
head on them and these bits there's a

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.690 
head on them and these bits there's a
adjustment<00:02:53.510> here<00:02:53.630> at<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.750> front<00:02:53.960> for<00:02:54.440> that

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
adjustment here at the front for that

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.070 
adjustment here at the front for that
then<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.790> need<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.090> get<00:02:56.300> yourself<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.630> 10<00:02:56.840> mil

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
then you need to get yourself a 10 mil

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:05.610 
then you need to get yourself a 10 mil
socket<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.210> know<00:02:59.360> do<00:02:59.510> this<00:02:59.630> is<00:03:00.200> party

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.710 

nice<00:03:06.620> nice<00:03:06.890> working<00:03:07.280> on<00:03:07.370> new<00:03:07.550> mowers<00:03:07.880> nice<00:03:08.480> and

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
nice nice working on new mowers nice and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.830 
nice nice working on new mowers nice and
clean<00:03:09.610> shouldn't<00:03:10.610> happen<00:03:10.760> my<00:03:11.030> gos<00:03:11.270> brain<00:03:11.540> unit

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
clean shouldn't happen my gos brain unit

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.199 
clean shouldn't happen my gos brain unit
but<00:03:11.959> anyway<00:03:12.910> she<00:03:13.910> taking<00:03:14.180> these<00:03:14.270> guys<00:03:14.450> off

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.640 

yeah<00:03:20.209> it's<00:03:20.330> a<00:03:20.390> little<00:03:20.570> I<00:03:20.720> guess<00:03:20.840> in<00:03:21.140> protection

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
yeah it's a little I guess in protection

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.900 
yeah it's a little I guess in protection
play<00:03:21.800> which<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.040> thought<00:03:22.190> was<00:03:22.310> pretty<00:03:22.400> cool<00:03:22.760> to

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
play which I thought was pretty cool to

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.390 
play which I thought was pretty cool to
keep<00:03:23.000> all<00:03:23.180> these<00:03:23.239> linkages<00:03:23.570> and<00:03:23.870> stuff<00:03:24.470> safe

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
keep all these linkages and stuff safe

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.310 
keep all these linkages and stuff safe
from<00:03:25.640> injury<00:03:26.239> when<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:26.600> crash<00:03:26.780> into<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.140> into

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
from injury when you crash into it into

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.780 
from injury when you crash into it into
a<00:03:27.350> tree<00:03:27.590> which<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.250> will<00:03:28.370> do<00:03:28.520> one<00:03:28.670> day<00:03:28.790> oh<00:03:29.410> and

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
a tree which you will do one day oh and

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.960 
a tree which you will do one day oh and
this<00:03:31.790> here<00:03:32.030> is<00:03:32.060> easier<00:03:32.450> governor<00:03:33.790> that's<00:03:34.790> the

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
this here is easier governor that's the

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.870 
this here is easier governor that's the
governor<00:03:35.330> spring<00:03:35.690> now<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:37.310> screw<00:03:37.700> or<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
governor spring now this screw or the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.250 
governor spring now this screw or the
frontier<00:03:38.270> wise<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.840> know<00:03:38.870> in<00:03:39.050> and<00:03:39.170> out

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
frontier wise you know in and out

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.449 
frontier wise you know in and out
forwards<00:03:39.620> or<00:03:39.680> backwards<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:40.070> this<00:03:40.130> is<00:03:40.280> what

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
forwards or backwards and this is what

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.760 
forwards or backwards and this is what
you<00:03:40.520> need<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.760> talks<00:03:41.110> talks<00:03:42.110> for<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:42.410> bit<00:03:42.560> for

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
you need the talks talks for a bit for

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.680 
you need the talks talks for a bit for
because<00:03:43.070> it's<00:03:43.250> they've<00:03:43.430> used<00:03:43.610> that<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:44.269> people

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
because it's they've used that so people

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.580 
because it's they've used that so people
kind<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:44.900> tamper<00:03:45.230> with<00:03:45.350> it<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:45.650> guess

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
kind of tamper with it I guess

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.729 
kind of tamper with it I guess
now<00:03:48.590> if<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:49.310> look<00:03:49.459> here<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:50.480> that<00:03:51.260> spring

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
now if you look here that that spring

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.820 
now if you look here that that spring
was<00:03:51.920> originally<00:03:52.280> in<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.370> top<00:03:52.610> hole<00:03:52.820> now<00:03:53.830> when

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
was originally in the top hole now when

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.440 
was originally in the top hole now when
I<00:03:54.860> have<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.280> had<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.580> tacho<00:03:55.910> hooked<00:03:56.120> up<00:03:56.300> in

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
I have the had the tacho hooked up in

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.150 
I have the had the tacho hooked up in
that<00:03:56.570> when<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:56.750> feel<00:03:57.110> when<00:03:57.260> I<00:03:57.320> unwound<00:03:57.890> this

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
that when I feel when I unwound this

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.140 
that when I feel when I unwound this
spring<00:03:58.570> I've<00:03:59.570> backed<00:03:59.870> it<00:04:00.050> off<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:01.820> engine

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
spring I've backed it off the engine

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.490 
spring I've backed it off the engine
picked<00:04:02.420> up<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:02.600> little<00:04:02.750> bit<00:04:02.870> of<00:04:02.959> rpm<00:04:03.290> but<00:04:03.440> it

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
picked up a little bit of rpm but it

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.830 
picked up a little bit of rpm but it
like<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.010> wouldn't<00:04:04.310> pick<00:04:04.430> up<00:04:04.550> enough<00:04:04.820> rpm<00:04:05.360> to<00:04:05.570> to

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
like a wouldn't pick up enough rpm to to

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.800 
like a wouldn't pick up enough rpm to to
get<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.220> 3,600<00:04:07.220> so<00:04:07.459> I<00:04:07.730> had<00:04:08.360> to<00:04:08.450> shut<00:04:08.570> it<00:04:08.690> back

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
get to 3,600 so I had to shut it back

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.380 
get to 3,600 so I had to shut it back
down<00:04:09.019> again<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:09.700> fiddle<00:04:10.700> with<00:04:10.790> this<00:04:10.910> to<00:04:11.209> take

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
down again and fiddle with this to take

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.640 
down again and fiddle with this to take
it<00:04:11.510> from<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.780> top<00:04:11.959> hole<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.350> put<00:04:12.470> on<00:04:12.560> the

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
it from the top hole and put on the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.440 
it from the top hole and put on the
front<00:04:12.799> hole<00:04:13.040> and<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.850> can<00:04:13.970> see<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.209> front

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
front hole and you can see the front

front hole and you can see the front
hole

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790

is<00:04:15.060> like<00:04:15.840> it's<00:04:16.019> out<00:04:16.139> of<00:04:16.259> alignment<00:04:16.500> by<00:04:16.859> I<00:04:17.130> know

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
is like it's out of alignment by I know

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.610 
is like it's out of alignment by I know
cut<00:04:17.759> the<00:04:17.789> mill<00:04:18.000> something<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.509> that<00:04:19.199> allow<00:04:19.440> me

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
cut the mill something and that allow me

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.529 
cut the mill something and that allow me
to<00:04:19.680> have<00:04:19.769> enough<00:04:20.009> adjustment<00:04:20.549> on<00:04:21.120> this<00:04:21.239> on

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
to have enough adjustment on this on

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.960 
to have enough adjustment on this on
this<00:04:21.840> screw<00:04:22.139> a<00:04:22.169> year<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:23.430> that's<00:04:23.580> all<00:04:23.820> you've

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
this screw a year and that's all you've

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.270 
this screw a year and that's all you've
got<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.120> do<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.479> adjust<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.169> top-end<00:04:25.380> rpm

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
got to do to adjust the the top-end rpm

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.980 
got to do to adjust the the top-end rpm
speed<00:04:26.789> and<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:27.210> makes<00:04:27.479> a<00:04:27.630> fantastic

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
speed and it makes a fantastic

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.219 
speed and it makes a fantastic
difference<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:29.070> mowing<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.430> grass<00:04:29.460> now

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
difference to mowing the grass now

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.409 
difference to mowing the grass now
unlike<00:04:31.229> people<00:04:32.190> often<00:04:32.550> say<00:04:32.759> that<00:04:32.789> the<00:04:33.060> speed

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
unlike people often say that the speed

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.260 
unlike people often say that the speed
at<00:04:33.660> you<00:04:33.750> know<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.930> ground<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:35.639> travel<00:04:36.000> speed

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
at you know the ground the travel speed

at you know the ground the travel speed
of<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.600> mower<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:37.050> very<00:04:37.259> slow<00:04:37.620> like<00:04:37.889> it's<00:04:38.340> a

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
of the mower is very slow like it's a

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.180 
of the mower is very slow like it's a
three<00:04:38.669> speed<00:04:38.970> now<00:04:39.780> I<00:04:40.020> found<00:04:40.289> before<00:04:40.440> like<00:04:41.039> for

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
three speed now I found before like for

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.370 
three speed now I found before like for
the<00:04:41.280> last<00:04:41.430> 18<00:04:41.789> months<00:04:41.820> of<00:04:42.030> habit<00:04:42.380> thinking

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
the last 18 months of habit thinking

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.330 
the last 18 months of habit thinking
that's<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.560> way<00:04:43.710> it's<00:04:43.860> meant<00:04:43.949> to<00:04:44.070> be<00:04:44.130> with

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
that's the way it's meant to be with

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.320 
that's the way it's meant to be with
adjusting<00:04:44.789> this<00:04:44.910> rpm<00:04:45.600> speed<00:04:46.669> on<00:04:47.780> third<00:04:48.780> speed

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
adjusting this rpm speed on third speed

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.749 
adjusting this rpm speed on third speed
it<00:04:51.330> wasn't<00:04:51.660> really<00:04:51.810> that<00:04:51.840> fast<00:04:52.199> like<00:04:52.889> and<00:04:53.610> like

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
it wasn't really that fast like and like

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.520 
it wasn't really that fast like and like
I'm<00:04:53.880> a<00:04:53.910> tall<00:04:54.150> person<00:04:54.360> I've<00:04:54.630> got<00:04:54.750> about<00:04:55.139> six

I'm a tall person I've got about six

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.580 
I'm a tall person I've got about six
three<00:04:55.800> I've<00:04:56.039> got<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.400> pretty<00:04:56.759> long<00:04:56.880> legs<00:04:57.590> but

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
three I've got a pretty long legs but

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.420 
three I've got a pretty long legs but
since<00:04:58.919> increasing<00:04:59.880> the<00:04:59.970> RPM<00:05:01.430> since

I<00:05:07.440> think<00:05:07.710> it's<00:05:07.889> supposed<00:05:08.130> to<00:05:08.310> be<00:05:08.550> maybe<00:05:09.360> you

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
I think it's supposed to be maybe you

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.510 
I think it's supposed to be maybe you
guys<00:05:09.720> can<00:05:09.930> just<00:05:10.020> confirm<00:05:10.680> that<00:05:10.710> for<00:05:11.160> me<00:05:11.250> I<00:05:11.310> mean

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
number three like the best way I could

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.540 
number three like the best way I could
describe<00:05:34.110> it<00:05:34.590> is<00:05:34.710> that<00:05:34.860> you're<00:05:35.039> doing<00:05:35.130> a<00:05:35.280> power

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
describe it is that you're doing a power

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.279 
describe it is that you're doing a power
walk<00:05:35.820> like<00:05:36.120> I'm<00:05:36.300> like<00:05:36.659> I<00:05:36.750> said<00:05:36.900> I've<00:05:36.990> got<00:05:37.110> a<00:05:37.139> big

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
walk like I'm like I said I've got a big

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.589 
walk like I'm like I said I've got a big
long<00:05:37.500> legs<00:05:37.680> it's<00:05:38.520> a<00:05:38.610> power<00:05:38.820> walk<00:05:39.090> for<00:05:39.300> me<00:05:39.389> so<00:05:39.539> if

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
long legs it's a power walk for me so if

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.680 
long legs it's a power walk for me so if
you're<00:05:39.750> if<00:05:40.050> you're<00:05:40.080> short<00:05:40.500> ass<00:05:40.909> yeah<00:05:41.909> you<00:05:42.539> need

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
you're if you're short ass yeah you need

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.420 
you're if you're short ass yeah you need
to<00:05:42.750> be<00:05:42.870> doing<00:05:43.020> a<00:05:43.050> slow<00:05:43.260> jog<00:05:43.500> I<00:05:43.770> reckon<00:05:44.280> it's

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
to be doing a slow jog I reckon it's

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.240 
to be doing a slow jog I reckon it's
pretty<00:05:44.699> like<00:05:45.060> it<00:05:45.210> it<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:46.010> thing<00:05:47.010> wise<00:05:47.159> you

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
pretty like it it and thing wise you

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.770 
pretty like it it and thing wise you
always<00:05:47.490> see<00:05:47.669> that<00:05:47.849> the<00:05:47.970> contractors<00:05:48.510> using

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780
