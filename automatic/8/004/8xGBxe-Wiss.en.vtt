00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.279
 hello everyone today we'll talk about not 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.090
 quite usual on the same from spider to spider 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.910
 to captain 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:28.329
 designer jason brides on the knife 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:31.490
 the small one has a 4-position clip 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.250
 opens softly and very comfortable in 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.760
 principle like all spider to blade 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.809
 really unusual shape of it 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.379
 modified have built 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.570
 as the designer Jason Bradon himself said 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.620
 he needed a knife that would solve it 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.559
 tasks on the river 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.409
 namely the knife which would be convenient 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.110
 cut the rope but he had 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:57.170
 would be a wide enough bubble tip for 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.760
 order to have a very controlled 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.400
 cut wear in hand sits very comfortable as 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.600
 close grip for controlled cutting 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.390
 as well as more distant enough for a general way 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.479
 say cutting but actually 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.539
 reverse grabbing already as not kerambit 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.119
 descending by themselves from the middle but when 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:27.259
 this cuts well liner comes on 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:32.649
 the middle of the notch under the finger pretty 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.649
 sharp and sirris finger 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.110
 spoons from g10 classic for spider to 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.869
 the knife is successful and it seems to me 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.159
 useful not only somewhere on the river but 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.369
 and in ordinary life 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.910
 let's look at it at the same time 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:56.330
 handsome and freak closer to the clinker 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:00.740
 nice satin and blade shape 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:04.509
 still very unusual thank you all 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.509
 it was Peter bye bye
