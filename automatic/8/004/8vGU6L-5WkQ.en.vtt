00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.340
 - In our Faculty of Medicine we train doctors and doctors with the necessary skills 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.700
 basic to exercise a profession as interesting and as complex as ours. Competencies 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.919
 not only in the field of knowledge acquisition, also in attitudes, in values, in commitments. 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.779
 The main concern of a doctor should be the care and benefit of the health of 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.239
 their patients, respect for their privacy, their dignity and always showing an attitude 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.430
 comprehensive and compassionate trying, as I said, the benefit of these patients. Of course 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.739
 always preserving the interests of the sick over the interests of the doctor. 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.079
 Not only do we forget, of course, to encourage ongoing training throughout 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.260
 life, it is not only necessary to acquire this knowledge, but to maintain it and renew it 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.409
 to be able to attend our patients with criteria of excellence. 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.060
 - I think that one important thing is the possibility of developing the capabilities 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.920
 personal skills that each one has through a solid formation in what are the principles 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.500
 biological, social and community medicine. In addition to an enthusiasm that I 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.710
 I think we try to convey the teachers who, in general, are very vocational people 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.710
 and we love doing what we do. 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.880
 - Tutoring is an important part of the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.210
 learning of medicine at the Miguel Hernández University of Elche, allow the student 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.030
 to interact with the teacher live, as we are doing now, that we have 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.030
 the opportunity to explain the doubts that arise throughout the theoretical study 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.200
 of the teaching sessions that we have in class and allow us to bring them 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.720
 many more experiences 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.020
 - The faculty of the Faculty of Medicine 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.700
 from the Miguel Hernández University, is a highly qualified faculty. 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.390
 - The facilities of the UMH are very complete, especially in Anatomy. We have microscopes 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.280
 Surgical and simulation rooms. - In the simulation room it is a question of 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.280
 place where we can do surgical practices as if it were real life. 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.690
 - And in these rooms we have the latest technology in medical simulation. 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.700
 - That they help us to understand the aspects that we give in the theory. 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.989
 - And we can learn them better and translate them into practice. 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.029
 - In short, we have very good facilities. 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.980
 - I think the most rewarding thing about studying 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.260
 Medicine is knowing partners with whom you can create links to play your professional future. 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.420
 - What I like most about studying medicine is 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.180
 the camaraderie that we have among us and the good atmosphere that there is always. 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.760
 - I am the delegate of Medicine degree and from the Delegation of Medical Students 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.260
 we try to work to be a medium between the professors and deanship and the students of Medicine. 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.160
 - The national congress of medical students 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.790
 It is a congress with a lot of tradition that we have been celebrating for the last 32 years. 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.599
 - It is not only made for students of our Faculty, but for those of the rest 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.819
 from Spain, Europe and Latin America, where medical personalities from all over the world come. 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.260
 - We try to do socio-cultural activities, 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.680
 bioethics, etc. so that studying medicine is not only studying in the Faculty, the basic ones, 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.100
 the clinics and then in the hospital, but there is also a background of what it is to be a doctor. 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.180
 - As coordinator of hospital practices 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.840
 I assure that the students have an immersion in the clinical activity of the hospitals 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.780
 where they will develop their profession in the future. 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.280
 - Medicine is a really incredible career, 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.380
 so much encouragement to all who are struggling to enter because it is really worth it. 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.260
 - Studying medicine is one of the things 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.590
 more exciting than there is, one of the things that also serves not only to form one 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:22.330
 same, but also to put yourself in the place of another. Medicine has that social aspect that allows 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.500
 that you go knowing yourself, knowing the other, approaching the patients, approaching you 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.729
 to the problems of the people. Of course, it's one of the most grateful careers 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:37.130
 There is that social aspect, that important human part that you have. It is a learning 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.510
 that also has to be done together, it's a walk together of teachers and students, 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.000
 exchange, sponsor the other's word. It's not about competition, it's about going 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.850
 exchanging knowledge and learning together. It is a path that begins 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:06:00.060
 and that of course he will be grateful for the rest of his life.
