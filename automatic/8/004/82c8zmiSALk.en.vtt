we'll evaluate the performance of the
system<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.700> get<00:01:55.850> feedback<00:01:56.060> directly<00:01:56.510> from

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
system and get feedback directly from

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.200 
system and get feedback directly from
the<00:01:57.020> 911<00:01:57.350> operators<00:01:57.920> we<00:01:58.280> incorporated<00:01:58.850> their

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
the 911 operators we incorporated their

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.870 
the 911 operators we incorporated their
feedback<00:01:59.480> into<00:01:59.870> our<00:02:00.110> design<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.800> then<00:02:01.520> it

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
feedback into our design and then it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.280 
feedback into our design and then it
helped<00:02:02.210> in<00:02:02.420> making<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.870> more<00:02:03.050> successful
