00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.180
 states and this is minecraft we are at 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.800
 Friday day that means those tricks 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.570
 them some trick that more than a trick 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.400
 it's a command but it's a very command 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.169
 cheto vale I find it incredible that 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.150
 someone has been able to do this is 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.770
 incredible is worth the information this video 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.330
 I'm going to leave the command that is too long 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.660
 ok you can not write I'll leave it on 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.760
 a link and incredible but incredible 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.070
 true if things one go to him okay let's go 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.600
 to learn without using any type of mod 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.940
 generating villages and do it themselves 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.920
 order for a town to appear with 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.530
 villagers table of enchantments with 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.230
 new town by a different side worth 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.030
 something that contrasts with others good 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.339
 we go here here we have our 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.559
 command block and the command is this 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.569
 It's worth it, it 's eternally long, I'm worth 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.609
 I put you here to turn pages and 

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:52.229
 we could be when it is brutally 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.550
 long is worth as to join 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.129
 explain all this this would be crazy 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.769
 to explain it worth it is amazing is a 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.969
 I do not know what part of the world has made it 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.069
 the created one has created worth because I have 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.559
 seen many different paths and could not 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:06.390
 really find the creator worth but 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.970
 yes I tell you that the creator since 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.909
 point of view you are a machine a beast 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.940
 an amazing amazing guy really 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.580
 amazing I have no more synonyms 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.110
 to tell you what I think you get to be 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.090
 to make this piece of command because 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.470
 it has to be a pain in the neck talking 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.960
 ballet and she's a woman of boredom 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.890
 to do it is worth as you see is super 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.900
 long good we give you here there already what 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.950
 load as you see loads a command that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.640
 laugh in agreement 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.009
 and nothing we take a button and eye to the data 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.560
 that we now take and do here and 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.170
 all this appears because if it starts here 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.460
 to generate this because you feel like it is worth 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.009
 I can not do anything this follows 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.780
 being generated put to 15 seconds appears 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.000
 glass to present things because if of 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.170
 agreements to these tags recording are we 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.940
 bit with him and that in no time 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.330
 five seconds and tick tac tick 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.020
 what will happen I am saying with the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.210
 snow this is the town guys 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.000
 this ball is the town and I dance this 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.690
 It was going to look like a town because if it's worth 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.690
 water is still pa 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.650
 how do you stay then that the town of 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.480
 villagers because villagers out if it 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.120
 because if I stay water flip what 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.310
 seen you come in and wang torches are 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.290
 settlers who are new settlements worth 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.390
 hello how nice how wonderful 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.900
 tell you that these version 1.8 is worth 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.760
 well the chests to see if we see any 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.890
 bad in laciana the green ones are different 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.280
 these come with enchantments visits 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.290
 OK 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.160
 and then the stone ones I do not know with what 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.050
 come let's go now a point 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.459
 but the greens bring table 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.580
 spells that is very or 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.740
 prevail the houses as you see very cool 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.810
 It's worth combining here I 'll be a 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.000
 block of gold because like that when you appreciate there 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.870
 one that traces gold block 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.849
 there it is because good 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.849
 you can put all you want and I 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.799
 I throw here again and wing is generated 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.060
 over the drop threw here and we're going to 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.510
 start generating your own village 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.370
 on top of another village I turn 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.370
 crazy and maybe I'm left with the minecraft 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.930
 if you look at the villagers they have stayed 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.930
 They do not move because nothing happens 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.900
 it seems they were all full or if 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.900
 They must have been 2 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.950
 anything weirder to see I want to 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.880
 to receive more balls of these and it's very 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.880
 fun this is worth 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.710
 each filled which will pass more good 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.300
 as you can see, this is the command generating 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.560
 very good outputs I wanted to try this 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.750
 because of course here with the tails 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.270
 these have become he has already had 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.800
 we do not work it must be that they work 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.290
 a few and then the others that 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.780
 It has send you can do and immense 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.640
 things it's worth it's very opposite it's worth but very 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.700
 opera, I found it super fun as 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.550
 You can see it is a huge city 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.930
 ok and then play in it and the world 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.210
 could page that you can do a lot of 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.560
 things agree guys and this is another 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.720
 kilo that I have today the truth that is 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.920
 interesting is curious is more than a 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.700
 group is a command but you know that 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.190
 There is a trick to command blocks etc etc 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.900
 etc books errors curiosities and everything is 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.400
 called a trick I put it inside the group 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.800
 of tricks worth does not mean that this 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.780
 be a trick of agreement and nothing you like
