00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
through create holes and actually use

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.300 
through create holes and actually use
them<00:03:21.700> as<00:03:21.910> sight<00:03:22.180> lines<00:03:22.480> so<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.740> destruction

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
them as sight lines so the destruction

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.830 
them as sight lines so the destruction
capabilities<00:03:24.820> are<00:03:24.940> still<00:03:25.120> pretty<00:03:25.270> impressive

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
capabilities are still pretty impressive

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.410 
capabilities are still pretty impressive

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
in comparison to the other maps but

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.100 
in comparison to the other maps but
that's<00:03:28.990> just<00:03:29.110> my<00:03:29.320> take<00:03:29.560> on<00:03:29.770> it<00:03:30.930> although<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:31.959> do

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
that's just my take on it although I do

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.630 
that's just my take on it although I do
have<00:03:32.350> an<00:03:32.500> opinion<00:03:32.680> on<00:03:32.860> this<00:03:32.950> bed<00:03:33.250> like<00:03:33.490> when

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
have an opinion on this bed like when

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.830 
have an opinion on this bed like when
you<00:03:33.700> shoot<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.000> corners<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:34.510> stuff<00:03:34.660> they

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
you shoot the corners and stuff they

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.210 
you shoot the corners and stuff they
sort<00:03:35.020> of<00:03:35.080> did<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:35.200> yeah<00:03:35.830> like<00:03:36.130> what<00:03:37.020> what

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
sort of did it yeah like what what

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.870 
sort of did it yeah like what what
mattress<00:03:39.220> doesn't<00:03:39.550> just<00:03:39.700> break

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.940 

vo<00:03:43.710> aiming<00:03:44.710> is<00:03:44.800> terrible<00:03:45.400> yeah<00:03:46.740> but<00:03:47.740> the<00:03:47.830> best

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950
