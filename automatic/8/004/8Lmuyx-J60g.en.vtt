00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
failure success success success so this

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.490

the<00:05:45.360> wrong<00:05:45.419> password<00:05:45.810> in<00:05:46.320> so<00:05:46.560> you'll<00:05:46.710> need<00:05:46.830> to

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
the wrong password in so you'll need to

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.180 
the wrong password in so you'll need to
double<00:05:47.220> check<00:05:47.250> that<00:05:48.050> other<00:05:49.050> times<00:05:49.860> there's

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
double check that other times there's

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.909 
double check that other times there's
other<00:05:50.780> errors<00:05:51.780> and<00:05:51.960> it<00:05:52.050> again<00:05:52.320> it<00:05:52.470> tells<00:05:52.680> you

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
other errors and it again it tells you

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.310 
other errors and it again it tells you
there<00:05:53.220> so<00:05:53.910> you<00:05:53.970> can<00:05:54.150> go<00:05:54.300> through<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:55.169> this

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
there so you can go through and this

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.380 
there so you can go through and this
helps<00:05:55.650> when<00:05:55.770> you're<00:05:55.890> counting<00:05:56.430> up<00:05:56.640> your

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
helps when you're counting up your

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.980 
helps when you're counting up your
counters<00:05:58.020> to<00:05:58.800> put<00:05:58.980> it<00:05:59.100> into<00:05:59.280> the<00:05:59.400> spreadsheet

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
counters to put it into the spreadsheet

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.909 
counters to put it into the spreadsheet
so<00:06:00.990> if<00:06:01.080> I<00:06:01.140> was<00:06:01.260> doing<00:06:01.350> it<00:06:01.500> for<00:06:01.560> this<00:06:01.710> one<00:06:01.860> I

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
so if I was doing it for this one I

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:09.710 
so if I was doing it for this one I
count<00:06:02.220> 1<00:06:02.460> 2<00:06:02.669> 3<00:06:03.090> 4<00:06:03.360> 5<00:06:04.020> 6<00:06:04.260> 7<00:06:04.590> 8<00:06:04.770> 9<00:06:04.950> 10<00:06:07.310> 11<00:06:08.310> 12<00:06:08.700> 13<00:06:09.120> 14
