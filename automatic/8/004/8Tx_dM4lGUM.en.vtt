00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
long before this corn sheller was built

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.330 
long before this corn sheller was built
corn<00:00:41.690> was<00:00:41.810> shelled<00:00:42.050> by<00:00:42.110> hand<00:00:42.470> is<00:00:43.040> very

corn was shelled by hand is very

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.270 
corn was shelled by hand is very
labor-intensive<00:00:44.020> so<00:00:45.020> when<00:00:45.470> a<00:00:45.800> mechanized

labor-intensive so when a mechanized
device<00:00:46.580> such<00:00:46.880> as<00:00:47.030> this<00:00:47.270> was<00:00:47.900> invented<00:00:48.050> and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
device such as this was invented and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.810 
device such as this was invented and
saved<00:00:49.160> a<00:00:49.280> lot<00:00:49.550> of<00:00:49.700> man-hours<00:00:51.520> I'd<00:00:52.520> like<00:00:52.700> to

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
saved a lot of man-hours I'd like to

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.030 
saved a lot of man-hours I'd like to
show<00:00:53.000> you<00:00:53.030> how<00:00:53.270> it<00:00:53.420> works<00:00:53.630> it's<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.710> little<00:00:54.950> bit

let me point out something to look for
out<00:01:00.050> of<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.260> bottom<00:01:00.590> here<00:01:00.829> will<00:01:01.430> come<00:01:01.579> the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
out of the bottom here will come the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.660 
out of the bottom here will come the
corn<00:01:02.030> kernels<00:01:02.420> into<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.690> bucket<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:04.100> ears<00:01:04.460> of

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
corn kernels into a bucket the ears of

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.550 
corn kernels into a bucket the ears of
corn<00:01:04.909> that<00:01:05.180> are<00:01:05.299> plain<00:01:05.570> with<00:01:05.900> no<00:01:06.020> kernels<00:01:06.439> on

corn that are plain with no kernels on
them<00:01:06.680> will<00:01:07.100> come<00:01:07.280> shooting<00:01:07.909> out<00:01:08.090> here<00:01:08.390> and

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
them will come shooting out here and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.450 
them will come shooting out here and
I'll<00:01:09.320> be<00:01:09.439> feeding<00:01:09.770> corn<00:01:10.540> into<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.780> over<00:01:12.049> here

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
I'll be feeding corn into the over here

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.819 
I'll be feeding corn into the over here
so<00:01:13.460> let's<00:01:13.850> give<00:01:13.969> it<00:01:14.030> a<00:01:14.119> try<00:01:14.469> here's<00:01:15.469> the<00:01:15.590> corn

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
so let's give it a try here's the corn

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.039 
so let's give it a try here's the corn
we're<00:01:16.009> going<00:01:16.189> to<00:01:16.280> use<00:01:16.460> it<00:01:17.450> was<00:01:17.600> raised<00:01:17.840> for

we're going to use it was raised for
cattle<00:01:18.350> feed<00:01:18.380> it's<00:01:19.219> hard<00:01:19.850> dried<00:01:20.569> and<00:01:21.579> let's

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
cattle feed it's hard dried and let's

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:57.570 
cattle feed it's hard dried and let's
give<00:01:22.729> it<00:01:22.759> a<00:01:22.819> try<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.179> the<00:01:23.270> crunch
