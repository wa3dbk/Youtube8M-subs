00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.379 

okay<00:04:35.169> once<00:04:35.379> you're<00:04:35.560> signed<00:04:35.770> in<00:04:36.360> what<00:04:37.360> I

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
okay once you're signed in what I

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.770 
okay once you're signed in what I
usually<00:04:37.569> do<00:04:37.930> I<00:04:37.960> typically<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.830> wait<00:04:39.069> like<00:04:39.310> five

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
usually do I typically I wait like five

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.719 
usually do I typically I wait like five
to<00:04:40.780> seven<00:04:41.110> seconds<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.949> the<00:04:42.280> reason<00:04:42.550> why<00:04:42.669> is

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
to seven seconds and the reason why is

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.339 
to seven seconds and the reason why is
because<00:04:42.969> if<00:04:43.629> you<00:04:43.750> click<00:04:43.960> it<00:04:44.110> right<00:04:44.139> away
