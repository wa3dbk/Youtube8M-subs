 sure if you are a camera 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.700
 works because the sound one with the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.200
 at that time there were problems 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.910
 well no matter more complicated behaves 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.590

 I should be able to do that in January 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.699
 Camera too pure because the no car focus 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.780

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.780

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.210

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.120

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.110

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.820

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.330
 Sixth one still sees the note 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.519
 me what is that here on the 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.850
 hall plan not noted on the 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.850

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:20.580
 program boring then we have from 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.020
 band that one can yes 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.470
 I would probably be apart 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.470
 namely on 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.470
 want a bag again that is 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.710
 annoying and it has to one side 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:42.160
 alliance or other page 1904 eg 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:45.920
 Alliance amount and no it is very 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.830
 good the alliance variant in blue 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:54.340
 then we have even more cramp I say 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.340
 times advertising advertising 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:04.790

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:13.930
 advertising advertising advertising travel 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:17.780
 then we have a great one 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.319
 cruise you can make out of here 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.019
 sometimes 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.760
 and yes, I'm not sure if you can do it 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.920
 can do anything is likely 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.609
 Do something with it takes you say plays 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.829
 the little toy is wonderful 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.630
 then they should throw back 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.070
 then we just have 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.110
 You see that I am abyss 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.610
 if I drop you then it will be missing 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.370
 to be there I am relatively sure 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.160
 that falls down with the family behind 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:52.120
 which is totally great but well so nice 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.120
 I somehow here with the 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.230
 yes, yes 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.890
 at not even caught I want 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:05.100
 do not overuse my luck 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:08.190
 so let's just say it's one of 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.170
 strong production what any part of 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.170
 starcraft ii we can download the iphone video 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.100
 and then I have ministers here and 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.880
 no fun two things 1 I have 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.130
 the wrong concept 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.130
 but another guy at the moment 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:41.560

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:44.009

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:51.520
 unfortunately not in it anymore 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.520
 so well prepared for it 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.850
 the real trailer still location advantage 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.430
 pendant 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.639

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:10.930
