00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.049
 two 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.100
 hello very good to all the confetti and 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.680
 tutorial we will learn how to install and 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.600
 configure our ps3 command to 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.480
 play emulators and in every 74 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.830
 to begin with we will have to install 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.950
 mail controller 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.740
 will be in the description link os 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.740
 you download it and then you extract the folder 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.070
 that in bankruptcy once extracted the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.260
 you can open and find the serious and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.730
 the program 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.770
 we will execute the program 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.980
 then we have to double click on the 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.980
 pack 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.840
 now it is very important that we 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.930
 we disconnect from the internet because if not 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.180
 will not let us check in and check 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.350
 that our registration number is already 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.550
 registered and will detect us as if not 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.830
 outside original 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.750
 something that does not interest us since that's not the case 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.229
 will let us use some commands 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.909
 to be able to configure the ps3 command in 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.190
 this case does not see it because I already have it 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.960
 installed but you would have to continue 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.619
 with the installation and once two batteries 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.820
 register you register is with the name 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.070
 of user this you will find also 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.240
 here in the link folder of the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.100
 description and with this serial 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.350
 once done this will ask you to 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.170
 reboot the computer the re initials 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.240
 and once rebooted and you will find the 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.030
 program to be able to execute it 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.630
 JCE as it executes and I have here 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.630
 the name and password 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.020
 then once opened we will appear 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.060
 this nor this to be able to find us 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.520
 well these here are the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.760
 configurations to be able to play 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.400
 games like call of duty 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.830
 4 call of duty modern warfare 3 black 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.140
 ops or modern warfare 2 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.820
 and then what we have to do will be 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.160
 import them for that we will give import 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.950
 and also that in the link of the 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.190
 description you will also find this 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.530
 file that I have on the desktop 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.810
 that you will also have to download what 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.380
 you will open and these two will appear to you 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.080
 records 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.930
 the first will have to drag it here 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.880
 and I already have it done and then in virtual 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.090
 controller you will have to drag this 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.459
 from below 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.960
 Once this is done, you can close it 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.970
 do not keep 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.530
 and as you can see here are all the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.420
 configurations of the different 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.120
 buttons that assign a button on the remote 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.060
 from playstation 3 to a keyboard button 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.310
 which is used for the game 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.040
 well once this is done we will have to 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.640
 connect our ps3 command to 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.640
 computer 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.450
 in my case I have the latest version of 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.190
 mac os x lion for which thing has not 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.810
 no driver needed to be installed but 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.090
 if you have a slightly old version 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.350
 you will have to install this driver that 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.760
 you will find in the link of the 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:18.580
 description once the driver is installed 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.310
 you will have to connect the cable control 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.630
 if you have bluetooth then you can 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.630
 disconnect the command and it will leave you the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.400
 jacko command already set to power 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.650
 play by bluetooth but if you do not have it 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.600
 you can continue using it with cable 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.060
 good to activate the bluetooth and if that 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.040
 you have bluetooth connect 'aces' of 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.750
 command and once the command is connected 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.780
 a usb with which the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.960
 playstation3 click you will do the ps button 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.960
 from the middle of the command 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.020
 wait is a little bit then 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.080
 disconnect is the command by the usb if 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.060
 you have bluetooth but leaving connected 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.210
 and you see that your 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.490
 bluetooth symbol towards three 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.320
 points this means that you have not 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.900
 detected and you have connected the command 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.520
 playstation 3 but in case you want it 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.860
 try you can open the program that 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.870
 we had previously opened and you will see 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.360
 that if we press the buttons as we see 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.620
 the crossheads will change the buttons 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.989
 This means that it is not 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.840
 identifying the buttons of our 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.020
 I send 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.860
 once done this check 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.860
 we minimize this program 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.850
 Well now we can test if it works 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.850
 our call of duty 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.490
 in this case but it's worth 24 faces 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.490
 modern warfare 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:59.720
 good can you move the cursor with the ipad 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.550
 right of your command but do not tell 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.240
 I recommend since to click 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.370
 you will need the mouse and it is not very 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.710
 advisable to use it since the 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.830
 precision is not very good in the 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.979
 interface of the game then playing and so 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.690
 that is going well I will enter this game 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.349
 that I have here created that I created with 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.349
 my other computer 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.260
 wait for the game to load and good 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.530
 basically you will have to do some 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.050
 small changes in the controls since 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.150
 the version that we have of male control 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.100
 it is not the last and with which thing 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.600
 lets us configure some options of 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.690
 mouse 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.910
 then you will have to go to control and 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.240
 combat and what we have to do is 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.700
 attack you will see that there is only the led mouse 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.790
 or the left mouse and you will have to 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.490
 add the jota and on your girl i'm down or 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.110
 be the button we use to aim 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.449
 you will have to add the p 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.490
 well once this is done 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.650
 with the team 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.750
 and well you can check that the 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.430
 buttons are saturated as is in the 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.740
 playstation the only difference here 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.289
 you will find is that with the l1 to 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.099
 point looks as pointed stays 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.960
 in the call of duty games for pc 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:28.380
 good at least in the heat and 4 does not 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.169
 there is the option for us to just point 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.139
 when we are aiming tightening the 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:36.389
 button that would be the only difference that 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.220
 you can find when playing 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:40.110
 this game on the other keys are 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.139
 perfectly configured by the gloss 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:47.539
 you can aim shoot shoot your 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:50.599
 grenades jump knead recharge 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:53.729
 change weapon all the buttons 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:55.650
 will be exactly configured as in 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.979
 the playstation as well as running 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.840
 to stab and the other good things 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:03.630
 this has been all for today I hope that you 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.580
 have helped give light favorites and 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.210
 subscribe for more video tutorials 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.210
 goodbye
