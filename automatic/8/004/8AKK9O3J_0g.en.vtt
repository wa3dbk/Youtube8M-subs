00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
been too timid right we've been too

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.759 
been too timid right we've been too
afraid<00:03:34.919> to<00:03:35.310> say<00:03:35.549> no<00:03:35.790> no<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.810> isn't<00:03:37.139> that<00:03:37.199> the

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
afraid to say no no it isn't that the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.619 
afraid to say no no it isn't that the
solution<00:03:38.159> isn't<00:03:38.310> another<00:03:38.729> group<00:03:39.090> the

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.210 
solution isn't another group the
solution<00:03:40.079> is<00:03:40.169> actually<00:03:40.530> blowing<00:03:40.829> up<00:03:41.099> the

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
solution is actually blowing up the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.710 
solution is actually blowing up the
architecture<00:03:41.819> completely<00:03:42.389> right<00:03:42.599> and

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
architecture completely right and

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.390 
architecture completely right and
figuring<00:03:43.319> out<00:03:43.470> how<00:03:43.620> make<00:03:43.799> continuous

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
solution you bet and and it's not

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
times in the 20th century that companies

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.479 
times in the 20th century that companies
actually<00:03:57.449> invented<00:03:58.019> this<00:03:58.169> forgot<00:03:59.009> how<00:03:59.189> to<00:03:59.250> do

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
actually invented this forgot how to do

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.610 
actually invented this forgot how to do
it<00:03:59.609> because<00:03:59.759> it<00:04:00.030> wasn't<00:04:00.299> essential<00:04:00.810> but<00:04:01.439> now

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
it because it wasn't essential but now

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.289 
it because it wasn't essential but now
it<00:04:01.769> is<00:04:01.799> so<00:04:02.189> for<00:04:02.459> example<00:04:02.489> in<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:02.939> seventies

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
it is so for example in the seventies

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.270 
it is so for example in the seventies
and<00:04:03.329> eighties<00:04:03.540> HP<00:04:04.379> created<00:04:04.799> something<00:04:05.009> like

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
and eighties HP created something like

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.280 
and eighties HP created something like
forty<00:04:05.609> five<00:04:05.759> divisions<00:04:06.060> one<00:04:06.509> guy<00:04:06.689> Chuck<00:04:07.079> house

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
forty five divisions one guy Chuck house

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.259 
forty five divisions one guy Chuck house
was<00:04:07.799> responsible<00:04:08.430> for<00:04:08.579> most<00:04:08.819> of<00:04:09.030> them<00:04:09.180> and

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
was responsible for most of them and

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.589 
was responsible for most of them and
they<00:04:09.659> lost<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.079> formula<00:04:10.500> IBM<00:04:11.280> when<00:04:12.150> they<00:04:12.269> came

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
they lost the formula IBM when they came

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.659 
they lost the formula IBM when they came
out<00:04:12.659> of<00:04:12.810> their<00:04:12.959> crisis<00:04:13.439> actually<00:04:14.220> figured<00:04:14.519> out

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
out of their crisis actually figured out

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:15.949 
out of their crisis actually figured out
how<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:14.879> make<00:04:15.060> innovation<00:04:15.569> part<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.840> their

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
how to make innovation part of their

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.740 
how to make innovation part of their
corporate<00:04:16.289> DNA<00:04:17.060> Apple<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.180> Amazon<00:04:18.269> have

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
corporate DNA Apple and Amazon have

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.930 
corporate DNA Apple and Amazon have
figured<00:04:19.049> out<00:04:19.139> how<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.380> do<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.590> as<00:04:19.769> well<00:04:19.949> and

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
figured out how to do it as well and

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.870 
figured out how to do it as well and
usually<00:04:21.599> those<00:04:21.779> work<00:04:22.019> if<00:04:22.880> organizations

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
usually those work if organizations

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.960 
usually those work if organizations
created<00:04:24.090> an<00:04:24.450> extreme<00:04:24.840> crisis<00:04:25.349> or<00:04:25.529> or<00:04:25.770> the

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
created an extreme crisis or or the

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.640 
created an extreme crisis or or the
because<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.240> an<00:04:27.330> extreme<00:04:27.660> individual<00:04:28.260> right

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
because of an extreme individual right

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.470 
because of an extreme individual right
but<00:04:28.860> we<00:04:28.950> really<00:04:29.340> need<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.580> know<00:04:29.850> how<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.060> do<00:04:30.300> is

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
but we really need to know how to do is

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.690 
but we really need to know how to do is
take<00:04:30.690> those<00:04:30.870> best<00:04:31.170> practices<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:31.890> make<00:04:32.490> those

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
take those best practices and make those

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.030 
take those best practices and make those
just<00:04:33.240> kind<00:04:33.270> of<00:04:33.450> a<00:04:33.570> common<00:04:34.110> corporate<00:04:34.530> type<00:04:34.740> and

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
just kind of a common corporate type and

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.880 
just kind of a common corporate type and
in<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.790> next<00:04:36.060> year<00:04:36.240> or<00:04:36.270> so<00:04:36.390> i<00:04:36.570> think<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:37.740> work

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
in the next year or so i think the work

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.950 
in the next year or so i think the work
i'm<00:04:38.040> going<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.280> do<00:04:38.340> with<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.850> henry<00:04:39.540> chesbro

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
i'm going to do with the henry chesbro

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.420 
i'm going to do with the henry chesbro

we've<00:04:47.400> been<00:04:47.550> thinking<00:04:47.940> about<00:04:48.060> what<00:04:48.450> is<00:04:48.630> a

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
we've been thinking about what is a

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.870 
we've been thinking about what is a
canonical<00:04:49.590> model<00:04:49.920> for<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.340> 21st<00:04:50.820> century

think<00:05:18.210> this<00:05:18.390> is<00:05:19.040> the<00:05:20.040> antithesis<00:05:20.400> of<00:05:20.790> I<00:05:21.480> need

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
think this is the antithesis of I need

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.110 
think this is the antithesis of I need
to<00:05:22.560> make<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.830> numbers<00:05:22.980> because<00:05:23.580> it<00:05:23.730> requires

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
to make the numbers because it requires

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.730 
to make the numbers because it requires
you<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.419> ask<00:05:24.510> well<00:05:24.840> what<00:05:25.020> numbers<00:05:25.350> do<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:25.560> need

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
you to ask well what numbers do you need

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.480 
you to ask well what numbers do you need
to<00:05:25.830> make<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:27.570> I<00:05:27.750> think<00:05:28.050> this<00:05:28.919> is<00:05:28.980> going<00:05:29.250> to<00:05:29.340> be

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
to make and I think this is going to be

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.670 
to make and I think this is going to be
a<00:05:29.730> little<00:05:30.030> wrenching<00:05:30.660> for<00:05:30.900> both<00:05:31.110> not<00:05:31.410> only

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
a little wrenching for both not only

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.560 
a little wrenching for both not only
companies<00:05:32.100> but<00:05:32.460> Wall<00:05:32.640> Street<00:05:32.910> as<00:05:33.060> well<00:05:33.240> I

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
companies but Wall Street as well I

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.600 
companies but Wall Street as well I
think<00:05:33.990> we're<00:05:34.260> going<00:05:34.350> to<00:05:34.440> end<00:05:34.560> up<00:05:34.650> and<00:05:35.340> let<00:05:35.520> me

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
think we're going to end up and let me

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.520 
think we're going to end up and let me
vaguely<00:05:36.120> not<00:05:36.480> answer<00:05:36.840> your<00:05:36.990> question<00:05:37.410> by

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
vaguely not answer your question by

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.500 
vaguely not answer your question by
telling<00:05:37.950> you<00:05:38.040> a<00:05:38.100> consequence<00:05:38.700> we're<00:05:39.330> going<00:05:39.419> to

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
telling you a consequence we're going to

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.270 
telling you a consequence we're going to
have<00:05:39.600> two<00:05:39.780> types<00:05:40.050> of<00:05:40.230> companies<00:05:40.560> we're<00:05:41.190> going

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
have two types of companies we're going

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.400 
have two types of companies we're going
to<00:05:41.370> have<00:05:41.460> companies<00:05:41.820> that<00:05:41.850> continue<00:05:42.410> the

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
to have companies that continue the

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.890 
to have companies that continue the
existing<00:05:43.890> way<00:05:44.040> and<00:05:44.340> my<00:05:44.820> prediction<00:05:45.390> is<00:05:45.540> their

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
existing way and my prediction is their

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.110 
existing way and my prediction is their
trajectories<00:05:46.590> on<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.860> street<00:05:47.160> will<00:05:47.700> be<00:05:47.729> five

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
trajectories on the street will be five

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.210 
trajectories on the street will be five
to<00:05:48.330> ten<00:05:48.540> years<00:05:48.570> of<00:05:48.930> great<00:05:49.140> profit<00:05:49.620> and<00:05:49.770> then

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
to ten years of great profit and then

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.890 
to ten years of great profit and then
going<00:05:50.610> out<00:05:50.700> of<00:05:50.760> business<00:05:51.000> sale<00:05:51.150> as<00:05:51.690> they

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
going out of business sale as they

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.290 
going out of business sale as they
decline<00:05:52.340> or<00:05:53.340> we're<00:05:53.640> going<00:05:53.729> to<00:05:53.790> have<00:05:53.910> companies

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
decline or we're going to have companies

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.159 
decline or we're going to have companies
that<00:05:54.330> continually<00:05:55.290> reinvest<00:05:55.890> in<00:05:56.130> innovation

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
that continually reinvest in innovation

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.170 
that continually reinvest in innovation
continually<00:05:58.169> with<00:05:58.770> probably<00:05:59.370> lower<00:05:59.669> profits

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
continually with probably lower profits

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.150 
continually with probably lower profits
more<00:06:00.360> like<00:06:00.540> an<00:06:00.660> Amazon<00:06:00.960> model<00:06:01.470> but<00:06:01.890> are<00:06:02.010> going

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
more like an Amazon model but are going

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.370 
more like an Amazon model but are going
to<00:06:02.220> be<00:06:02.310> around<00:06:02.400> for<00:06:02.700> decades<00:06:03.060> and<00:06:03.600> in<00:06:04.050> fact<00:06:04.229> on

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
to be around for decades and in fact on

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.360 
to be around for decades and in fact on
the<00:06:04.470> street<00:06:04.710> you're<00:06:04.860> going<00:06:05.010> to<00:06:05.070> be<00:06:05.130> able<00:06:05.160> to

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
the street you're going to be able to

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.860 
the street you're going to be able to
pick<00:06:05.520> which<00:06:05.850> one<00:06:06.090> you<00:06:06.210> want<00:06:06.240> to<00:06:06.450> invest<00:06:06.720> in

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
pick which one you want to invest in

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.300 
pick which one you want to invest in
because<00:06:07.260> you're<00:06:07.680> going<00:06:07.800> to<00:06:07.860> be<00:06:07.950> able<00:06:07.979> to<00:06:08.160> see

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
because you're going to be able to see

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.860 
because you're going to be able to see
the<00:06:08.460> difference<00:06:08.790> in<00:06:08.940> those<00:06:09.030> models<00:06:09.479> when

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
the difference in those models when

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.230 
the difference in those models when
short-term<00:06:10.770> profits<00:06:11.220> you<00:06:11.580> know<00:06:11.700> invest<00:06:12.090> in

short-term profits you know invest in

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.210 
short-term profits you know invest in

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
the people who have a 20 20th century

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.150 
the people who have a 20 20th century
good<00:06:14.550> a<00:06:15.000> corporate<00:06:15.570> organization<00:06:16.140> you<00:06:17.040> want

good a corporate organization you want

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
to invest in something that's going to

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.360 
to invest in something that's going to
be<00:06:18.450> around<00:06:18.630> for<00:06:18.900> 30<00:06:19.169> or<00:06:19.320> 40<00:06:19.590> years<00:06:19.620> because

they're able to keep up with the

isn't going to slow down innovation is
going<00:06:30.450> to<00:06:30.510> continue<00:06:30.810> and<00:06:31.169> and<00:06:31.560> unless<00:06:31.890> you

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040 
going to continue and and unless you

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.040 
going to continue and and unless you
have<00:06:32.220> a<00:06:32.250> corporate<00:06:32.640> structure<00:06:33.210> that<00:06:33.690> just

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
have a corporate structure that just

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.219 
have a corporate structure that just
rolls<00:06:34.320> with<00:06:34.590> that<00:06:34.740> I<00:06:35.720> think<00:06:36.720> we're<00:06:36.990> going<00:06:37.140> to

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
rolls with that I think we're going to

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.070 
rolls with that I think we're going to
see<00:06:37.260> some<00:06:37.410> major<00:06:37.950> changes
