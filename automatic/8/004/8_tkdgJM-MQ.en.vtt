00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 all right 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.670
 hi what data but they are very good 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:14.160
 eating well the title of the video today 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.430
 let's see a new technique that is going to 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.070
 be the implementation of Valkyries and 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.860
 healers I have 10 nacelles and 10 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.750
 the level 4 healers and the 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.300
 valkirias level 1 because they have not had 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.460
 time to improve them in elche and only 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.219
 I carry what is a spell of the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.620
 spells jump and in the castle the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.079
 clan took what are five magicians and ten 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.780
 archers for in case of emergencies 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.050
 use it also I carry my two kings 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.050
 the queen and the king and let's see how it goes 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.989
 the game here I want the shield in what 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.450
 particular I have no idea for 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.270
 look for it so the first one that says 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.360
 it's been good to attack will be the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.890
 attack for example this do not have 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.910
 resources in fact I will not attack so much 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.530
 for resources if I do not think I do not win like that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.940
 that we are going to attack any village that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.530
 is not at a level 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.530
 but not so low 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.580
 they are or the other 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.830
 for example it could be this 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.870
 does not have as many resources but is not 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.570
 so hard to gain defenses 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.030
 known low and then let's see how we 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.550
 goes against this village I think the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.360
 place will be to attack above and draw your 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.280
 castle since in previous videos my 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.270
 mistake has been not to take out the castle and 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.470
 again wizards good the nacelles what 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.200
 good is that they have attack 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.240
 splash are destroying everything to your 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.960
 around here they have already destroyed me I think 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.150
 that three heifers the only wizards 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.220
 and he launched a month to destroy 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.150
 these magicians 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.940
 unfortunately I miss valkiria is what 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.040
 which I did not expect because 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.860
 I did not expect the orchids to kill me 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.900
 and little by little they will be entering the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.480
 village is but they carry some of their gold 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.539
 It's not much, but 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.629
 it's nothing 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.609
 here they go outside I do not know why 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.379
 look here, a flight went 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.719
 boat here they were going to destroy me 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.359
 healer I think that this village was not the 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.129
 best option here we are going to launch a 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:26.459
 spell jump so they do not get stuck 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.939
 so much and go ahead look one went for 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.760
 outside 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:33.000
 the others go in and go destroying 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.099
 a little but with four valkyrie is not 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.040
 it was my idea to enter a village to 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.290
 destroy it and the worst thing is that the outside 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.239
 is likely to be killed here and the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.280
 three inside are destroying little to 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.060
 little constructions here I already 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.879
 they killed another one and nothing left me 32 are 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.680
 with cannons and defenses here I'm going to 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.439
 launch another type of jump because if I 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.290
 they're going to last a lot and they're shooting at you 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.720
 right to my healers which is going to cause 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.460
 that at a certain time I stayed 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.380
 without healers and only with Valkyrie 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.170
 well the outside one at least follows 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.150
 alive and here the other two go 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.510
 distributing on the inside the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.270
 mouthpiece has been raised a lot of life and 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.670
 attack and that's why I wanted to see how 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.090
 they worked but I see that they have to go 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.460
 together so they can destroy everything and 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.710
 with 12 jump spells since it is 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.790
 can attack on the walls and there it is 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.739
 when they are going to destroy them 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.549
 here is already a little more defenses 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.739
 the outside one already dead and the healers 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.870
 they have less than half of life I think 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.969
 that this village was not the best for 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.930
 attack since it has not gone so well 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:47.030
 well I've already been 40 percent and I've 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.620
 stolen for what he has but I have 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.530
 Stolen 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.180
 to achieve 50 or greater I think that 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.709
 I'm going to have to throw my kings and 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.709
 that the nacelles do not do much here 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.160
 see already they come into the game of several 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.560
 defenses 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.660
 and the healer heal everything here already 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.000
 He sent my queen to destroy 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.860
 all that remains that I have little left 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.750
 time 50% already here they enter a fire 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.390
 very serious since all the defenses 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.180
 the Valkyries are firing the 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.360
 healer are also being attacked 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.510
 by the air defenses and here they destroy 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.820
 to my last healer the Valkyrie is like that 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.370
 easy prey for all defenses like this 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.350
 I better give up and I prefer to go very 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.420
 victorious good I hope you have them 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.940
 liked this tactic do not leave also 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.050
 but finally see you until the next 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.050
 video bye
