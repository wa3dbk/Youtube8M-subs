you're<00:02:02.380> going<00:02:02.409> to<00:02:02.649> take<00:02:02.950> your<00:02:03.189> ribbon<00:02:03.369> and

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
you're going to take your ribbon and

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.029 
you're going to take your ribbon and
you're<00:02:04.390> going<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.810> pull<00:02:05.020> it<00:02:05.200> straight<00:02:05.469> and

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
you're going to pull it straight and

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.550 
you're going to pull it straight and
then<00:02:06.939> you're<00:02:07.090> going<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.390> loop<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.749> around<00:02:07.810> and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
then you're going to loop it around and

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.420 
then you're going to loop it around and
you're<00:02:09.520> going<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.670> pierce<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.210> other<00:02:10.390> end

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
you're going to pierce the other end

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.420 
you're going to pierce the other end
your<00:02:12.750> needle<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:14.739> make<00:02:14.980> sure<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.280> your

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
your needle so make sure that your

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.330 
your needle so make sure that your
ribbon<00:02:15.610> is<00:02:15.790> loop

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
ribbon is loop

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.970 
ribbon is loop
like<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.910> it's<00:02:17.180> straight<00:02:17.599> when<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.769> let

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
like that and it's straight when you let

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.059 
like that and it's straight when you let
go<00:02:19.160> of<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.519> it's<00:02:20.060> gonna<00:02:20.239> naturally<00:02:21.019> try<00:02:22.010> to

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
go of it it's gonna naturally try to

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.430 
go of it it's gonna naturally try to
regain<00:02:22.459> some<00:02:22.819> of<00:02:22.879> that<00:02:23.030> curl<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.900> that's

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
regain some of that curl and that's

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.650 
regain some of that curl and that's
what's<00:02:24.739> gonna<00:02:24.890> give<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.670> unique<00:02:25.730> curly

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
what's gonna give it that unique curly

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.920 
what's gonna give it that unique curly
look<00:02:27.700> like<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:28.879> this<00:02:28.970> blue<00:02:29.300> bow<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:32.660> take

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
look like in this blue bow so you take

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.150 
look like in this blue bow so you take
each<00:02:33.170> piece

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.559 

let's<00:02:37.160> Pierce<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.730> on<00:02:37.819> one<00:02:38.030> end<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.420> needle

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
let's Pierce it on one end of the needle

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.119 
let's Pierce it on one end of the needle
straight<00:02:39.410> in<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:40.670> ribbon<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.920> then<00:02:42.920> the

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
straight in the ribbon and then the

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.520 
straight in the ribbon and then the
other<00:02:43.280> side<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.720> keep<00:02:45.410> going<00:02:47.080> until<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.500> have

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
other side and keep going until you have

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.020 
other side and keep going until you have
filled<00:02:49.489> your<00:02:50.299> needle<00:02:51.019> what<00:02:51.799> I<00:02:51.829> usually<00:02:52.099> do<00:02:52.519> is

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
filled your needle what I usually do is

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.910 
filled your needle what I usually do is
I<00:02:54.099> do<00:02:55.099> one<00:02:55.430> complete<00:02:56.090> pattern<00:02:56.500> stacked<00:02:57.500> on<00:02:57.769> the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
I do one complete pattern stacked on the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.270 
I do one complete pattern stacked on the
needle<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:59.170> then<00:03:00.170> I<00:03:00.440> slide<00:03:00.829> it<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.370> end<00:03:01.549> of

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
needle and then I slide it to the end of

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.210 
needle and then I slide it to the end of
the<00:03:04.280> thread<00:03:04.610> like<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.599> to<00:03:05.959> where<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.410> knot

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
the thread like this to where the knot

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.869 
the thread like this to where the knot
is<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:09.140> just<00:03:09.319> keep<00:03:09.530> going<00:03:09.950> until<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.849> have

pieces on your thread and you're going
to<00:03:59.120> want<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.660> try<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.319> line<00:04:00.680> them<00:04:00.709> up<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.340> that

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
to want to try to line them up so that

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.470 
to want to try to line them up so that
you<00:04:02.480> have<00:04:02.930> all<00:04:03.380> of<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.769> ends<00:04:04.430> stack<00:04:05.209> together

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
you have all of the ends stack together

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.839 
you have all of the ends stack together
they<00:04:05.930> get<00:04:06.109> kind<00:04:06.349> of<00:04:06.440> crazy<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:07.010> jumbled<00:04:07.459> up<00:04:07.579> as

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
they get kind of crazy and jumbled up as

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.699 
they get kind of crazy and jumbled up as
you're<00:04:08.030> pulling<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.540> pieces<00:04:08.900> of<00:04:09.019> thread<00:04:09.290> onto

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
you're pulling the pieces of thread onto

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.890 
you're pulling the pieces of thread onto
the<00:04:09.829> needle<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.400> here's<00:04:11.120> where<00:04:11.329> you<00:04:11.510> want<00:04:11.750> to

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
the needle and here's where you want to

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.080 
the needle and here's where you want to
get<00:04:12.410> them<00:04:12.590> straightened<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:13.880> you<00:04:13.970> have

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
get them straightened so that you have

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.810 
get them straightened so that you have
all<00:04:14.299> your<00:04:14.480> loops<00:04:14.780> sticking<00:04:15.680> up<00:04:15.859> straight

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
all your loops sticking up straight

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.659 
all your loops sticking up straight
should<00:04:17.539> just<00:04:17.840> be<00:04:18.289> pretty<00:04:18.620> easy<00:04:18.829> to<00:04:19.250> get<00:04:19.400> that

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
should just be pretty easy to get that

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.330 
should just be pretty easy to get that
loop<00:04:20.389> together<00:04:20.810> like<00:04:21.139> that<00:04:23.800> okay<00:04:24.800> so<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:25.039> have

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
loop together like that okay so I have

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.370 
loop together like that okay so I have
them<00:04:25.520> all<00:04:25.610> pretty<00:04:26.030> much<00:04:26.240> stacked<00:04:27.020> up<00:04:27.229> they

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
them all pretty much stacked up they

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.170 
them all pretty much stacked up they
don't<00:04:27.560> have<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:27.890> be<00:04:28.010> perfect

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
don't have to be perfect

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.999 
don't have to be perfect
wanna<00:04:29.419> make<00:04:29.539> sure<00:04:29.720> you're<00:04:29.870> not<00:04:29.900> about<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.500> glue

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
wanna make sure you're not about to glue

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.390 
wanna make sure you're not about to glue
any<00:04:31.340> loops<00:04:31.729> them<00:04:32.380> okay<00:04:33.380> so<00:04:33.410> what<00:04:33.830> I<00:04:33.860> do<00:04:34.009> is<00:04:34.370> I

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
any loops them okay so what I do is I

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.300 
any loops them okay so what I do is I
take<00:04:34.820> this<00:04:35.120> stack<00:04:35.509> and<00:04:35.960> I<00:04:36.410> kind<00:04:36.740> of<00:04:36.830> turn<00:04:37.100> it<00:04:37.280> a

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
take this stack and I kind of turn it a

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.890 
take this stack and I kind of turn it a
little<00:04:37.460> bit<00:04:37.910> like<00:04:38.570> that

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900
