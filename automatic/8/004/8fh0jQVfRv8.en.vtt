00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
happening and actually had this a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.090 
happening and actually had this a
matchup<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.210> fact<00:00:48.480> happening<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.680> seahawks

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
the Falcons and the Falcons have been a

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.470 
the Falcons and the Falcons have been a
fraud<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.160> playoffs<00:02:32.490> last<00:02:32.730> few<00:02:33.000> years<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.420> gets

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
fraud in playoffs last few years it gets

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.010 
fraud in playoffs last few years it gets
a<00:02:33.630> playoffs<00:02:34.020> get<00:02:34.320> beat<00:02:34.530> by<00:02:34.740> dots<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.750> so

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
a playoffs get beat by dots and so on so

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.510 
a playoffs get beat by dots and so on so
forth<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:38.120> but<00:02:39.120> i<00:02:39.330> think<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.980> falcons<00:02:41.430> are

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
forth and but i think the falcons are

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.300 
forth and but i think the falcons are
destined<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.620> go<00:02:43.620> farther<00:02:43.890> than<00:02:44.100> playoffs

destined to go farther than playoffs

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.930 
destined to go farther than playoffs
really<00:02:44.730> do<00:02:44.850> think<00:02:44.970> they<00:02:45.150> are<00:02:45.440> great<00:02:46.440> team

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
really do think they are great team

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.180 
really do think they are great team
defense<00:02:47.940> has<00:02:48.750> been<00:02:48.780> suspect<00:02:49.380> at<00:02:49.710> times<00:02:49.740> but

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
defense has been suspect at times but

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.960 
defense has been suspect at times but
they<00:02:50.340> played<00:02:50.610> well<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.120> tough<00:02:51.600> times<00:02:52.970> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
they played well and tough times the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.150 
they played well and tough times the
seahawks<00:02:54.390> man<00:02:55.050> there<00:02:55.380> they're<00:02:55.800> unstoppable

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
seahawks man there they're unstoppable

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.770 
seahawks man there they're unstoppable
right<00:02:56.940> now<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:58.430> defense<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.730> often<00:03:00.390> some

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
right now on defense and often some

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.960 
right now on defense and often some
ethan's<00:03:01.710> playing<00:03:01.950> lights-out<00:03:02.460> offense

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
ethan's playing lights-out offense

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.350 
ethan's playing lights-out offense
really<00:03:03.270> can't<00:03:03.480> be<00:03:03.570> stopped<00:03:03.980> but<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.370> mean<00:03:06.000> this

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
really can't be stopped but I mean this

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.840 
really can't be stopped but I mean this
can<00:03:06.570> be<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.810> atlanta<00:03:07.490> falcons<00:03:08.490> had<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.610> bye<00:03:08.820> week

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
can be in atlanta falcons had a bye week

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.490 
can be in atlanta falcons had a bye week
that's<00:03:09.240> not<00:03:09.480> necessarily<00:03:09.930> always<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.320> best

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
that's not necessarily always the best

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.250 
that's not necessarily always the best
thing<00:03:10.850> but<00:03:11.850> i<00:03:12.770> think<00:03:13.770> their<00:03:14.310> offense<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.260> one

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
thing but i think their offense is one

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.230 
thing but i think their offense is one
of<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.380> best<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.800> film<00:03:17.070> at<00:03:17.250> run<00:03:17.460> amazing

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
here in Atlanta um I think Matt Wright

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.340 
here in Atlanta um I think Matt Wright
has<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.280> big<00:03:50.490> game<00:03:50.570> Russell<00:03:51.570> Wilson<00:03:52.020> has<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.140> big

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
has a big game Russell Wilson has a big

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.870 
has a big game Russell Wilson has a big
game<00:03:52.380> think<00:03:52.830> Marshawn<00:03:53.220> Lynch<00:03:53.430> has<00:03:53.580> a<00:03:53.610> big<00:03:53.850> game

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
game think Marshawn Lynch has a big game

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.670 
game think Marshawn Lynch has a big game
and<00:03:54.330> wash<00:03:55.140> on<00:03:55.380> Lynch<00:03:55.710> has<00:03:56.040> been<00:03:57.260> prone<00:03:58.260> to

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
and wash on Lynch has been prone to

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.280 
and wash on Lynch has been prone to
fumbling<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.160> ball<00:03:59.250> as<00:03:59.610> of<00:03:59.790> late<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.240> I<00:04:00.810> think

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
fumbling the ball as of late and I think

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.620 
fumbling the ball as of late and I think
something<00:04:01.620> little<00:04:01.860> like<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.580> ends<00:04:03.030> up

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
something little like that ends up

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
something little like that ends up
giving<00:04:03.960> Falcons<00:04:04.590> possession<00:04:05.070> in<00:04:06.080> great<00:04:07.080> field

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
giving Falcons possession in great field

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.770 
giving Falcons possession in great field
position<00:04:07.770> end<00:04:08.430> up<00:04:08.820> getting<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.090> field<00:04:09.360> goal<00:04:09.480> and

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
position end up getting a field goal and

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.080 
position end up getting a field goal and
I<00:04:09.900> think<00:04:10.080> that<00:04:10.200> one<00:04:10.410> field<00:04:10.680> goal<00:04:10.740> oh<00:04:11.130> that<00:04:11.850> one

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
I think that one field goal oh that one

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.910 
I think that one field goal oh that one
school<00:04:12.420> will<00:04:12.570> be<00:04:12.600> just<00:04:13.110> enough<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.560> knock<00:04:13.740> off
