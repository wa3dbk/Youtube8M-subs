the first strings then it strings 1 2 3
&amp;<00:03:31.880> 4<00:03:31.940> then<00:03:32.420> 2<00:03:32.690> 3<00:03:33.410> &amp;<00:03:33.560> 4<00:03:33.620> then<00:03:34.489> 3<00:03:34.520> &amp;<00:03:35.090> 4<00:03:35.330> then<00:03:36.260> 3<00:03:36.500> &amp;<00:03:36.620> 4

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
&amp; 4 then 2 3 &amp; 4 then 3 &amp; 4 then 3 &amp; 4

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.229 
&amp; 4 then 2 3 &amp; 4 then 3 &amp; 4 then 3 &amp; 4
again<00:03:37.040> then<00:03:37.280> 4<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:38.510> it's<00:03:39.080> like<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:41.350> then<00:03:42.350> this

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
again then 4 so it's like this then this

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.820 
again then 4 so it's like this then this
then<00:03:44.239> this<00:03:45.160> then<00:03:46.160> this

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
then this then this

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.380 
then this then this
ok<00:03:48.830> so<00:03:48.890> it's<00:03:49.250> 1<00:03:49.820> 2<00:03:49.970> 3<00:03:50.150> 4<00:03:50.450> 2<00:03:50.630> 3<00:03:50.900> 4<00:03:51.200> 3<00:03:51.650> 4<00:03:51.739> 3<00:03:51.980> 4<00:03:52.430> 4<00:03:52.760> so

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
ok so it's 1 2 3 4 2 3 4 3 4 3 4 4 so

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.220 
ok so it's 1 2 3 4 2 3 4 3 4 3 4 4 so
it's<00:03:54.019> really<00:03:54.410> easy<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:54.860> remember<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:56.230> the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
it's really easy to remember the the

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.580 
it's really easy to remember the the
finger<00:03:57.560> sequence<00:03:58.690> but<00:03:59.690> it's<00:04:00.350> kind<00:04:00.530> of

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
finger sequence but it's kind of

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.229 
finger sequence but it's kind of
difficult<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.040> pull<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.400> off<00:04:01.580> so<00:04:01.610> it<00:04:01.940> takes<00:04:02.120> a

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
difficult to pull it off so it takes a

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.860 
difficult to pull it off so it takes a
bit<00:04:02.420> of<00:04:02.450> practice<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:03.019> let's<00:04:03.650> see<00:04:03.980> you<00:04:04.870> play

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
bit of practice and let's see you play

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.770 
bit of practice and let's see you play
