percent this is one of the most talented
sides<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.640> US<00:01:29.880> history<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.930> know<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.290> they

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409

would<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> huge<00:01:33.210> disappointment<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:34.110> think

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
would be a huge disappointment I think

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.660

they'll<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.799> there<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.220> then<00:01:35.310> when<00:01:35.549> you're

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
they'll get there and then when you're

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.770 
they'll get there and then when you're
in<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> knockout<00:01:36.030> rounds<00:01:36.329> anything<00:01:36.659> can

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780

what we're best at we win games you know
ten<00:01:58.979> years<00:01:59.219> ago<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.670> wouldn't<00:01:59.880> have<00:02:00.000> had<00:02:00.119> an

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
ten years ago we wouldn't have had an

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.359 
ten years ago we wouldn't have had an
atmosphere<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.409> our<00:02:01.680> sport<00:02:02.250> is

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
atmosphere like this so our sport is

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.940 
atmosphere like this so our sport is
growing<00:02:02.460> tremendously<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.229> think

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
growing tremendously and I think

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.980 
growing tremendously and I think
everybody's<00:02:05.460> excited<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> chance<00:02:06.540> to

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
everybody's excited to have a chance to

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.040 
everybody's excited to have a chance to
have<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> world<00:02:07.469> cup<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.829> brazil

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
think that's probably the best place you

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.100 
think that's probably the best place you
could<00:02:10.850> ask<00:02:11.000> for<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.330> have<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.480> world<00:02:11.720> cup<00:02:11.930> and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110
