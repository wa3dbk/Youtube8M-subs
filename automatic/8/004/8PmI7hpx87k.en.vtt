but<00:06:33.660> I<00:06:33.690> didn't<00:06:33.990> take<00:06:34.050> the<00:06:34.200> time<00:06:34.380> to<00:06:34.530> look<00:06:34.740> but

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
but I didn't take the time to look but

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.970 
but I didn't take the time to look but
we<00:06:35.820> get<00:06:35.970> some<00:06:36.120> nice<00:06:36.270> wonderful<00:06:36.630> lag<00:06:37.080> and<00:06:37.350> this

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
we get some nice wonderful lag and this

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.470 
we get some nice wonderful lag and this
is<00:06:38.220> what<00:06:38.430> gave<00:06:38.640> me<00:06:38.730> an<00:06:38.820> upper<00:06:39.030> hand<00:06:39.060> even

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480

though<00:06:39.690> we<00:06:39.900> probably<00:06:40.050> could<00:06:40.320> have<00:06:40.350> finished

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
though we probably could have finished
