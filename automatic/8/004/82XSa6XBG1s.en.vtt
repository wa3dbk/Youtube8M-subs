00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
all their components to their system

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.190 
all their components to their system
where<00:05:19.210> do<00:05:19.270> they<00:05:19.389> get<00:05:19.570> them<00:05:19.690> from<00:05:19.840> they<00:05:20.050> don't

where do they get them from they don't
build<00:05:20.650> the<00:05:21.280> components<00:05:21.639> to<00:05:21.970> their<00:05:22.120> system

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
build the components to their system

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.290 
build the components to their system
they<00:05:22.690> buy<00:05:22.990> them<00:05:23.290> from<00:05:23.560> a<00:05:23.680> manufacturer<00:05:24.490> to<00:05:25.060> put

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
they buy them from a manufacturer to put

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.700 
they buy them from a manufacturer to put
in<00:05:25.479> there<00:05:25.660> so<00:05:26.370> they<00:05:27.660> buy<00:05:28.660> how<00:05:28.870> hypocritical<00:05:29.620> is

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
in there so they buy how hypocritical is

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.120 
in there so they buy how hypocritical is
that<00:05:29.889> for<00:05:30.190> a<00:05:30.220> person<00:05:30.490> to<00:05:30.910> say<00:05:31.660> that<00:05:32.130> they're

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
that for a person to say that they're

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.270 
that for a person to say that they're
building<00:05:33.490> a<00:05:33.729> system<00:05:33.970> but<00:05:34.630> they<00:05:35.140> just<00:05:35.410> paid<00:05:35.710> for

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
building a system but they just paid for

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.500 
building a system but they just paid for
all<00:05:36.370> the<00:05:36.490> products<00:05:36.880> they<00:05:36.940> didn't<00:05:37.150> build<00:05:37.270> all

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
all the products they didn't build all

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.909 
all the products they didn't build all
the<00:05:37.660> products<00:05:38.110> that<00:05:38.140> they<00:05:38.320> put<00:05:38.500> in<00:05:38.620> there<00:05:38.740> they

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
the products that they put in there they

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.370 
the products that they put in there they
didn't<00:05:39.100> build<00:05:39.250> all<00:05:39.370> the<00:05:39.460> components<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.090> it

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
didn't build all the components to it

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.440 
didn't build all the components to it
but<00:05:41.380> just<00:05:42.010> because<00:05:42.430> I<00:05:42.729> install<00:05:43.180> these

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
but just because I install these

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.140 
but just because I install these
components<00:05:44.169> makes<00:05:44.380> them<00:05:44.760> better<00:05:45.760> than<00:05:46.060> a

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
components makes them better than a

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.080 
components makes them better than a
person<00:05:46.600> that<00:05:46.870> decides<00:05:47.560> to<00:05:47.770> pay<00:05:48.130> this<00:05:48.669> person

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
person that decides to pay this person

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.560 
person that decides to pay this person
to<00:05:49.360> put<00:05:49.539> their<00:05:49.660> stuff<00:05:49.870> on<00:05:50.050> there<00:05:50.200> so<00:05:51.450> and<00:05:52.450> I'm

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
to put their stuff on there so and I'm

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.000 
to put their stuff on there so and I'm
sure<00:05:52.630> there's<00:05:52.960> several<00:05:53.200> other<00:05:53.440> things<00:05:53.500> but<00:05:53.979> I

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
sure there's several other things but I

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.920 
sure there's several other things but I
guess<00:05:54.280> it<00:05:54.669> just<00:05:54.700> makes<00:05:55.000> some<00:05:55.240> sleep<00:05:55.570> better<00:05:55.720> at

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
guess it just makes some sleep better at

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.020 
guess it just makes some sleep better at
night<00:05:57.419> whether<00:05:58.419> I<00:05:58.720> mean<00:05:58.900> everybody<00:06:00.030> depends

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
night whether I mean everybody depends

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.510 
night whether I mean everybody depends
on<00:06:01.150> somebody<00:06:01.570> else<00:06:01.810> or<00:06:02.139> everybody<00:06:03.010> has<00:06:03.250> stuff

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
on somebody else or everybody has stuff

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.790 
on somebody else or everybody has stuff
done<00:06:03.820> for<00:06:03.850> them<00:06:04.270> whatever<00:06:04.840> it<00:06:05.080> might<00:06:05.289> be<00:06:05.350> in

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
done for them whatever it might be in

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.920 
done for them whatever it might be in
