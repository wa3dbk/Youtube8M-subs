00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.300
 to make a yeast dough he put Bettini up for the Eklat approach 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:14.739
 in fact 80% fresh yeast is available for the help and there is 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:16.570
 dried help from the bag 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.140
 I prefer the fresh yeast 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.360
 and you have to 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.720
 Percent first because there were no longer start for some z 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.060
 and one of those 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.060
 our package about a third 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:32.819
 Boston what's up 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.480
 the deadlines is a living one 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.520
 and that's why it's about becoming 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.780
 eye-fi only along also warm milk 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.970
 is offered and above all 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.260
 what a little trick is a bit of sugar to do with it 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 because the lady governs the train or the sugar 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.640
 and around 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.840
 That's the approach 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.050
 an advantage if you could go in with a little bit of sugar 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.020
 a little bit of the lukewarm milk 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.020
 on it 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.280
 and I help out per job and gives some time 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.280
 to form this approach 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.770
 they sit so I let Danzer run somewhere on the stove 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.570
 Of course, that's the birth too 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.440
 Here, too, the citizens, I should be hot, I need for the yeast dough 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.240
 preferably 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.630
 warm ingredients but percent does not mean there is nothing cooking 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.910
 and now I can take my breasts very much and the rest 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.079
 The ingredients already 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.320
 because prepared by recipe 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.320
 I start with the seventh more 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.280
 8th 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.490
 touted as 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.430
 and two threes 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.079
 I can do that now at the beginning 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.330
 Next, I'll go and get that butter 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
 to 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.599
 Hugo colorful 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:41.550
 and around 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.689
 because the train itself 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.049
 after ten minutes 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.949
 about this 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:50.949
 Consistency so beautifully absorbed 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.989
 and now I give it here too carefully 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.499
 sometimes the dough 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.349
 it is still missing 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.779
 a little bit of lukewarm milk 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.779
 just after recipe her husband case a quarter liter 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.499
 times 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.499
 still in the pot 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.339
 Prof 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:28.339
 APA 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.569
 Now I start with my hand 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.569
 to knead the whole well 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:45.029
 so and around depending on the consistency, if the dough is still up to torture too 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.029
 we just add a little bit more 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.999
 until the 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.999
 Dough is beautifully smooth 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.510
 and if my place is a bit limited for kneading you can do so 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.189
 But it is also important to knead on the board, but it is important 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.739
 bit me here to stray with it not easy every leaf 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.029
 because I can offer my help drinking water through the board 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:18.230
 The goal is here 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.169
 to get as supple dough as possible 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.099
 no lumps from the surface is very smooth 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.590
 I press 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.719
 the dough 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.789
 always after rounds of boards with the ball of your hand 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.930
 Stiebig him the leaf that's me 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.930
 being worked through by violence becomes really good 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.990
 in order to accelerate this breakdown and childhood always 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.159
 to be smoother 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.460
 Depending on your strength, this can sometimes take up to fifteen minutes 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.199
 then the party is not real 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.199
 nice and smooth as they say 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.300
 Knead 2 after fifteen minutes 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.500
 is the dough then 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.569
 so far 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.089
 in my opinion it is beautifully supple but very smooth 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:08.270
 Surface and he lets himself 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.300
 nice to go apart without ripping 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.430
 So really adopted a different consistency 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.430
 and around 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.550
 be formed into a sphere 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.389
 Now the yeast dough has to go next, that is 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.530
 he must go on the help must percent in the part of the work 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.530
 for that we go back to the 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.409
 April he has his on 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:41.520
 to warm 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.360
 Wind quiet place 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.090
 something to do with hotelplan when go belgium turkey too he will always be 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.300
 Larger and thus Starline has a crosswise way up 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.030
 so it can rise 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.229
 it does not get dry 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.229
 I would have the whole thing with me 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.089
 stoked on wet clock 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:06.450
 now I'll put them on 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.169
 Wiesbaden place 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.169
 more for example 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.979
 the whole now takes at least 30 minutes percent 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.080
 and who would have to wait so long now 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.499
 for a yeast dough 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:24.580
 has gone up 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.960
 I can do that carefully 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.689
 touring today 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:32.189
 and when you see the salon really worked out, Survive Wreath is out 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:35.150
 now that I have him carefully out of the bowl 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.229
 Environment that 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.229
 Pratt first sprinkle a bit with flour again 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:44.099
 and now Mr. Schmidt is feverish again 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:47.099
 they have 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.689
 Naturally Speaking means I have to help them out a bit 

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:57.889
 then comes too 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.889
 to the moon 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.550
 Now I want to go through it again really strong 

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:24.389
 and this one 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:26.980
 ready to be processed further, for example 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.060
 to be rolled out
