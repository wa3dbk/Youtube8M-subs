00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.660 

this<00:00:01.310> is<00:00:01.550> what<00:00:01.760> I<00:00:01.790> figured<00:00:02.570> out<00:00:02.830> for<00:00:03.830> mounting

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:04.670 
this is what I figured out for mounting

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.890 
this is what I figured out for mounting
a<00:00:04.790> camera<00:00:06.099> on<00:00:07.099> my<00:00:07.430> bike<00:00:07.670> and<00:00:08.000> I<00:00:08.179> think<00:00:08.750> it'll

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
a camera on my bike and I think it'll

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.950 
a camera on my bike and I think it'll
work<00:00:09.020> for<00:00:09.530> a<00:00:10.010> motorcycle<00:00:10.520> or<00:00:11.090> for<00:00:11.300> a<00:00:11.330> bicycle

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
work for a motorcycle or for a bicycle

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.070 
work for a motorcycle or for a bicycle
because<00:00:12.110> the<00:00:12.680> size<00:00:13.550> of<00:00:13.820> the<00:00:13.880> handle<00:00:14.390> I<00:00:14.510> cube<00:00:14.900> is

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
because the size of the handle I cube is

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.439 
because the size of the handle I cube is
about<00:00:15.380> saying<00:00:15.860> I<00:00:16.510> got<00:00:17.510> PVC<00:00:18.140> piping<00:00:19.030> and<00:00:20.710> a<00:00:22.449> PVC

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
about saying I got PVC piping and a PVC

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:33.779 
about saying I got PVC piping and a PVC
end<00:00:23.990> plug<00:00:25.359> and<00:00:26.359> then<00:00:26.600> I<00:00:26.930> got<00:00:27.289> a<00:00:28.810> small<00:00:32.140> bolt

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
end plug and then I got a small bolt

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.160 
end plug and then I got a small bolt
it's<00:00:34.789> stainless<00:00:35.120> steel<00:00:35.539> that<00:00:35.690> doesn't<00:00:36.019> have

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
it's stainless steel that doesn't have

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.979 
it's stainless steel that doesn't have
to<00:00:36.319> be<00:00:36.879> you<00:00:37.879> have<00:00:38.059> to<00:00:38.089> figure<00:00:38.389> out<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.780> size

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
to be you have to figure out the size

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.239 
to be you have to figure out the size
that<00:00:39.319> matches<00:00:39.829> the<00:00:40.039> thread<00:00:41.079> inside<00:00:42.249> your

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:43.249 
that matches the thread inside your

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.319 
that matches the thread inside your
camera<00:00:43.489> mount<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.359> I<00:00:44.989> just<00:00:45.289> screwed<00:00:46.059> the<00:00:47.059> bolt

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
camera mount and I just screwed the bolt

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.049 
camera mount and I just screwed the bolt
through<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.809> PVC<00:00:48.679> end<00:00:48.949> cap<00:00:49.370> it's<00:00:49.670> a<00:00:49.789> little

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
through the PVC end cap it's a little

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.889 
through the PVC end cap it's a little
plastic<00:00:50.299> cap<00:00:50.780> that<00:00:50.929> goes<00:00:50.989> on<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.409> end<00:00:51.709> of

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
plastic cap that goes on the end of

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.670 
plastic cap that goes on the end of
pipes

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
pipes

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.420 
pipes
this<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> endcap<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.870> got<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:02.160> bolt

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
this is the endcap that I got the bolt

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.880 
this is the endcap that I got the bolt
you<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.390> take<00:01:03.900> a<00:01:03.930> little<00:01:04.230> camera<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:04.739> you

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you just take a little camera with you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.560 
you just take a little camera with you
and<00:01:04.920> then<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.460> match<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.970> thread<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and then you can match the thread to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.420 
and then you can match the thread to
whatever<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.110> need<00:01:07.290> for<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:07.890> cameras<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
whatever you need for your cameras and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.520 
whatever you need for your cameras and
they're<00:01:08.670> universal<00:01:08.850> too<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.110> fix<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
they're universal too so if you fix it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.080 
they're universal too so if you fix it
on<00:01:10.620> one<00:01:10.800> camera<00:01:11.160> it'll<00:01:11.250> work<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.670> anything

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
on one camera it'll work on anything

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:31.790 
on one camera it'll work on anything
else<00:01:12.300> as<00:01:12.479> well<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.950> pipe<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.460> cut<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.800> little

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
else as well the pipe is cut a little

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.730 
else as well the pipe is cut a little
more<00:01:32.130> than<00:01:33.030> half<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:35.610> holds<00:01:35.970> around

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
more than half so that it holds around

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.010 
more than half so that it holds around
the<00:01:37.740> handlebars<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:40.170> then<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:41.009> use<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
the handlebars and then I just use the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.660 
the handlebars and then I just use the
the<00:01:43.020> masking<00:01:43.500> tape<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.710> Gaffa<00:01:44.009> tape<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:47.460> create

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the masking tape to Gaffa tape to create

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.090 
the masking tape to Gaffa tape to create
a<00:01:47.910> snugger<00:01:48.630> fit<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:49.320> also<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.680> little<00:01:49.890> more

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
a snugger fit it's also a little more

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.999 
a snugger fit it's also a little more
sticky<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:52.320> grips<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.740> handlebars<00:01:54.860> this<00:01:55.860> is

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
sticky it grips the handlebars this is

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.590 
sticky it grips the handlebars this is
the<00:01:56.100> PVC<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.789> little<00:01:57.060> slippery<00:01:59.360> and<00:02:00.360> there's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the PVC is a little slippery and there's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.160 
the PVC is a little slippery and there's
the<00:02:00.750> camera<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.729> fits<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.390> really<00:02:03.780> easily

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the camera and it fits on really easily

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.050 
the camera and it fits on really easily
and<00:02:04.440> it<00:02:04.920> stays<00:02:05.220> tight<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:05.880> real<00:02:06.090> tight<00:02:08.060> when

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
and it stays tight it's real tight when

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.729 
and it stays tight it's real tight when
you're<00:02:09.179> tightening<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:10.019> not<00:02:10.200> facing

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
you're tightening it it's not facing

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.030 
you're tightening it it's not facing
exactly<00:02:11.220> how<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.459> want<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:12.209> just<00:02:15.799> twist<00:02:16.799> this

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
exactly how you want I just twist this

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.160 
exactly how you want I just twist this
because<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:17.610> not<00:02:17.820> glued<00:02:18.269> in<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.750> can<00:02:18.959> point

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
because it's not glued in I can point

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.550 
because it's not glued in I can point
any<00:02:19.410> way<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.680> want<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:21.019> so<00:02:22.019> if<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.170> want<00:02:22.290> to

any way I want it to so if you want to

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.740 
any way I want it to so if you want to
point<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.920> just<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.459> little<00:02:24.060> bit<00:02:24.239> off<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.450> the
