one and a half by one and a half wood it

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.790 
one and a half by one and a half wood it
can<00:00:17.640> be<00:00:17.789> fairly<00:00:18.780> soft<00:00:19.110> because<00:00:19.380> you'll<00:00:19.650> see

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
can be fairly soft because you'll see

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.350 
can be fairly soft because you'll see
what<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.100> do<00:00:20.250> with<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.820> don't<00:00:20.940> really<00:00:21.240> need

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
what we do with it we don't really need

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.210 
what we do with it we don't really need
it<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> hardwood<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.620> gonna<00:00:22.740> be<00:00:22.920> easier

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
it to be a hardwood it's gonna be easier

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.460 
it to be a hardwood it's gonna be easier
to<00:00:23.370> manipulate<00:00:23.580> if<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:24.300> soft<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:25.140> gonna<00:00:25.290> be

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
to manipulate if it's soft it's gonna be

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.800 
to manipulate if it's soft it's gonna be
lighter<00:00:25.770> weight<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.490> we<00:00:27.390> don't<00:00:27.510> want<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.720> do

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
lighter weight and we don't want to do

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.690 
lighter weight and we don't want to do
any<00:00:27.960> damage<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> rim<00:00:28.920> or<00:00:29.100> the<00:00:29.130> tire

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
any damage to the rim or the tire

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.610 
any damage to the rim or the tire
I'm<00:00:30.030> just<00:00:30.210> gonna<00:00:30.300> set<00:00:30.570> mine<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:30.780> in<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.200> one<00:00:31.530> of

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:31.620 
I'm just gonna set mine up in it one of

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.440 
I'm just gonna set mine up in it one of
these<00:00:31.710> little<00:00:31.890> cheap<00:00:32.189> plastic<00:00:32.640> miter<00:00:32.910> boxes

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
these little cheap plastic miter boxes

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.779 
these little cheap plastic miter boxes
and<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.289> see<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> wood<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.010> smaller<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.730> can

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
and you see the wood is smaller so I can

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:37.370 
and you see the wood is smaller so I can
angle<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.329> little<00:00:36.570> bit<00:00:36.720> I'm<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:36.900> gonna<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.350> a

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
angle a little bit I'm just gonna get a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.010 
angle a little bit I'm just gonna get a
slight<00:00:37.710> angle<00:00:37.920> cut<00:00:38.370> off<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.730> end<00:00:38.970> so<00:00:39.240> that<00:00:39.990> I

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
slight angle cut off the end so that I

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.560 
slight angle cut off the end so that I
have<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.680> little<00:00:41.460> bit<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.790> wedge<00:00:42.000> coming<00:00:42.420> down

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
have a little bit of a wedge coming down

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.819 
have a little bit of a wedge coming down
on<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> tire<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.020> I'm<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.410> hitting<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
on the tire and I'm not hitting the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:57.590 
on the tire and I'm not hitting the
whole<00:00:43.980> thing<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> flat<00:00:44.730> piece<00:00:56.600> there

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
whole thing with a flat piece there

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.240 
whole thing with a flat piece there
we've<00:00:57.720> got<00:00:57.780> our<00:00:58.050> angle<00:00:58.380> dead<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.980> only<00:00:59.100> about

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
we've got our angle dead it's only about

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
we've got our angle dead it's only about
an<00:00:59.489> inch<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.880> a<00:00:59.910> half<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.540> it<00:01:00.690> really<00:01:00.840> doesn't

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
an inch and a half so it really doesn't

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.110 
an inch and a half so it really doesn't
need<00:01:01.200> to<00:01:01.380> be<00:01:01.500> shaped<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.280> gonna<00:01:02.460> hit<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.880> rim

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
need to be shaped it's gonna hit the rim

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.990 
need to be shaped it's gonna hit the rim
a<00:01:03.360> 17<00:01:04.140> inch<00:01:04.290> rim<00:01:04.530> or<00:01:04.710> 19<00:01:05.009> inch<00:01:05.159> rim<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.610> fine

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
a 17 inch rim or 19 inch rim just fine

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.420 
a 17 inch rim or 19 inch rim just fine
but<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:06.719> do<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.110> sand<00:01:07.380> off<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.619> edges<00:01:07.829> so

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
but we do want to sand off the edges so

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.180 
but we do want to sand off the edges so
we<00:01:08.549> don't<00:01:08.700> get<00:01:08.820> any<00:01:08.880> chipping<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:09.930> damage<00:01:10.560> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the tires and come down I could break

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.260 
the tires and come down I could break
out<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> sander<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.700> everything<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.180> this

so<00:01:19.799> I'm<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.610> use<00:01:20.729> one<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.909> these

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
so I'm just going to use one of these

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
so I'm just going to use one of these
little<00:01:21.090> paths<00:01:21.540> you're<00:01:22.380> seeing<00:01:22.650> these<00:01:22.770> it's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
little paths you're seeing these it's

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.070 
little paths you're seeing these it's
like<00:01:23.190> a<00:01:23.220> foam<00:01:23.520> pad<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.510> can<00:01:24.630> use<00:01:24.690> it<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.049> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
like a foam pad you can use it as a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.750 
like a foam pad you can use it as a
block<00:01:25.350> senator<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.130> gonna<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.369> perfect

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
block senator it's gonna be perfect

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.950 
block senator it's gonna be perfect
because<00:01:26.850> we're<00:01:27.060> working<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.420> real<00:01:27.690> soft

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
because we're working with real soft

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.109 
because we're working with real soft
wood<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.680> essentially<00:01:29.070> done<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.909> could

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
wood I'm essentially done you could

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.840 
wood I'm essentially done you could
experiment<00:01:30.780> by<00:01:31.130> rolling<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:32.310> vinyl

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
experiment by rolling a little vinyl

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.700 
experiment by rolling a little vinyl
tape<00:01:33.090> over<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.840> end<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.200> really<00:01:34.229> want<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
tape over the end if you really want to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.679 
tape over the end if you really want to
be<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.520> anal<00:01:35.850> about<00:01:35.939> protecting<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
be you know anal about protecting the
