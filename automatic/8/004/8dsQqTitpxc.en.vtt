00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 ah 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.080
 Today we cook roasted milk with carlos 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.240
 pascal and electrolux hello we are here 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.760
 to make a recipe today very 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.100
 simple and very rich also a dessert 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.290
 traditional roasted milk 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.990
 We will make this recipe in two steps 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.660
 simple the first to make a candy 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.750
 in this pan we have for that a 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.599
 cup of sugar over medium heat slowly 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.780
 until it becomes a very liquid 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.000
 viscous the second step here we have a 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.489
 cinnamon sugar cup a little bit of 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.129
 vanilla essence six whole eggs 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.590
 a liter of milk and all these 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.350
 ingredients we are going to mix in this 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.420
 container quietly so as not 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.220
 drop foam and that finally what 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.750
 important is that it chooses sugar well 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.129
 once all the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.040
 mixed ingredients we can continue 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.500
 with the recipe we are going to light our 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.170
 induction plate electrolux to a fire 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.430
 medium we will leave it in this case to number 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.320
 7 let's put the cup of sugar in 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.460
 we will try to cover all the 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.880
 surface of our pan 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.030
 and now we continue mixing the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.650
 ingredients as we talked we had the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.290
 sugar we will also add 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.990
 the whole milk eggs as we said 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.450
 previously a liter of essence of 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.510
 vanilla some droplets remember that it is 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.510
 a pretty powerful flavor a twig of 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.320
 cinnamon we will begin to mix the 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.030
 ingredients and we will beat in a way 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.500
 slowly slow 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.080
 first of all we do not want to publish the 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.530
 content and second that we're not going to 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.380
 get out foam is worth the idea of ​​this is 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.010
 beat until the eggs are well 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.150
 dissolved over all the sugar once 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.360
 that we have this mixture already completely 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:05.020
 dissolved let's continue with this recipe 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.019
 putting it in its source 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.560
 good as we see here we already have our 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:14.709
 Ready candy has to have that color 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.560
 a little brown that is bright 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.170
 especially and that already has that texture 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.090
 liquid when we already have the candy 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.239
 then what we will do is put it in the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.780
 bottom of the container where then we go to 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.879
 pour our mixture as it we 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.739
 the entire surface of our container 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.140
 with the candy well extended what 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.920
 we do now is add the mixture that 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.920
 we did previously 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.760
 cooking function ok turbo plus steam 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.540
 we go down ok 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.450
 we fill our container with water 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.280
 has an indicator to tell us when 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.020
 be ready 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.760
 a little more 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.550
 we have already loaded our steam oven 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.440
 with liquid in this container that 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.530
 we have here we have it previously 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.150
 heated to 175 degrees and as you see these 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.700
 figurines here will indicate that 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.820
 both the turbo and the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.890
 steam function we see how the 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.170
 wonderful steam 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.290
 and now very carefully that we do not 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.910
 go to get liquid in our dessert 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.810
 let's put the container 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.810
 in the oven 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.840
 Well, it has been 45 minutes 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.709
 that we have put here our milk 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.030
 roasted and we can remove it with much 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.030
 beware that this embraces 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:09.760
 what we are going to do now is leave it 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.380
 rest, we remove it from the water 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.300
 approximately 15 minutes so that 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.040
 release the fund well and we can 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.700
 plating 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:24.220
 ok let's unmold then the edges 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.220
 of the surface with a lace 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:33.050
 we take a tray enough 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.050
 big and as if this were an omelet 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:39.879
 we turn to see how the result 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.950
 well let's see how it is 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:49.470
 our dessert with the help of a 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:52.320
 spatula let's cut it another sky in 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.500
 rations and 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.289
 we will see how 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.490
 First 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:04.120
 dessert and we take advantage of this candy 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.120
 for 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.599
 some little flavor too 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.370
 and there is now the most difficult thing to prove it 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.210
 It's delicious 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.819
