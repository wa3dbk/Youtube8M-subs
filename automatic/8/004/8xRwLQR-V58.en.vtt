00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
started as a little twig in the middle

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.850 
started as a little twig in the middle
and<00:00:50.090> then<00:00:51.090> by<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.809> next<00:00:52.110> year<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.410> had<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and then by the next year it had all the

and then by the next year it had all the
arms<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.699> out<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.000> every<00:00:54.180> direction<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.870> on

arms going out in every direction and on
the<00:00:55.949> year<00:00:56.370> after<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:57.170> continued<00:00:58.170> those

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the year after that it continued those

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.020 
the year after that it continued those
arms<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.219> past<00:00:59.489> winter

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
arms and this past winter

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.460 
arms and this past winter
it<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.609> it<00:01:02.609> bloomed<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:06.110> some<00:01:07.110> ants

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470

stealing nectar or something there and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.940 
stealing nectar or something there and
all<00:01:09.720> people<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.200> know<00:01:10.400> back<00:01:11.400> there<00:01:11.640> but<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
all people you know back there but I

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
all people you know back there but I
discovered<00:01:13.950> honeybees<00:01:14.520> actually<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.180> this

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
discovered honeybees actually like this

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.200 
discovered honeybees actually like this
as<00:01:15.600> an<00:01:15.780> early<00:01:16.049> pollen<00:01:16.560> source<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.580> there<00:01:18.090> was<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
as an early pollen source so there was a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.899 
as an early pollen source so there was a
benefit<00:01:18.570> right<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.549> I'm<00:01:20.549> read<00:01:20.759> online

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
benefit right there and I'm read online

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.999 
benefit right there and I'm read online
that<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.390> tree<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.110> upwards<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.740> maybe

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
that this tree can get upwards of maybe

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.740 
that this tree can get upwards of maybe
30<00:01:23.880> feet<00:01:24.150> maximum<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.759> think<00:01:26.759> 15<00:01:27.150> feet<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.570> more

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
30 feet maximum I think 15 feet is more

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
30 feet maximum I think 15 feet is more
common<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:30.720> know<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.900> can't<00:01:31.439> wait<00:01:31.590> for

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
common but you know I can't wait for

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.630 
common but you know I can't wait for
next<00:01:31.979> year's<00:01:32.220> flowers<00:01:33.030> they're<00:01:33.680> also<00:01:34.680> it's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
