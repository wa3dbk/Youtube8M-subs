00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:23.080
 colder 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.410
 very shared and could tell how 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.260
 surprise whoever you want 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.100
 so we talk more 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.880
 Our ingredients are mold bread 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.830
 the side of your preference in this case 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.670
 I'm going to do with the chocolate side 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.070
 aluminum foil and flour to make hot 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.130
 cakes or pancreas depending on how you know it 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.220
 in your country in this case mine comes in 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.260
 boat and I just have to add milk but 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.930
 that already depends on the instructions of 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.470
 your country on the other hand let's put the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.870
 ice cream on a slice of bread 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.030
 we're going to close it with another slice and 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.760
 with the same thing we are going to do with our 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.010
 own hands a circle so that we 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.110
 there's a little dow ball we have to do 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.360
 very fast before it melts 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.210
 the ice cream once the little ball is made 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.510
 the next thing will be to put it on paper 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.900
 aluminum we wrap it very well what 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.510
 we do this very quickly so that with 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.100
 our heat from our hands is not 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.350
 defrost the ice cream once the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.560
 let's put it back in the freezer 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.320
 at least two hours or the next day 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.179
 I recommend it much better in a mold 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.820
 let's put our jose flour that 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.370
 As I told you, mine only needs 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.670
 milk the new pretty well and ready 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.790
 I have my dough to bathe my balls 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.750
 as you are seeing them, we submerge them 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.560
 we bathed perfectly well in that flour 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.380
 and in a big pot we're going to put 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.080
 abundant oil sunflower oil and 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.239
 let's leave it after 30 seconds of 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.330
 each side because how are you seeing 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.340
 changes the color very quickly and only 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.580
 we need that we stay know each other 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.940
 so beautiful success will decorate a 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.239
 tray or on the plate that you go to 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.640
 put in this case I decided to put them in 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.150
 a 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.780
 now I put all three together and I'm going to 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.000
 decorate with more chocolate and the truth is 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.819
 that dessert is exquisite 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.280
 it's amazing how you see now they 're going to see 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:10.150
 the effect that has how we can fry 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.850
 something and not become not melt more 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.970
 good and ready and until the presentation 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.310
 now they will see how it did not melt and 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.440
 we still have the chocolate side 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.360
 inside skeletal I hope you have them 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.450

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.730
