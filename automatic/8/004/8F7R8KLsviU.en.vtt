00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
what's happening I move you a little

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.390 
what's happening I move you a little
closer<00:01:49.140> maybe

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
closer maybe

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.320 
closer maybe
there<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.510> go<00:01:51.630> let's<00:01:52.080> try<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.440> and<00:01:53.000> I'll<00:01:54.000> get

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
there we go let's try that and I'll get

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.270 
there we go let's try that and I'll get
two<00:01:54.450> packets<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.900> jars

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.340 

so<00:01:58.940> what<00:01:59.090> I've<00:01:59.210> been<00:01:59.240> doing<00:01:59.510> in<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.750> past<00:01:59.840> is

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
so what I've been doing in the past is

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.020 
so what I've been doing in the past is
just<00:02:01.330> packing<00:02:02.330> these<00:02:02.479> jars<00:02:02.950> this<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.130> what's

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
just packing these jars this is what's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.430 
just packing these jars this is what's
called<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.330> raw<00:02:05.540> pack<00:02:05.840> because<00:02:06.080> I<00:02:06.260> haven't

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
called a raw pack because I haven't

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.010 
called a raw pack because I haven't
cooked<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.799> meat<00:02:06.950> yet<00:02:07.509> so<00:02:08.509> we'll<00:02:08.660> just<00:02:08.690> pack

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
cooked the meat yet so we'll just pack

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.890 
cooked the meat yet so we'll just pack
them<00:02:09.170> in<00:02:09.319> nice<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.530> tight<00:02:10.390> leaving<00:02:11.390> about<00:02:11.750> an

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
them in nice and tight leaving about an

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.240 
them in nice and tight leaving about an
ancient<00:02:12.230> headspace

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.880 

so

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
so

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.400 
so
back<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.640> next<00:02:19.850> one

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.440 

now<00:02:25.920> I'll<00:02:26.040> have<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.340> let<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.790> guys<00:02:27.030> know<00:02:27.270> that

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
now I'll have to let you guys know that

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.390 
now I'll have to let you guys know that
I've<00:02:27.540> never<00:02:27.750> Rob<00:02:28.290> packed<00:02:28.590> pork<00:02:28.950> before<00:02:29.280> I've

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
I've never Rob packed pork before I've

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.830 
I've never Rob packed pork before I've
done<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.670> with<00:02:29.760> beef<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.270> turns<00:02:30.480> out<00:02:30.660> great

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
done it with beef and it turns out great

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.250 
done it with beef and it turns out great
I'm<00:02:31.830> working<00:02:32.610> off<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.730> assumption<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.390> cork

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
I'm working off the assumption that cork

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.610 
I'm working off the assumption that cork
will<00:02:34.410> be<00:02:34.760> will<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:35.790> just<00:02:36.150> as<00:02:36.270> easy<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:37.380> it'll

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
will be will be just as easy and it'll

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.210 
will be will be just as easy and it'll
work<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.890> same<00:02:38.040> way

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220
