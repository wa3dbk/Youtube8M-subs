00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:13.633
 It was a long trip. 

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.014
 But I have not arrived in Japan yet, so I will go! 

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:17.443
 Vladimir, are you all right? 

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:19.792
 Of course it's alright! 

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:23.847
 It takes 12 hours to get to Japan, but it's okay. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.190
 I'm locked in an airplane for about 12 hours, but it's okay. I'm ready to go 

00:00:27.253 --> 00:00:31.253
 I have not slept at all yet! ! 

00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:33.483
 Not sleep yet! ! 

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:37.585
 These three guys are cool. 

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:43.819
 I want to buy coffee, but please tell me as I do not know how to say in English. 

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:45.895
 I WANT TO BUY A COFFEE 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:47.999
 Great! 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 There are still 11 hours 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.130
 I'm resting but I'm still tired 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.830
 I will do various things in the plane. Watch movies, talk, and have a good time. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.300
 I have already prepared! 

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:09.569
 I only slept a little to be able to become local standard time 

00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:13.671
 I want to sleep, so I go to bed in a plane. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 I have already prepared. It's okay! 

00:01:16.177 --> 00:01:20.177
 I am pleased. I want to travel a long time. 

00:01:20.307 --> 00:01:26.307
 I want to win, so I will practice again when I get to Japan. 

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.213
 As I was in the room with Borges, I learned a little Japanese. 

00:01:30.617 --> 00:01:35.617
 But what I really want to remember is how to celebrate victory in Japanese 

00:01:36.548 --> 00:01:39.548
 Because I do not understand Japanese at all 

00:01:40.727 --> 00:01:45.730
 Yesterday I was really sleepy! 

00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:48.730
 Have you prepared? 

00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:52.490
 Of course, I prepared! 

00:01:52.588 --> 00:01:56.590
 I was told that I should not sleep, but I slept for about 3 hours 

00:01:56.792 --> 00:01:58.790
 Have you prepared? 

00:01:59.796 --> 00:02:04.800
 He does not want to be shot! I'm running away from the camera. 

00:02:06.327 --> 00:02:08.330
 I wanted to run away, but I couldn't. 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:14.130
 I only slept for 3 hours, still sleepy. But preparation is OK! 

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:22.140
 I want to win a title! I pray for that every day! 

00:02:22.268 --> 00:02:24.270
 So what did you do? Was there anything in the luggage? 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.770
 Yes! I was able to open my package. But there was only football in that. 

00:02:32.114 --> 00:02:38.310
 The goal is the club world cup! It's a long journey, but it can't be helped. Because we want to play a match, we have to go beyond such problems. 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.410
 I will do my best! 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 I have not slept at all tonight. Because young players played and talked. I could not go to bed. 

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:50.420
 But I'm fine. It's alright because I sleep in the plane. 

00:02:50.547 --> 00:02:51.950
 How are you? 

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:54.050
 I'm fine! Next is Nagoya. 

00:02:56.053 --> 00:02:58.050
 It's Nagoya, right? 

00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:01.060
 I'm going! 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.060
 Wait a second. I'm taking pictures 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.170
 I will also take a video 

00:03:17.474 --> 00:03:19.470
 no problem! 

00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:31.840
 Was the trip alright? 

00:03:31.936 --> 00:03:33.940
 It was fine! 

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:44.970
 He is the son of Koukinha. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 I'm sleepy, but I'm fine! 

00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:54.580
 This guy is my memory! 

00:03:55.613 --> 00:03:59.610
 Don't worry because I will be back in Santos!
