hi<00:00:04.910> my<00:00:05.180> name<00:00:05.359> is<00:00:05.390> Janie<00:00:05.750> Hodgkins<00:00:06.439> I'm<00:00:06.529> a

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:06.590 
hi my name is Janie Hodgkins I'm a

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.660 
hi my name is Janie Hodgkins I'm a
registered<00:00:06.830> nurse

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
registered nurse

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.180 
registered nurse
my<00:00:08.059> background<00:00:08.570> is<00:00:08.660> on<00:00:08.690> oncology<00:00:08.930> and<00:00:09.710> Hospice

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
my background is on oncology and Hospice

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.740 
my background is on oncology and Hospice
and<00:00:10.430> the<00:00:10.580> reason<00:00:10.879> I<00:00:10.969> was<00:00:11.090> attracted<00:00:11.600> to<00:00:11.629> that

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
and the reason I was attracted to that

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.660 
and the reason I was attracted to that
was<00:00:12.080> because<00:00:12.410> it<00:00:12.530> was<00:00:12.680> looking<00:00:13.160> at<00:00:13.490> people

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
was because it was looking at people

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.599 
was because it was looking at people
from<00:00:14.119> a<00:00:14.299> holistic<00:00:14.869> approach<00:00:14.990> it<00:00:15.949> led<00:00:16.160> me<00:00:16.190> into

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
from a holistic approach it led me into

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.730 
from a holistic approach it led me into
bringing<00:00:16.789> integration<00:00:17.390> therapy<00:00:17.740> partly

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
bringing integration therapy partly

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.259 
bringing integration therapy partly
because<00:00:18.920> I<00:00:19.190> was<00:00:19.460> interested<00:00:19.820> in<00:00:20.029> the<00:00:20.150> whole

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:20.269 
because I was interested in the whole

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.450 
because I was interested in the whole
person<00:00:20.720> and<00:00:20.929> partly<00:00:21.560> because<00:00:21.710> I<00:00:21.890> had<00:00:22.130> a<00:00:22.160> set<00:00:22.429> of

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
person and partly because I had a set of

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.429 
person and partly because I had a set of
twins<00:00:22.580> who<00:00:22.970> had<00:00:23.150> been<00:00:23.300> prematurely<00:00:23.810> born<00:00:24.169> and

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
twins who had been prematurely born and

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.189 
twins who had been prematurely born and
it<00:00:24.890> had<00:00:25.070> some<00:00:25.339> effects<00:00:25.820> from<00:00:26.029> that<00:00:26.269> and<00:00:26.539> brain

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
it had some effects from that and brain

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.480 
it had some effects from that and brain
integration<00:00:27.710> therapy<00:00:28.099> helped<00:00:28.369> them

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
integration therapy helped them

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.269 
integration therapy helped them
tremendously<00:00:29.060> in<00:00:29.359> school<00:00:29.689> in<00:00:29.960> life<00:00:30.169> and<00:00:30.529> I

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
tremendously in school in life and I

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.679 
tremendously in school in life and I
then<00:00:31.640> myself<00:00:31.880> went<00:00:32.329> through<00:00:32.480> brain

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
then myself went through brain

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.300 
then myself went through brain
integration<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:33.500> found<00:00:33.739> that<00:00:33.860> it<00:00:33.980> helped<00:00:34.220> me

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
integration and found that it helped me

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.410 
integration and found that it helped me
a<00:00:34.340> great<00:00:34.460> deal

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
a great deal

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.960 
a great deal
brain<00:00:36.170> integration<00:00:36.710> started<00:00:37.190> about<00:00:37.370> 50<00:00:37.730> years

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
brain integration started about 50 years

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.910 
brain integration started about 50 years
ago<00:00:38.120> by<00:00:38.480> a<00:00:38.510> couple<00:00:38.840> doctors<00:00:39.080> who<00:00:39.440> were<00:00:39.560> medical

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
ago by a couple doctors who were medical

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.640 
ago by a couple doctors who were medical
doctors<00:00:40.310> dr.<00:00:40.670> Doleman<00:00:41.060> and<00:00:41.240> an<00:00:41.930> educator<00:00:42.410> dr.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
doctors dr. Doleman and an educator dr.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.760 
doctors dr. Doleman and an educator dr.
Delicato<00:00:43.310> they<00:00:44.320> determined<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:45.470> people

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
Delicato they determined that people

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.380 
Delicato they determined that people
that<00:00:46.010> had<00:00:46.100> had<00:00:46.130> head<00:00:46.550> injuries<00:00:46.880> whether<00:00:47.240> it

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
that had had head injuries whether it

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.130 
that had had head injuries whether it
was<00:00:47.540> via<00:00:47.990> stroke<00:00:48.440> or<00:00:49.270> accidents<00:00:50.270> they<00:00:50.780> wanted

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
was via stroke or accidents they wanted

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.660 
was via stroke or accidents they wanted
to<00:00:51.230> find<00:00:51.440> out<00:00:51.590> how<00:00:51.860> they<00:00:52.040> could<00:00:52.100> relearn

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
to find out how they could relearn

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.790 
to find out how they could relearn
activities<00:00:53.300> they<00:00:53.480> had<00:00:53.660> lost<00:00:53.870> what<00:00:54.680> they

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
activities they had lost what they

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.290 
activities they had lost what they
determined<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.340> do<00:00:55.490> is<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.760> find<00:00:55.940> out<00:00:56.120> how

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
determined to do is to find out how

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.630 
determined to do is to find out how
infants<00:00:56.900> had<00:00:57.170> learned<00:00:57.440> these<00:00:57.620> activities<00:00:58.340> and

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
infants had learned these activities and

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.280 
infants had learned these activities and
they<00:00:59.090> found<00:00:59.300> out<00:00:59.570> that<00:00:59.600> they<00:00:59.840> learned<00:01:00.080> them

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
they found out that they learned them

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.290 
they found out that they learned them
through<00:01:00.530> physical<00:01:01.010> movement<00:01:01.460> that<00:01:01.940> children

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
through physical movement that children

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.179 
through physical movement that children
weren't<00:01:02.450> actually<00:01:03.020> born<00:01:03.290> wired<00:01:03.650> for<00:01:04.040> these

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
weren't actually born wired for these

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.340 
weren't actually born wired for these
activities<00:01:04.549> but<00:01:05.269> they<00:01:05.420> became<00:01:05.780> plugged<00:01:06.140> in

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
activities but they became plugged in

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.319 
activities but they became plugged in
through<00:01:06.560> physical<00:01:07.100> movement<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:07.670> what<00:01:08.210> we

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
through physical movement and what we

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.719 
through physical movement and what we
find<00:01:08.509> out<00:01:08.749> is<00:01:08.929> that<00:01:09.039> movement<00:01:10.039> has<00:01:10.369> a<00:01:10.399> lot<00:01:10.700> to

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
find out is that movement has a lot to

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.120 
find out is that movement has a lot to
do<00:01:11.030> with<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.299> precursor<00:01:11.810> for<00:01:11.840> learning<00:01:12.409> these

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
do with the precursor for learning these

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.069 
do with the precursor for learning these
doctors<00:01:13.640> went<00:01:13.850> across<00:01:14.119> all<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.570> continents

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
doctors went across all the continents

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.380 
doctors went across all the continents
and<00:01:15.200> looked<00:01:15.469> at<00:01:15.590> infants<00:01:16.130> crawling<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:16.909> they

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
and looked at infants crawling and they

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.880 
and looked at infants crawling and they
mapped<00:01:17.689> out<00:01:17.929> their<00:01:18.140> brain<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.560> they<00:01:18.619> found

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
mapped out their brain and they found

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.559 
mapped out their brain and they found
out<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.159> when<00:01:19.520> they<00:01:19.700> did<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.060> movement<00:01:20.479> of

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
out that when they did the movement of

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:22.959 
out that when they did the movement of
crawling<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.170> looking<00:01:21.979> up<00:01:22.219> that<00:01:22.759> they<00:01:22.909> were

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
crawling and looking up that they were

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:24.700 
crawling and looking up that they were
stimulating<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:23.810> brain<00:01:23.929> centers<00:01:24.409> that<00:01:24.560> had

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
stimulating the brain centers that had

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.499 
stimulating the brain centers that had
to<00:01:24.890> do<00:01:25.009> with<00:01:25.189> vision<00:01:25.429> and<00:01:25.789> that<00:01:26.240> when<00:01:26.420> they

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
to do with vision and that when they

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.120 
to do with vision and that when they
would<00:01:26.659> turn<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:27.079> the<00:01:27.109> side<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.649> listen<00:01:27.979> to

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
would turn to the side to listen to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.950 
would turn to the side to listen to
their<00:01:28.249> parents<00:01:28.819> that<00:01:29.210> they<00:01:29.390> were<00:01:29.450> actually

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
their parents that they were actually

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.510 
their parents that they were actually
stimulating<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.710> brain<00:01:30.859> centers<00:01:31.340> for

stimulating the brain centers for
auditory<00:01:31.969> processing<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:33.439> as<00:01:33.619> kids

auditory processing and that as kids

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.529 
auditory processing and that as kids
will<00:01:34.100> do<00:01:34.280> creeping<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.030> crawling<00:01:35.090> and

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
will do creeping and crawling and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.209 
will do creeping and crawling and
picking<00:01:35.929> things<00:01:36.139> up<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.619> putting<00:01:36.710> them<00:01:37.130> in

adult they were able to get the adult to

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.129 
adult they were able to get the adult to
relearn<00:01:49.639> some<00:01:49.969> of<00:01:50.119> these<00:01:50.209> activities<00:01:50.899> of

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:51.139 
relearn some of these activities of

brain<00:03:34.130> learners<00:03:34.520> are<00:03:34.730> they<00:03:34.880> more<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.180> a

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
brain learners are they more of a

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.860 
brain learners are they more of a
kinesthetic<00:03:35.840> or<00:03:36.380> moving<00:03:37.160> kind<00:03:37.430> of<00:03:37.550> a<00:03:37.610> learner

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
kinesthetic or moving kind of a learner

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.720 
kinesthetic or moving kind of a learner
and<00:03:38.870> then<00:03:39.110> we<00:03:39.260> also<00:03:39.470> do<00:03:39.740> a<00:03:39.770> lot<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.100> Education

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
and then we also do a lot of Education

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.780 
and then we also do a lot of Education
like<00:03:41.240> I'm<00:03:41.450> doing<00:03:41.780> now<00:03:41.900> with<00:03:42.110> you<00:03:42.380> to<00:03:43.070> bring

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
like I'm doing now with you to bring

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.180 
like I'm doing now with you to bring
them<00:03:43.970> into<00:03:44.150> what<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:45.080> brain<00:03:45.320> looks<00:03:45.350> like<00:03:45.770> and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
them into what the brain looks like and

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.280 
them into what the brain looks like and
how<00:03:46.640> we<00:03:46.700> can<00:03:47.060> best<00:03:47.300> get<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.930> work<00:03:48.080> more

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
how we can best get that to work more

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.110 
how we can best get that to work more
efficiently<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:49.070> really<00:03:49.760> get<00:03:49.940> them<00:03:50.090> to

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
efficiently and really get them to

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.780 
efficiently and really get them to
celebrate<00:03:50.750> how<00:03:50.930> they<00:03:51.230> are<00:03:51.500> wired<00:03:51.800> for<00:03:52.220> their

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
celebrate how they are wired for their

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.430 
celebrate how they are wired for their
brain<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.180> type<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:53.660> how<00:03:53.750> they<00:03:53.930> learn<00:03:54.170> and

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
brain and type and how they learn and

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.130 
brain and type and how they learn and
then<00:03:55.250> we<00:03:55.430> meet<00:03:55.610> for<00:03:55.880> ten<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.270> eleven<00:03:56.630> sessions

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
then we meet for ten to eleven sessions

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.570 
then we meet for ten to eleven sessions
with<00:03:57.830> a<00:03:58.040> certain<00:03:58.850> category<00:03:59.480> of<00:04:00.140> activity<00:04:00.950> in

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
with a certain category of activity in

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.970 
with a certain category of activity in
mind<00:04:01.820> perhaps<00:04:02.780> we're<00:04:02.990> working<00:04:03.320> in<00:04:03.440> eyes<00:04:03.620> or

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
mind perhaps we're working in eyes or

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.640 
mind perhaps we're working in eyes or
ears<00:04:04.310> or<00:04:04.580> hand-eye<00:04:05.090> coordination<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.990> then

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
ears or hand-eye coordination and then

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.620 
ears or hand-eye coordination and then
we<00:04:06.860> do<00:04:07.040> an<00:04:07.190> actual<00:04:07.520> reap<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.880> turning<00:04:08.180> session

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
we do an actual reap a turning session

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.780 
we do an actual reap a turning session
and<00:04:08.840> then<00:04:09.260> they<00:04:09.410> go<00:04:09.590> home<00:04:09.830> and<00:04:09.890> they<00:04:10.430> do<00:04:10.490> the

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
and then they go home and they do the

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.720 
and then they go home and they do the
exercises<00:04:11.410> that<00:04:12.410> will<00:04:12.560> then<00:04:12.770> keep<00:04:13.190> what<00:04:13.490> we've

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
exercises that will then keep what we've

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.120 
exercises that will then keep what we've
done<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.360> getting<00:04:14.780> those<00:04:15.200> dendrites<00:04:15.590> in<00:04:16.010> the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
done and getting those dendrites in the

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.420 
done and getting those dendrites in the
brain<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.520> form<00:04:16.790> and<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.270> wire<00:04:17.930> together<00:04:18.530> they

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
brain to form and to wire together they

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.490 
brain to form and to wire together they
exercises<00:04:20.359> they<00:04:20.510> do<00:04:20.570> at<00:04:20.780> home<00:04:20.810> will<00:04:21.109> then<00:04:21.230> keep

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
exercises they do at home will then keep

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.970 
exercises they do at home will then keep
them<00:04:22.420> concrete<00:04:23.420> and<00:04:23.690> gel<00:04:24.080> then<00:04:24.320> what<00:04:24.860> do<00:04:24.920> I

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
them concrete and gel then what do I

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.220 
them concrete and gel then what do I
mean<00:04:25.310> by<00:04:25.370> getting<00:04:25.790> something<00:04:26.090> plugged<00:04:26.540> in<00:04:26.960> or

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
mean by getting something plugged in or

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.880 
mean by getting something plugged in or
wired

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
wired

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.980 
wired
well<00:04:28.310> we're<00:04:28.490> made<00:04:28.700> up<00:04:28.880> essentially<00:04:29.540> of<00:04:29.720> water

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
well we're made up essentially of water

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.910 
well we're made up essentially of water
and<00:04:30.350> it

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
and it

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.160 
and it
electricity<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:31.700> our<00:04:32.060> brain<00:04:32.360> has<00:04:32.780> all<00:04:33.140> of

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
electricity and our brain has all of

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.050 
electricity and our brain has all of
these<00:04:33.470> neuron<00:04:34.040> cells<00:04:34.460> that<00:04:34.760> you're<00:04:34.880> going<00:04:35.030> to

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
these neuron cells that you're going to

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.970 
these neuron cells that you're going to
be<00:04:35.180> looking<00:04:35.330> at<00:04:35.630> pictures<00:04:36.080> of<00:04:36.110> in<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.650> moment

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
be looking at pictures of in a moment

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.520 
be looking at pictures of in a moment
and<00:04:37.130> those<00:04:37.790> neuron<00:04:38.270> cells<00:04:38.660> have<00:04:38.960> dendrites

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
and those neuron cells have dendrites

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.230 
and those neuron cells have dendrites
that<00:04:39.770> look<00:04:39.920> like<00:04:40.070> little<00:04:40.280> spiders<00:04:40.880> or<00:04:41.060> little

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
that look like little spiders or little

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.570 
that look like little spiders or little
fingers<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:41.840> they<00:04:42.320> connect<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:43.070> you

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
fingers and they connect and you

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.130 
fingers and they connect and you
literally<00:04:44.000> have<00:04:44.330> trillions<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:45.050> trillions

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
literally have trillions and trillions

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.070 
literally have trillions and trillions
of<00:04:45.680> those<00:04:45.890> in<00:04:46.160> your<00:04:46.430> brain<00:04:46.760> that<00:04:47.450> connect<00:04:47.900> and

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
of those in your brain that connect and

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.290 
of those in your brain that connect and
can<00:04:48.320> make<00:04:48.530> tens<00:04:49.190> of<00:04:49.370> thousands<00:04:49.790> connections

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
can make tens of thousands connections

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.560 
can make tens of thousands connections
and<00:04:50.770> when<00:04:51.770> they<00:04:52.010> when<00:04:52.280> that<00:04:52.310> happens<00:04:52.940> signals

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
and when they when that happens signals

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.150 
and when they when that happens signals
can<00:04:53.810> then<00:04:53.960> efficiently<00:04:54.590> go<00:04:54.770> through<00:04:55.040> the

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
can then efficiently go through the

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.120 
can then efficiently go through the
brain<00:04:55.400> electrically<00:04:56.300> in<00:04:56.510> order<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.290> talk<00:04:57.560> it's

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
brain electrically in order to talk it's

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.080 
brain electrically in order to talk it's
kind<00:04:58.430> of<00:04:58.520> like<00:04:58.700> if<00:04:58.850> you<00:04:58.880> were<00:04:58.970> playing

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
kind of like if you were playing

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.780 
kind of like if you were playing
telephone<00:04:59.690> in<00:05:00.020> school<00:05:00.350> and<00:05:00.620> whispering<00:05:01.490> along

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
telephone in school and whispering along

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.340 
telephone in school and whispering along
the<00:05:01.940> line<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.420> seeing<00:05:02.690> if<00:05:02.810> you<00:05:02.900> could<00:05:03.050> get<00:05:03.200> the

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
the line and seeing if you could get the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.200 
the line and seeing if you could get the
right<00:05:03.500> information<00:05:03.740> out<00:05:04.400> at<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.670> end<00:05:04.910> if

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
right information out at the end if

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.180 
right information out at the end if
there's<00:05:05.780> something<00:05:06.260> that<00:05:06.290> becomes<00:05:06.890> in

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
there's something that becomes in

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.950 
there's something that becomes in
between<00:05:07.550> if<00:05:07.760> maybe<00:05:07.910> someone<00:05:08.270> doesn't<00:05:08.690> spread

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
between if maybe someone doesn't spread

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.200 
between if maybe someone doesn't spread
the<00:05:09.140> information<00:05:09.410> correctly<00:05:10.280> then<00:05:10.790> you<00:05:11.000> have

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
the information correctly then you have

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.150 
the information correctly then you have
a<00:05:11.240> problem<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:11.870> that's<00:05:12.410> what<00:05:12.620> happens<00:05:12.950> when

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
a problem and that's what happens when

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.630 
a problem and that's what happens when
we<00:05:13.730> run<00:05:13.790> plugged<00:05:14.420> or<00:05:14.750> not<00:05:14.960> wired<00:05:15.260> correctly

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
we run plugged or not wired correctly

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.420 
we run plugged or not wired correctly
for<00:05:16.640> physical<00:05:17.330> movement<00:05:17.840> or<00:05:18.020> for<00:05:18.530> activities

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
for physical movement or for activities

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.790 
for physical movement or for activities
such<00:05:19.460> as<00:05:19.610> reading<00:05:19.880> writing<00:05:20.030> and<00:05:20.390> arithmetic

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
such as reading writing and arithmetic

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.920 
such as reading writing and arithmetic
let<00:05:21.800> me<00:05:21.890> give<00:05:22.070> you<00:05:22.190> an<00:05:22.310> example<00:05:22.430> if<00:05:23.330> I<00:05:23.510> had<00:05:23.780> you

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
let me give you an example if I had you

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.770 
let me give you an example if I had you
turn<00:05:24.200> on<00:05:24.350> this<00:05:24.590> little<00:05:24.800> light<00:05:25.660> you<00:05:26.660> would

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
turn on this little light you would

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.290 
turn on this little light you would
expect<00:05:27.200> the<00:05:27.350> light<00:05:27.530> to<00:05:27.740> come<00:05:27.860> on<00:05:28.040> if<00:05:28.340> for<00:05:29.270> some

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
expect the light to come on if for some

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.970 
expect the light to come on if for some
reason<00:05:29.780> when<00:05:29.900> you<00:05:29.930> turned<00:05:30.260> it<00:05:30.380> on<00:05:30.470> nothing

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
reason when you turned it on nothing

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.490 
reason when you turned it on nothing
happened<00:05:31.460> then<00:05:32.000> you<00:05:32.180> might<00:05:32.360> wonder<00:05:32.630> well<00:05:33.200> is

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
happened then you might wonder well is

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.220 
happened then you might wonder well is
it<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.580> light<00:05:34.760> bulb<00:05:35.000> burned<00:05:35.120> out<00:05:35.390> is<00:05:35.900> there<00:05:36.200> a

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
it the light bulb burned out is there a

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.320 
it the light bulb burned out is there a
problem<00:05:36.890> with<00:05:37.100> our<00:05:37.250> source<00:05:37.700> of<00:05:37.910> electricity

problem with our source of electricity

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330 
problem with our source of electricity
but<00:05:39.080> you<00:05:39.260> wouldn't<00:05:39.560> look<00:05:39.650> at<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:39.830> light<00:05:40.100> and

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
but you wouldn't look at the light and

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.670 
but you wouldn't look at the light and
say<00:05:40.580> you're<00:05:41.060> a<00:05:41.090> stupid<00:05:41.540> light<00:05:41.720> it<00:05:42.050> has<00:05:42.230> nothing

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
say you're a stupid light it has nothing

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.290 
say you're a stupid light it has nothing
to<00:05:42.710> do<00:05:42.920> with<00:05:43.040> the<00:05:43.190> lights<00:05:43.370> intelligence<00:05:44.090> and

to do with the lights intelligence and

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.730 
to do with the lights intelligence and
that's<00:05:44.720> the<00:05:44.930> same<00:05:45.110> thing<00:05:45.170> with<00:05:45.470> brain

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
that's the same thing with brain

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.860 
that's the same thing with brain
integration<00:05:46.250> therapy<00:05:46.430> this<00:05:47.090> has<00:05:47.420> nothing<00:05:47.840> to

there's<00:05:54.920> actually<00:05:55.370> a<00:05:55.400> lot<00:05:55.670> of<00:05:55.700> research<00:05:56.030> that

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
there's actually a lot of research that

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.410 
there's actually a lot of research that
shows<00:05:56.510> that<00:05:56.780> people<00:05:57.320> like<00:05:57.530> Thomas<00:05:58.010> Edison

and they actually embrace that and use

in<00:06:19.520> understanding<00:06:20.000> brain<00:06:20.210> integration<00:06:20.810> is

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
in understanding brain integration is

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.990 
in understanding brain integration is
the<00:06:21.410> idea<00:06:21.890> that<00:06:22.040> the<00:06:22.160> brain<00:06:22.340> will<00:06:22.700> take

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
the idea that the brain will take

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.690 
the idea that the brain will take
efficient<00:06:23.720> routes<00:06:23.990> if<00:06:24.320> possible<00:06:25.040> but<00:06:25.550> when

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
efficient routes if possible but when

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.670 
efficient routes if possible but when
it's<00:06:25.880> not<00:06:26.000> it<00:06:26.480> will<00:06:26.510> sometimes<00:06:26.870> take<00:06:27.350> a<00:06:27.410> route

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
it's not it will sometimes take a route

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.130 
it's not it will sometimes take a route
that's<00:06:27.950> much<00:06:28.250> harder<00:06:28.760> to<00:06:28.940> form<00:06:29.330> which<00:06:29.900> means

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
that's much harder to form which means

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.110 
that's much harder to form which means
we'll<00:06:30.410> be<00:06:30.440> able<00:06:30.560> to<00:06:30.830> do<00:06:31.100> an<00:06:31.310> activity<00:06:31.850> but<00:06:32.000> it

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
we'll be able to do an activity but it

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.110 
we'll be able to do an activity but it
may<00:06:32.300> be<00:06:32.360> harder<00:06:33.020> for<00:06:33.770> example<00:06:34.310> I<00:06:34.520> live<00:06:34.880> in<00:06:35.030> the

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
may be harder for example I live in the

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.330 
may be harder for example I live in the
Colorado<00:06:35.600> area<00:06:36.080> if<00:06:36.500> I<00:06:36.800> were<00:06:36.980> gonna<00:06:37.070> ask

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
Colorado area if I were gonna ask

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.220 
Colorado area if I were gonna ask
someone<00:06:37.670> how<00:06:38.120> they<00:06:38.150> would<00:06:38.510> drive<00:06:38.780> from<00:06:39.050> Denver

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
someone how they would drive from Denver

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.920 
someone how they would drive from Denver
to<00:06:39.770> Colorado<00:06:40.220> Springs<00:06:40.460> they<00:06:41.300> would<00:06:41.510> say<00:06:41.720> they

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
to Colorado Springs they would say they

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.480 
to Colorado Springs they would say they
would<00:06:42.050> take<00:06:42.290> the<00:06:42.440> one<00:06:42.620> main<00:06:42.920> free

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
would take the one main free

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.120 
would take the one main free
in<00:06:43.639> our<00:06:43.819> state<00:06:44.210> however<00:06:44.930> if<00:06:45.350> I<00:06:45.530> said<00:06:45.860> oh<00:06:46.039> no

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
in our state however if I said oh no

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.520 
in our state however if I said oh no
let's<00:06:46.610> go<00:06:46.789> through<00:06:47.090> the<00:06:47.240> mountains<00:06:47.690> it<00:06:48.020> would

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
let's go through the mountains it would

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.219 
let's go through the mountains it would
take<00:06:48.770> four<00:06:49.039> to<00:06:49.160> five<00:06:49.370> plus<00:06:49.880> hours<00:06:50.449> longer<00:06:50.840> to

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:51.229 
take four to five plus hours longer to

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:53.020 
take four to five plus hours longer to
do<00:06:51.380> that<00:06:51.590> and<00:06:51.860> they<00:06:52.340> would<00:06:52.490> wonder<00:06:52.669> why<00:06:53.000> I

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
do that and they would wonder why I

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.330 
do that and they would wonder why I
would<00:06:53.330> take<00:06:53.690> such<00:06:53.990> an<00:06:54.199> inefficient<00:06:54.860> route

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
would take such an inefficient route

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.309 
would take such an inefficient route
well<00:06:55.789> our<00:06:56.000> brain<00:06:56.330> does<00:06:56.660> the<00:06:56.870> same<00:06:57.050> thing

00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319 
well our brain does the same thing

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:59.260 
well our brain does the same thing
sometimes<00:06:57.860> it<00:06:58.130> has<00:06:58.430> to<00:06:58.669> be<00:06:58.789> able<00:06:58.970> to<00:06:59.060> function

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
sometimes it has to be able to function

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.960 
sometimes it has to be able to function
to<00:06:59.660> read<00:06:59.900> but<00:07:00.440> it<00:07:00.560> may<00:07:00.800> take<00:07:01.130> a<00:07:01.310> longer<00:07:01.580> route

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
to read but it may take a longer route

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.900 
to read but it may take a longer route
thereby<00:07:02.930> making<00:07:03.199> someone<00:07:03.710> tired<00:07:04.069> or<00:07:04.400> sick<00:07:04.699> or

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:04.910 
thereby making someone tired or sick or

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.210 
thereby making someone tired or sick or
irritable<00:07:05.599> because<00:07:06.110> they're<00:07:06.680> having<00:07:06.949> to<00:07:07.039> work

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220
