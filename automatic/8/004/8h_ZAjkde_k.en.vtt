00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
this too so instead of harming on the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.930 
this too so instead of harming on the
little<00:01:45.000> finger<00:01:45.120> you<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.450> go<00:01:45.630> tap<00:01:46.350> pearl<00:01:47.040> pearl

since the little finger is already there

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.770 
since the little finger is already there
kind<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.380> makes<00:01:55.530> sense<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:57.570> from

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
finger which is already on 17 now the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.220 
finger which is already on 17 now the
tricky<00:03:11.730> part<00:03:11.940> is<00:03:12.030> going<00:03:12.210> back<00:03:12.390> down<00:03:12.750> again

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
tricky part is going back down again

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.250 
tricky part is going back down again
so<00:03:13.560> from<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:13.950> last<00:03:14.130> tap<00:03:15.080> we're<00:03:16.080> then<00:03:16.170> going

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.280 
tapping finger and then you have it you
notice<00:05:03.340> as<00:05:03.760> well<00:05:03.940> I'm<00:05:04.330> using<00:05:04.540> my<00:05:05.020> wife's

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
notice as well I'm using my wife's

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.060 
notice as well I'm using my wife's
hairband<00:05:05.770> here<00:05:06.210> which<00:05:07.210> is<00:05:07.390> basically

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
hairband here which is basically

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.140 
hairband here which is basically
preventing<00:05:09.070> any<00:05:09.190> string<00:05:09.520> noise<00:05:09.700> I<00:05:09.940> mean<00:05:10.030> you

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
preventing any string noise I mean you

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.630 
preventing any string noise I mean you
still<00:05:10.270> get<00:05:10.420> a<00:05:10.450> little<00:05:10.630> bit<00:05:11.040> but<00:05:12.040> not<00:05:12.190> a<00:05:12.250> lot<00:05:12.340> as

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
still get a little bit but not a lot as

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.510 
still get a little bit but not a lot as
compared<00:05:13.000> to<00:05:13.710> that<00:05:14.710> so<00:05:15.040> when<00:05:15.160> you<00:05:15.250> tapping

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
compared to that so when you tapping

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.760 
compared to that so when you tapping
it's<00:05:15.760> quite<00:05:15.970> useful<00:05:16.240> to<00:05:16.450> have<00:05:16.750> that<00:05:17.020> so<00:05:17.590> that

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
it's quite useful to have that so that

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.530 
it's quite useful to have that so that
you<00:05:17.890> can<00:05:18.070> block<00:05:18.310> off<00:05:18.490> your<00:05:18.730> strings<00:05:19.000> and<00:05:19.360> this

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
you can block off your strings and this

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.700 
you can block off your strings and this
one<00:05:19.690> was<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:19.810> little<00:05:19.900> bit<00:05:20.110> too<00:05:20.200> big<00:05:20.380> I<00:05:20.500> had<00:05:20.650> to

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
one was a little bit too big I had to

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.590 
one was a little bit too big I had to
modify<00:05:21.130> it<00:05:21.190> a<00:05:21.550> little<00:05:22.060> metal<00:05:22.300> part<00:05:22.420> in<00:05:22.540> the

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
modify it a little metal part in the

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.450 
modify it a little metal part in the
back<00:05:22.750> there<00:05:22.990> just<00:05:23.200> so<00:05:23.320> that<00:05:23.350> it<00:05:23.530> actually<00:05:23.680> held

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
back there just so that it actually held

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.860 
back there just so that it actually held
the<00:05:24.550> strings<00:05:24.880> some<00:05:25.090> of<00:05:25.180> them<00:05:25.330> are<00:05:25.420> too<00:05:25.570> tight

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
the strings some of them are too tight

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.150 
the strings some of them are too tight
and<00:05:25.990> it's<00:05:26.140> going<00:05:26.230> to<00:05:26.290> act<00:05:26.440> like<00:05:26.620> a<00:05:26.650> capo<00:05:27.100> and

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
and it's going to act like a capo and

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.470 
and it's going to act like a capo and
others<00:05:27.370> are<00:05:27.490> too<00:05:27.640> loose<00:05:27.850> and<00:05:28.030> it<00:05:28.150> is<00:05:28.210> making

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
others are too loose and it is making

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.930 
others are too loose and it is making
