texturing them modeling them everything

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.070 
texturing them modeling them everything
I<00:02:27.290> just<00:02:27.500> put<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.340> lot<00:02:28.489> more<00:02:28.640> time<00:02:29.080> difference

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
I just put a lot more time difference

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.979 
I just put a lot more time difference
about<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.290> couple<00:02:30.500> million<00:02:30.769> polygons<00:02:31.989> we

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
about a couple million polygons we

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.229 
about a couple million polygons we
absolutely<00:02:33.200> want<00:02:33.920> reach<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.550> tell<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.760> human

absolutely want reach to tell a human

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.970 
absolutely want reach to tell a human
story<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.840> that's<00:02:36.140> going<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.410> require<00:02:36.590> us<00:02:36.950> to

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.460 
story and that's going to require us to
invest<00:02:37.940> significantly<00:02:38.780> into<00:02:39.200> higher

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.250 
the vision for what we had for this game
we<00:02:49.549> ended<00:02:49.760> up<00:02:49.849> getting<00:02:50.120> almost<00:02:50.480> every<00:02:50.989> part<00:02:51.140> of
