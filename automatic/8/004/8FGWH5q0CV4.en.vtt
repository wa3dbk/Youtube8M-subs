00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.920
 to play 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.960
 of quality so 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.100
 because I have 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.100
 Y 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.520
 i 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.750
 the good thing about starting is that by day 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.920
 for the song another completely 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.230
 different 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 well I like what steps are going to like 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.920
 Y 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.210
 on the occasion of Christmas and the moments 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.490
 most important of the city made of 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.579
 laity 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.579
 i 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.230
 despite being outdoors 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.800
 They have taken advantage of our invoices 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:33.420
 Argentines and tiny old 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.420
 remember that Christmas is here 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
 Y 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.680
 so you can see the rapids that 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.750
 we evolved this was in 1970 and 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.750
 now it is a superior loving site 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.300
 for work reasons I will be able to marry 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.030
 Christmas so I'm going to stay here 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.910
 but I'm going to welcome this site as 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.990
 my home 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.990
 before mom and dad 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.920
 this is called the mcmillan trade where 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.780
 with a donation of 3 pounds you receive one 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.280
 green ball to hang on this tree 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.140
 in the ball you have to write a 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.180
 love message celebration or 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.650
 I remember I will dedicate it to me 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.269
 family that also includes my 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.970
 friends because I've thrown a lot of 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.680
 less and I love them even more the money is 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.109
 targets cancer victims like this 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.670
 which is undoubtedly a very good cause if 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.890
 you are not in london on the internet too 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.200
 you can donate money I leave the link 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.359
 below and if you want you can send a 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.599
 email and the message will appear in this 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.599
 screen 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.770
 despite the disenchanted 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.550
 and two more 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.780
 surpasses me 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.790
 there is a lot of competition in the subject 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.650
 scenic so you can get a 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.690
 Very good seat for a very reasonable price 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:49.880
 affordable so to see an opera what 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.880
 make it even for less than Christmas 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.250
 for discovering the corners of saleh a 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.160
 guide 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.690
 and that both on the outside and inside 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.690
 really surrounded by natural 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.300
 We are in winter and have flowers 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.930
 imagined in summer this can teach 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.930
 a photo now 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.120
