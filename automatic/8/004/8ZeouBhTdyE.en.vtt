and<00:00:09.719> why<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.019> think<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.679> could<00:00:11.130> be<00:00:11.190> resolved

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
and why I think that could be resolved

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.900 
and why I think that could be resolved
with<00:00:12.360> formats<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.889> there's<00:00:14.099> actually<00:00:14.610> a

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
with formats and and there's actually a

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.250 
with formats and and there's actually a
bunch<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.269> benefits<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.900> can<00:00:16.020> come<00:00:16.230> from

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
bunch of benefits that can come from

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.320 
bunch of benefits that can come from
that<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:17.100> let's<00:00:17.250> talk<00:00:17.430> about<00:00:17.490> just<00:00:17.910> baseline

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
that so let's talk about just baseline

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.179 
that so let's talk about just baseline
what<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.750> problem<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.350> well<00:00:19.920> it's<00:00:20.039> rather

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
what that problem is well it's rather

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.700 
what that problem is well it's rather
simple<00:00:20.550> since<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.660> official<00:00:22.170> launch<00:00:22.320> in

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
simple since the official launch in

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.640 
simple since the official launch in
March<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.250> 2014<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:24.750> gotten<00:00:25.140> new<00:00:25.289> sets

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
March of 2014 we have gotten new sets

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.290

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
more cards and the more cards means a

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.359 
more cards and the more cards means a
larger<00:00:30.480> barrier<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.349> entry<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.040> people<00:00:32.340> just

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
larger barrier to entry so people just

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.270 
larger barrier to entry so people just

now or five months from now they're
going<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> really<00:00:37.950> hard<00:00:38.309> time

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430

going to have a really hard time
competing<00:00:38.940> at<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.660> high<00:00:39.690> level<00:00:39.980> because<00:00:40.980> it's

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
competing at a high level because it's

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.490 
competing at a high level because it's
cost<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.700> much<00:00:41.969> or<00:00:42.329> will<00:00:42.510> take<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.989> much<00:00:43.170> time

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
cost so much or will take so much time

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.160 
cost so much or will take so much time
to<00:00:44.100> accumulate<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.820> gold<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.480> order<00:00:46.050> to

purchase all the cards that you need to
play<00:00:48.239> competitively<00:00:48.930> now<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:49.710> are

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
play competitively now there are

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.860 
play competitively now there are
certainly<00:00:50.250> different<00:00:50.550> deck<00:00:51.030> options<00:00:51.629> like

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
certainly different deck options like

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.319 
certainly different deck options like
the<00:00:52.050> zoo<00:00:52.260> lock<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:52.829> example<00:00:53.370> or<00:00:53.640> even<00:00:54.149> like

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the zoo lock for example or even like

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.029 
the zoo lock for example or even like
mech<00:00:54.660> mange<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.410> relatively<00:00:55.920> cheap

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
mech mange that are relatively cheap

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.939 
mech mange that are relatively cheap
that<00:00:56.670> allow<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.120> compete<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.500> doesn't

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that allow you to compete but it doesn't

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.880 
that allow you to compete but it doesn't
make<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.520> new<00:00:59.879> player<00:01:00.359> experience<00:01:01.199> any

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
make the new player experience any

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.680 
make the new player experience any
better<00:01:02.280> knowing<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.059> they're<00:01:03.210> missing<00:01:03.600> out

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
better knowing that they're missing out

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.810 
better knowing that they're missing out
on<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.199> many<00:01:04.350> legendaries<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.430> they'd<00:01:05.790> like

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
on so many legendaries and they'd like

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.399 
on so many legendaries and they'd like
to<00:01:06.000> try<00:01:06.360> all<00:01:06.420> these<00:01:06.600> different<00:01:06.810> decks<00:01:07.170> but

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
to try all these different decks but

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.020 
to try all these different decks but
they're<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.799> sort<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.100> shoehorned<00:01:08.790> into

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
they're just sort of shoehorned into

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.600 
they're just sort of shoehorned into
playing<00:01:09.600> zoo<00:01:09.930> lock<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.500> example<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.159> they

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
playing zoo lock for example if they

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.130 
playing zoo lock for example if they
want<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.060> any<00:01:12.270> chance<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.780> reach

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
want to have any chance to reach

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.190 
want to have any chance to reach
legendary<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.369> what<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> think<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.570> solve<00:01:15.930> this

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
legendary so what I think can solve this

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.920 
legendary so what I think can solve this
issue<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.950> having<00:01:17.549> different<00:01:17.939> game<00:01:18.180> formats

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
issue is having different game formats

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.080 
issue is having different game formats
basically<00:01:19.500> taking<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.070> note<00:01:20.400> from<00:01:20.880> where

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
basically taking a note from where

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.730 
basically taking a note from where
imagina<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> gathering<00:01:22.110> has<00:01:22.229> been<00:01:22.439> very

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
imagina the gathering has been very

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
imagina the gathering has been very
successful<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.909> let's<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> quick

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
successful so let's just do a quick

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.469 
successful so let's just do a quick

Mountain<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:57.299> added<00:01:57.570> 31<00:01:58.229> cards<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.829> little

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
Mountain that added 31 cards a little

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.490 
Mountain that added 31 cards a little
bit<00:01:59.159> over<00:01:59.430> next<00:01:59.640> ramas<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.180> 30<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> similar

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
bit over next ramas is 30 with a similar

cost of 24 99 to get all of the wings

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.649 
cost of 24 99 to get all of the wings
now<00:02:05.189> all<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.909> I'm<00:02:06.030> talking<00:02:06.450> about

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
now all of this that I'm talking about

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.749 
now all of this that I'm talking about
yes<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.200> be<00:02:07.320> purchased<00:02:07.560> with<00:02:07.799> gold<00:02:08.190> but

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
yes it can be purchased with gold but

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.119 
yes it can be purchased with gold but
that<00:02:08.910> isn't<00:02:09.149> really<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.780> resolution<00:02:10.590> for<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
that isn't really a resolution for the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.340 
that isn't really a resolution for the
new<00:02:11.310> players<00:02:11.640> coming<00:02:11.849> into<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> game<00:02:12.690> at<00:02:12.959> all

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
new players coming into the game at all

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.560 
new players coming into the game at all
because<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.490> just<00:02:14.520> takes<00:02:15.000> time<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.540> takes

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
because that just takes time it takes

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.420 
because that just takes time it takes
time<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.020> accumulate<00:02:16.470> all<00:02:16.680> those<00:02:16.890> golds<00:02:17.280> and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
time to accumulate all those golds and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.430 
time to accumulate all those golds and
they<00:02:17.820> just<00:02:18.060> got<00:02:18.270> here<00:02:18.300> certainly<00:02:19.290> people

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
they just got here certainly people

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.890 
they just got here certainly people
should<00:02:19.770> put<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.010> their<00:02:20.160> time<00:02:20.400> and/or<00:02:20.940> money<00:02:21.300> to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
should put in their time and/or money to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.860 
should put in their time and/or money to
be<00:02:22.110> competitive<00:02:22.770> but<00:02:23.010> i'm<00:02:23.520> thinking<00:02:24.120> more<00:02:24.300> six

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
be competitive but i'm thinking more six

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.930 
be competitive but i'm thinking more six
months<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.350> year<00:02:25.380> from<00:02:25.980> now<00:02:26.040> two<00:02:26.190> years<00:02:26.550> from

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
months a year from now two years from

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.600 
months a year from now two years from
now<00:02:27.270> if<00:02:27.540> we<00:02:27.990> just<00:02:28.200> keep<00:02:28.380> adding<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.190> list

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
now if we just keep adding to this list

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.330 
now if we just keep adding to this list
that's<00:02:30.390> going<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.660> be<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.840> major<00:02:31.110> issue<00:02:31.230> now<00:02:32.130> i'm

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
that's going to be a major issue now i'm

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.520 
that's going to be a major issue now i'm
not<00:02:32.580> talking<00:02:33.030> about<00:02:33.090> removing<00:02:33.900> these<00:02:34.020> cards

most of the cards in all of the sets

this<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.550> where<00:02:59.790> i<00:02:59.820> think<00:03:00.210> that<00:03:00.390> hearthstone

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
this is where i think that hearthstone

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.350 
this is where i think that hearthstone

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
the future but I think there should also

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.990 
the future but I think there should also
be<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.660> standard<00:03:15.660> block<00:03:16.020> a<00:03:16.320> standard<00:03:17.280> format<00:03:17.550> in

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
be a standard block a standard format in

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.740 
be a standard block a standard format in
