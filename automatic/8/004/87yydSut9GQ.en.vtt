00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.450 
going over the AER 14 prototype this
weapon<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.250> ok<00:00:11.820> it's<00:00:12.150> just<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.570> unique<00:00:12.929> um<00:00:13.460> would

weapon is ok it's just a unique um would
you<00:00:14.519> say<00:00:14.730> laser<00:00:15.150> rifle<00:00:15.630> does<00:00:16.109> 16<00:00:16.560> damage<00:00:16.949> and

you say laser rifle does 16 damage and
51<00:00:18.300> DPS<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:19.230> it's<00:00:19.320> not<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.470> strongest<00:00:19.710> weapon

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
51 DPS so it's not the strongest weapon

51 DPS so it's not the strongest weapon
but<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.430> pretty<00:00:20.609> decent<00:00:21.020> this<00:00:22.020> weapon<00:00:22.170> can

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320
