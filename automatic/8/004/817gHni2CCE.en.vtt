 follow depp I am today again 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.730
 Alone is a bit longer 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.830
 that I played alone but 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.219
 Today it is time again and again 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.400
 I'm allowed to start right there I am 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.119
 of course, as marco again ours 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.369
 colleague logged in directly as tiger 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.019
 So the picture as tiger today the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.420
 make water unsafe we â€‹â€‹stay that way 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.010
 Market loyal and definitely very 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.289
 curious my dear friends whether we 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.230
 here at our services the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.940
 can follow up on past ones 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.149
 if we are scared and terrified again 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.760
 take care after yes I have a good one there 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.340
 feeling 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.129
 the flooded Aztec ruin 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.420
 as I always call her 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.320
 think they'll be down there 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.090
 go 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.610
 I think I'll try again 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.570
 to catch someone upstairs 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.410
 I always think that is one thing 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.820
 very good idea let's see if I can use it 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.289
 We will simply succeed 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.309
 go straight and push here 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.309
 bit forward so you see yours 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.880
 the one alone 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.580
 he's a long way and I already have here 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.040
 you chew the first way away 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:26.490
 probably as fast as that can go if the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.110
 easy to get in my way 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.700
 want 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.700
 they have seen me or believe me 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:40.950
 too bad but my colleague was also straight 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.450
 I would not have that earlier 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.549
 seen so fast away here so come on 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.340
 hurry up there are even the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.899
 robben seehunde or seals are now 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.210
 robot seconds i believe it is 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.500
 seehunde someone has me namely 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.500
 constantly corrected 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.020
 pity someone always had me 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.060
 corrected and written no that are 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.619
 point either point i have 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.860
 Yes , I've always said so 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.830
 have this dull arjen robben 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.180
 out worked so are seehunde 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.400
 obviously please excuse my 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.690
 biological ignorance 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.459
 There I am stupid on a scale of 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.690
 one to ten that was a smooth 11 36 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.930
 shit easy to breathe through the pants 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.880
 This looks so bad 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.390
 so let's get away from it 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.390
 do not be confused 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.050
 Hello 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:56.800
 one is somehow all worthwhile because are 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:03:02.580
 three not okay yet still 3 hello 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.580
 hello friends hello 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.930
 well I think we have enough now 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.190
 Kills are made for the good old blood greed 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.590
 and to treat and thus become ours 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.380
 playing style holds a decisive 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.630
 tick faster 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:28.650
 Boa had the pig just that 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:30.640
 hello kid I would've 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.320
 okay we have 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.000
 I wanted to be refreshed for a short while 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.680
 and then I reach deeper now if 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.680
 another buddy attacks ratchet 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.980
 But I have someone with in the death 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.480
 cracked 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.330
 our ships are definitely fond 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.330
 too bad I'll get to the 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.380
 States the fat cock me 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.820
 Do not know exactly what it means 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.680
 powerful Spanz I think 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:07.090
 and therefore also unhappy 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.350
 pity I have traded but currently 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.280
 it looks as if we play the still 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.480
 So I could decide for us 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.450
 can not do that for so long now 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:24.310
 rushing so fast a bit 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:26.670
 All of us will be more careful here 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.670
 by 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.870
 and there I have a fast way exactly 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.479
 to the mine was planned 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.840
 of course that was planned, I think 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.220
 to get the sharp fins and there has 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:51.530
 he got people there he just has 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.530
 clicked yes fits so hello 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.740

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.740

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:15.060
 Can you just go there then? 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:20.400

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:22.050

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.820
 because out there but wants none 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.690
 collecting treasures or even wanting to 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:33.440
 collecting treasures 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:33.440
 I do not think that's okay, hello 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:42.360
 I have unfortunately no one caught 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:45.150

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:59.999
 quite easy 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:06:05.759

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:21.469
 you can see the seal 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.759
 Long 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:25.020

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:42.389
 Colleagues have become com 

00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:42.389

 nevertheless people still have a re and 

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:04.179
 if you get the adrenaline 

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:05.349
 push and double speed or with 

00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:06.879
 The brand is even faster 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:11.319
 which is not yet fast enough to me 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:15.369

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:17.619
 we are here this time oh yes I have to 

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:19.889
 Out of here that was not so cool 

00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:19.889
 Degree

 killing runner first if the player 

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:41.529
 triple kiel are only awards

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:46.300
 throat playing fields but my goodness
