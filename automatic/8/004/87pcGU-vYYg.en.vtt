00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
card but first off what I think about

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.450 
card but first off what I think about
this<00:01:36.210> card<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.350> think<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.920> could<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.220> a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
this card is that I think it could be a

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.030 
this card is that I think it could be a
potential<00:01:38.880> staple<00:01:39.470> it's<00:01:40.470> really<00:01:40.680> interesting

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
potential staple it's really interesting

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.350 
potential staple it's really interesting
a<00:01:41.400> rank<00:01:41.700> 3<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.960> my<00:01:43.200> opinion<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:44.360> probably

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
a rank 3 I and my opinion is probably

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.060 
a rank 3 I and my opinion is probably
one<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> better<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.110> threes<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.799> I

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
one of the better in threes we have I

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.880 
one of the better in threes we have I
don't<00:01:47.250> know<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.990> Leviathan<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.020> pretty<00:01:49.619> good

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
don't know a Leviathan is pretty good

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.190 
don't know a Leviathan is pretty good
and<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:51.240> know<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> few<00:01:51.930> others<00:01:52.170> that

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and you know we have a few others that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.109 
and you know we have a few others that
are<00:01:52.439> pretty<00:01:52.560> good<00:01:52.770> right<00:01:53.250> now<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.579> would<00:01:53.970> say

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
are pretty good right now I would say

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.899 
are pretty good right now I would say
this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.329> one<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> better<00:01:54.840> ones<00:01:54.990> and

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
this is one of the better ones and

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.850 
this is one of the better ones and
because<00:01:56.909> first<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.360> its<00:01:57.600> kind<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.110> wall<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
because first of its kind of a wall of a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.340 
because first of its kind of a wall of a
monster<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.490> second<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.780> second<00:02:01.200> ability

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
monster and second it's a second ability

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990 
monster and second it's a second ability
is<00:02:01.590> really<00:02:01.860> interesting<00:02:02.340> i<00:02:02.460> write<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> little

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
is really interesting i write a little

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.700 
is really interesting i write a little
bit<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.210> how<00:02:03.630> maybe<00:02:03.899> people<00:02:04.290> could<00:02:04.380> use<00:02:04.560> this

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
bit of how maybe people could use this

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.639 
bit of how maybe people could use this
card<00:02:04.979> I'm<00:02:05.369> even<00:02:05.670> thinking<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.360> could

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
card I'm even thinking that you could

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.260 
card I'm even thinking that you could
potentially<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:08.459> talked<00:02:08.670> about<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.030> could

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
potentially I talked about you could

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.910 
potentially I talked about you could
maybe<00:02:09.569> somehow<00:02:09.959> use<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.349> within<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.739> bail

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
maybe somehow use this within you bail

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.229 
maybe somehow use this within you bail

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
to end up for like four dollars or

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.540 
to end up for like four dollars or
whatever<00:02:48.390> or<00:02:48.510> two<00:02:48.660> dollars<00:02:48.990> on<00:02:49.140> ebay<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:50.040> looks

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
whatever or two dollars on ebay it looks

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.800 
whatever or two dollars on ebay it looks
like<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:50.760> gonna<00:02:50.880> be<00:02:50.970> super<00:02:51.120> rare<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:51.630> my

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
like it's gonna be super rare so my

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.330 
like it's gonna be super rare so my
guess<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.620> will<00:02:52.800> end<00:02:52.920> up<00:02:53.070> being<00:02:53.250> I

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
guess is that this will end up being I

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.400 
guess is that this will end up being I
had<00:02:53.520> all<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.730> card<00:02:53.970> as<00:02:54.090> well<00:02:54.120> if<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.570> is<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.170> good

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
had all the card as well if it is a good

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.870 
had all the card as well if it is a good
as<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.590> think<00:02:55.740> it<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.430> don't<00:02:56.580> know<00:02:56.670> other

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
as I think it is I don't know other

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.190 
as I think it is I don't know other
people<00:02:57.120> might<00:02:57.210> have<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.480> separate<00:02:57.780> opinions

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
people might have the separate opinions

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.650 
people might have the separate opinions
on<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.350> my<00:02:58.590> thing<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.800> garbage<00:02:59.220> but<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.270> me<00:03:00.390> I
