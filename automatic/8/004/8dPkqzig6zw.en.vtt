00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
knocked out top 32 tonight I think we

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.350 
knocked out top 32 tonight I think we
learn<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.470> lot<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.980> we<00:04:42.730> have<00:04:42.850> really<00:04:43.180> good

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360

think we can use that experience for
2014<00:04:49.780> and<00:04:50.100> we<00:04:51.100> can<00:04:51.250> do<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.430> lot<00:04:51.700> better<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:53.220> I've
