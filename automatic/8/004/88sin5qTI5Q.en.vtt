00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.609
 Arseny Arseny Yatsenyuk likes to talk 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.649
 but it can go sideways because 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.719
 As we will demonstrate it to you now 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.719
 inconsistent in almost all matters 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.830
 they created such a financial pyramid 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.690
 starting with the bretton woods agreement 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.119
 only brilliant people can do it 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.840
 put the whole world on a single injection 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.650
 us dollars and print them yes they are great 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.480
 financial pyramid interestingly shared 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.619
 does he have these thoughts with the us president 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.630
 barrack obama 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.670
 when talking to him in the white house on 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.160
 what is more interesting Yatsenyuk said that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.329
 America has made Russia its victim 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.950
 financial fraud I remember you 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.739
 He said that Russia has earned a lot 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.930
 money well and where they they were lowered for 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.820
 year the central bank of Russia spent 300 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.579
 billion dollars i will tell you that 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.590
 happened Russia developed it again like 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.050
 how allowed to earn and then all 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.090
 taken away she was simply not allowed to use 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.930
 the money she received the sale 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.730
 oil and gas 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.270
 all the money went to maintain the course 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.460
 the ruble and now this money is not there but 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.909
 According to Yatsenyuk, Russia has a very good 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.560
 the president is also passing by his way 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.200
 changes the way he performed his 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.119
 historical mission to save Russia where 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.830
 there was a big gap between classes and 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.229
 clans between the common people and 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.030
 oligarchs as in Ukraine in Russia 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.340
 there were five oligarchs who were tearing 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.710
 country apart with loyal to them 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.299
 MPs, we see that Putin chose 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.770
 certain way and i can't 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.720
 compete with him by quantity 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.759
 great decisions that he made 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.799
 Yesterday I realized that it is not known that I 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.280
 did i lead so big and 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.579
 unmanaged country I'm pretty tight 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.740
 his right hand was the hand that is a pity 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.960
 Arseny Yatsenyuk does not want to cooperate with 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.210
 the man he is so tall about 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.950
 views at a certain point kiev hotel 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.119
 partnership with nato but surprisingly 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.340
 Yatsenyuk has his own accounts with the alliance 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.259
 she doesn't know and the plague know why 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.540
 they buy our military transport 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.399
 airplanes are interesting to me 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.680
 we are supposed to be partners 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.830
 I would like us to sell ours 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.430
 NATO airplanes on the country but they buy 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.680
 airbus boeing and 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.579
 braer but nato will not use 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.769
 own helicopters 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.299
 and you enjoy our course much 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.569
 more profitable to send blow 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:25.750
 Ukrainian helicopters 5 some 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.730
 modernization they are not here so yatsenyuk 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.950
 changed my decision about membership 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.959
 in nato but what about his favorite European Union 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.090
 because of which all this chaos began 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.549
 in Ukraine we will become part of the great 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.769
 Europe because we are Europeans and I 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.439
 I put it our first priority 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:49.659
 so that we become part of Europe and our tsen 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:51.340
 task great honor to be part of 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.349
 which he has been singing for many years 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.970
 making another move on the chessboard and 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.099
 I declare that this is the only way to 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.689
 his countries and all this in order to 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.510
 finally admit that this is never 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.549
 there will be a tonic no one is going there 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.889
 no one else take it we already 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.349
 understood and moreover nobody will accept 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.060
 Ukraine in which 46 million inhabitants and 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.010
 which is approximately equal in area 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.650
 France Ukraine acts as 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.690
 a kind of border area big 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.989
 border strip between the European Union and 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.819
 Russia between democracy and you knot out 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.599
 went the way of forming a belt 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.819
 security and again impartial 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.470
 remarks about russia but it's not about 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.250
 these statements and not even anyone 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.949
 supports 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.959
 or not Yatsenyuk matter in the presence of his plan 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:36.760
 lack of concern for many including even 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.620
 those who supported Yatsenyuk during 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.359
 coup d'Ã©tat why 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.849
 because they no longer know what 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.060
 they support marina Kosarev 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.060
