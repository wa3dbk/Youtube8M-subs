the<00:00:00.359> cardiac<00:00:00.780> system<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.350> and<00:00:01.770> will<00:00:02.010> always<00:00:02.040> be

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
the cardiac system is and will always be

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.120 
the cardiac system is and will always be
the<00:00:03.120> meat<00:00:03.330> of<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.600> NCLEX<00:00:03.870> there<00:00:04.680> are<00:00:04.830> plenty

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
the meat of the NCLEX there are plenty

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.070 
the meat of the NCLEX there are plenty
of<00:00:05.250> ways<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.609> study<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.299> cardiovascular

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
of ways to study the cardiovascular

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.350 
of ways to study the cardiovascular
system<00:00:07.470> but<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.740> best<00:00:07.919> approach<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.970> break

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
system but the best approach is to break

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.200 
system but the best approach is to break
down<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.599> different<00:00:10.080> major<00:00:10.349> diseases<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.030> way

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
down a different major diseases in a way

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.789 
down a different major diseases in a way
that<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.450> can<00:00:12.599> understand<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.320> remember<00:00:13.710> it

the NCLEX exam and 75% of the answers

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.549 
the NCLEX exam and 75% of the answers
that<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.920> got<00:00:41.129> included<00:00:41.820> angina<00:00:42.750> myocardial

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that I got included angina myocardial

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.290 
that I got included angina myocardial
infraction<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.340> CHF<00:00:44.789> which<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.120> heart

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
infraction and CHF which is heart

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.600 
infraction and CHF which is heart
failure<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.870> then<00:00:46.230> asked<00:00:46.469> several<00:00:46.980> students

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
failure I then asked several students

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.400 
failure I then asked several students
who<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:47.940> recently<00:00:48.239> taken<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.989> grex<00:00:49.260> if

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
who have recently taken that grex if

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.200 
who have recently taken that grex if
they<00:00:49.530> remembered<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.399> cardiac<00:00:50.820> diseases

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
they remembered the cardiac diseases

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.060 
they remembered the cardiac diseases
that<00:00:51.570> they<00:00:51.750> encountered<00:00:52.230> more<00:00:52.440> often<00:00:52.829> during

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
that they encountered more often during

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.369 
that they encountered more often during
the<00:00:53.190> exam<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.120> results<00:00:54.600> came<00:00:54.899> out<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.260> be

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the exam and the results came out to be

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.830 
the exam and the results came out to be
very<00:00:55.559> similar<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.219> which<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.610> majority

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
very similar in which the majority

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.750 
very similar in which the majority
mentioned<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.410> angina<00:00:58.980> myocardial

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
mentioned that angina myocardial

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.880 
mentioned that angina myocardial
infraction<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.570> CHF<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.649> heart<00:01:01.829> failure

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
infraction and CHF for heart failure

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.640 
infraction and CHF for heart failure
with<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.879> biggest<00:01:03.359> three<00:01:03.660> main<00:01:04.140> cardiac

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
with the biggest three main cardiac

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.859 
with the biggest three main cardiac
diseases<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.309> they<00:01:05.460> did<00:01:05.700> encounter<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
diseases that they did encounter in the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.230 
diseases that they did encounter in the
exam<00:01:07.200> now<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> second<00:01:08.490> category<00:01:08.610> involves

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
exam now the second category involves

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.780 
exam now the second category involves
the<00:01:09.630> valvular<00:01:09.960> diseases<00:01:10.740> when<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:11.610> say

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the valvular diseases when we say

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.580 
the valvular diseases when we say
valvular<00:01:12.180> disease<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.960> are<00:01:13.020> talking<00:01:13.500> about

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
valvular disease we are talking about

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.340 
valvular disease we are talking about
the<00:01:13.890> heart<00:01:14.159> valves<00:01:14.640> within<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.450> heart<00:01:15.720> that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the heart valves within the heart that

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.990 
the heart valves within the heart that
has<00:01:16.500> problems<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.159> opening<00:01:17.790> or<00:01:17.970> closing

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
has problems with opening or closing

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.840 
has problems with opening or closing
that's<00:01:18.930> basically<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:20.340> back<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
that's basically it going back to the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.310 
that's basically it going back to the
anatomy<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.450> heart<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:21.990> know<00:01:22.140> that

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
anatomy of the heart we all know that

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.109 
anatomy of the heart we all know that
the<00:01:22.470> heart<00:01:22.500> has<00:01:23.159> several<00:01:23.549> valves<00:01:23.939> right

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the heart has several valves right

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.210 
the heart has several valves right
remember<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.810> Demetrio<00:01:25.259> valve<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
remember we have Demetrio valve the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.340 
remember we have Demetrio valve the
tricuspid<00:01:26.640> valve<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> aortic<00:01:28.320> valve

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
tricuspid valve we have the aortic valve

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.219 
tricuspid valve we have the aortic valve
we<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> pulmonic<00:01:29.670> valve<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.720> with<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
we have the pulmonic valve but with the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.140 
we have the pulmonic valve but with the
valvular<00:01:31.530> disease<00:01:31.890> we're<00:01:32.369> only<00:01:32.579> gonna<00:01:32.850> focus

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
valvular disease we're only gonna focus

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.240 
valvular disease we're only gonna focus
in<00:01:33.479> two<00:01:33.659> particular<00:01:34.140> valves<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.860> this

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
in two particular valves and this

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.030 
in two particular valves and this
involves<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.000> Metro<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.140> aortic<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
involves the Metro in the aortic and the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.100 
involves the Metro in the aortic and the
problems<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.820> has<00:01:39.030> with<00:01:39.479> opening<00:01:39.990> or

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
problems that it has with opening or

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.929 
problems that it has with opening or
closing<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> let's<00:01:41.490> say<00:01:41.670> there's<00:01:41.880> a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
closing so let's say there's a

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.330 
closing so let's say there's a
thickening<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.570> valvular<00:01:42.930> tissue<00:01:43.380> within

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
thickening of the valvular tissue within

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.460 
thickening of the valvular tissue within
the<00:01:44.460> mitra<00:01:44.790> valve<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.899> causes<00:01:46.140> the

narrowing of the valve opening then we

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.539 
narrowing of the valve opening then we
can<00:01:48.750> say<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.409> nose<00:01:49.740> or<00:01:50.280> either

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
can say that it's the nose or either

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.120 
can say that it's the nose or either
fully<00:01:50.909> or<00:01:51.119> partially<00:01:51.420> closed<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.649> we

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
now if for some reason the valves

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.670 
now if for some reason the valves
doesn't<00:02:11.730> close<00:02:12.000> completely<00:02:12.569> or<00:02:13.020> is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
doesn't close completely or is

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.309 
doesn't close completely or is
partially<00:02:14.099> insufficient<00:02:14.819> in<00:02:14.969> closing<00:02:15.390> we<00:02:16.170> can

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
partially insufficient in closing we can

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.110 
partially insufficient in closing we can
therefore<00:02:16.650> call<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.040> valvular<00:02:17.370> disease<00:02:17.760> and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
therefore call this valvular disease and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.270 
therefore call this valvular disease and
insufficiency<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.439> we<00:02:19.560> call<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.950> mutual

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
insufficiency so we call it a mutual

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.610 
insufficiency so we call it a mutual
valve<00:02:20.519> insufficiency<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:22.079> same<00:02:22.290> things

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
valve insufficiency and the same things

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.559 
valve insufficiency and the same things
can<00:02:22.890> apply<00:02:23.129> for<00:02:23.189> the<00:02:23.489> aortic<00:02:23.819> valve<00:02:23.849> the

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
can apply for the aortic valve the

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.149 
can apply for the aortic valve the
aortic<00:02:24.840> valve<00:02:25.049> could<00:02:25.439> also<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.799> a<00:02:25.829> stenosis

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
aortic valve could also have a stenosis

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.449 
aortic valve could also have a stenosis
or<00:02:26.609> an<00:02:27.239> aortic<00:02:27.689> insufficiency<00:02:28.069> to<00:02:29.069> sum<00:02:29.310> this

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
or an aortic insufficiency to sum this

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.000 
or an aortic insufficiency to sum this
up<00:02:29.670> we<00:02:30.180> can<00:02:30.329> basically<00:02:30.569> simplify<00:02:31.500> valvular

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
up we can basically simplify valvular

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.250 
up we can basically simplify valvular
heart<00:02:32.489> diseases<00:02:32.849> by<00:02:33.569> looking<00:02:33.930> at<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.109> two

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
heart diseases by looking at the two

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.440 
heart diseases by looking at the two
particular<00:02:34.829> valves<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.639> involved<00:02:36.120> which

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
particular valves that is involved which

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.780 
particular valves that is involved which
is<00:02:36.659> the<00:02:36.870> meet<00:02:37.079> row<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.709> aortic<00:02:38.129> and<00:02:38.310> we'll

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
is the meet row in the aortic and we'll

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.190 
is the meet row in the aortic and we'll
look<00:02:38.849> at<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.090> problems<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.540> involves<00:02:40.049> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
look at the problems that involves the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.679 
look at the problems that involves the
opening<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.769> closing<00:02:41.189> of<00:02:41.310> these<00:02:41.430> valves

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
opening and closing of these valves

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.699 
opening and closing of these valves
lastly<00:02:42.689> we<00:02:42.989> can<00:02:43.109> look<00:02:43.290> at<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.469> inflammatory

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
lastly we can look at the inflammatory

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.740 
lastly we can look at the inflammatory
diseases<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.909> affects<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.359> heart<00:02:45.510> and
