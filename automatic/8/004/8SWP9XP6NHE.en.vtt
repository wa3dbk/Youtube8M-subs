00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:05.009
 Hello and welcome to a separate explanatory piece in things 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.009
 Norway fill and that can be the arias for 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.320
 Weather conditions The basis for this one sees not too often but you can see 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.860
 But sometimes almost nowhere in Germany should be like that 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.089
 Area with really much sunshine comparatively 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:24.629
 And the southern border is also a bit so the Elk case also hinted 

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:29.809
 and some people think WHO the Elbe is not a weather sheath though 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:33.390
 that has nothing to do but nothing at all with the Elbe so his subject 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.550
 Pure random 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.140
 this Norway or Scandinavia movie comes off that's just over 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.540
 Norway is this mountains are reasonably north-south and if 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.399
 is animal northwest wind 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.030
 so that's always on the Seitele side on the wind canceled wait page 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.059
 The mountain also gives a dry ground to the area because of the wind 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.260
 descends he warms up and accordingly is the 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.049
 Humidity lower and this lege offers with the loosening the 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.920
 looks just to the part of Germany and the demarcation or direction 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.030
 South is and it happens just because the Norwegian mountains like that 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.450
 looks like and because next to the northwest wind looks like that then more or 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.630
 less part of the course of the Elbe and the people on the Elbe then always think 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.860
 because south of it is clouds and north of it is this one 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.320
 Loosen up the area from Norway fill yard there is somehow the Elbe 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.980
 a weather is rising 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.370
 that is completely the nonsense in the weather is the Elbe 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.039
 No matter the Elbe has only an influence on the weather 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.490
 that is because just coincidentally the mountain course over Norway with the 

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:41.960
 Northwest wind leads to it 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.040
 that same loosening SGA beat just exactly 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.420
 these limits have approximately more or less the 11 runs correspond times 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.320
 a few kilometers more or less short up 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.470
 sometimes we have more sunshine in the northeastern Germany 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.920
 in Germany there are mountains in Norway 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.979
 Maybe they did not know but as I said on the Elbe there is 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:02.909
 definitely not
