thought<00:02:46.480> in<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.690> second<00:02:47.050> quarter<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.380> then

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
thought in the second quarter and then

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.220 
thought in the second quarter and then
we<00:02:47.740> let<00:02:47.950> up<00:02:48.099> let<00:02:48.760> up<00:02:48.880> on<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.090> in<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.480> third<00:02:49.720> then

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
we let up let up on it in the third then

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.839 
we let up let up on it in the third then
we<00:02:50.319> got<00:02:50.470> back<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:50.980> in<00:02:51.069> a<00:02:51.130> full<00:02:51.340> quarter<00:02:51.580> so

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
we got back to it in a full quarter so

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.910 
we got back to it in a full quarter so
it<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.599> depending<00:02:53.080> on<00:02:53.170> who<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.440> rootin<00:02:53.709> for
