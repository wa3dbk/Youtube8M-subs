00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.980
 The country's good point is 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.909
 When a boat came up 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.759
 There is no buoyancy here 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.319
 In fact though this is like this 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:25.019
 This is not an easy thing 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.050
 It is the same air group, but in fact do not deposit 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.060
 originally 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.300
 There is also such a thing 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.260
 Tentative name as well as air conditioning 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.620
 This is Moko like this 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.620
 If I moved in the future and I could move Momoko 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.020
 Design is not here 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020
 If you do have power then you'll be curious in the meantime 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.580
 Because I have no physical strength, I will try to bring only its true meaning 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.330
 That means 70 years old 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.430
 that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.630
 This is also good for those who think that they are from difficult things 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.739
 There are many 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.369
 In fact this is 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.369
 That roll and the real car 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.880
 But with you work and Toruo 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.880
 But i understood 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.370
 I think why companies are doing 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.370
 Dangerous to the test tower 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.450
 The day of the largest hand is high 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.460
 In the middle of such a new-fielder until now 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.670
 That means 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.909
 Lecture in Yokohama 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.909
 It is expanding eight steps that I was moving 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.890
 Furthermore 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.720
 Because there is no cpf power 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.720
 Like this 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.350
 Other schools and China 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.800
 It is impossible to say that the ball is impossible 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.210
 Candidates for obstacles 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.970
 Oshio-kun 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.180
 It's moving like this for us and the road is not in 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.180
 Quite often this kind of baroque 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.280
 So in that sense that eye is very much of that time 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.510
 Few 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.480
 In that 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.480
 Yeah 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.279
 tdl 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:15.939
