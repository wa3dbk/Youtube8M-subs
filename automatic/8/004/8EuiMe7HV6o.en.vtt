they are over like this making a sharp
turn<00:00:59.070> at<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.339> parking-lot<00:00:59.790> speed<00:01:00.180> they're<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
turn at a parking-lot speed they're in a

turn at a parking-lot speed they're in a
they're<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.830> a<00:01:01.890> dangerous<00:01:02.280> position<00:01:02.489> they're

they're in a dangerous position they're
not<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.570> control<00:01:03.839> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> bike<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.589> this

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
not in control of the bike so that this

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.219 
not in control of the bike so that this
doesn't<00:01:05.280> work<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.760> not<00:01:06.360> only<00:01:06.479> wristing<00:01:06.990> but

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
doesn't work for not only wristing but

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.250 
doesn't work for not only wristing but
also<00:01:07.409> low<00:01:07.740> speed<00:01:08.040> maneuvers<00:01:08.750> these<00:01:09.750> files<00:01:10.049> may

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
also low speed maneuvers these files may

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320 
also low speed maneuvers these files may
look<00:01:10.560> cool<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.610> they're<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.000> kill<00:01:12.180> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
look cool but they're going to kill you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.060 
look cool but they're going to kill you
in<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.479> long<00:01:12.720> trip<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.619> ride<00:01:13.860> your<00:01:14.009> bike

in a long trip and if you ride your bike

in a long trip and if you ride your bike
continuously<00:01:14.790> day<00:01:15.060> after<00:01:15.270> day<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.840> going

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
continuously day after day this is going

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
continuously day after day this is going
to<00:01:16.049> become<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> problem<00:01:16.590> you're<00:01:17.159> going<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> find

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
to become a problem you're going to find

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.010 
to become a problem you're going to find
yourself<00:01:17.700> holding<00:01:18.060> your<00:01:18.330> hand<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.840> on

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
yourself holding your hand like this on

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.039 
yourself holding your hand like this on
the<00:01:19.110> grid<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:20.009> comfortable<00:01:20.720> this<00:01:21.720> bar

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the grid it's not comfortable this bar

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.410 
the grid it's not comfortable this bar
there's<00:01:22.650> no<00:01:22.920> way<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> closer<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
there's no way to get it closer to you

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.870 
there's no way to get it closer to you
because<00:01:24.749> as<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.200> pull<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.590> back<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:26.310> goes<00:01:26.520> down

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
because as you pull it back it goes down

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.660 
because as you pull it back it goes down
you<00:01:27.659> push<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.109> forward<00:01:28.679> and<00:01:28.859> it<00:01:29.039> comes<00:01:29.249> up<00:01:29.429> too

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you push it forward and it comes up too

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.760 
you push it forward and it comes up too
high<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.020> try<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> number<00:01:31.679> of

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
high and you can try a number of

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.560 
high and you can try a number of
different<00:01:32.070> bends<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.579> try<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.149> close<00:01:33.390> to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
different bends to try to get close to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.779 
different bends to try to get close to
this<00:01:33.749> but<00:01:34.109> this<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.619> not<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.249> change<00:01:35.310> on

this but this is not going to change on
any<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.149> them<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.390> will<00:01:37.229> take<00:01:37.469> incredible

traditional but to be real real

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.380 
traditional but to be real real
comfortable<00:01:46.189> now<00:01:47.189> while<00:01:47.429> this<00:01:47.670> design<00:01:47.880> which

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
comfortable now while this design which

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.090 
comfortable now while this design which
looks<00:01:48.630> kinda<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:48.929> a<00:01:49.020> t-bob<00:01:49.530> might<00:01:49.770> not<00:01:49.950> be

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
looks kinda like a t-bob might not be

everyone's cup of tea there's a reason

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.160 
everyone's cup of tea there's a reason
for<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.939> looks<00:01:54.179> and<00:01:54.359> we<00:01:54.450> certainly<00:01:54.659> refine

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
for the looks and we certainly refine

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.050 
for the looks and we certainly refine
the<00:01:55.350> looks<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:56.189> didn't<00:01:56.399> want<00:01:56.609> this<00:01:56.729> thing<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the looks we didn't want this thing to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.700 
the looks we didn't want this thing to
look<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.749> mechanical<00:01:58.319> piece<00:01:58.499> of

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
look like just a mechanical piece of

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.849 
look like just a mechanical piece of
joint<00:01:59.749> once<00:02:00.749> we<00:02:00.899> got<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.499> the<00:02:01.619> point

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
joint once we got this to the point

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.679 
joint once we got this to the point
where<00:02:02.069> we<00:02:02.700> were<00:02:02.819> comfortable<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:03.509> its

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
where we were comfortable with its

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.499 
where we were comfortable with its
parents<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.829> real<00:02:05.009> function<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.789> shines

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
parents the real function of this shines

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.760 
parents the real function of this shines
through<00:02:06.749> and<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.929> can<00:02:07.049> see<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.319> first<00:02:07.530> thing

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
through and you can see the first thing

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.090 
through and you can see the first thing
right<00:02:07.889> off<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.160> bat<00:02:08.569> my<00:02:09.569> hand<00:02:09.899> fits<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.860> there

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
right off the bat my hand fits on there

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.710 
right off the bat my hand fits on there
without<00:02:11.250> any<00:02:11.610> turning<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.240> way<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
without any turning this way of that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.680 
without any turning this way of that
reads<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.440> completely<00:02:14.130> neutral<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.760> at<00:02:15.510> this

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
reads it completely neutral and at this

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.080 
reads it completely neutral and at this
point<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.470> push<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.830> entire<00:02:17.190> unit<00:02:17.670> forward

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
point I can push the entire unit forward

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.809 
point I can push the entire unit forward
without<00:02:18.270> even<00:02:18.600> changing<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.319> angle<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:19.950> when

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
without even changing that angle so when

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.809 
without even changing that angle so when
I<00:02:20.850> get<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.209> setback<00:02:21.690> right<00:02:21.959> which<00:02:22.380> for<00:02:22.590> me

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
I get the setback right which for me

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.910 
I get the setback right which for me
is<00:02:22.879> about<00:02:23.120> right<00:02:23.480> there<00:02:23.959> very<00:02:24.409> comfortable

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
is about right there very comfortable

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.610 
is about right there very comfortable
hand<00:02:25.519> just<00:02:25.790> drop<00:02:25.999> right<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.599> can<00:02:27.260> make<00:02:27.409> some

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
hand just drop right on I can make some

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.030 
hand just drop right on I can make some
my<00:02:27.739> new<00:02:27.980> changes<00:02:28.670> rotating<00:02:29.599> this<00:02:29.810> way<00:02:30.049> so

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
my new changes rotating this way so

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.920 
my new changes rotating this way so
we've<00:02:31.189> got<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> pivot<00:02:31.790> here<00:02:31.819> we've<00:02:32.329> got<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.540> pivot

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
we've got a pivot here we've got a pivot

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.319 
we've got a pivot here we've got a pivot
here<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.620> have<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:33.769> pivot<00:02:34.040> here<00:02:34.189> the<00:02:35.030> fourth

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
here you have a pivot here the fourth

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.059 
here you have a pivot here the fourth
pivot<00:02:35.719> is<00:02:35.840> here<00:02:36.109> when<00:02:36.319> we<00:02:36.590> loosen<00:02:36.920> these<00:02:37.010> two

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
pivot is here when we loosen these two

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.610 
pivot is here when we loosen these two
screws<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:38.269> can<00:02:38.299> actually<00:02:38.780> adjust<00:02:38.900> our<00:02:39.260> levers

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
screws we can actually adjust our levers

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.800 
screws we can actually adjust our levers
up<00:02:39.799> and<00:02:39.950> down<00:02:40.129> so<00:02:40.969> it<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.150> truly<00:02:41.450> three

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
up and down so it is truly three

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.319 
up and down so it is truly three
dimensionally<00:02:42.290> adjustable<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.879> can<00:02:44.060> find

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
dimensionally adjustable you can find

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.729 
dimensionally adjustable you can find
the<00:02:44.450> set<00:02:44.689> back<00:02:44.930> which<00:02:45.139> you<00:02:45.230> can't<00:02:45.469> do<00:02:45.620> with

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
the set back which you can't do with

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.009 
the set back which you can't do with
that<00:02:45.889> other<00:02:46.069> start<00:02:46.430> bar<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:47.689> your<00:02:47.840> wrist

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
that other start bar just your wrist

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.479 
that other start bar just your wrist
angles<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.569> find<00:02:50.569> that<00:02:50.719> sweet<00:02:51.019> spot<00:02:51.409> so<00:02:52.340> now

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
angles and find that sweet spot so now

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.690 
angles and find that sweet spot so now
we<00:02:52.549> talked<00:02:53.060> these<00:02:53.530> factory<00:02:54.530> clamps<00:02:54.980> down<00:02:55.040> okay

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
we talked these factory clamps down okay

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.610 
we talked these factory clamps down okay
with<00:02:55.879> tight<00:02:56.090> there<00:02:56.389> now<00:02:56.989> we've<00:02:57.169> got<00:02:57.319> two<00:02:57.530> other

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
with tight there now we've got two other

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.030 
with tight there now we've got two other
rotations<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.519> work<00:02:58.700> with<00:02:58.939> here<00:02:59.329> and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
rotations to work with here and

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.500 
rotations to work with here and
underneath<00:03:01.040> we<00:03:01.340> have<00:03:01.519> two<00:03:01.730> bolts<00:03:02.090> here<00:03:02.299> which

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
underneath we have two bolts here which

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.050 
underneath we have two bolts here which
you<00:03:02.629> would<00:03:02.750> loosen<00:03:03.169> up<00:03:03.290> there<00:03:04.189> Allen<00:03:04.609> socket

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
you would loosen up there Allen socket

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.240 
you would loosen up there Allen socket
heads<00:03:05.269> we<00:03:06.109> would<00:03:06.260> loosen<00:03:06.650> these<00:03:06.799> and<00:03:07.099> make

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
heads we would loosen these and make

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.699 
heads we would loosen these and make
this<00:03:07.459> adjustment<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.349> then<00:03:09.349> we've<00:03:09.500> got<00:03:09.650> a

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
this adjustment and then we've got a

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.860 
this adjustment and then we've got a
left<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.159> a<00:03:10.250> right<00:03:10.299> independent<00:03:11.299> adjustment

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
left and a right independent adjustment

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.500 
left and a right independent adjustment
here<00:03:12.409> which<00:03:13.010> allows<00:03:13.370> us<00:03:13.639> to<00:03:13.790> swing<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.180> bar<00:03:14.359> in

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
here which allows us to swing the bar in

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.770 
here which allows us to swing the bar in
and<00:03:14.659> out<00:03:15.159> now<00:03:16.159> for<00:03:16.939> the<00:03:17.030> up-and-down<00:03:17.419> motion

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
and out now for the up-and-down motion

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.020 
and out now for the up-and-down motion
these<00:03:18.199> bars<00:03:18.560> are<00:03:18.859> key<00:03:19.040> together<00:03:19.280> through<00:03:19.819> this

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
these bars are key together through this

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.929 
these bars are key together through this
cross<00:03:20.930> bar<00:03:21.230> which<00:03:21.680> has<00:03:21.889> a<00:03:21.919> set<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.310> teeth<00:03:22.669> on

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:22.939 
cross bar which has a set of teeth on

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.569 
cross bar which has a set of teeth on
both<00:03:23.269> sides<00:03:23.599> when<00:03:24.560> we<00:03:24.709> assemble<00:03:25.010> this<00:03:25.250> upper

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
both sides when we assemble this upper

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.969 
both sides when we assemble this upper
portion<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.569> these<00:03:26.719> always<00:03:27.049> stay<00:03:27.439> in<00:03:27.470> line<00:03:27.769> so

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:27.979 
portion so these always stay in line so

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.309 
portion so these always stay in line so
they<00:03:28.099> mirrored<00:03:28.400> perfect<00:03:29.030> however<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.079> left

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
they mirrored perfect however the left

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.559 
they mirrored perfect however the left
and<00:03:30.530> right<00:03:30.709> are<00:03:30.979> somewhat<00:03:31.970> random<00:03:32.389> and<00:03:32.509> you

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
and right are somewhat random and you

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.149 
and right are somewhat random and you
can<00:03:32.689> certainly<00:03:32.989> adjust<00:03:33.139> them<00:03:33.590> just<00:03:33.889> to<00:03:34.009> what

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
can certainly adjust them just to what

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.550 
can certainly adjust them just to what
feels<00:03:34.459> best<00:03:34.790> but<00:03:35.780> for<00:03:35.989> people<00:03:36.109> that<00:03:36.259> like

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
feels best but for people that like

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.140 
feels best but for people that like
everything<00:03:36.889> to<00:03:37.129> be<00:03:37.159> perfect<00:03:37.729> and<00:03:37.819> you<00:03:37.879> may<00:03:38.000> not

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
everything to be perfect and you may not

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.699 
everything to be perfect and you may not
be<00:03:38.299> able<00:03:38.389> to<00:03:38.479> see<00:03:38.689> this<00:03:38.840> in<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.139> picture<00:03:39.319> but

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
be able to see this in the picture but

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.129 
be able to see this in the picture but
there<00:03:40.280> are<00:03:40.430> small<00:03:40.759> little<00:03:40.970> index<00:03:41.449> marks<00:03:41.810> here

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
there are small little index marks here

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.979 
there are small little index marks here
and<00:03:42.250> what<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.400> do<00:03:43.579> is<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:43.970> align<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.540> edge<00:03:44.750> of

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
and what you do is you align the edge of

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.469 
and what you do is you align the edge of
this<00:03:45.169> piece<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.889> one<00:03:46.459> line<00:03:46.699> that<00:03:46.729> feels<00:03:47.239> good

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
this piece to one line that feels good

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.149 
this piece to one line that feels good
and<00:03:47.540> then<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:47.989> just<00:03:48.199> mirror<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.560> over<00:03:48.919> and

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
and then you just mirror it over and

how much it can move you can see the

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.860 
how much it can move you can see the
motion<00:05:20.410> there<00:05:20.830> it<00:05:21.040> stops<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:22.210> going<00:05:22.570> forward

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
motion there it stops and going forward

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.840 
motion there it stops and going forward
it<00:05:23.200> stops<00:05:23.710> it<00:05:23.950> won't<00:05:24.160> go<00:05:24.280> any<00:05:24.430> further<00:05:24.610> than

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
it stops it won't go any further than

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.360 
it stops it won't go any further than
that<00:05:24.880> so<00:05:25.720> even<00:05:25.900> if<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.200> clamp<00:05:26.500> bolt<00:05:26.800> fell<00:05:27.100> out

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
that so even if the clamp bolt fell out

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.770 
that so even if the clamp bolt fell out
this<00:05:28.240> couldn't<00:05:28.630> disengage<00:05:29.200> and<00:05:29.530> stop<00:05:30.070> moving

this couldn't disengage and stop moving

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.260 
this couldn't disengage and stop moving
and<00:05:31.780> and<00:05:32.200> you<00:05:32.740> know<00:05:32.860> eliminate<00:05:33.340> that<00:05:33.610> stop

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
and and you know eliminate that stop
