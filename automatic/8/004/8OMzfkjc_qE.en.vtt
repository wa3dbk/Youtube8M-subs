00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
and obviously it's getting closer and

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.210 
and obviously it's getting closer and
closer<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.110> have<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.259> home<00:00:28.500> Olympics<00:00:28.980> in

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
the home ground and having the home

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.359 
the home ground and having the home
support<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:31.829> obviously<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.160> dream

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
support is is what obviously I dream

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.830 
support is is what obviously I dream
about<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.759> hopefully<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.600> there<00:00:38.840> some

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
about and hopefully I can be there some

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.390 
about and hopefully I can be there some
mornings<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.559> harder<00:00:40.830> than<00:00:40.980> others

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
mornings are harder than others

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.470 
mornings are harder than others
but<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:43.010> think<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.339> get<00:00:44.640> into<00:00:45.000> routine

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
but I think you just get into routine

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.400 
but I think you just get into routine
after<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> while<00:00:47.180> like<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.480> tend<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.140> bed

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
after a while like I tend to go to bed

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.000 
after a while like I tend to go to bed

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
a week was to allocate session for 20

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
as well so it's hard to ask where we do

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.680 
as well so it's hard to ask where we do
it<00:01:30.159> because<00:01:30.310> who<00:01:30.640> want<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.850> do<00:01:31.000> well<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.390> we

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
it because who want to do well and we

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.840 
it because who want to do well and we
enjoy<00:01:31.960> it<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.500> mean<00:01:33.160> they're<00:01:33.369> all<00:01:33.490> ranked<00:01:33.789> in

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
enjoy it I mean they're all ranked in

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.760 
enjoy it I mean they're all ranked in
the<00:01:33.880> top<00:01:34.090> 10<00:01:34.330> in<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.450> world<00:01:34.509> and<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.649> only

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
the top 10 in the world and the only

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.260 
the top 10 in the world and the only
problem<00:01:36.070> is<00:01:36.280> that<00:01:36.310> they're<00:01:36.640> all<00:01:36.789> in<00:01:36.820> events

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
problem is that they're all in events

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.210 
problem is that they're all in events
that<00:01:37.450> there's<00:01:37.660> a<00:01:37.720> lot<00:01:38.350> of<00:01:38.380> competition<00:01:38.800> from
