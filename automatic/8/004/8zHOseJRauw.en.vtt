00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello my name is from osvaldo junior said 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.849
 that episode number 34 of the blog 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.710
 The Bible was the theme of this week's 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.759
 breaking of curses and curses 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.530
 heritable 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.170
 the breaks of curses have already become part of 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.150
 of the evangelical folklore of doctrines 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.980
 has no biblical basis and is not 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.900
 It's so hard to realize that it's enough to give 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.289
 a little look at the scriptures 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.289
 come on 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.070
 unfortunately evangelicalism 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.399
 Brazil has become a set of 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.410
 The doctrines that work right 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.020
 certain thing that is taught in a 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.360
 church works then that is taken as 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.219
 truth and screw the scriptures 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.590
 business has become so absurd that 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.230
 You can not see difference anymore 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.570
 between the so-called evangelical religion 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.760
 Protestant religion of the other religions 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.570
 own evangelicals fight against each other 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.640
 coherent 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.070
 the concept of being a Christian means 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.559
 live according to the scriptures 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.260
 that is, the foundations of our faith and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.229
 practice are based on the word 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.390
 of god and everything that does not fit 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.760
 in the word of God must be rejected 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.210
 as false teaching but so-and-so has the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.100
 power to reveal beautiful moments but 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.659
 if this does not agree with that 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.880
 what the Word of God says 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.830
 so this is not god's it's up to 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.420
 understandable because many so-called 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 churches want to make people 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.860
 believe in these fables everything does not pass 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.420
 of a mechanism can gain control 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.670
 about people's lives 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.250
 and the more mystical and esoteric they were 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.030
 education and more dependent on the figure of a 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.979
 priest you become better for them 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.619
 makes it easier to keep a little 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.899
 blind obedience and a 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.570
 Submission that does not question is as it says 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.340
 that prophet is lives of cattle people 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.720
 marked happy people 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.549
 those who teach such doctrines 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.439
 despising what the scriptures say 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.509
 on this subject are the enemies of the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.530
 cross of christ these do not want to enter 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.420
 in the kingdom of god 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.100
 and worse than that do not want to allow 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.540
 that you enter but not to say 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.619
 that all this video was based only 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.420
 in reviews 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.640
 Let's go to the scriptures. 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.099
 used to defend the concept of 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.020
 Hereditary curse is in exodus 20 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.940
 there it is written that god visits 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.770
 equality of the parents to the children 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.420
 third and fourth generation 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.430
 but defenders of this line of 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.410
 reasoning despise any 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.270
 verse should be read within your 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.580
 context and that even if the 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.410
 context it is not possible to find a 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.230
 reasonable response to a particular 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.750
 We should look at all the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.730
 biblical scripture is explained and not 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.010
 we need assumptions of supposed 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.690
 prophets of our time to try 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.490
 play with the script if 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.130
 let's look a little more carefully 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.620
 chapter 20 we will realize that the 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.870
 of a hearing is over all that 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.150
 who is disobedient to the commandments of 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.610
 god or the curses are for the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.980
 unholy not for those who are the people of 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.780
 God, this idea is so clear in the text that 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.510
 you even notice in the verse 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.730
 that the mercy of God is 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.040
 thousands of generations ago 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.930
 those who are obedient realize that 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.150
 this preference for the concept of 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.710
 curse is very convenient when 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.930
 people want to have control over their 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.090
 trying to rape the concept of 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.670
 obedience and try to make you a 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.680
 environment to them is very clear that 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.080
 God appears much more in this 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.120
 pass as a god of mercy from the 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.650
 that as a god who has an interest in 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.630
 punish someone but we do not 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.510
 stay only in this passage having a 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.310
 divided opinion between is and is not 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.980
 Let's look at the other chapter in the 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.110
 Ezekiel chapter 18 has a passage 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.110
 which states that the people of 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.200
 God would say that when parents like 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.780
 grapes children get dirty fingers 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.510
 this passage explicitly condemns the 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.090
 idea that the sins of a generation 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.840
 somehow reach the next 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.520
 generations 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.430
 and complements this reasoning in a 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.550
 very simple telling the soul to pekar 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.760
 this dying to every kind of curse 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.950
 that might have existed 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.560
 broken our life at the moment when 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.989
 we recognize the lordship of Christ over 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.540
 our life and that his sacrifice was 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.850
 sufficient not only to clean them from the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.430
 sin but also of all condemnation 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.950
 Christ made himself cursed in our place. 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.489
 therefore every curse that was upon 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.440
 we 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.130
 now it has fallen on him and any 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.220
 Attempt to help God pay for this. 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.380
 prices for the curses means 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.180
 deny the sacrifice of Christ on the cross and 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.800
 if these two passages were no longer 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.500
 enough people also come in the new 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.660
 testament jesus confirming the idea 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.120
 when Jesus meets the man who 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.250
 is blind from birth asks him if he 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.770
 was born in this way because of his 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.050
 sin or the sin of your parents 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.200
 and what was the answer of jesus he said 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.990
 that neither is a deep one 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.780
 transformation of understanding will be able to 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.000
 to truly liberate Christian from 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.830
 every curse and every game of 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.660
 oppression that religiosity is 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.390
 wanting to put on his life to the work 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.300
 redeemer of Christ is complete in the 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.200
 cross and nothing we do or do not 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.050
 do 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.760
 has the power to manipulate realities 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.030
 to save us 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.360
 complete salvation is in the person of 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.250
 and if someone still suffers or is 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.880
 imprisoned by evil such person still 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.430
 did not understand who Christ is and what 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.280
 importance of we submit to our 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.900
 life to your landlord and let the 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.720
 bullshit aside so we can 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.270
 live the true gospel that frees 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.460
 people with our lives and with 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.140
 Our practice I close this video for 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.850
