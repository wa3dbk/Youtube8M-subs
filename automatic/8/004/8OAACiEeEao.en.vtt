edge<00:01:57.880> as<00:01:58.060> well<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.600> all<00:01:59.500> over<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.070> boards<00:02:00.399> are

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
edge as well and all over the boards are

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.609 
edge as well and all over the boards are
actually<00:02:00.670> all<00:02:01.329> overboard<00:02:02.140> just<00:02:02.200> but<00:02:02.439> they

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
actually all overboard just but they

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.039 
actually all overboard just but they
don't<00:02:02.860> do<00:02:02.979> a<00:02:03.009> 360<00:02:03.790> wrap<00:02:04.060> with<00:02:04.659> their<00:02:04.780> edges

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
don't do a 360 wrap with their edges

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.070 
don't do a 360 wrap with their edges
they<00:02:05.439> save<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.710> lot<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:06.250> swing<00:02:06.610> weight<00:02:07.080> not

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
they save a lot of swing weight not

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.690 
they save a lot of swing weight not
having<00:02:08.560> that<00:02:08.739> just<00:02:08.920> they<00:02:08.979> go<00:02:09.099> all<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.670> way

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
having that just they go all the way

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.520 
having that just they go all the way
around<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.660> nose<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.170> tail<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.410> the

if you dig it on a rail it's going to
