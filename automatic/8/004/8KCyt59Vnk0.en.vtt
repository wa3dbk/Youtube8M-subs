 background I have in here with four 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:02:00.299
 liters of water 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:02:02.340

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.989

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:38.799
 even giving this one is the one that is a 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:42.939
 delicious celery and if you have 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:45.939
 something that can not stand something there 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:49.269
 you can replace the cabbage for more 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:51.400
 plus the turnip greens can not 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.519

 seasoned onion soup places places 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:21.840
 Everyone here likes growing up and there 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:39.549

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.609
 Kingdom 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:04:01.150
 remembering that down there I have four 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:04:08.049

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.759

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:19.870
 minutes 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:21.829
 lower the heat and leave 40 minutes capped 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.810
 and on low heat 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.400
 will turn this because all the vegetables 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.590

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.780
 render much more eyes cheeks smell 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.590
