 bye when 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.910
 our task is to establish the exact 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.359
 starting battery location 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.099
 control point 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.640
 turnover projects anthony 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.009
 the newest but weapons scouts are often 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.300
 using a knife 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.430
 she can be silent at the time but at the same time 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.880
 it was necessary to get close to him 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.920
 Closely our scouts decided 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.950
 make shooting 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.000
 another important silently arm 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.080
 underdeveloped special it 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.990
 like it was a combination 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.840
 weapons which is estimated 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.390
 then still devices 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.140
 for pistol shooting 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.660
 use cartridge ch 36 powder powder

 length blades 158 and meters 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.909
 initial bullet speed of 140 meters in 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:19.840
 give me a sec 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.330
 aimed shooting range of 25 meters 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
 the design I express ensures it 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.399
 multipurpose use 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.509
 they can cut and fair 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.029
 surpass steel get thick up 

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:35.250
 six meters 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.550
 for this to receive 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.580
 budgeted 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.870
 the share of ie6 will to pressing on the eggs and rubber

 hit of water and dirt when fired 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.800
 she does not interfere 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.910
 it would be possible to detain 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.600
 use 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.090
 it is worth trying 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.560
 wait a word place 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.560
 stated the head of the mechanism 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.630
 yak but what's wrong 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.630
 and make a shot 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.319
 our automation system before 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.029
 this gas in the world 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:18.929
 make a shot of such a push 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.929
 practically 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.749
 after the shot did not blow much on 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.309
 The photo on the left of the school is why but 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:30.719
 remarks about him 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.569
 devices 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.999
 can analysis or special nippers and 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.079
 could be tied pro in that 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.079
 energized 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.540
 but by itself a universal weapon 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.619
 especially in the right hands 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:47.869
 our shooting but some puck 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.099
 cases can replace
