00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:34.629
 yes but modifications of the songs 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.870
 to give it another rhythm with others 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.300

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.469

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.420
 different 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.400
 this will be a little more general to be the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.620
 first and will consist of up to three remixes 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.020
 which usually usually used in 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.630
 my videos I will put the links in the 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.450
 description and you can hear a brief 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.700
 part of the song in this video there 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.950
 let's start with the one that is sounding 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.140
 right now I know it for example on the top 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.259
 5 items and in the spin-off video 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.820
 of the saga it's a remix of the 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.090
 fields of jairo we can hear 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.850
 in twilight princess its creator disney 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.680
 I have managed to keep the magic of the subject 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 original and has created this wonder 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.340
 ah 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.250

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.700
 You may not have had your best today 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.380
 well at school or at work can 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.110
 I slipped you with your parents or your 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.390
 friends and you do not want to know about anyone is 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.180
 so when you should listen to this topic 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.010
 sanders leonys its creator has taken the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.900
 song of the lost forests of 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.160
 ocarina of time and has done this 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.380
 wonder 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.510
 even though this song is about 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.120
 all known for its fast pace that 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.520
 I would dance until the most vague chorus 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.530
 sanders has been enough to slow down the 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.450
 and add a perfect ambient sound 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.450
 to fall in love with this topic 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.909
 how 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:30.310
 and you can not finish the video without getting 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.719
 stefan castor remix created by jesse 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.370
 where I use the sounds of all 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.640
 zelda games to make this theme 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.969
 original by himself is simply 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.969
 cool 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.629
