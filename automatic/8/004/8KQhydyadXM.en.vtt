foundation brush is brilliant because

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.870 
foundation brush is brilliant because
it's<00:00:19.890> angled<00:00:20.280> so<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.430> works<00:00:20.640> with<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
it's angled so it works with the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.190 
it's angled so it works with the
contours<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.360> the<00:00:21.450> face<00:00:21.860> as<00:00:22.860> you<00:00:23.040> will<00:00:23.190> see<00:00:24.200> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
bit of a cooler tone then you might want

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.880 
bit of a cooler tone then you might want
to<00:01:10.490> swap<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.910> cooler<00:01:12.150> tone<00:01:12.450> Brown<00:01:12.890> and

to swap that for a cooler tone Brown and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.290 
to swap that for a cooler tone Brown and
then<00:01:14.009> I'm<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.220> gonna<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.700> lightly<00:01:15.150> just

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
then I'm just gonna really lightly just

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.140 
then I'm just gonna really lightly just
brush<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.810> through<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:17.910> to<00:01:18.000> make

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
brush this through and I want to make

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.420 
brush this through and I want to make
this<00:01:18.330> too<00:01:18.690> kind<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.530> harsh<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:19.950> angular

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
this too kind of harsh and angular

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.730 
this too kind of harsh and angular
because<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.930> supposed<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> look<00:01:22.470> really

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
because it's supposed to look really

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.670 
because it's supposed to look really
natural<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.369> that's<00:01:23.990> why<00:01:24.990> I'm<00:01:25.200> using<00:01:25.350> this

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
natural so that's why I'm using this

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.490 
natural so that's why I'm using this
brush<00:01:25.920> rather<00:01:26.190> than<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:27.000> brow<00:01:27.960> brush<00:01:28.229> which<00:01:28.470> has

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
brush rather than a brow brush which has

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.440 
brush rather than a brow brush which has
got<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> firmer<00:01:29.070> bristle<00:01:29.550> and<00:01:29.729> will<00:01:30.060> put<00:01:30.300> more

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
got a firmer bristle and will put more

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.859 
got a firmer bristle and will put more
product<00:01:30.720> onto<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> skin<00:01:35.270> if<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:36.450> natural

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
product onto the skin if your natural

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.060 
product onto the skin if your natural
brows<00:01:37.050> are<00:01:37.259> quite<00:01:37.440> dark<00:01:37.710> then<00:01:37.890> there's

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
brows are quite dark then there's

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.469 
brows are quite dark then there's
probably<00:01:38.369> no<00:01:38.580> need<00:01:38.729> for<00:01:38.910> you<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.000> fill<00:01:39.180> them<00:01:39.390> in

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
probably no need for you to fill them in

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.029 
probably no need for you to fill them in
you<00:01:39.660> may<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.840> able<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.140> get<00:01:40.289> away<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.500> by

you may be able to get away just by

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.469 
you may be able to get away just by
