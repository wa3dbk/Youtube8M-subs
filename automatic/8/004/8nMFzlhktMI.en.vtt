00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.720 
like it was kind of stiff so I've added
a<00:02:12.600> jump<00:02:13.020> ring<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.560> top<00:02:13.770> just<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.400> give<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.670> a

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
a jump ring on the top just to give it a

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.670 
a jump ring on the top just to give it a
little<00:02:14.970> bit<00:02:15.120> more<00:02:15.360> movement<00:02:15.569> uh-huh<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.530> what

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
little bit more movement uh-huh is what

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.770 
little bit more movement uh-huh is what
happens<00:02:17.100> if<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.340> get<00:02:17.520> just<00:02:18.000> if<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.420> tried<00:02:18.660> to

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
happens if you get just if you tried to

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.570 
happens if you get just if you tried to
add<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.080> directly<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.860> your<00:02:20.040> necklace<00:02:20.400> it

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
add this directly to your necklace it

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.780 
add this directly to your necklace it
would<00:02:20.670> be<00:02:20.790> pretty<00:02:21.060> stiff

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
would be pretty stiff

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.660 
would be pretty stiff
so<00:02:22.629> I<00:02:22.659> want<00:02:22.989> as<00:02:23.080> much<00:02:23.260> as<00:02:23.530> much<00:02:24.099> you<00:02:24.640> know

so I want as much as much you know

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.780 
so I want as much as much you know

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
variation and and movement it as I can

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.740 
variation and and movement it as I can
get<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.690> when<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.870> come<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.200> assemble<00:02:30.360> what<00:02:31.360> what

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
get so when I come to assemble what what

made my my sort of line of beads I try
to<00:02:37.480> arrange<00:02:38.140> them<00:02:38.500> in<00:02:38.799> a<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.250> know<00:02:39.310> kind<00:02:39.519> of<00:02:39.670> a

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
to arrange them in a you know kind of a

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.309 
to arrange them in a you know kind of a
nice<00:02:39.910> way<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.360> like<00:02:40.629> so<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:40.989> just<00:02:41.140> go

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
nice way that I like so you just go

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.710 
nice way that I like so you just go
ahead<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.709> do<00:02:41.890> all<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:43.090> dangles<00:02:43.480> for

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
ahead and do all of the dangles for

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.900 
ahead and do all of the dangles for
right<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:44.140> do<00:02:44.200> all<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.620> dangles<00:02:45.129> and<00:02:45.310> then<00:02:45.879> I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
right I do all the dangles and then I

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.180 
right I do all the dangles and then I
start<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:47.019> thread<00:02:47.290> them<00:02:47.500> on<00:02:47.650> my<00:02:47.860> choker

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
start to just thread them on my choker

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.970 
start to just thread them on my choker
but<00:02:48.760> what<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:48.940> like<00:02:49.239> is<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> little<00:02:49.629> bit<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.530> glitz

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
but what I like is a little bit of glitz

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.460 
but what I like is a little bit of glitz
and<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.579> wiggle<00:02:52.090> in<00:02:52.239> between<00:02:52.659> so<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.019> will<00:02:53.349> have

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
and and wiggle in between so I will have

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.979 
and and wiggle in between so I will have
a<00:02:53.500> tendency<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.160> throw<00:02:54.340> on<00:02:54.640> some<00:02:55.540> extra

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
a tendency to throw on some extra

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.830 
a tendency to throw on some extra
paddles<00:02:56.590> or<00:02:56.890> maybe<00:02:57.640> some<00:02:58.030> beads<00:02:58.299> with<00:02:58.540> round

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
paddles or maybe some beads with round

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.039 
paddles or maybe some beads with round
larger<00:02:59.709> round<00:02:59.950> holes<00:03:00.280> oh<00:03:00.670> that's<00:03:01.030> fun<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.510> it

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
larger round holes oh that's fun and it

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.990 
larger round holes oh that's fun and it
makes<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.500> lot<00:03:02.650> more<00:03:02.829> nice<00:03:03.010> pleasant<00:03:03.459> spaces

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
makes it a lot more nice pleasant spaces

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.330 
makes it a lot more nice pleasant spaces
the<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.870> bangles<00:03:05.319> what<00:03:05.530> happens<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.129> if<00:03:06.280> you

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
the the bangles what happens is if you

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.949 
the the bangles what happens is if you
get<00:03:06.519> them<00:03:06.670> too<00:03:06.879> close<00:03:07.120> they<00:03:07.359> they<00:03:07.660> just<00:03:07.840> sort

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
get them too close they they just sort

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.390 
get them too close they they just sort
of<00:03:08.019> clump<00:03:08.319> up<00:03:08.500> so<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.579> also<00:03:09.879> just<00:03:10.120> thread<00:03:10.660> on

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
of clump up so I also just thread on

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.089 
of clump up so I also just thread on
charms<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.640> don't<00:03:12.849> have<00:03:13.060> any<00:03:13.680> head<00:03:14.680> pins<00:03:14.950> on

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
charms that don't have any head pins on

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.190 
charms that don't have any head pins on
them<00:03:15.250> whatsoever<00:03:15.549> which<00:03:16.450> gives<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> lot<00:03:17.049> of

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
them whatsoever which gives you a lot of

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.650 
them whatsoever which gives you a lot of
variation<00:03:17.739> in<00:03:17.890> length<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.180> tend<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.510> like

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
variation in length so I tend to like

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.650 
variation in length so I tend to like
this<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.079> also<00:03:20.379> here's<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:21.209> nice<00:03:22.209> one<00:03:22.239> here

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
this and also here's a nice one here

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.330 
this and also here's a nice one here
with<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.959> shell<00:03:23.849> that's<00:03:24.849> pretty<00:03:25.180> yeah<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:27.040> I

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
with the shell that's pretty yeah so I

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.890 
with the shell that's pretty yeah so I
like<00:03:27.700> that<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:28.030> have<00:03:28.239> different<00:03:28.450> sizes

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
like that you have different sizes

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.289 
like that you have different sizes
different<00:03:29.859> texture<00:03:30.370> right<00:03:30.609> different<00:03:31.180> yeah

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
different texture right different yeah

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.670 
different texture right different yeah
they<00:03:31.690> all<00:03:31.810> have<00:03:31.930> each<00:03:32.049> have<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.260> different<00:03:32.590> kind

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
they all have each have a different kind

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.860 
they all have each have a different kind
of<00:03:32.769> movement<00:03:33.010> right<00:03:33.459> they<00:03:33.819> do<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.329> that's

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
of movement right they do and that's

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.319 
of movement right they do and that's
what<00:03:35.019> makes<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.319> really<00:03:35.470> nice<00:03:35.739> exactly<00:03:36.519> so<00:03:37.060> and

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
what makes it really nice exactly so and

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.569 
what makes it really nice exactly so and
the<00:03:37.500> variations<00:03:38.500> then<00:03:38.739> once<00:03:38.980> you<00:03:39.160> get<00:03:39.370> this

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
the variations then once you get this

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.150 
the variations then once you get this
sort<00:03:39.880> of<00:03:40.000> theory<00:03:40.989> down<00:03:41.230> you<00:03:41.470> can<00:03:41.650> really<00:03:41.919> take

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
sort of theory down you can really take

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.789 
sort of theory down you can really take
it<00:03:42.340> however<00:03:42.549> you<00:03:42.819> want<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.599> as<00:03:44.169> you<00:03:44.440> can<00:03:44.590> see

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
it however you want and as you can see

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.309 
it however you want and as you can see
over<00:03:44.950> here<00:03:45.430> if<00:03:45.609> you<00:03:46.120> make<00:03:46.359> a<00:03:46.599> simple<00:03:46.959> wrapped

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
over here if you make a simple wrapped

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.289 
over here if you make a simple wrapped
hanger<00:03:47.889> you<00:03:48.160> can<00:03:48.340> accomplish<00:03:48.730> sort<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.209> the

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
hanger you can accomplish sort of the

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.720 
hanger you can accomplish sort of the
same<00:03:49.540> thing<00:03:49.780> without<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.200> choker<00:03:50.470> look<00:03:50.950> so

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
same thing without the choker look so

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.490 
same thing without the choker look so
you<00:03:51.819> just<00:03:52.090> get<00:03:52.239> all<00:03:52.389> of<00:03:52.569> everything<00:03:52.870> made<00:03:53.169> your

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
you just get all of everything made your

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.430 
you just get all of everything made your
stringing<00:03:53.889> on<00:03:53.980> together<00:03:54.190> just<00:03:54.790> close<00:03:55.030> up<00:03:55.180> your

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
stringing on together just close up your

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.470
