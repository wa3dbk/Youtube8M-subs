Cold<00:01:24.780> Steve<00:01:24.990> Austin<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> rock

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.210 

on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.420> court<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.930> don't<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.619> myself<00:01:31.799> being

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
on the court I don't see myself being

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.969

more<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> rock<00:01:32.940> I<00:01:33.330> think<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> rock<00:01:34.110> flares

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
more of the rock I think the rock flares

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.460 
more of the rock I think the rock flares
and<00:01:35.310> has<00:01:35.790> too<00:01:36.030> much<00:01:36.180> Showtime<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.020> him<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.440> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and has too much Showtime in him so I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.770 
and has too much Showtime in him so I
don't<00:01:37.800> really<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.250> all<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.640> flopping<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.360> lot

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
don't really do all that flopping a lot

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.380 
don't really do all that flopping a lot
so<00:01:40.140> I'll<00:01:40.380> probably<00:01:40.530> say<00:01:40.830> no<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.550> I<00:01:41.970> think

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
so I'll probably say no to that I think

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.749 
so I'll probably say no to that I think
I'm<00:01:42.540> more<00:01:42.690> of<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.990> stone-cold<00:01:43.650> you<00:01:44.340> know<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.520> go
