00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.550
 arrives in the area that was the dance of the flip or 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.230
 who chips 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.360
 in this key frame video or 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.130
 explain the difference between the names of 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.260
 maneuvers you have here 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.920
 When did you arrive in Brazil and like the chicken? 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.920
 call green 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.050
 good people first maneuver that more 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.580
 confused about the bonuses is the flip 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.580
 with the clip that's it from here 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.480
 here in brazil is philips and in gringa it 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.820
 Felipe calls the team and here in Brazil 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.820
 Which is what Felipe is from here. 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.600
 what in the gringa there are called 360 flip or 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.550
 360 kickflip or simply 135 flip 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.860
 so you have to pay attention to 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.930
 to July when you go to watch a video 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.100
 especially that Bergued lipstick 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.079
 when he comes back through the maneuvers 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.910
 underneath another maneuver that confuses 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.770
 enough in relation to Vamos is the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.600
 rock'n'roll or rock'n'roll and only when 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.170
 you back to the elite frontside the beque 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.549
 site 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.520
 So this means that this is a 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.920
 rock faith and not okay with rock'n'roll and 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.110
 only when you dock and turn one of the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.560
 bases 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.560
 This is rock'n'roll. 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.340
 he also ordered that the biggest confusion 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.210
 that exists in relation to names of 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.740
 maneuvers 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.200
 it's a mess that rockslide exists 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.030
 boardslide and philips lighting 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.729
 so well guys I 'm regular 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.450
 entering from frontside with the brother I gave 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.860
 here o 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.259
 This in Brazil, we call it 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.560
 frontside hawks haiti but a certain 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.569
 name of this work is frontside boardslide and 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.219
 because it confuses a lot because here 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.380
 brazil that is called frontside boardslide 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.240
 that's when the train passes over into ap 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.939
 here I am regular box 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.610
 the sure is lipslide frontside then the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.679
 confusion is what rock cleide the right is 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.709
 boardslide and what is borislav here at 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.450
 Brazil, the right one is lipslide, I'm going to give 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.310
 four new ones for you and I'll put the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.270
 name that is here in Brazil that the name 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.270
 Call staff in gringa there. 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.420
 This is it, guys, it was the video 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.210
 spoke difference of the names of the maneuvers 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.550
 here and there in the gringa are few maneuvers 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.320
 but it confuses a little to who looks 20 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.700
 even for the people who asked me why 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.320
 saw in the video game 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.690
 but the most important thing is that it does not help 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.550
 You want to call Flip Flip all over 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.950
 world calls flip much less call 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.890
 lipslide lipslide or rockslide 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.110
 boardslide the galley calls rockslide and 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.060
 even if you just have a notion 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.500
 that has this difference for people who 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.660
 You are doubtfully asking in the 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.490
