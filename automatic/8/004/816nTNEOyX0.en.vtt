guess<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.720> answer<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.680> ear<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
guess the answer is in the ear of the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
two feet away from my face right now

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.050 
two feet away from my face right now
I'm<00:03:18.870> scratchy<00:03:19.290> I'm<00:03:19.440> going<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.620> scratch<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:21.440> so

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
I'm scratchy I'm going to scratch it so

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.340 
I'm scratchy I'm going to scratch it so
this<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.299> mic<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:24.840> don't<00:03:25.079> know<00:03:25.140> how<00:03:25.230> much

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
this is the mic I don't know how much

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.440 
this is the mic I don't know how much
better<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.769> sounds<00:03:25.980> than<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.430> ambient<00:03:26.610> mic

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
better it sounds than the ambient mic

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.530 
better it sounds than the ambient mic
and<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:29.400> think<00:03:29.670> I'm<00:03:29.790> doing<00:03:30.000> something<00:03:30.090> wrong

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
and I think I'm doing something wrong

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.080 
and I think I'm doing something wrong
because<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.680> same<00:03:31.980> result<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.880> had

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
because this is the same result I had

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.910 
because this is the same result I had
with<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:34.410> rode<00:03:34.620> videomic<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.320> don't<00:03:37.829> know

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
with the rode videomic so I don't know

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.470 
with the rode videomic so I don't know
what<00:03:38.070> else<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.370> could<00:03:38.549> do<00:03:38.700> I<00:03:38.910> have<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.299> mic

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
what else I could do I have the mic

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.390 
what else I could do I have the mic
plugged<00:03:39.810> into<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.290> mic<00:03:40.440> port<00:03:42.410> and<00:03:43.410> there's

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
plugged into the mic port and there's

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.949 
plugged into the mic port and there's
not<00:03:44.579> really<00:03:44.790> many<00:03:44.970> settings<00:03:45.420> I'm<00:03:45.600> using<00:03:45.810> a

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
not really many settings I'm using a

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.890 
not really many settings I'm using a
Canon<00:03:46.230> t3i<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.329> ambient<00:03:48.630> mic

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
Canon t3i and this is the ambient mic

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.199 
Canon t3i and this is the ambient mic
now<00:03:49.109> this<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.220> recording<00:03:50.700> with<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:50.910> ambient

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
now this is a recording with the ambient

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.470 
now this is a recording with the ambient
mic<00:03:51.510> I've<00:03:52.549> unplugged<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.730> microphone<00:03:54.180> on<00:03:54.359> top

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
mic I've unplugged the microphone on top

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.300 
mic I've unplugged the microphone on top
so<00:03:56.020> we<00:03:56.170> could<00:03:56.319> see<00:03:56.500> if<00:03:56.890> there's<00:03:57.190> any

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
so we could see if there's any

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.020 
so we could see if there's any
difference<00:03:57.760> at<00:03:57.940> all<00:03:57.970> between<00:03:59.010> the<00:04:00.030> additional

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
difference at all between the additional

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.710 
difference at all between the additional
mic<00:04:01.180> or<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.690> on-board<00:04:02.560> camera<00:04:02.920> mic<00:04:03.720> they'll

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
mic or the on-board camera mic they'll

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.300 
mic or the on-board camera mic they'll
probably<00:04:04.900> be<00:04:05.080> a<00:04:05.110> slight<00:04:05.410> difference<00:04:05.590> but<00:04:06.040> not

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
probably be a slight difference but not

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.059 
probably be a slight difference but not
that<00:04:06.550> dramatic<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:07.180> one<00:04:07.390> it's<00:04:08.379> possible<00:04:08.650> that

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
that dramatic of one it's possible that

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.009 
that dramatic of one it's possible that
the<00:04:09.220> Canon<00:04:09.610> built-in<00:04:10.000> mic<00:04:10.209> is<00:04:10.420> just<00:04:10.660> as<00:04:10.810> good

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
the Canon built-in mic is just as good

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.059 
the Canon built-in mic is just as good
as<00:04:11.260> any<00:04:12.190> as<00:04:12.580> any<00:04:13.150> add-on<00:04:13.569> mic<00:04:13.810> I<00:04:14.050> doubt<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:14.830> but

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
as any as any add-on mic I doubt it but

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.430 
as any as any add-on mic I doubt it but
it's<00:04:15.220> possible<00:04:15.670> in<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.660> end<00:04:17.700> this<00:04:18.700> microphone

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
it's possible in the end this microphone

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.129 
it's possible in the end this microphone
performed<00:04:20.790> slightly<00:04:21.790> below<00:04:22.300> what<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.840> video

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
performed slightly below what the video

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200
