we're looking at it right now we got an

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.170 
we're looking at it right now we got an
over-under<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.500> 195<00:00:20.369> coming<00:00:20.699> into<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:20.970> game

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.970 
over-under of 195 coming into this game
pretty<00:00:21.510> much<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:21.900> would<00:00:22.080> see<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:22.710> far

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
pretty much what we would see in so far

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.590 
pretty much what we would see in so far
but<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.670> know<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.789> don't<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.269> any<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.539> these

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
but you know I don't see any of these

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.769 
but you know I don't see any of these
games<00:00:24.779> going<00:00:25.140> over<00:00:25.380> what<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.830> think<00:00:26.779> in

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
games going over what do you think in

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.990 
games going over what do you think in
terms<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.439> total<00:00:28.859> i<00:00:29.189> would<00:00:29.340> definitely<00:00:29.670> lean

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
terms of total i would definitely lean

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.139 
terms of total i would definitely lean
towards<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> under<00:00:31.199> i<00:00:31.230> think<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:32.640> saw<00:00:32.880> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
towards the under i think that we saw a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.630 
towards the under i think that we saw a
Cavs<00:00:33.510> team<00:00:33.930> that's<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.260> bit<00:00:34.410> fatigued<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.250> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
Cavs team that's a bit fatigued and a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.420 
Cavs team that's a bit fatigued and a
little<00:00:35.850> bit<00:00:35.969> confused<00:00:36.570> as<00:00:37.469> far<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.040> what<00:00:38.280> they

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
little bit confused as far as what they

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.060 
little bit confused as far as what they
need<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.700> be<00:00:38.820> doing<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.800> Golden<00:00:40.800> State's

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
need to be doing and Golden State's

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.830 
need to be doing and Golden State's
going<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.370> play<00:00:41.579> as<00:00:41.850> strongly<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:42.600> did<00:00:42.809> on

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
going to play as strongly as they did on

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.889 
going to play as strongly as they did on
the<00:00:43.020> defensive<00:00:43.559> end<00:00:44.149> just<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.270> offensive<00:00:45.809> end

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the defensive end just the offensive end

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.240 
the defensive end just the offensive end
which<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.200> getting<00:00:46.350> all<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> attention<00:00:46.710> then

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
which is getting all the attention then

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.560 
which is getting all the attention then
you<00:00:47.340> know<00:00:47.460> under<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.910> definitely<00:00:48.300> going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> be

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
you know under is definitely going to be

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.930 
you know under is definitely going to be
the<00:00:48.719> way<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.870> go<00:00:48.960> here<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.469> now<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.309> Cavs<00:00:50.579> opened

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the way to go here I now the Cavs opened

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.869 
the way to go here I now the Cavs opened
up<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.180> game<00:00:51.420> at<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.199> plus-9<00:00:52.680> there<00:00:53.489> right<00:00:53.699> now

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
up this game at a plus-9 there right now

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.600 
up this game at a plus-9 there right now
at<00:00:54.090> plus<00:00:54.329> eight<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.649> see<00:00:56.010> them<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
at plus eight what do you see them that

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.000 
at plus eight what do you see them that
they<00:00:56.760> need<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.059> do<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.539> come<00:00:57.899> back<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> cover

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
they need to do to come back and cover

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.889 
they need to do to come back and cover
that<00:00:59.219> spread<00:00:59.520> well<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> think<00:01:00.629> they're

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
that spread well I think they're

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.240 
that spread well I think they're
probably<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.559> cover<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> spread<00:01:02.160> I

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
probably going to cover the spread I

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.380 
probably going to cover the spread I
don't<00:01:02.520> think<00:01:02.699> they're<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> play<00:01:03.210> as

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
don't think they're going to play as

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.479 
don't think they're going to play as
poorly<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:04.080> they<00:01:04.439> did<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> last<00:01:04.949> time<00:01:05.250> around

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
poorly as they did the last time around

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.760 
poorly as they did the last time around
delhi<00:01:06.390> dhaba<00:01:06.659> three<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.200> 14<00:01:07.500> from<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> field

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
so if those guys can shoot a little bit

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.950 
so if those guys can shoot a little bit
better<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.830> they<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.520> slow<00:01:20.820> down<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.270> pace<00:01:21.780> of

better if they can slow down the pace of
the<00:01:22.020> game<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.409> think<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.280> cover<00:01:23.700> I

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
the game I think that they can cover I

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
the game I think that they can cover I
don't<00:01:24.090> know<00:01:24.150> if<00:01:24.210> they'll<00:01:24.330> win<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> think

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
don't know if they'll win but I think

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140 
don't know if they'll win but I think
they<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.140> cobble<00:01:25.490> all<00:01:26.490> right<00:01:26.670> all<00:01:26.820> right<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
they can cobble all right all right and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.819 
they can cobble all right all right and
now<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.960> go<00:01:28.110> into<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> Warriors<00:01:28.680> now

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
now like we go into the Warriors now

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
I don't really see that happening either

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.690 
I don't really see that happening either
even<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> way<00:01:35.189> they've<00:01:35.369> been<00:01:35.460> playing

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
even with the way they've been playing

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.280 
even with the way they've been playing
really<00:01:36.210> happy<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.840> inclusion<00:01:37.229> of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
really happy to see the inclusion of

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.859 
really happy to see the inclusion of
David<00:01:37.590> Lee<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.890> Andre<00:01:38.130> Iguodala<00:01:38.869> however

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
David Lee and Andre Iguodala however

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.090 
David Lee and Andre Iguodala however
that<00:01:39.930> eight<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> half<00:01:40.320> lines<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.890> steep

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that eight and a half lines a bit steep

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.249 
that eight and a half lines a bit steep
don't<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.400> think<00:01:41.579> well<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.509> saw<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.780> Warriors

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
don't you think well we saw the Warriors

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.530 
don't you think well we saw the Warriors
in<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.530> position<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.220> against<00:01:45.030> Memphis

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
in a position like this against Memphis

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.719 
in a position like this against Memphis
they<00:01:45.780> remember<00:01:46.409> we're<00:01:46.590> down<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.310> made<00:01:47.610> us

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
they remember we're down to one made us

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.030 
they remember we're down to one made us
made<00:01:48.119> an<00:01:48.270> adjustment<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:49.530> rolled<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
made an adjustment and then rolled the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.010 
made an adjustment and then rolled the
rest<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> way<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.970> think<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.540> issue<00:01:51.720> here

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
rest of the way I think the issue here

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.990 
rest of the way I think the issue here
for<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.290> Cavs<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.340> they<00:01:53.490> don't<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.759> an

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
for the Cavs is that they don't have an

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.300 
for the Cavs is that they don't have an
answer<00:01:54.740> necessarily<00:01:55.740> kind<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
answer necessarily kind of like the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.370 
answer necessarily kind of like the
Grizzlies<00:01:56.729> did<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> calves<00:01:57.299> are<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.719> thin<00:01:58.110> as

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
Grizzlies did the calves are so thin as

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.929 
Grizzlies did the calves are so thin as
it<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.950> don't<00:01:59.280> know<00:01:59.460> what<00:01:59.700> type<00:01:59.909> of

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
it is I don't know what type of

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.510 
it is I don't know what type of
adjustment<00:02:00.180> they<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.899> really<00:02:01.170> make<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.799> if

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
adjustment they can really make so if

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.039 
adjustment they can really make so if
you're<00:02:02.700> banking<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.509> Golden<00:02:03.810> State

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
you're banking on the Golden State

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.749 
you're banking on the Golden State
covering<00:02:04.560> you're<00:02:04.860> expecting<00:02:05.460> them<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.640> be

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
covering you're expecting them to be

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.059 
covering you're expecting them to be
even<00:02:06.119> more<00:02:06.360> confident<00:02:07.049> remember<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.799> played

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
even more confident remember it played

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.740 
even more confident remember it played
really<00:02:08.280> well<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.819> fourth<00:02:09.209> quarter<00:02:09.509> of

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
really well in the fourth quarter of

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.260 
really well in the fourth quarter of
game<00:02:10.170> number<00:02:10.800> three<00:02:10.979> they<00:02:11.550> played<00:02:11.790> great<00:02:11.970> from

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
game number three they played great from

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.520 
game number three they played great from
start<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.720> finish

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
start to finish

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.350 
start to finish
in<00:02:13.890> Game<00:02:14.069> forward<00:02:14.400> like<00:02:14.550> Momentum's<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.209> their

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
in Game forward like Momentum's on their

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.330 
in Game forward like Momentum's on their
side<00:02:15.569> so<00:02:15.870> now<00:02:16.319> they're<00:02:16.500> back<00:02:16.620> at<00:02:16.860> home<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.220> you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
side so now they're back at home if you

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.910 
side so now they're back at home if you
think<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.760> all<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.959> compounds<00:02:19.800> into

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
think that all of that compounds into

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.970 
think that all of that compounds into
one<00:02:20.250> if<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.420> even<00:02:21.660> makes<00:02:21.690> sense<00:02:22.140> then<00:02:22.350> yeah

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
one if that even makes sense then yeah

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.040 
one if that even makes sense then yeah
they<00:02:23.160> can<00:02:23.310> definitely<00:02:23.670> cover<00:02:23.880> all<00:02:24.720> right<00:02:24.900> they

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
they can definitely cover all right they

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.559 
they can definitely cover all right they
so<00:02:25.110> Game<00:02:25.560> five<00:02:25.830> Oracle's<00:02:26.340> Sunday<00:02:26.940> what's<00:02:27.450> your

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
so Game five Oracle's Sunday what's your

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.750 
so Game five Oracle's Sunday what's your
top<00:02:27.720> pick<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.170> one<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.530> like<00:02:29.040> calves<00:02:29.340> plus

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
top pick for this one I like calves plus

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.630 
top pick for this one I like calves plus
the<00:02:29.940> points<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.600> liked<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.230> more<00:02:31.500> at<00:02:31.770> nine<00:02:32.160> then

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
the points I liked it more at nine then

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.940 
the points I liked it more at nine then
8<00:02:33.080> obviously<00:02:34.080> I'd<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.800> extra

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
8 obviously I'd like to have that extra

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.860 
8 obviously I'd like to have that extra
point<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:35.550> i<00:02:35.580> think<00:02:35.880> i<00:02:36.090> think<00:02:36.540> they<00:02:36.660> play

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
point but i think i think they play

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.040 
point but i think i think they play
better<00:02:37.110> i<00:02:37.230> think<00:02:37.350> Golden<00:02:37.800> State<00:02:38.010> does<00:02:38.040> win<00:02:38.610> and

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
better i think Golden State does win and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.020 
better i think Golden State does win and
probably<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.290> looks<00:02:41.100> more<00:02:41.160> like<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.730> Golden

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
probably is looks more like the Golden

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.580 
probably is looks more like the Golden
State<00:02:42.270> team<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.720> we've<00:02:42.900> known<00:02:43.230> throughout

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590

the regular season and most of the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.210 
the regular season and most of the
