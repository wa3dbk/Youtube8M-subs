hey guys today we got a 2002 GMC Envoy

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.440 
hey guys today we got a 2002 GMC Envoy
with<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:04.160> concern<00:00:05.160> that<00:00:05.190> it<00:00:05.730> won't<00:00:05.970> come<00:00:06.060> out<00:00:06.299> of

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
with a concern that it won't come out of

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.169 
with a concern that it won't come out of

neutral and as you'll be able to see

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.400 
neutral and as you'll be able to see
here<00:00:10.130> won't<00:00:11.130> even<00:00:11.370> crank<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.790> start<00:00:12.090> either<00:00:12.410> so

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
here won't even crank to start either so

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.530 
here won't even crank to start either so
I<00:00:13.830> managed<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.429> get<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.670> shifter<00:00:15.030> into<00:00:15.269> park

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
I managed to get the shifter into park

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.130 
I managed to get the shifter into park
once<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.900> got<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> garage<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:18.140> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
once I got it in the garage and the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.599 
once I got it in the garage and the
shifter<00:00:19.500> won't<00:00:19.650> come<00:00:19.800> out<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.039> park<00:00:20.279> as<00:00:20.490> you

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
shifter won't come out of park as you

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.240 
shifter won't come out of park as you
can<00:00:20.760> see<00:00:20.910> my<00:00:21.060> foots<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.510> brake<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:23.130> I

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
can see my foots on the brake and I

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.890 
can see my foots on the brake and I
can't<00:00:23.519> even<00:00:23.699> squeeze<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> little<00:00:24.480> release

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
can't even squeeze a little release

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.009 
can't even squeeze a little release
lever<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.439> ship<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.859> vehicle<00:00:26.480> also<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:27.990> a

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
lever to ship the vehicle also we have a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.890 
lever to ship the vehicle also we have a
no<00:00:28.500> crank<00:00:28.859> condition<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> vehicle<00:00:30.630> still

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
no crank condition but the vehicle still

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.049 
no crank condition but the vehicle still
rolls<00:00:31.430> without<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.850> emergency<00:00:33.510> brake<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.980> so

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
rolls without the emergency brake on so

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.360 
rolls without the emergency brake on so
what<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.090> did<00:00:36.210> was<00:00:36.630> first<00:00:37.320> thing<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.680> suspected

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
what I did was first thing I suspected

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.190 
what I did was first thing I suspected
was<00:00:38.550> broken<00:00:39.469> transmission<00:00:40.469> shift<00:00:40.710> cable<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:42.030> I

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
was broken transmission shift cable so I

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.650 
was broken transmission shift cable so I
got<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.350> up<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.649> my<00:00:43.800> rack<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.430> go<00:00:45.390> ahead<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
got it up on my rack here go ahead and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:57.380 
got it up on my rack here go ahead and
raise<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.350> up

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.119 

be<00:00:57.840> able<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.260> underneath<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:58.950> check

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
be able to get underneath it and check

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.700 
be able to get underneath it and check
out<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> shift<00:00:59.730> cable

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.120 

get<00:01:04.190> about<00:01:04.430> 41<00:01:05.000> inches<00:01:05.030> of<00:01:05.690> lift<00:01:06.080> height<00:01:06.350> with

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
get about 41 inches of lift height with

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.649 
get about 41 inches of lift height with
this<00:01:07.310> lift<00:01:07.549> it's<00:01:07.790> not<00:01:07.970> bad<00:01:08.180> at<00:01:08.360> all<00:01:08.450> it's

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
this lift it's not bad at all it's

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.969 
this lift it's not bad at all it's
pretty<00:01:08.840> good<00:01:08.990> I<00:01:09.290> like<00:01:09.650> it<00:01:10.930> it's<00:01:11.930> just<00:01:12.380> perfect

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
pretty good I like it it's just perfect

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.660 
pretty good I like it it's just perfect
for<00:01:13.040> this<00:01:13.250> garage

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.940 

okay<00:01:19.670> let's<00:01:20.210> take<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:20.540> look<00:01:20.659> underneath<00:01:21.110> here

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.980 

and<00:01:24.950> sure<00:01:25.340> enough<00:01:25.370> right<00:01:25.880> there<00:01:26.180> you<00:01:26.630> can<00:01:26.810> see

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
and sure enough right there you can see

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.830 
and sure enough right there you can see
the<00:01:27.110> broken<00:01:27.320> transmission<00:01:28.250> shift<00:01:28.840> cable

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
the broken transmission shift cable

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.649 
the broken transmission shift cable
right<00:01:30.110> there<00:01:30.409> little<00:01:31.340> bushing<00:01:31.880> goes<00:01:32.060> bad<00:01:32.360> and

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
right there little bushing goes bad and

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.050 
right there little bushing goes bad and
they<00:01:33.020> break<00:01:33.290> off<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.490> here's<00:01:34.940> your

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
they break off so here's your

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.340 
they break off so here's your
transmission<00:01:35.750> shift<00:01:37.570> lever<00:01:38.570> right<00:01:38.900> here

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
transmission shift lever right here

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.540 
transmission shift lever right here
so<00:01:40.100> that's<00:01:40.310> Park<00:01:40.670> reverse<00:01:41.330> neutral<00:01:41.800> Drive<00:01:42.800> the

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
so that's Park reverse neutral Drive the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.550 
so that's Park reverse neutral Drive the
reason<00:01:43.970> it<00:01:44.090> was<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.240> crank<00:01:44.570> notes<00:01:44.900> are<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.170> no

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
reason it was a crank notes are a no

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.340 
reason it was a crank notes are a no
crank<00:01:45.860> no<00:01:46.100> start<00:01:46.460> was<00:01:47.300> because<00:01:47.750> the

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
crank no start was because the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.219 
crank no start was because the
transmission<00:01:49.009> was<00:01:49.130> in<00:01:49.340> Drive<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:50.720> we<00:01:51.020> shifted

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
transmission was in Drive so we shifted

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.940 
transmission was in Drive so we shifted
into<00:01:51.530> park<00:01:51.860> now<00:01:52.850> it'll<00:01:53.090> start<00:01:53.119> just<00:01:53.600> fine<00:01:53.950> so

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
into park now it'll start just fine so

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.430 
into park now it'll start just fine so
I've<00:01:55.070> got<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.460> replacement<00:01:56.060> part<00:01:56.330> over<00:01:56.660> here

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.499 

we've<00:02:00.440> got<00:02:00.470> and<00:02:01.100> put<00:02:01.399> this<00:02:01.580> new<00:02:01.789> shift<00:02:02.060> cable

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
we've got and put this new shift cable

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.200 
we've got and put this new shift cable
in<00:02:02.679> see<00:02:03.679> what<00:02:03.830> happens<00:02:04.190> okay

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
in see what happens okay

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.930 
in see what happens okay
new<00:02:05.570> shift<00:02:05.929> cable<00:02:06.920> has<00:02:07.130> been<00:02:07.250> installed<00:02:07.610> and

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
new shift cable has been installed and

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.020 
new shift cable has been installed and
is<00:02:08.810> connected<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.769> shifter<00:02:10.429> there<00:02:10.610> on<00:02:10.820> the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
is connected to the shifter there on the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.270 
is connected to the shifter there on the
side<00:02:11.209> of<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.360> transmission<00:02:11.800> let's<00:02:12.800> go<00:02:13.010> see<00:02:13.220> if

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
side of the transmission let's go see if

00:02:13.280 --> 00:03:02.940 
side of the transmission let's go see if
this<00:02:13.489> fixes<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:14.000> problem

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.830 

there<00:03:03.550> you<00:03:03.700> go<00:03:04.180> probably<00:03:04.840> fixed<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.680> salt<00:03:05.950> was

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
there you go probably fixed it salt was

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.630 
there you go probably fixed it salt was
the<00:03:07.840> reason<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.440> wasn't<00:03:08.890> allowed<00:03:09.069> to<00:03:09.130> come<00:03:09.520> out

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
the reason I wasn't allowed to come out

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.339 
the reason I wasn't allowed to come out
of<00:03:09.760> park<00:03:10.030> or<00:03:10.209> out<00:03:10.300> of<00:03:10.420> neutral<00:03:10.599> in<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.050> case

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
of park or out of neutral in this case

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.570 
of park or out of neutral in this case
is<00:03:11.620> because<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:13.450> transmission<00:03:14.260> was<00:03:15.010> still<00:03:15.370> in

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
is because the transmission was still in

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.320 
is because the transmission was still in
gear<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:17.099> even<00:03:18.099> though<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:18.640> were<00:03:18.910> pressing

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
gear and even though you were pressing

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.550 
gear and even though you were pressing
the<00:03:19.390> brake<00:03:19.600> pedal<00:03:19.900> here<00:03:20.110> we're<00:03:20.350> still

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
the brake pedal here we're still

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
transmission range matched up correctly

transmission range matched up correctly
with<00:03:25.300> shifter<00:03:26.520> now<00:03:27.520> shifts<00:03:27.970> just<00:03:28.239> fine

there's<00:03:29.650> reverse<00:03:33.540> there's<00:03:34.540> forward<00:03:36.269> problem
