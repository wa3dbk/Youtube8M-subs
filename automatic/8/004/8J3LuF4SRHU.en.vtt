effect by banishing it which is gonna
get<00:00:30.090> us<00:00:30.240> another<00:00:30.359> PTIN<00:00:30.929> from<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.279> deck<00:00:32.520> this

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
get us another PTIN from the deck this

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.600 
get us another PTIN from the deck this
one<00:00:33.300> starts<00:00:33.660> off<00:00:33.809> very<00:00:34.020> similar<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.280> ends

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
know that there is a 4000 combo out

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.479 
know that there is a 4000 combo out
there<00:00:41.610> I'm<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.239> freaking<00:00:42.840> find<00:00:43.200> it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.700 
detach okay this is a little different
you<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.820> detach<00:00:51.180> mathematician<00:00:52.110> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
you have to detach mathematician you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.240 
you have to detach mathematician you
cannot<00:00:53.190> detach<00:00:54.020> you<00:00:55.020> cannot<00:00:55.350> detach<00:00:55.739> pinion

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
cannot detach you cannot detach pinion

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.889 
cannot detach you cannot detach pinion
you<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.730> detach<00:00:57.090> mathematician

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you have to detach mathematician

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.020 
you have to detach mathematician
specifically<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.219> does<00:00:59.520> matter

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
specifically it does matter

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.170 
specifically it does matter

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
alright so we get the second Pete anon

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.800 
alright so we get the second Pete anon
field<00:01:03.680> play<00:01:04.680> instant<00:01:05.100> fusion<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:06.390> cost<00:01:06.630> us

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
field play instant fusion that cost us

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.560 
field play instant fusion that cost us
1,000<00:01:07.290> Life<00:01:07.439> Points<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:09.240> then<00:01:09.360> we're<00:01:09.479> gonna

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
1,000 Life Points and then we're gonna

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.560 
1,000 Life Points and then we're gonna
get<00:01:10.100> noting<00:01:12.290> Nodin<00:01:13.290> hits<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.619> fields<00:01:14.570> gonna

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
get noting Nodin hits the fields gonna

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.859 
get noting Nodin hits the fields gonna
activate<00:01:16.170> Nolan's<00:01:16.650> effect<00:01:17.360> which<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.600> going

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
activate Nolan's effect which is going

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
activate Nolan's effect which is going
to<00:01:19.140> give<00:01:19.380> us<00:01:19.549> mathematician<00:01:20.549> let's<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:20.850> put

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
to give us mathematician let's just put

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.410 
to give us mathematician let's just put
it<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.299> defense<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:22.470> doesn't<00:01:22.770> really<00:01:22.860> matter

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
it in defense it doesn't really matter

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.620 
it in defense it doesn't really matter
all<00:01:24.420> right

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
all right

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.920

so<00:01:25.049> we're<00:01:25.290> going<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.590> exceed<00:01:26.189> again<00:01:26.930> we're

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
so we're going to exceed again we're

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.370 
so we're going to exceed again we're
going<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:28.409> our<00:01:28.439> invoker<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.170> Volker<00:01:31.170> hits

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
going for our invoker and Volker hits

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.499 
going for our invoker and Volker hits
the<00:01:31.590> graveyard<00:01:32.280> or<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.729> me<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.119> against<00:01:33.360> the

the graveyard or to me of up against the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.270 
the graveyard or to me of up against the
field<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.939> we're<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.479> detach<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:38.070> want

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
field and we're going to detach you want

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.800 
field and we're going to detach you want
to<00:01:38.369> detach<00:01:38.700> mathematician<00:01:39.420> we're<00:01:39.509> gonna<00:01:39.600> need

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
to detach mathematician we're gonna need

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.380 
to detach mathematician we're gonna need
mathematician<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.070> graveyard<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.880> make

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
mathematician in the graveyard to make

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.170 
mathematician in the graveyard to make
this<00:01:42.570> play<00:01:42.869> work<00:01:43.189> we<00:01:44.189> get<00:01:44.340> extra<00:01:44.700> sword<00:01:45.030> just

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
this play work we get extra sword just

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.380 
this play work we get extra sword just
like<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.630> did<00:01:45.750> before<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:47.030> then<00:01:48.030> we're<00:01:48.240> going

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
like we did before and then we're going

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.639 
like we did before and then we're going
to<00:01:48.810> exceed<00:01:49.619> again<00:01:50.460> using<00:01:51.360> extra<00:01:51.810> sword<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
to exceed again using extra sword and

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.600 
to exceed again using extra sword and
note<00:01:53.369> him<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:54.119> time<00:01:54.420> we're<00:01:54.720> going<00:01:54.899> into<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
note him this time we're going into the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.389 
note him this time we're going into the
bauble<00:01:57.060> chain<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:58.040> what<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.070> didn't<00:01:59.369> realize

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
bauble chain and what I didn't realize

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.580 
bauble chain and what I didn't realize
is<00:01:59.700> extra<00:02:00.390> sword<00:02:00.600> doesn't<00:02:00.960> actually<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.439> to

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
is extra sword doesn't actually have to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.170 
is extra sword doesn't actually have to
stay<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.009> monster<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.000> we're<00:02:03.090> gonna

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
stay on the monster so we're gonna

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.350 
stay on the monster so we're gonna
detach<00:02:03.689> extra<00:02:04.320> sword<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:05.670> activate<00:02:06.090> lavalla

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
detach extra sword the activate lavalla

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.789 
detach extra sword the activate lavalla
chain<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.960> guys<00:02:07.110> should<00:02:07.320> know<00:02:07.439> where<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.680> is

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
chain you guys should know where this is

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.550 
chain you guys should know where this is
going

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
going

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.080 
going
we're<00:02:10.560> gonna<00:02:10.680> have<00:02:10.920> redox<00:02:11.460> hit<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> graveyard

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
we're gonna have redox hit the graveyard

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.390 
we're gonna have redox hit the graveyard
and<00:02:15.090> now<00:02:15.780> we're<00:02:16.020> gonna<00:02:16.140> banish<00:02:16.440> our<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:17.040> earth

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
and now we're gonna banish our to earth

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.990
