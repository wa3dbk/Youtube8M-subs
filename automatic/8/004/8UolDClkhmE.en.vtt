00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.160
 hi girls in this video I want 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.440
 share my experience with the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.419
 lipsticks of medical bids and 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.980
 we know the shadows and we know they are 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.110
 of very good quality and its profile 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.350
 we will see how are the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.500
 lipsticks we begin 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.170
 the first color is called time and it's this 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.260
 rosadito that the truth for my color of 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.029
 skin I do not think it's the best color but 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.310
 If you are more clarita than me it is super 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.310
 creamy and our normal 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.930
 we continue with another light color and this 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.040
 it's called naked pitch but this is more 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.290
 like peach color melon more towards 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.199
 orange what I'm applying to 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.170
 little touches and I think this is going a little 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:52.610
 I like this one sincerely and what 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.610
 you will be if I recommend them 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.339
 honestly with a few smoky eyes this 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.670
 lipstick would be perfect 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:04.280
 we continue with pop art I think that's how 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.610
 says the name that is a fuchsia that 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.549
 we take the colors so it's super 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.470
 pigmented and how beautiful I feel that not 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.840
 I need to put moisturizer in my 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.899
 lips I love this I feel that it is 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.850
 rain would suit us with any 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.640
 anything else 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.460
 we end up with barry bites which is a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.100
 red that looks super cute and also I 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.690
 like it because it has blue tones and that goes 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.020
 to make your teeth look more 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.530
 whites so let's go girls to wear that 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.420
 I recommend this red lipstick 100% 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.850
 It looks super cute pigmented and 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.909
 moisturizing the truth be convinced with 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.920
 these paintings of biesc marks so 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.680
 this is my personal opinion girls the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.670
 claritos are not for me but the dark ones 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.590
 I like more 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.869
