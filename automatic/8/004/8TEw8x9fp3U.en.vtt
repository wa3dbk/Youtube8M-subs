00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello how about friends from the community of 

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.250
 micro voice like this 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.670
 the end this time I bring you a little 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.560
 video of 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.500
 how to calibrate and adjust the handbrake 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.250
 for those who do not know or do not know 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.020
 how calibrated must fit 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.560
 for when they change from you 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.190
 chicote I in my case change it in the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.220
 beginning is something dishes or tedious 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.700
 but now now the attention that must 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.000
 to go 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.850
 without hand brake and with handbrake already 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 that going adjusted by the working end 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.930
 inside the shoe opens and that is going to be 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.580
 the adjustment in which 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.570
 the brake cylinder pump to open 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.730
 is when you are because you are going to be 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.790
 a certain height will be opening 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.070
 as it is wearing away then the 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.230
 boy dividing tensed in a car 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.780
 adjuster in our worry alone 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.580
 they are adjusting but the chicote if the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.800
 help in something so that when you 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.050
 then trained and do not do so much 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.300
 travel if I do not take a tour of 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.220
 less 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.560
 although the attention must tell if you 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.680
 I have now 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.560
 I do not have it on without a handbrake 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.210
 you must move with one hand 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.020
 only 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.860
 I felt a lot of support on the side and with 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.500
 its weight can be said that between 60 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.780
 kilos out there you should move a 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.670
 rim without difficulty 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.940
 look what I 'm going to do and that's the way 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.940
 to be 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.310
 only the moves 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.030
 then force no no nothing is the pure weight 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.030
 of my body 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.340
 with one hand I should move 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.130
 with the pure weight if it has the rhythm 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.020
 wrong 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.770
 does it move 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.770
 the proper 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.979
 and there goes as it should go with the brake 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.159
 hand 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.790
 well already put the hand brake and so 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.700
 was left 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.750
 check the difference through 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.750
 of its weight 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.170
 does not move now they are given strength and with 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.580
 all your strength the rim we should see 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.580
 they are very a bit 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.710
 and so I have it tight 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.740
 and does not move anything moves very little 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.080
 almost nothing like that can be left if you do not 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.830
 moves absolutely nothing, it 's fine 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.830
 so you can get it 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.820
 they saw it as right does not move for 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.820
 nothing will I do all my weight 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.670
 and nothing 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.170
 and already removed the hand brake again and 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.170
 now yes not again 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.190
 since in a group 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.380
 He decides to be three like 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.900
 and seeing friends would be all 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.900
 that is the setting you and give you 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.900
 in 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.280
 to this part 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.440
 to the adjusters and the chicote already 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.110
 you already raising the 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.150
 the length I have it in the middle of its 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.150
 travel and pull 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.430
 I'm missing the other one is the same 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.970
 and you are giving the attention that 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.520
 you go see where not already 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.090
 do not move the tire but at the moment of 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.910
 be the parking brake is outside or 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.300
 do not have it on, the rim should 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.460
 rotate freely 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.210
 and any questions will be all friends 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.210
 because a comment 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.530
 and here we are to serve you see you 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.530
 until next time
