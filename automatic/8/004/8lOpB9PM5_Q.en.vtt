want to do is leave it out for about say
half<00:01:41.070> an<00:01:41.190> hour<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.490> an<00:01:41.520> hour<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.150> soften

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
half an hour to an hour just to soften

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.180 
half an hour to an hour just to soften
up<00:01:42.660> because<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.930> makes<00:01:43.050> a<00:01:43.140> lot<00:01:43.410> easier<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.920> mix

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
up because it makes a lot easier to mix

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.950 
up because it makes a lot easier to mix
okay<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:44.910> with<00:01:45.180> our<00:01:45.300> softened<00:01:45.510> cream<00:01:45.840> cheese
