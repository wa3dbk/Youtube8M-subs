00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.860 

the<00:00:01.530> most<00:00:02.070> effective<00:00:02.639> wearing<00:00:03.239> you<00:00:03.360> ever<00:00:03.540> see

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
the most effective wearing you ever see

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.730 
the most effective wearing you ever see
is<00:00:04.529> almost<00:00:04.800> always<00:00:05.040> that<00:00:05.220> which<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.120> done<00:00:06.360> by

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
is almost always that which is done by

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.070 
is almost always that which is done by
directly<00:00:07.740> copying<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.580> photograph<00:00:09.390> I<00:00:09.750> know<00:00:09.870> you

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
directly copying a photograph I know you

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.250 
directly copying a photograph I know you
it's<00:00:10.760> quite<00:00:11.760> easy<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.030> make<00:00:12.150> up<00:00:12.599> weathering

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 
it's quite easy to make up weathering

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.500 
it's quite easy to make up weathering
but<00:00:13.530> usually<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.010> ends<00:00:14.160> up<00:00:14.429> looking<00:00:14.639> made-up

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.510 
but usually it ends up looking made-up

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.069 
but usually it ends up looking made-up
as<00:00:16.139> well<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.619> doesn't<00:00:17.070> ring<00:00:17.759> as<00:00:18.029> true<00:00:18.419> somehow

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:19.079 
as well it doesn't ring as true somehow

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.579 
as well it doesn't ring as true somehow
and<00:00:19.609> as<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:21.150> consequence<00:00:21.839> of<00:00:22.019> this<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.319> find

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:22.589 
and as a consequence of this I find

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.790 
and as a consequence of this I find
himself<00:00:22.739> looking<00:00:23.460> at<00:00:24.439> through<00:00:25.439> photographs

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
himself looking at through photographs

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.819 
himself looking at through photographs
with<00:00:26.640> an<00:00:26.789> eye<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:26.999> good<00:00:27.630> weathering<00:00:28.140> subjects

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
with an eye to good weathering subjects

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.569 
with an eye to good weathering subjects
and<00:00:28.949> when<00:00:29.069> I<00:00:29.099> saw<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:30.329> shot<00:00:31.079> of<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.289> class<00:00:31.579> 47

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and when I saw this shot of a class 47

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.610 
and when I saw this shot of a class 47
in<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.650> early<00:00:35.060> 1960s<00:00:36.060> I<00:00:36.300> thought<00:00:36.690> I've<00:00:37.050> got<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
in the early 1960s I thought I've got to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.280 
in the early 1960s I thought I've got to
do<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.270> something<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.750> appealing

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
do that something just so appealing

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.120 
do that something just so appealing
about<00:00:40.380> it<00:00:40.830> particularly<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.120> way<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.890> been

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
about it particularly the way it's been

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.290 
about it particularly the way it's been
cleaned<00:00:44.430> at<00:00:44.700> one<00:00:44.910> end<00:00:45.150> may<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.890> they<00:00:47.070> were

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
cleaned at one end may be that they were

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.220 
cleaned at one end may be that they were
starting<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.420> clean<00:00:48.630> and<00:00:48.870> he<00:00:48.930> was<00:00:49.020> suddenly

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
starting to clean and he was suddenly

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.740 
starting to clean and he was suddenly
summoned<00:00:49.740> back<00:00:50.130> into<00:00:50.460> traffic<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:51.000> don't<00:00:51.510> know

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
summoned back into traffic I don't know

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.950 
summoned back into traffic I don't know
but<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.520> makes<00:00:53.700> a<00:00:54.000> hell<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.750> picture

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
but I think it makes a hell of a picture

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.290 
but I think it makes a hell of a picture
and<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.829> thought<00:00:56.070> it'd<00:00:56.220> be<00:00:56.340> good<00:00:56.490> to<00:00:57.090> do

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
and I thought it'd be good to do

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.590 
and I thought it'd be good to do
something<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.670> program<00:01:00.150> using

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
something like this in the program using

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.080 
something like this in the program using
a<00:01:00.720> buffman<00:01:01.140> class<00:01:01.800> 47<00:01:02.460> okay<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.880> got<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
a buffman class 47 okay it's got the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.090 
a buffman class 47 okay it's got the
full<00:01:03.239> yellow<00:01:03.450> front-end<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.320> that's<00:01:04.530> neither

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
full yellow front-end but that's neither

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.120 
full yellow front-end but that's neither
here<00:01:05.280> nor<00:01:05.489> there<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.630> what<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.170> hope<00:01:07.649> we've<00:01:07.890> got

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
here nor there so what I hope we've got

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.120 
here nor there so what I hope we've got
is<00:01:08.429> something<00:01:08.759> if<00:01:09.359> it's<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:09.689> an<00:01:10.200> exact<00:01:10.799> street

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
is something if it's not an exact street

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.599 
is something if it's not an exact street
buy<00:01:11.369> streak<00:01:11.819> copy<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:13.159> our<00:01:14.159> real<00:01:14.460> class<00:01:14.780> 47<00:01:15.780> is

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
buy streak copy of our real class 47 is

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.989 
buy streak copy of our real class 47 is
pretty<00:01:17.609> close<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.329> in<00:01:18.659> spirit<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.999> an

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
pretty close to it in spirit and an

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:24.830 
pretty close to it in spirit and an
absolutely<00:01:22.039> filthy<00:01:23.039> looking<00:01:23.789> locomotive<00:01:24.689> but

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
absolutely filthy looking locomotive but

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.330 
absolutely filthy looking locomotive but
also<00:01:25.439> absolutely<00:01:25.889> unique

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.850 

now<00:01:33.970> one<00:01:34.659> thing<00:01:34.690> that<00:01:35.140> may<00:01:35.680> not<00:01:35.740> be

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
now one thing that may not be

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.390 
now one thing that may not be
immediately<00:01:36.610> obvious<00:01:37.119> is<00:01:37.690> that<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:38.560> want<00:01:39.190> to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
immediately obvious is that you want to

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.170 
immediately obvious is that you want to
take<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.000> needle<00:01:40.210> out<00:01:41.820> forwards<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.960> you

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
take the needle out forwards if you

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.460 
take the needle out forwards if you
pulled<00:01:46.180> it<00:01:46.299> out<00:01:46.479> through<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.960> rear<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.229> the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
pulled it out through the rear of the

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.280 
pulled it out through the rear of the
airbrush<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.700> run<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.030> risk<00:01:49.180> of<00:01:49.509> getting

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
airbrush you run the risk of getting

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.389 
airbrush you run the risk of getting
paint<00:01:51.000> into<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.899> inner<00:01:53.080> workings<00:01:53.770> whereas<00:01:54.280> if

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
paint into the inner workings whereas if

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.980 
paint into the inner workings whereas if
you<00:01:54.520> take<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:56.130> needle<00:01:57.130> out<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:58.299> front<00:01:58.600> by<00:01:58.930> the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
you take the needle out the front by the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.830 
you take the needle out the front by the
front<00:01:59.350> exit<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:01.000> not<00:02:01.299> going<00:02:01.509> to<00:02:01.600> happen

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
front exit that's not going to happen

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.310 
front exit that's not going to happen
the<00:02:02.830> chances<00:02:03.369> are<00:02:03.580> there'll<00:02:04.270> be<00:02:04.390> a<00:02:04.840> little<00:02:05.170> bit

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
the chances are there'll be a little bit

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.850 
the chances are there'll be a little bit
of<00:02:05.440> paint<00:02:06.840> still<00:02:07.840> accumulating<00:02:08.229> on<00:02:08.800> the

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
of paint still accumulating on the

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.430 
of paint still accumulating on the
needle<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.459> can<00:02:09.610> probably<00:02:10.000> see<00:02:10.539> there<00:02:10.840> how

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
needle you can probably see there how

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.220 
needle you can probably see there how
even<00:02:11.709> though<00:02:11.860> I've<00:02:11.980> cleaned<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:13.230> reasonably

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
even though I've cleaned it reasonably

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.410 
even though I've cleaned it reasonably
thoroughly<00:02:14.890> in<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.730> cleaning<00:02:16.000> station

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
thoroughly in the cleaning station

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.640 
thoroughly in the cleaning station
there's<00:02:16.930> still<00:02:17.260> some<00:02:17.590> mucky<00:02:18.160> marks<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:20.260> my

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
there's still some mucky marks on my

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.949 
there's still some mucky marks on my
kitchen<00:02:21.100> row<00:02:23.220> okay<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.459> I've<00:02:25.090> just<00:02:25.480> while

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
kitchen row okay and I've just while

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.770 
kitchen row okay and I've just while
we're<00:02:26.350> at<00:02:26.530> it

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
we're at it

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.809 
we're at it
handrails<00:02:28.780> again<00:02:29.290> dunno<00:02:30.250> why<00:02:30.430> but<00:02:30.459> these

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
handrails again dunno why but these

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.890 
handrails again dunno why but these
things<00:02:31.120> always<00:02:31.300> seem<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.600> rust<00:02:33.209> if<00:02:34.209> half<00:02:34.480> mine

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
things always seem to rust if half mine

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.539 
things always seem to rust if half mine
to<00:02:35.550> put<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.580> bit<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:36.880> kink<00:02:37.269> in<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.690> handrail

photographed the Notting Lee oh nine and
I<00:03:37.390> was<00:03:37.420> thinking<00:03:37.810> of<00:03:38.459> converting<00:03:39.459> this

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
I was thinking of converting this

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
Spackman r8 in in 209 to a war

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.100 
Spackman r8 in in 209 to a war
then<00:03:44.480> I<00:03:44.660> discovered<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:46.600> boxes<00:03:47.600> on<00:03:47.810> the

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
then I discovered the boxes on the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.140 
then I discovered the boxes on the
left-hand<00:03:49.010> side<00:03:49.280> were<00:03:49.550> slightly<00:03:50.000> different

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
left-hand side were slightly different

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.000 
left-hand side were slightly different
there's<00:03:50.690> got<00:03:51.020> to<00:03:51.080> be<00:03:51.110> a<00:03:51.200> lot<00:03:51.320> more<00:03:51.350> work<00:03:51.740> and

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
there's got to be a lot more work and

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.470 
there's got to be a lot more work and
I'd<00:03:52.100> anticipate<00:03:52.840> just<00:03:53.840> gently<00:03:55.390> touching<00:03:56.390> you

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
I'd anticipate just gently touching you

I'd anticipate just gently touching you

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
know copying areas that I can see my

know copying areas that I can see my

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.340 

okay<00:04:18.140> now<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:19.370> gets<00:04:19.580> even<00:04:19.850> curiouser<00:04:20.780> I've

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
okay now it gets even curiouser I've

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.210 
okay now it gets even curiouser I've
taken<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:22.310> stiff<00:04:22.850> a<00:04:23.270> stiff<00:04:23.540> brush<00:04:23.840> and<00:04:24.220> I'm

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
taken a stiff a stiff brush and I'm

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.290 
taken a stiff a stiff brush and I'm
going<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.640> go<00:04:25.880> over<00:04:26.740> each<00:04:27.740> model<00:04:28.580> in<00:04:28.700> turn<00:04:28.970> and

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
going to go over each model in turn and

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.090 
going to go over each model in turn and
brush<00:04:29.600> off<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:31.130> rock<00:04:31.370> salt<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:33.220> can<00:04:34.220> you<00:04:34.310> see

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
brush off the rock salt and can you see

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.430 
brush off the rock salt and can you see
that<00:04:37.100> where<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:40.850> salt<00:04:41.180> was<00:04:41.480> it<00:04:41.870> acted<00:04:42.260> as<00:04:42.380> a

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
that where the salt was it acted as a

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.510 
that where the salt was it acted as a

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
really rather wealthy the random patches

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.840 
really rather wealthy the random patches
where<00:04:58.130> rust<00:04:59.050> starts<00:05:00.050> to<00:05:00.200> develop<00:05:01.330> on<00:05:02.330> a<00:05:02.390> wagon

stoppies<00:05:04.850> you're<00:05:05.090> doing<00:05:05.360> it<00:05:05.480> this<00:05:05.810> way<00:05:05.870> than

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
stoppies you're doing it this way than

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.800

by<00:05:07.910> most<00:05:08.620> painting<00:05:09.620> techniques<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:11.510> here's

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
by most painting techniques and here's

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.650 
by most painting techniques and here's
the<00:05:12.020> one<00:05:12.800> of<00:05:12.950> the<00:05:13.010> two<00:05:13.220> mill<00:05:13.460> wagons<00:05:13.940> finished

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.740 
the one of the two mill wagons finished
as<00:05:14.960> well<00:05:15.230> and<00:05:15.680> I<00:05:16.220> think<00:05:17.000> it<00:05:17.060> really<00:05:17.300> does<00:05:17.510> work

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
as well and I think it really does work

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.140 
as well and I think it really does work
surprisingly<00:05:18.230> well<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:19.040> in<00:05:19.460> this<00:05:19.640> very<00:05:19.940> small

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
surprisingly well and in this very small

surprisingly well and in this very small
scale<00:05:20.440> very<00:05:21.440> pleasing<00:05:21.919> takes<00:05:22.130> no<00:05:22.370> time<00:05:22.580> at<00:05:22.790> all

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
scale very pleasing takes no time at all

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.690 
scale very pleasing takes no time at all
to<00:05:23.840> do<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:24.290> I've<00:05:24.410> done<00:05:24.710> it<00:05:24.860> in<00:05:25.040> exactly<00:05:25.490> the

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
to do and I've done it in exactly the

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:33.600 
to do and I've done it in exactly the
