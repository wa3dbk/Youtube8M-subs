00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 in the course of debt and raised euro 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.339
 crisis we have a lot of amazing 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.620
 things can be learned about greece 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.030
 especially I mean that's enough 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.139
 greek does not pay it with the tax 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.519
 that's what we've always had 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.559
 already known but very much 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.830
 It was amazing to know that she was 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.119
 since no catastrophe know so the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.010
 We really do not really know 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.930
 how these luxury back we belong 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.430
 then the stupid and if it 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.660
 everywhere by black buildings can give 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.830
 Of course also great black money 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.779
 it is very clear 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.029
 and I have an idea how to do that 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.769
 accelerate process came out find out 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.700
 who owns something so I suggest the following 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.649
 procedure 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.329
 I would sound like the first luxury villa 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.100
 will say that comes from the tax office 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.620
 we would know who the house 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.850
 heard and if I say only then 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.020
 we also do not know we know well 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.000
 only you know where you are not the one 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.590
 Owners that are tenants then they have to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.059
 but have rental agreement you have to 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.510
 Owners are very well recognized if you 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:03.030
 only owners say they come out there 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.530
 The squatters are there now 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.439
 arrested and then I read one 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.460
 bulldozers come and restore that 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.460
 abandoned land 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.060
 that's wonderful for the environment and 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.790
 ever creates jobs in the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.049
 Bulldozer area would be the boys 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.299
 Working are the shivers of the sound 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.549
 neighbor villa good day here comes from 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.940
 planned to lead her 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.830
 restructuring by like them 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.420
 maybe you will have to see the humans 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.759
 prove that she is serious what 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.080
 All this has no purpose I bet 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.450
 with you if you have two three villas 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.039
 have demolished 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.920
 from the fourth villa logs in everywhere 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.280
 a owner this is my house what 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.280
 they really want to 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.600

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.490

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.720

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.300

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.270

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.580
 he paid her 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:10.600
 You may ask questions should I ask 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.190

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.960
 on the same dish we know what 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.280
 running here is that's not 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.240
 next bad that was so that is 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.160
 then our culture has been 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.200
 the fun is over now is partie 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.490
 to the end the little ones would have to 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.020
 reduced wages 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.860
 not dry people are let 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.510
 and you have to control yours 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.490
 additional payment which is now just so they 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.360
 pay their taxes ten years and ten years 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.340
 Everyone is happy 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.740
 yes, although all my money is in 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.170
 Switzerland is more concerned about her money 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.580
 now back I would hurry 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.190

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.480
 You can also sell it on TV 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.140

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.140

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.150
 the lynx is not the thing anymore 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.130
 I would like to bulldozer a lot easier 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
 I 'm going for the first luxury years 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.190

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.830

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.570
 You only have to drive the taxes for ten years 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.400

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.470
