up in Aisle three as quickly and as fast
as<00:01:44.100> possible<00:01:44.780> second<00:01:45.780> spawn<00:01:46.020> back<00:01:46.290> look<00:01:47.009> at

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
as possible second spawn back look at

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.399 
as possible second spawn back look at
all<00:01:47.310> these<00:01:47.460> covers<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.299> play<00:01:48.540> there

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
all these covers that I can play there

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.499 
all these covers that I can play there
are<00:01:49.619> concrete<00:01:50.100> blocks<00:01:50.430> everywhere<00:01:50.850> there's

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
are concrete blocks everywhere there's

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.450 
are concrete blocks everywhere there's
tons<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:52.020> cover<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.560> both<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.860> attackers<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
tons of cover for both the attackers and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.010 
tons of cover for both the attackers and
defenders<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.509> my<00:01:54.600> second<00:01:54.990> time

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
playing slow here I'm expecting people

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.320 
playing slow here I'm expecting people
to<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:08.700> spawn<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> my<00:02:09.149> right

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
to be here and they spawn to my right

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.029 
to be here and they spawn to my right
that<00:02:09.869> guys<00:02:10.020> are<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.229> mini-map<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.770> why<00:02:10.890> not

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that guys are the mini-map so why not

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.470 
that guys are the mini-map so why not
prepare<00:02:11.250> for<00:02:11.610> them<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:11.849> they're<00:02:12.000> spawning<00:02:12.270> on

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
so this is a bad spot to loiter because

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.520 
so this is a bad spot to loiter because
they<00:02:17.040> literally<00:02:17.489> spawn<00:02:17.909> in<00:02:18.209> front<00:02:18.689> of<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.900> to
