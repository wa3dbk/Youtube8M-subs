in<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.860> Tom<00:00:44.280> Cruise<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:44.910> case<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.329> ever<00:00:45.360> did

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
in a Tom Cruise is in case you ever did

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.389 
in a Tom Cruise is in case you ever did
guess<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.410> by<00:00:46.590> now<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:46.920> Days<00:00:47.160> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
guess what it is by now it's Days of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.600 
guess what it is by now it's Days of
Thunder<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:48.050> love<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.350> movie<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.250> good

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
Thunder I love this movie it's so good

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.970 
Thunder I love this movie it's so good
and<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.239> reason<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.050> because<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.739> captures

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and the reason is is because it captures

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.799 
and the reason is is because it captures
the<00:00:53.430> drama<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:53.969> everything<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.480> goes<00:00:54.600> in

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the drama and everything that goes in

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
the drama and everything that goes in
