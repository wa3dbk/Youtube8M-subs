00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.109
 and the effect I hope you are well 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:06.189
 today I'm talking about a serum that I have 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.689
 recently discovered 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:11.040
 if you follow me for some time 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:14.230
 on my channel you know that messi lesson 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.700
 problematic but I explain this to 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.980
 to say that it grows in the boys are only 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.960
 not super slow so it annoys me a little 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.310
 little and I'm still looking for sivom that 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.070
 could he grow more 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.930
 quickly thicken them all kinds and 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.840
 last December so in December 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:33.819
 2013 I'm on twitter and I was watching 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:36.550
 my son 2008 yes that then there I saw 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:39.159
 an article of the urban blog on a 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.620
 serum the more I clicked on the deny is 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.089
 really the pictures before after and have me 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.559
 really impressed me a lot 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.960
 I'm told she really tried this 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.639
 serum the well in addition stale beak 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.190
 I did my research I contacted 

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:52.870
 the owner and we talked to each other and we 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.710
 arranged for me to test 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.899
 the product 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.769
 so I've been doing about 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.219
 mid-January and I really like 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.010
 a lot 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.659
 so the second is called magic booster 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.689
 loose so it's long enough for a 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.820
 if it's for eyebrows and kids 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:15.159
 is a little bottle like that it's 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.770
 looks like this one is constituted with 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.780
 18 natural there are a lot of agents 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.060
 actors inside and it works but 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.710
 really very very very fast so 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.329
 what we do is that it's your 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.149
 brush is really for who 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.729
 no contamination of the product and it does not 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.679
 we see a small pump if we 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.719
 apply a box must 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.700
 we are small we really apply to the 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.170
 eyelash root we try that it touches 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.479
 not too much the first because the 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.030
 eyelid could swell a little bit 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.399
 it's not dangerous it's just that 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.380
 because of this story that but it's okay 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.719
 disappear after a few days so we 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.100
 applied on the root is also this 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.840
 role and so that's it's a 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.350
 treatment that will strengthen but who 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.300
 will also achieve enrich here we see 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.520
 and the morning melts 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.350
 just but rinse the eyes cleansing 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.090
 face as usual and continue 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.430
 that if one practices and envied for them 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.280
 facts that had eyelash extensions 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.690
 who have lost eyelashes or whose 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.660
 signs does not really grow much anymore 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.040
 because it 's really going these mules and the 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.740
 grows in the root 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.170
 so it's not a posture that's 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.320
 really the bulb that will be activated 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.360
 and I wish I noticed a 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.060
 second is in the thickness of missiles 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.280
 about 4 5 days what is really 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.960
 very very very fast and the length 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.320
 does a little more time but it's 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.510
 normal and I find it really crazy 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.750
 because it's so fast acting 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.570
 again if I had tried rap and 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.100
 cowardly xl that took a month or so 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.440
 before I see results while 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.840
 that kind but if they are a lot 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.700
 much much more provided they are 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.500
 longer than my mascara 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.660
 applies super well with rocket 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.120
 gentlemen are wonderful who are 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.440
 defined it's long memo outer corner 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.410
 a particle more than ten years to 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.880
 apply mascara it's going great 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.209
 but it's sure thicker you know that 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.000
 each series a little bigger 11th rank 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.580
 and who gained in width that I like 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.470
 a lot and besides it costs 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.410
 takes less money than others his men 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.690
 in all with the management it costs 40 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.270
 dollars around so about thirty 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.430
 out over cooler taxes 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.680
 delivery what really bias 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.070
 is a rare example of buying at 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.300
 pay 60 dollars to have it so this 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:39.330
 live well it works very well as 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:41.920
 here is seriously and I deny 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.989
 I have very little criticism of the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.520
 product because its cowhide to it 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.500
 it works really quickly that 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.030
 works great too and it's a 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.920
 Quebec brand what I would like 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.190
 a lot it's done to saint placid so 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.030
 it's in quebec where the pro b late ma'am 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.440
 everything is super nice and really 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.390
 I really like it are now 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.980
 I have two small surprises compared 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.780
 at this block serum 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.280
 firstly i'm going to indicate the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.440
 step in the right information but 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.940
 if you contact the owner and that 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.100
 you indicate that you want to buy 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.540
 in national and that you mention 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.180
 walk n you are going to have a stand for 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.030
 cent of discount and or 6 5% of votes 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.680
 thoroughly recommend 5% of the price will go 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.960
 at the foundation of this camp 5 because 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.550
 it is a subject that is consumed 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.470
 touch at Madame Tussauds and me 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.330
 both of them so they're really 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.220
 so happy besides having your 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.660
 it's like you'll be able to say that 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.320
 you helped a little the foundation of the 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.720
 breast cancer 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.550
 ok that's really cool then me it does not 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.260
 build on that keeps me not to each 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.570
 october i make my month a 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.950
 funds for dance 1 or at the end of this 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.320
 month I see all 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.930
 all the money from youtube to this 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.630
 foundation so I really loved it 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.550
 the idea of sick sow to send 5% of 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.810
 sales to the foundation makes that it's 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.560
 really I'm thoroughly you do not have 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.150
 varied more it's just a part of 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.380
 your money will go to the formation of 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.360
 consciences and second peep in g14 here 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.760
 case it's really not removed because 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.169
 it's berlin think I have a floor 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.000
 that I will buy it because having it 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.470
 finished then finally know that it has 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.180
 really lasted a long time because it takes 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.919
 like in many in this jeans do not 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.919
 will not be removed so in the background 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.570
 the regulations to arrange took the 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.430

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.510
