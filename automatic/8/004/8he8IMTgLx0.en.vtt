 I propose to you today I will 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.940
 do not slip the ingredients we need 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.560
 so by promising he'll have us 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:21.840

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.330
 brown rum like that with a glass 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.330
 any one I took a drink for 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.689
 the mojito we will need juice from 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.059
 lemon 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:37.290
 so we have there and a melon juice 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.090
 that we have a fund here and a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.410
 pod cleansing 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.980
 so here it is going to be worth to us 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.680
 teaspoon and a knife then 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.440
 here we go so for this mojito the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.079
 long let's pour in first time 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.170
 our rank strand that we have there we 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.489
 see so will be less we will put 8 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.300
 cents so that was important 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.629
 so 80 he's the base of this mojito 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.760
 it is the main ingredient 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.920
 so here we have our Rome with 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.470
 800 titles in this worm so has it 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.229
 directly a true according to the rising of 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.700
 side we will take our neighborhood 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:21.049
 of melon so here we remove all the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:27.920
 parts that are not good melon 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.920
 we kept that melon flesh 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:37.290
 so that's just that so this melon 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:42.119
 we are going to cut it first by 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.490
 small features like these in fine 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.869
 slices 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.110
 then we will do little 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.110
 cubes 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.659
 this is like that a little ridges of 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.590
 fish so this melon so see the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:06.600
 cut into even smaller cubes 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.560
 like this and so that's it so 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:17.760
 after we pour the pieces directly 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:19.790
 in the mojito in rum this is in 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.420
 sufficient quantity 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:32.340
 so here is a melon district will suffice 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:34.800
 amply for this mojito so here 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.920
 directly after that to find 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.670

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.700

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.739
 melon concentrate that is sweet on the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.510
 base so concentrate me london we're going 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.440
 2 cl put a little pl 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.450

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.530
 glass once we have our two 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.680
 centilitres of melon juice in this 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:06.720
 drama we do not hesitate to brew for that 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:10.380
 this juice dissolves well in this rum so 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.549
 So here is rum and sweet with 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.620
 pieces of melon with our juice 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:21.500

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:35.760
 so our lemon juice 3 spoons at 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:39.910
 coffee will suffice amply 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:45.040

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.800
 last time we will put our 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.230

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.820
 of melon 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.650

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.780
