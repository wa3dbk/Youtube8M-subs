 like for you to know why it will 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.640
 incredibly cool for mic'ed 'us 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.150
 to work 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.600
 so that I may give this key I wanted 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.600
 first it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.359

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.140
 team spirit, we also professionally 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.909
 and communicate 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.949
 dealing with people but then it means 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.640
 for me a stable factor in my 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.470
 life 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.119
 I also think it is a place to grab 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.250
 I got appreciated that we put it in 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.990
