where you guys asked if you could play

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.560 
where you guys asked if you could play
this<00:00:20.939> game<00:00:21.240> with<00:00:21.689> certain<00:00:22.289> specs<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.570> there

this game with certain specs and there

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.810 
this game with certain specs and there
was<00:00:24.720> one<00:00:25.109> where<00:00:25.740> they<00:00:26.670> asked<00:00:26.910> if<00:00:27.240> his<00:00:28.220> core<00:00:29.220> i5

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
was one where they asked if his core i5

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.319 
was one where they asked if his core i5
quad<00:00:30.330> core<00:00:30.720> 3.4<00:00:31.529> gigahertz<00:00:32.070> with<00:00:32.489> 8<00:00:33.270> gigabytes

to<00:00:41.579> 30<00:00:41.820> frames<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.329> second<00:00:42.829> now<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:44.160> me<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.640> is

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
to 30 frames a second now for me it is

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
to 30 frames a second now for me it is
very<00:00:45.059> hard<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.690> answer<00:00:45.930> questions<00:00:46.500> like<00:00:46.620> that

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
very hard to answer questions like that

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.000 
very hard to answer questions like that
because<00:00:47.370> i<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:48.510> not<00:00:48.840> have<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.530> hardware

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
because i do not have that hardware

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.979 
because i do not have that hardware
that's<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.180> hard<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.750> me<00:00:51.809> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
that's going to be hard for me to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.439 
that's going to be hard for me to
compare<00:00:52.500> what<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> graph<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> card<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.180> in

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
compare what the graph is card can do in

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.220 
compare what the graph is card can do in
combination<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.129> hard<00:00:56.370> way<00:00:56.520> I

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
combination with with that hard way I

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.709 
combination with with that hard way I
can<00:00:58.230> only<00:00:58.379> guess<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.489> guesstimate<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.449> say

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
can only guess or guesstimate and say

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.810 
can only guess or guesstimate and say
yes<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.379> might<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.800> able<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.070> run<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.250> above<00:01:02.550> 30

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
yes you might be able to run it above 30

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.399 
yes you might be able to run it above 30
frames<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.210> second<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> hardware<00:01:04.229> I

frames a second with the hardware I

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.390 
frames a second with the hardware I
cannot<00:01:05.309> guarantee<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.970> there<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.710> you<00:01:07.710> also

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
cannot guarantee it there and you also

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.280 
cannot guarantee it there and you also
have<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.850> ask<00:01:09.000> yourself<00:01:09.090> why<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.750> would<00:01:10.260> want

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
have to ask yourself why you would want

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.649

in battlefield 3 MSAA is a new little

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.389 
in battlefield 3 MSAA is a new little
thing<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.960> developers<00:01:58.590> used<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.040> trick

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
thing that the developers used to trick

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.179 
thing that the developers used to trick
you<00:02:00.090> into<00:02:00.119> thinking<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.860> a

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
you into thinking that it is a

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.240 
you into thinking that it is a
next-generation<00:02:03.060> game<00:02:03.810> where<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:04.829> a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
next-generation game where it's just a

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.490 
next-generation game where it's just a
workaround

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
workaround

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.359 
workaround
it's<00:02:07.070> very<00:02:07.400> CPU<00:02:07.910> intensive<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.780> adds<00:02:09.369> well

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
it's very CPU intensive that adds well

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.400 
it's very CPU intensive that adds well
all<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:10.850> makes<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.570> graphics<00:02:11.990> look<00:02:12.170> a

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
all that makes that the graphics look a

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.700 
all that makes that the graphics look a
lot<00:02:12.710> better<00:02:13.100> on<00:02:13.430> screen<00:02:13.990> it's<00:02:14.990> not<00:02:15.410> graphic

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
lot better on screen it's not graphic

will make you sleepy chug so be careful

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.449

I'm<00:02:33.890> playing<00:02:34.580> torchlight<00:02:34.970> 2<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.630> thought<00:02:36.050> that

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
I'm playing torchlight 2 I thought that

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.800 
I'm playing torchlight 2 I thought that
I<00:02:36.290> would<00:02:36.590> make<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:37.250> nice<00:02:37.940> little<00:02:38.180> tea<00:02:38.330> for<00:02:38.660> you

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
I would make a nice little tea for you

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.470 
I would make a nice little tea for you
guys<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.290> have<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.500> look<00:02:39.739> at<00:02:39.920> while<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:41.030> talk

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
guys to have a look at while I talk

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.199 
guys to have a look at while I talk
about<00:02:41.750> these<00:02:41.900> types<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.350> things<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:43.550> game<00:02:43.730> is

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
about these types of things the game is

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.199 
about these types of things the game is
maxed<00:02:44.630> out<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.650> didn't<00:02:46.070> even<00:02:46.160> bother<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.610> to

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
maxed out and I didn't even bother to to

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.970 
maxed out and I didn't even bother to to
drop<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.630> settings<00:02:48.080> for<00:02:48.230> this<00:02:48.800> little

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
drop the settings for this little

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.710 
drop the settings for this little
vanilla<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:49.520> you<00:02:49.580> might<00:02:49.820> notice<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.300> bit<00:02:50.570> of

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
vanilla so you might notice a bit of

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.530 
vanilla so you might notice a bit of
stuttering<00:02:51.380> here<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.739> there<00:02:51.970> gorgeous<00:02:52.970> lower

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
stuttering here and there gorgeous lower

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.340 
stuttering here and there gorgeous lower
frames<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:54.110> think<00:02:54.709> it<00:02:55.310> gave<00:02:56.239> me<00:02:56.420> 25<00:02:56.930> frames<00:02:57.230> a

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
frames I think it gave me 25 frames a

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.460 
frames I think it gave me 25 frames a
second<00:02:57.680> while<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:57.830> was<00:02:58.040> recording<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.640> but

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
second while I was recording this but

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.830 
second while I was recording this but
still<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.800> game<00:03:01.010> plays<00:03:01.340> 40<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.120> 45<00:03:02.600> frames

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
still this game plays 40 to 45 frames

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.810 
still this game plays 40 to 45 frames
per<00:03:03.050> second<00:03:03.440> without<00:03:03.680> fraps<00:03:04.310> running<00:03:04.700> and

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
per second without fraps running and

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.580 
per second without fraps running and
recording<00:03:06.250> so<00:03:07.250> definitely<00:03:07.459> this<00:03:08.030> card<00:03:08.750> can

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
recording so definitely this card can

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.550 
recording so definitely this card can
handle<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.519> lot<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:11.180> new<00:03:11.360> games<00:03:11.570> as<00:03:11.959> you've<00:03:12.320> seen

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
handle a lot of new games as you've seen

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.840 
handle a lot of new games as you've seen
max<00:03:13.280> payne<00:03:13.549> 3<00:03:13.690> with<00:03:14.690> MSA<00:03:15.200> off<00:03:15.560> was<00:03:16.100> brilliant

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
max payne 3 with MSA off was brilliant

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.900 
max payne 3 with MSA off was brilliant
it<00:03:17.120> was<00:03:17.510> something<00:03:17.870> brilliant<00:03:18.489> if<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.670> weren't

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
it was something brilliant if it weren't

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.050 
it was something brilliant if it weren't
for<00:03:20.150> fraps<00:03:20.660> charring<00:03:21.530> some<00:03:21.769> CPU<00:03:22.250> resources<00:03:22.430> it

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
for fraps charring some CPU resources it

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.090 
for fraps charring some CPU resources it
could<00:03:23.209> have<00:03:23.299> been<00:03:23.510> even<00:03:23.840> more<00:03:23.989> brilliant<00:03:24.380> to

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
could have been even more brilliant to

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.400 
could have been even more brilliant to
show<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.340> guys<00:03:25.580> but<00:03:25.910> unfortunately<00:03:26.570> perhaps

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
show you guys but unfortunately perhaps

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.410 
show you guys but unfortunately perhaps
being<00:03:27.680> what<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:29.000> way<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:29.299> it

being what it is and the way that it

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.640 
being what it is and the way that it
works<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:30.190> won't<00:03:31.190> ever<00:03:31.489> be<00:03:31.700> able<00:03:31.850> to<00:03:32.350> pay<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.380> on

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
same time and this there was some work

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.590 
same time and this there was some work
around<00:03:38.989> where<00:03:39.440> it<00:03:39.590> just<00:03:39.829> basically<00:03:40.190> grabs<00:03:40.790> the

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
around where it just basically grabs the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.870 
around where it just basically grabs the
information<00:03:42.260> coming<00:03:43.220> from<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.549> graphics
