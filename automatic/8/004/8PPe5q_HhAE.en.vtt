solving the problems pretty easy all you
need<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.740> do<00:01:09.860> is<00:01:09.979> give<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.220> water<00:01:10.430> some<00:01:10.700> time

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
need to do is give the water some time

the RO storage container through the DI

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.090 
the RO storage container through the DI
resident<00:01:35.390> into<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.659> new<00:01:35.869> storage<00:01:36.170> container<00:01:36.649> we

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
resident into a new storage container we

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.920 
resident into a new storage container we
have<00:01:37.189> a<00:01:37.250> ton<00:01:37.399> of<00:01:37.430> these<00:01:37.579> BRS<00:01:38.030> 50<00:01:38.360> milliliter<00:01:38.840> a

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
have a ton of these BRS 50 milliliter a

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.929 
have a ton of these BRS 50 milliliter a
minute<00:01:39.259> top<00:01:39.439> off<00:01:39.680> dosing<00:01:40.189> pumps<00:01:40.549> so<00:01:40.670> I<00:01:40.700> was

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
minute top off dosing pumps so I was

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.399 
minute top off dosing pumps so I was
going<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.119> use<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.420> but<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:41.899> can<00:01:42.020> really<00:01:42.290> use

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
going to use this but you can really use

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.010 
going to use this but you can really use
any<00:01:42.649> slow<00:01:43.130> flow<00:01:43.399> pump<00:01:43.729> this<00:01:44.119> pump<00:01:44.420> can<00:01:44.479> run<00:01:44.750> dry

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
any slow flow pump this pump can run dry

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.050 
any slow flow pump this pump can run dry
so<00:01:45.350> I'm<00:01:45.439> not<00:01:45.560> particularly<00:01:46.100> worried<00:01:46.820> about

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
so I'm not particularly worried about

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.240 
so I'm not particularly worried about
making<00:01:47.270> sure<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:47.719> turns<00:01:47.930> off<00:01:48.229> in<00:01:48.469> time<00:01:48.649> but<00:01:49.159> you

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
making sure it turns off in time but you

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.620 
making sure it turns off in time but you
could<00:01:49.430> use<00:01:49.579> a<00:01:49.610> do-it-yourself<00:01:50.210> top-off

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
could use a do-it-yourself top-off

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.420 
could use a do-it-yourself top-off
solution<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.259> turn<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.560> pump<00:01:51.799> off<00:01:52.040> if<00:01:52.280> you

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
solution to turn the pump off if you

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.010 
solution to turn the pump off if you
wanted<00:01:52.790> but<00:01:53.119> even<00:01:53.329> easier<00:01:53.659> you<00:01:53.750> could<00:01:53.840> just

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
wanted but even easier you could just

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.080 
wanted but even easier you could just
use<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.200> digital<00:01:54.649> timer<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:55.219> turn<00:01:55.369> it<00:01:55.549> off<00:01:55.670> after

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
use a digital timer to turn it off after

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.149 
use a digital timer to turn it off after
set<00:01:56.299> amount<00:01:56.570> of<00:01:56.630> time<00:01:56.689> as<00:01:57.049> well<00:01:57.200> some<00:01:57.860> of<00:01:58.039> you

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
set amount of time as well some of you

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.830 
set amount of time as well some of you
are<00:01:58.340> probably<00:01:58.670> burning<00:01:58.909> through<00:01:59.299> a<00:01:59.360> cartridge

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
are probably burning through a cartridge

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.319 
are probably burning through a cartridge
of<00:02:00.049> resin<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.590> month<00:02:00.829> or<00:02:01.039> even<00:02:01.250> faster<00:02:01.820> most<00:02:02.149> of

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
of resin a month or even faster most of

it<00:02:02.479> related<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.869> co2<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:03.860> this<00:02:04.009> project<00:02:04.189> could

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490
