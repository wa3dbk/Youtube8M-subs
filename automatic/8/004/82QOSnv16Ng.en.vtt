00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
that sort of stuff I mean there wasn't a

that sort of stuff I mean there wasn't a
whole<00:00:56.890> lot<00:00:57.100> of<00:00:57.309> stuff<00:00:57.579> happened<00:00:57.910> but<00:00:58.620> tackling

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
whole lot of stuff happened but tackling

whole lot of stuff happened but tackling
motion<00:00:59.980> and<00:01:00.129> look<00:01:00.219> it<00:01:00.370> looked<00:01:00.519> quite<00:01:00.730> good

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
motion and look it looked quite good

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.200 
motion and look it looked quite good
quite<00:01:01.149> realistic<00:01:02.429> it<00:01:03.429> look<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:03.760> be<00:01:03.879> some<00:01:04.059> sort

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
quite realistic it look to be some sort

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.779 
quite realistic it look to be some sort
of<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.449> not<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:04.899> shoulder<00:01:05.289> charge<00:01:05.440> but<00:01:05.800> a<00:01:06.220> tough

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:06.789 
of a not a shoulder charge but a tough

of a not a shoulder charge but a tough
sort<00:01:07.000> of<00:01:07.090> tackle<00:01:07.360> I<00:01:07.390> mean<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.690> can't<00:01:07.840> do<00:01:08.020> look

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
sort of tackle I mean it can't do look

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.050 
sort of tackle I mean it can't do look
like<00:01:08.289> a<00:01:08.350> short<00:01:08.590> judge<00:01:08.770> but<00:01:09.009> yeah<00:01:09.220> a<00:01:09.250> big<00:01:09.700> tackle

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
like a short judge but yeah a big tackle

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.029 
like a short judge but yeah a big tackle
it<00:01:10.509> looked<00:01:10.690> am<00:01:10.899> quite<00:01:11.229> good<00:01:11.410> also<00:01:11.679> there<00:01:11.890> was<00:01:11.979> a

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
it looked am quite good also there was a

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.310 
it looked am quite good also there was a
part<00:01:13.000> where<00:01:13.090> they<00:01:13.270> reach<00:01:13.450> out<00:01:13.630> for<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.140> line

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
part where they reach out for the line

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.410 
part where they reach out for the line
that<00:01:15.039> was<00:01:15.340> quite<00:01:15.490> good<00:01:15.550> I'm<00:01:15.850> it<00:01:15.970> but<00:01:16.149> at<00:01:16.330> the

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
that was quite good I'm it but at the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.940 
that was quite good I'm it but at the
same<00:01:16.570> time<00:01:16.720> we<00:01:16.899> have<00:01:16.929> that<00:01:17.170> sort<00:01:17.380> of<00:01:17.409> animation

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
same time we have that sort of animation

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.540 
same time we have that sort of animation
well<00:01:18.550> hopefully<00:01:18.759> it<00:01:18.970> doesn't<00:01:19.119> result<00:01:19.450> in

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
well hopefully it doesn't result in

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.800 
well hopefully it doesn't result in
coming<00:01:21.550> to<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.729> video<00:01:21.940> if<00:01:22.090> every<00:01:22.390> single<00:01:22.630> time

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
coming to the video if every single time

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.570 
coming to the video if every single time
you<00:01:22.840> reach<00:01:23.140> out<00:01:23.319> because<00:01:23.979> I<00:01:24.039> think<00:01:24.250> that<00:01:24.399> might

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
you reach out because I think that might

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.139 
you reach out because I think that might
have<00:01:24.640> been<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:26.229> happened<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:27.459> replica

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
have been what happened in a replica

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.990 
have been what happened in a replica
life<00:01:28.270> too<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.770> yeah<00:01:30.280> we<00:01:30.489> take<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.670> look<00:01:30.789> at<00:01:30.940> the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
life too but yeah we take a look at the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.120 
life too but yeah we take a look at the
full<00:01:31.209> goal<00:01:31.390> I<00:01:31.569> mean<00:01:31.929> it's<00:01:32.200> probably<00:01:32.560> just<00:01:32.890> I

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
full goal I mean it's probably just I

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.740 
full goal I mean it's probably just I
mean<00:01:33.340> obviously<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:34.030> conversion<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.479> regular

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
mean obviously the conversion of regular

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.449 
mean obviously the conversion of regular
life<00:01:34.869> to<00:01:35.020> looks<00:01:35.259> half<00:01:35.800> decent<00:01:35.979> looks<00:01:36.280> pretty

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459 
life to looks half decent looks pretty

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.109 
life to looks half decent looks pretty
decent<00:01:36.610> but<00:01:37.599> hopefully<00:01:37.899> the<00:01:37.989> actual<00:01:38.289> in-game

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
decent but hopefully the actual in-game

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.520 
decent but hopefully the actual in-game
field<00:01:40.119> goals<00:01:40.300> look<00:01:40.509> as<00:01:40.720> good<00:01:40.869> as<00:01:40.929> this<00:01:41.080> one<00:01:41.319> I

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
field goals look as good as this one I

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.559 
field goals look as good as this one I
just<00:01:42.160> have<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.340> say<00:01:42.399> a<00:01:42.520> lot<00:01:42.970> either<00:01:43.149> boards<00:01:43.450> but

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
just have to say a lot either boards but

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.660 
just have to say a lot either boards but

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
gotta i think it might just be on the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.210 
gotta i think it might just be on the
the<00:02:19.120> pc<00:02:19.510> just<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.840> same<00:02:20.019> way<00:02:20.230> if<00:02:20.980> you've<00:02:21.190> got

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
the pc just the same way if you've got

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.339 
the pc just the same way if you've got
the<00:02:21.370> fan<00:02:21.580> hub<00:02:21.790> more<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.750> won't<00:02:22.959> just<00:02:23.019> be<00:02:23.170> the

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
the fan hub more it won't just be the

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.229 
the fan hub more it won't just be the
fan<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.650> any<00:02:23.769> more<00:02:23.980> they'll<00:02:24.160> be<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> some<00:02:25.030> sort

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
fan of any more they'll be a some sort

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.000

of gameplay maybe some skill games or
something<00:02:27.130> maybe<00:02:27.820> be<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> whole<00:02:28.270> game<00:02:28.480> would
