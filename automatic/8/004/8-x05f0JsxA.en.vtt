00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you can go twist right now to what is

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.210 
you can go twist right now to what is
fellow<00:01:36.509> boundary<00:01:37.020> line<00:01:37.470> only<00:01:37.650> what<00:01:38.070> it's

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
fellow boundary line only what it's

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.490 
fellow boundary line only what it's
supposed<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.700> yet<00:01:39.000> because<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> think<00:01:40.229> you

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
supposed to yet because so I think you

didn't<00:01:40.740> cost<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.040> much<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.110> also<00:01:43.350> been

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
didn't cost that much this is also been

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.440 
didn't cost that much this is also been
released<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.520> nurse<00:01:44.909> will<00:01:45.090> never<00:01:45.270> want

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
released so the nurse will never want

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.149
