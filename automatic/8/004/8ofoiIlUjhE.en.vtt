00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.690
 Hello everyone 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:16.200
 It is a treasure of the world rubber market 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:20.400
 I would like to introduce the first of the three major points of the cut measures for table tennis wisdom bag today 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:25.260
 The target person this time has never won a cutman 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.690
 As we target beginners of table tennis, thank you 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.060
 First of all it is easy to introduce myself 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.980
 I am a cutman in the back table 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:41.120
 Seen from the Catman 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:44.930
 Naa I hate When you are done that such it is from the other opponent 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:51.510
 I think that when you're your story while based on such things as I think 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:56.610
 I also myself for a while there was a time when I couldn't beat Cutman at all. 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:04.620
 a Became able to win the Cutman from the time you can not win 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:05.339
 That 's the way up there and I also teach that table tennis so that student 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.690
 is not it 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:13.240
 While also taking into account the British steel system 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:16.670
 I think if easy-to-understand explanation is possible so thank you 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:21.860
 First of all, one problem for everyone 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.460
 Answer that or not my different pen leading players like is it's cut man was often 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.130
 is 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.149
 What about you 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.630
 This is the answer but we are the same 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.630
 It is a cut man 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:44.710
 Though the cut changes to go to the national level nationwide also the story changes 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:50.799
 Ordinary cut man to the game through the same cut man has a very weak 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.479
 Let's take the same tactics as our cutman to propose this time 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.340
 It will be an introduction 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:59.050
 This is one of the 3 major points 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.000
 Without hitting without hitting 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.410
 To 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.270
 In the middle of the opponent's platform 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:13.170
 It will be said that let's put in 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:17.160
 The question is why it is better not to strike for some reason 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.060
 First, as one reason is our cut man 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.810
 Beaten 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.690
 It is very practice to cut 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.819
 If you hit me 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.030
 Make various changes 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:37.120
 The other party can be confused by the change and can score again 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:42.430
 Just Tsutsuki just do not sell in reverse 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.390
 If you get stuck, how do you score in this way? 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.620
 I don't understand 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:54.349
 Men come against politely poking also put a lot of change 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:03:00.379
 Then there is no point pattern of this, so I hit it by myself and make a mistake 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:04.750
 Or make a mistake by forcing the change by mixing 7 sideways by yourself 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:09.960
 I'm feeling like that 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:15.870
 This is the result of teaching my students 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:17.470
 If five people this is very glad that gave me my report to the wind that was able to win to him, etc. 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.800
 It is a thing 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:25.950
 And it's just doing ttsuzuki 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.820
 Very surprised this is 8 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.090
 I am not good at cutman 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:37.360
 Everyone's 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:40.960
 Because if you think that the cutman will come after you are just scared 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.620
 It's scheme is established that was too out 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.819
 Stop hitting a bit 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.629
 If you put more a lot more politely, maybe 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:54.010
 I think there will be more chances to win Cutman than now 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.010
 Let's do actually a 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.910
 Let's try to play now 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.890
 As a practice method 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:14.880
 If there are players cut man is asked to do towards the man and his 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:16.239
 If there are two such cut-mans, we will practice from now on in the form of a lecture island . 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.850
 I will 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.170
 First Naa useless in 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.170
 I will try to play 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.350
 Toppin 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.230
 Yes 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:38.740
 I think everyone like this experience will be better in the game 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:41.600
 So too the aim of course Tamada under the influence of rotation of the other party 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.810
 Go in the wrong direction 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.449
 In the middle of the opponent's platform to prevent this 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.910
 In terms of this Thailand 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:55.120
 It is this side in the case of the other party The middle 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.050
 It means that let's aim at 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.729
 Especially for beginners 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.180
 Without hitting 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:08.690
 Outside the open poking 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.660
 When the lateral rotation Majesty has been hanging like now if aiming at the middle that says If you fart middle 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.270
 But 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:16.409
 I will enter this side 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:20.009
 If you're aiming for the middle, you can get in here too 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:22.460
 If you aim at the middle, the broken ball will fall forward 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:28.440
 Knuckle balls go deep 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:30.270
 The point is to aim at the middle to make all the pillars of the revision work 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.830
 Then continue 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.830
 I will try a good example 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.629
 I will do it again 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:48.950
 Now I aimed at the middle 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.840
 Until now, Till, who is stretching outside, has a ball that wo n't enter Man Moon, but it slips in a little and enters 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.960
 I will 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:59.169
 It is very important to aim at this middle 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.169
 Then I will try to practice last 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.669
 Yes yes 

00:07:52.920 --> 00:08:02.380
 As I saw it now, I'll be able to put in various changes even in various attack man 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:08.350
 You can practice returning to comics 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:09.110
 If you go against the middle, you will always get somewhere in the platform even if you can change things like it is now 

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:14.830
 Give me 

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:14.830
 Thank you for trying such a practice method
