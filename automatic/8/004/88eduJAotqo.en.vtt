00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
disassembly did really well last time I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.700 
disassembly did really well last time I
think<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.239> got<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.780> think<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.620> like

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
now so I decided to do this scuff hybrid

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.590 
now so I decided to do this scuff hybrid
disassembly<00:00:41.730> now<00:00:41.850> I've<00:00:41.940> already<00:00:42.090> taken<00:00:42.510> it

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
disassembly now I've already taken it

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.360 
disassembly now I've already taken it
apart<00:00:42.840> as<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.590> see<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.800> modify<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
apart as you can see to modify it a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.100 
apart as you can see to modify it a
couple<00:00:44.550> times<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.809> see<00:00:45.930> it's

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
couple times and you can see it's

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.330 
couple times and you can see it's
completely<00:00:46.230> different<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:46.950> got<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> front

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
that and just to prove that it is just

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.860 
that and just to prove that it is just

probably<00:01:38.189> don't<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.939> many<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
probably don't have that many that to

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.889 
probably don't have that many that to
replace<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:41.360> that's<00:01:42.360> not<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> problem

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
replace it with but that's not a problem

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:52.700 
replace it with but that's not a problem
for<00:01:43.020> me<00:01:45.290> let's<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.530> pop<00:01:46.740> wrote<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:52.560> whole

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
for me let's just pop wrote the whole

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.249 
for me let's just pop wrote the whole
table<00:01:53.130> shaking<00:01:53.310> right<00:01:53.640> now

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
table shaking right now

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:03.600 
table shaking right now
come<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.350> there<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.189> go<00:01:56.780> that's<00:01:57.780> three

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.830 

now<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:04.640> don't<00:02:04.820> know<00:02:04.970> if<00:02:05.090> anyone's<00:02:05.390> done<00:02:05.510> this

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
now I don't know if anyone's done this

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.140 
now I don't know if anyone's done this
on<00:02:06.020> YouTube<00:02:06.350> yet<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.590> know<00:02:06.710> mine<00:02:07.100> last<00:02:07.610> time<00:02:07.910> was

on YouTube yet I know mine last time was
the<00:02:08.330> first<00:02:08.540> well<00:02:09.260> one<00:02:09.620> that<00:02:09.800> showed<00:02:10.070> you

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
the first well one that showed you

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.560 
the first well one that showed you
actually<00:02:10.730> taking<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.000> apart<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.270> know<00:02:11.300> there's

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
actually taking it apart I know there's

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.930 
actually taking it apart I know there's
a<00:02:11.600> ps3<00:02:11.960> one<00:02:12.350> last<00:02:12.560> time<00:02:12.800> but<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.610> was<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.910> first

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
a ps3 one last time but I was the first

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.040 
a ps3 one last time but I was the first
official<00:02:14.570> Xbox<00:02:15.050> one<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.440> do<00:02:15.560> it

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.890 

oops<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:22.120> don't<00:02:23.120> know<00:02:23.240> why<00:02:23.360> all<00:02:23.540> these<00:02:23.660> crew

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
oops I don't know why all these crew

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.330 
oops I don't know why all these crew
some<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.200> they're<00:02:24.320> staying<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.890> screw<00:02:25.130> holes

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
some of they're staying the screw holes

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.820 
some of they're staying the screw holes
but<00:02:25.610> that's<00:02:26.420> not<00:02:26.660> really<00:02:26.990> a<00:02:27.020> problem<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.680> just

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
but that's not really a problem I just

but that's not really a problem I just
got<00:02:28.010> pop<00:02:28.340> open<00:02:31.600> one's<00:02:32.600> good<00:02:32.900> where'd<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.200> go<00:02:33.350> oh

got pop open one's good where'd it go oh
there<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:33.950> is

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
there it is

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.310 
there it is
alright<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.210> now<00:02:35.450> how<00:02:35.630> I<00:02:35.660> like<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:35.960> do<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.230> to

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
alright so now how I like to do it to

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.740 
alright so now how I like to do it to
make<00:02:36.440> sure<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.950> back<00:02:37.490> stays<00:02:37.910> on<00:02:38.210> is<00:02:38.570> to

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
make sure that the back stays on is to

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.780 
make sure that the back stays on is to
just<00:02:38.990> kind<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.680> push<00:02:39.890> up<00:02:40.070> on<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.310> thumbsticks

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
just kind of push up on the thumbsticks

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.390 
just kind of push up on the thumbsticks
and<00:02:41.030> just<00:02:41.150> pull<00:02:41.360> out<00:02:41.510> like<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.900> then<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:43.370> can

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
and just pull out like that then you can

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.550 
and just pull out like that then you can
see<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:43.850> there's<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.360> front<00:02:44.660> half<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.230> then

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
see that there's the front half and then

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.890 
see that there's the front half and then
there's<00:02:46.460> the<00:02:46.700> shell<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.240> are<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.690> already

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
there's the shell you are you already

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.480 
there's the shell you are you already
guys<00:02:48.020> know<00:02:48.380> what<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.650> shell<00:02:48.860> looks<00:02:49.040> like<00:02:49.280> and

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
guys know what the shell looks like and

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.950 
guys know what the shell looks like and
how<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.610> modify<00:02:49.880> shells<00:02:50.360> if<00:02:50.570> you<00:02:50.660> watch<00:02:50.810> my

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
how to modify shells if you watch my

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.060 
how to modify shells if you watch my
other<00:02:50.990> video<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:51.470> we're<00:02:51.590> just<00:02:51.620> going<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:51.890> focus

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
other video so we're just going to focus

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.410 
other video so we're just going to focus
on<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.460> circuit<00:02:52.760> board<00:02:52.940> right<00:02:53.090> now

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
on the circuit board right now

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.350 
on the circuit board right now
as<00:02:54.350> you<00:02:54.590> can<00:02:54.740> see<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.460> is<00:02:55.700> what<00:02:55.880> they've<00:02:56.060> done

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
as you can see that is what they've done

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.350 
as you can see that is what they've done
they've<00:02:56.570> got<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:57.190> da<00:02:58.190> that'd<00:02:58.580> be<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.060> X<00:02:59.210> and

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
they've got the da that'd be the X and

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.000 
they've got the da that'd be the X and
the<00:02:59.420> y<00:02:59.540> wired<00:02:59.870> there<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.500> actually<00:03:00.680> haven't

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
the y wired there and I actually haven't

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.800 
the y wired there and I actually haven't
ever<00:03:01.460> removed<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.060> back<00:03:02.270> to<00:03:02.480> see<00:03:02.630> what<00:03:02.720> it

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
ever removed the back to see what it

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.560 
ever removed the back to see what it
looks<00:03:02.990> like<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.790> think<00:03:04.790> we're<00:03:05.090> gonna<00:03:05.180> take<00:03:05.450> the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
looks like I think we're gonna take the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.000 
looks like I think we're gonna take the
rumble<00:03:05.840> pack<00:03:06.020> so<00:03:06.230> we<00:03:06.380> do<00:03:06.500> this<00:03:06.650> because<00:03:06.860> I

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
rumble pack so we do this because I

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.740 
rumble pack so we do this because I
don't<00:03:07.040> want<00:03:07.220> them<00:03:07.490> in<00:03:07.580> there<00:03:07.760> anymore<00:03:07.970> and

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
don't want them in there anymore and

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.100 
don't want them in there anymore and
we're<00:03:09.290> just<00:03:09.380> gonna<00:03:09.910> pop<00:03:10.910> this<00:03:11.180> up<00:03:11.420> carefully<00:03:12.080> I

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
we're just gonna pop this up carefully I

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.270 
we're just gonna pop this up carefully I
don't<00:03:12.380> know<00:03:12.470> what<00:03:12.620> it's<00:03:12.709> gonna<00:03:12.800> look<00:03:12.920> like<00:03:13.070> on

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
don't know what it's gonna look like on

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.250 
don't know what it's gonna look like on
the<00:03:13.370> other<00:03:13.430> side<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:14.720> kind<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:14.959> feels<00:03:15.170> like

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
the other side it kind of feels like

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.880 
the other side it kind of feels like
it's<00:03:15.470> been<00:03:15.620> glued<00:03:16.989> let<00:03:17.989> me<00:03:18.080> figure<00:03:18.320> oh<00:03:18.680> there

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
it's been glued let me figure oh there

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.580 
it's been glued let me figure oh there
we<00:03:18.950> go<00:03:18.980> alright<00:03:19.840> gotta<00:03:20.840> be<00:03:20.930> really<00:03:21.410> careful

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
we go alright gotta be really careful

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.870 
we go alright gotta be really careful
when<00:03:21.860> I'm<00:03:21.950> doing<00:03:22.010> this<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.370> don't<00:03:22.430> want<00:03:22.820> to

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
when I'm doing this I don't want to

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.630 
when I'm doing this I don't want to
break<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.709> seems<00:03:24.709> really<00:03:25.010> tight<00:03:25.280> at<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.489> back

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
break it seems really tight at the back

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.440 
break it seems really tight at the back
but<00:03:26.570> as<00:03:26.750> you<00:03:26.930> can<00:03:27.050> see<00:03:27.230> there<00:03:28.220> is<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.940> I'm

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
but as you can see there is the I'm

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.640 
but as you can see there is the I'm
guessing<00:03:29.780> that's<00:03:29.900> where<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.230> rechargeable

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
guessing that's where the rechargeable

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.650 
guessing that's where the rechargeable
battery<00:03:30.739> is<00:03:31.130> underneath<00:03:31.459> there<00:03:31.730> but<00:03:32.390> you<00:03:32.540> can

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
battery is underneath there but you can

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.300 
battery is underneath there but you can
see<00:03:32.810> all<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.110> complexities<00:03:33.739> with<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.130> wires

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
see all the complexities with the wires

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.510 
see all the complexities with the wires
going<00:03:34.670> on<00:03:34.850> back<00:03:35.090> there<00:03:35.360> I<00:03:36.190> really<00:03:37.190> don't<00:03:37.340> want

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
going on back there I really don't want

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.190 
going on back there I really don't want
to<00:03:37.580> mess<00:03:37.850> this<00:03:37.880> up<00:03:38.270> but<00:03:38.630> as<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.840> can<00:03:38.930> see<00:03:39.080> it

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
to mess this up but as you can see it

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.660 
to mess this up but as you can see it
says<00:03:39.320> scuff<00:03:39.620> there<00:03:39.860> this<00:03:40.010> is<00:03:40.160> their<00:03:40.280> custom

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
says scuff there this is their custom

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.940 
says scuff there this is their custom
shell<00:03:40.970> there's<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.959> port<00:03:42.260> it's<00:03:42.470> wired<00:03:42.709> and

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
shell there's the port it's wired and

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.140 
shell there's the port it's wired and
they<00:03:43.040> basically<00:03:43.220> added<00:03:43.610> their<00:03:43.700> own<00:03:43.730> circuit

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
they basically added their own circuit

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.120 
they basically added their own circuit
board<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:45.170> I'm<00:03:45.650> thinking<00:03:45.950> I'm<00:03:46.010> gonna

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
board to it and I'm thinking I'm gonna

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.420 
board to it and I'm thinking I'm gonna
try<00:03:46.489> and<00:03:46.550> remove<00:03:47.330> my<00:03:47.720> Rumble<00:03:48.260> motors<00:03:48.590> I<00:03:48.860> don't

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
try and remove my Rumble motors I don't

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.699 
try and remove my Rumble motors I don't
want<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:49.640> screw<00:03:49.850> this<00:03:49.880> up

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.900 

don't<00:03:54.709> wanna<00:03:54.890> pull<00:03:55.370> too<00:03:55.640> hard

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.250 

usually<00:03:58.910> they'll<00:03:59.090> just<00:03:59.300> pop<00:03:59.570> right<00:03:59.600> out<00:04:00.020> but

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
usually they'll just pop right out but

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.320 
usually they'll just pop right out but
these<00:04:00.410> guys<00:04:00.650> are<00:04:00.890> being<00:04:01.100> contrary<00:04:01.520> today<00:04:04.330> come

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
the mobs that I wanted to do we're just

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.270 
the mobs that I wanted to do we're just
gonna<00:04:24.780> make<00:04:24.990> sure<00:04:25.139> if<00:04:25.260> she's<00:04:25.470> I'll<00:04:26.070> give<00:04:26.220> you

one<00:04:26.430> more<00:04:26.580> look<00:04:26.639> just<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.120> case<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.389> want<00:04:27.540> to

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
one more look just in case you want to

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.320 
one more look just in case you want to
see<00:04:27.780> but<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:29.250> looks<00:04:29.580> kind<00:04:29.790> of<00:04:29.820> like<00:04:29.910> they<00:04:30.090> tried

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
see but it looks kind of like they tried

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.850 
see but it looks kind of like they tried
to<00:04:30.360> glue<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.810> two<00:04:30.960> together<00:04:31.139> so<00:04:31.350> you<00:04:31.530> can<00:04:31.680> take

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
to glue the two together so you can take

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.129 
to glue the two together so you can take
that<00:04:31.889> part<00:04:32.250> but<00:04:32.400> that<00:04:32.580> is<00:04:32.760> all<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.000> wires<00:04:33.240> you

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
that part but that is all the wires you

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.010 
that part but that is all the wires you
can<00:04:34.230> see<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.440> wired<00:04:34.710> into<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.070> back<00:04:35.250> there

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
can see it wired into the back there

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.870 
can see it wired into the back there
it's<00:04:37.020> kind<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.260> interesting<00:04:37.470> actually<00:04:37.800> but<00:04:38.730> we

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
it's kind of interesting actually but we

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.670 
it's kind of interesting actually but we
are<00:04:39.030> going<00:04:39.180> to<00:04:39.270> pop<00:04:39.540> it<00:04:39.720> back<00:04:39.750> together<00:04:40.169> so<00:04:40.650> I

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
are going to pop it back together so I

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.550 
are going to pop it back together so I
can<00:04:40.919> still<00:04:41.250> use<00:04:41.490> it<00:04:41.669> when<00:04:42.480> I<00:04:42.510> play<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:42.990> my<00:04:43.200> dad's

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
can still use it when I play it my dad's

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.350 
can still use it when I play it my dad's
house<00:04:43.889> now<00:04:44.280> I<00:04:44.310> just<00:04:44.400> got<00:04:44.669> to<00:04:44.880> figure<00:04:45.000> out<00:04:45.210> how

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
house now I just got to figure out how

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.510 
house now I just got to figure out how
they<00:04:45.510> set<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:45.900> in<00:04:46.139> they're<00:04:46.380> not<00:04:47.220> really<00:04:47.400> sure

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
they set this in they're not really sure

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.640 
they set this in they're not really sure
as<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.940> how<00:04:48.000> they<00:04:48.180> did<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:48.510> let's<00:04:49.260> just<00:04:49.320> make

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
as to how they did it let's just make

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:58.810 
as to how they did it let's just make
sure<00:04:52.160> I<00:04:54.169> see<00:04:55.169> okay<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.760> think<00:04:56.760> that's<00:04:57.120> back<00:04:57.360> on<00:04:57.660> I

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
sure I see okay I think that's back on I

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.909 
sure I see okay I think that's back on I
think<00:04:59.820> so<00:05:00.060> looking<00:05:00.419> good<00:05:00.660> so<00:05:01.200> we<00:05:01.470> are<00:05:01.500> going<00:05:01.830> to

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
think so looking good so we are going to

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:02.990 
think so looking good so we are going to
I<00:05:02.190> don't<00:05:02.400> know<00:05:02.490> what<00:05:02.580> they're<00:05:02.700> doing<00:05:02.910> down

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
I don't know what they're doing down

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.780 
I don't know what they're doing down
there<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:03.270> think<00:05:03.600> that's<00:05:03.810> just<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:04.110> ground<00:05:04.380> it

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
there I think that's just to ground it

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.520 
there I think that's just to ground it
but<00:05:05.790> alright<00:05:06.060> so<00:05:06.300> we<00:05:06.540> are<00:05:06.720> going<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:07.020> wear<00:05:07.380> that

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530

we<00:05:25.110> go<00:05:25.260> just<00:05:25.289> make<00:05:25.740> sure<00:05:25.919> she's<00:05:26.130> all<00:05:26.250> together

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
we go just make sure she's all together

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.750 
we go just make sure she's all together
then<00:05:28.050> I'm<00:05:28.200> just<00:05:28.380> gonna<00:05:28.500> grab<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.890> by<00:05:29.430> the<00:05:29.490> two

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
then I'm just gonna grab it by the two

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.190 
then I'm just gonna grab it by the two
prongs<00:05:30.030> where<00:05:30.330> I<00:05:30.360> like<00:05:30.510> to<00:05:30.539> hold<00:05:30.780> it<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:31.080> make

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
prongs where I like to hold it to make

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.990 
prongs where I like to hold it to make
sure<00:05:31.350> nothing<00:05:31.680> falls<00:05:31.710> out<00:05:32.039> then<00:05:32.850> you're<00:05:32.940> just

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
sure nothing falls out then you're just

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.580 
sure nothing falls out then you're just
gonna<00:05:33.120> slide<00:05:33.450> it<00:05:33.600> in<00:05:33.690> like<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:34.050> and<00:05:34.380> just

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
kind of squeeze your shot and then

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.840 
kind of squeeze your shot and then
you're<00:05:37.620> just<00:05:37.710> gonna<00:05:37.860> take<00:05:38.070> your<00:05:38.190> screws<00:05:38.460> and

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
you're just gonna take your screws and

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.730

controller<00:05:45.780> now<00:05:45.990> I<00:05:46.020> didn't<00:05:46.320> get<00:05:46.410> the

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
controller now I didn't get the

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.520 
controller now I didn't get the
remappable<00:05:47.130> paddles<00:05:47.669> so<00:05:48.570> I<00:05:48.600> did<00:05:48.960> don't<00:05:49.229> think

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
remappable paddles so I did don't think

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.020 
remappable paddles so I did don't think
we<00:05:49.620> could<00:05:49.770> really<00:05:49.979> see<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.250> mechanism<00:05:50.520> of<00:05:50.940> how

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
we could really see the mechanism of how

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.159 
we could really see the mechanism of how
they<00:05:51.180> did<00:05:51.240> that<00:05:51.510> I<00:05:51.570> don't<00:05:51.840> know<00:05:51.930> why<00:05:52.050> that

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
they did that I don't know why that

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.409 
they did that I don't know why that
screw<00:05:52.380> there<00:05:52.650> we<00:05:52.740> go<00:05:52.830> we<00:05:53.580> couldn't<00:05:54.000> really<00:05:54.090> see

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
screw there we go we couldn't really see

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.630 
screw there we go we couldn't really see
the<00:05:54.780> mechanism<00:05:55.050> of<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:55.680> remappable<00:05:56.190> paddles

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
the mechanism of the remappable paddles

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.070 
the mechanism of the remappable paddles
awesome<00:05:57.000> one<00:05:57.150> thing<00:05:57.300> I<00:05:57.360> really<00:05:57.690> wanted<00:05:57.960> to

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.950 
one of these and has a remappable
paddles<00:06:02.160> option<00:06:02.550> and<00:06:02.760> they<00:06:03.300> want<00:06:03.510> to<00:06:03.600> slice

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
paddles option and they want to slice
