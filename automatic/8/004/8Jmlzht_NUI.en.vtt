00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
game it did but I it is what is found I

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.270 
game it did but I it is what is found I
think<00:01:36.850> in<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.210> first<00:01:38.510> half<00:01:38.750> we<00:01:39.200> do<00:01:39.620> good<00:01:40.010> gel

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
think in the first half we do good gel

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.450 
think in the first half we do good gel
to<00:01:40.520> use<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.790> flags<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:41.950> they<00:01:42.950> were<00:01:43.010> dropping

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
to use the flags and they were dropping

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.230 
to use the flags and they were dropping
off<00:01:45.010> bugger<00:01:46.010> just<00:01:46.490> outside<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:47.750> box<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:49.240> think

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
off bugger just outside the box I think

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.260 
off bugger just outside the box I think
it'd<00:01:50.450> been<00:01:50.750> jogging<00:01:51.110> path<00:01:52.070> chief<00:01:53.030> information

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
it'd been jogging path chief information

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.410 
it'd been jogging path chief information
and<00:01:53.990> black<00:01:54.890> children<00:01:55.100> beef<00:01:55.460> changed<00:01:56.270> me<00:01:56.390> a

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
and black children beef changed me a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.390 
and black children beef changed me a
little<00:01:56.660> bit<00:01:56.870> for<00:01:57.740> us<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:58.070> was<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.190> great

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
little bit for us it was a great

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.190 
little bit for us it was a great
learning<00:01:58.430> experience<00:01:59.120> because<00:01:59.570> we<00:01:59.930> can't

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
learning experience because we can't

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.230
