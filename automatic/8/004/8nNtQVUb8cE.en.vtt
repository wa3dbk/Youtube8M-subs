00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
me it's better I've got my protein it's

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.510 
me it's better I've got my protein it's
under<00:03:31.910> probably<00:03:32.360> 150<00:03:32.900> calories<00:03:33.319> because<00:03:34.280> the

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
under probably 150 calories because the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.550 
under probably 150 calories because the
whey<00:03:34.910> protein<00:03:35.300> so<00:03:35.510> lean<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:35.780> then<00:03:36.140> you've

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
whey protein so lean and then you've

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.960 
whey protein so lean and then you've
just<00:03:36.590> got<00:03:36.860> a<00:03:36.890> splash<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.280> almond<00:03:37.520> milk<00:03:37.550> no

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
just got a splash of almond milk no

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.570 
just got a splash of almond milk no
calories<00:03:38.420> in<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.860> instant<00:03:40.400> coffee

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
calories in the and the instant coffee

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.670 
calories in the and the instant coffee
and<00:03:40.790> then<00:03:41.000> only<00:03:41.150> one<00:03:41.450> tablespoon<00:03:42.050> of<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.290> pb2

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
and then only one tablespoon of the pb2

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.100
