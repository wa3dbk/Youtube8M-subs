at the website for this product you will

which<00:01:59.610> means<00:01:59.850> per<00:02:00.180> half<00:02:00.360> scoop<00:02:00.630> you're

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
which means per half scoop you're

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.109 
which means per half scoop you're
looking<00:02:01.079> at<00:02:01.229> 2<00:02:01.409> grams<00:02:01.710> each<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.729> gives<00:02:03.000> us

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
looking at 2 grams each so this gives us

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.730 
looking at 2 grams each so this gives us
some<00:02:03.329> leeway<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.259> then<00:02:04.439> kind<00:02:04.619> of

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
some leeway as we can then kind of

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.590 
some leeway as we can then kind of
determine<00:02:05.189> how<00:02:05.340> much<00:02:05.520> citrulline<00:02:06.000> malate<00:02:06.210> sin

determine how much citrulline malate sin
here<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.290> reason<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.619> do<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.979> typical

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
here the reason I do this is typical

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
alanine has shown to be 3.2 grams so the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.210 
alanine has shown to be 3.2 grams so the
fact<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.650> you're<00:02:13.830> getting

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220

four grams in a full scoop that's

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.960 
four grams in a full scoop that's

two grams per full scoop again the issue
with<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.720> if<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.930> combine<00:02:46.320> this<00:02:46.500> with

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
with that is is if you combine this with

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.290 
with that is is if you combine this with
some<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.040> other<00:02:47.220> useful<00:02:47.670> ingredients<00:02:47.820> as
