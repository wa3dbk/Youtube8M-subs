00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.610 

in<00:00:00.269> this<00:00:00.450> example<00:00:00.780> we<00:00:01.050> have<00:00:01.079> a<00:00:01.199> storage<00:00:01.530> tank

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
in this example we have a storage tank

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.590 
in this example we have a storage tank
which<00:00:02.010> holds<00:00:02.310> water<00:00:02.550> before<00:00:03.090> it's<00:00:03.210> pumped<00:00:03.389> out

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
which holds water before it's pumped out

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.499 
which holds water before it's pumped out
to<00:00:03.659> call<00:00:03.990> these<00:00:04.259> for<00:00:04.589> combustion<00:00:04.950> engines

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:05.509 
to call these for combustion engines

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:07.760 
to call these for combustion engines
combustion<00:00:06.509> engines<00:00:06.779> do<00:00:06.990> use<00:00:07.200> quite<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> bit<00:00:07.680> of

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
combustion engines do use quite a bit of

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.680 
combustion engines do use quite a bit of
water<00:00:07.890> over<00:00:08.220> time<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:08.970> it's<00:00:09.150> always<00:00:09.300> safe<00:00:09.570> to

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
water over time so it's always safe to

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.390 
water over time so it's always safe to
have<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> backup<00:00:10.080> storage<00:00:10.620> tank<00:00:10.950> because<00:00:11.280> you

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
have a backup storage tank because you

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.650 
have a backup storage tank because you
definitely<00:00:11.580> don't<00:00:11.910> want<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.240> combustion

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
definitely don't want the combustion

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.320 
definitely don't want the combustion
engines<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.080> overheat<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.650> explode<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.370> have<00:00:15.269> a

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
engines to overheat and explode I have a

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.730 
engines to overheat and explode I have a
redstone<00:00:15.599> engine<00:00:15.960> pumping<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.320> water<00:00:16.350> out<00:00:16.590> of

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
redstone engine pumping the water out of

redstone engine pumping the water out of
this<00:00:16.980> tank<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:17.670> permanently<00:00:18.119> powered

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
this tank and it's permanently powered

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.570 
this tank and it's permanently powered
on<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:19.289> combustion<00:00:19.619> engine<00:00:19.980> over<00:00:20.189> here<00:00:20.369> is

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
on this combustion engine over here is

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.519 
on this combustion engine over here is
connected<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.210> pump<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.840> would<00:00:22.080> waste<00:00:22.230> too

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
connected to the pump it would waste too

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.720 
connected to the pump it would waste too
much<00:00:22.560> fuel<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.279> running<00:00:23.519> all<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
much fuel to have it running all the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.150 
much fuel to have it running all the
time<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.539> instead<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:25.140> only<00:00:25.410> want<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.920> switch

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
time so instead I only want it to switch

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.130 
time so instead I only want it to switch
on<00:00:26.369> when<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> water<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.000> needed<00:00:27.210> solving<00:00:28.050> this

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
on when the water is needed solving this

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.689 
on when the water is needed solving this
problem<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.500> quite<00:00:28.650> easy<00:00:28.890> if<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.220> use<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> pipe

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
problem is quite easy if we use a pipe

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.550 
problem is quite easy if we use a pipe
wire<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.869> pipe<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.199> brings<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
wire this is the pipe that brings the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.620 
wire this is the pipe that brings the
water<00:00:31.710> into<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.040> storage<00:00:32.430> tank<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.450> pipe

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
segment closest to the tank I've

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.700 
segment closest to the tank I've
attached<00:00:35.670> an<00:00:35.910> iron<00:00:36.239> gate<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.140> use<00:00:37.380> an<00:00:37.530> awl

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
attached an iron gate you can use an awl

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.400 
attached an iron gate you can use an awl
or<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.040> NAND<00:00:38.370> gate<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.940> place<00:00:39.410> right

clicking<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.950> gate<00:00:41.100> will<00:00:41.280> bring<00:00:41.460> up<00:00:41.579> its

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
clicking on the gate will bring up its

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.940 
clicking on the gate will bring up its
interface<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.809> can<00:00:42.989> see<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:43.469> I've<00:00:43.710> set

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
interface so you can see here I've set

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.229 
interface so you can see here I've set
it<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.250> if<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> detects<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:44.969> there<00:00:45.149> is

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
it so that if it detects that there is

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
it so that if it detects that there is
space<00:00:45.480> inside<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> tank<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.469> will<00:00:46.739> activate

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
space inside the tank it will activate

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.520 
space inside the tank it will activate

the pipe wire signal the space inside
the<00:00:49.710> tank<00:00:49.950> condition<00:00:50.460> simply<00:00:50.910> means<00:00:51.239> that

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the tank condition simply means that

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.479 
the tank condition simply means that
when<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> tank<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.440> maximum<00:00:52.920> capacity

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
when the tank is at maximum capacity

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.369 
when the tank is at maximum capacity
it'll<00:00:53.879> stop<00:00:54.180> sending<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.690> red<00:00:54.899> pipe<00:00:55.199> way

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
it'll stop sending the red pipe way

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.410 
it'll stop sending the red pipe way
signal<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:55.980> until<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> tank<00:00:57.030> reaches

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
signal and until the tank reaches

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.389 
signal and until the tank reaches
maximum<00:00:57.719> capacity<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.559> will<00:00:58.920> continue

one<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.060> them<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.360> might<00:01:27.390> want<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.750> check<00:01:27.900> out

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
one of them you might want to check out

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.539 
one of them you might want to check out
this<00:01:28.229> troubleshooting<00:01:28.860> tutorial<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.369> put

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
this troubleshooting tutorial I put

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.490 
this troubleshooting tutorial I put
together<00:01:29.670> as<00:01:30.600> soon<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> combustion

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
together as soon as the combustion

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200 
together as soon as the combustion
engine<00:01:31.710> starts<00:01:32.040> back<00:01:32.220> up<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.820> pump<00:01:33.090> will

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
engine starts back up the pump will

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.120 
engine starts back up the pump will
begin<00:01:33.450> pumping<00:01:33.659> water<00:01:34.020> which<00:01:34.590> will<00:01:34.770> top<00:01:34.979> up

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
begin pumping water which will top up

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.830 
begin pumping water which will top up
the<00:01:35.280> pumps<00:01:35.549> combustion<00:01:36.030> engine<00:01:36.270> first<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the pumps combustion engine first and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.810 
the pumps combustion engine first and
then<00:01:37.259> flow<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.890> backup<00:01:38.250> water<00:01:38.430> storage

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
then flow to the backup water storage

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.120 
then flow to the backup water storage
tank<00:01:39.119> when<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> iron<00:01:40.229> gate<00:01:40.409> closest<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
tank when the iron gate closest to the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.010 
tank when the iron gate closest to the
tank<00:01:41.369> detects<00:01:41.759> there<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.090> no<00:01:42.299> space<00:01:42.570> left<00:01:42.899> for
