 he was that Genghis Khan 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.490
 there was no time to heal 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:16.710
 warriors after all there was a horde and usually always in 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.780
 a large mass of nations with someone something 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.840
 something happens but in general if you 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.540
 ask any vet what's from 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.620
 what animals are sick of you vet 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:31.980

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.190
 there was a cure it needed 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.320

 hacked and still in the east 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.940
 There are such treatments in 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.210
 Tibet when our monks come to them 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.790

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.820

 pulp take plum juice or take 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:16.020
 tomato juice doesn't care if the liver 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.719

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.770
 swallowing 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.960
 you can not chew if you eat it means a blow 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.270
 over the heart over the pancreas 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.280
 the main thing that was not even juice 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.750
 need to dry put to try 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.130
 chop so that was less juice and 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.500
 with a spoon 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.590
 squeezed in the night and again why because 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.410
 we are all among the people so that not from us 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.870
 smelled believe me if you swallow the smell 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.960
 No, if you have a face, you will smell like a whole 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.090
 day so here he drank this glass 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.630
 garlic it was on thursday topic we are with it 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.180
 have met 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.570
 and on monday he comes you like that 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.130
 eyes and starts and says wait i 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.260
 gathered all my therapists who 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.260
 were not busy I say tell me 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.530
 them and when he started telling that from 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.940
 he came out and imagine this 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.420
 garlic goes on guts 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.670
 all flat tape will talk 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.830
 roundworms of small large hair 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.930
 chapter there is nothing but all that 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.720
 comes across scrape just because 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:23.920
 shovel and a bunch of parsley 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.750
 does not work unfortunately no no 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.510
 not enough here it is necessary to begin the composition 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.160
 garlic partially digested partially 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.710
 digested then we spent 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.590
 since we have the equipment we 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.160
 conducted a study and began with the fact that 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.500
 for some time decided on how 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.960
 heads of garlic that is, they took the head 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.980
 Chinese garlic is very so sharp so 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:54.750
 we began to chop it up and on the night over the head 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.440
 and that means such an interesting moment 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.520
 initially when we have a doctor 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.220
 Worked tatyana me skin on a team 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.110
 floor microscope she spoke such 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.350
 santamo fetch 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.630
 can i see your blood 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.540
 she says that's your blood I'll be everything 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.989
 show patients as a model for well 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.720
 if you like it show me further 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.480
 what do I mean doing this experiment 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.860
 every day I start to swallow on this 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.020
 garlic heads 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.110
 a week later I decided to look like he 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:36.220
 access then I always have all the doctors gone 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.090
 in the evening I decided to take blood from myself 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.970
 microscope 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.160
 I look mother dear 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.680
 blood of this throw blood 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.560
 the worst was the blood that is such 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.880
 bacterial background larval background high 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.410
 mushrooms appeared in the blood then what was not 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.320
 from where 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.690
 Well, I think, okay, I will continue to drink once 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.690
 the whole thing may have appeared again 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.750
 continue for another week then it turns out 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.480
 so such an interesting schedule first 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.000
 it turns out that the body starts 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.970
 saturate that is what is present in 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.850
 garlic obviously there is strong obviously 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:20.080
 some fragments of the body the truth begins 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:22.750
 smell but not from the mouth but the body begins 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.530
 but you don't feel it feels 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.890
 surrounding and then it turns comes 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.020
 an interesting moment comes when 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.210
 a large number of all these extruded them 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:38.080
 because of the muscles we have in the muscles 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:41.110
 a large number of parasites larvae 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.350
 mushrooms are just not in lymphatic 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.840
 system and that's when they started to take but 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.750
 if we put a leech and start eating 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.250
 spur rank api spay key from there 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.229
 blood stained lymph 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.120
 we take this and under the microscope and what we 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.250
 watch we watch a huge 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.940
 amount of everything that is squeezed out 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.789
 of muscle 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.100
 from the tissue ie it is squeezed out and in 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:05.470
 lymphatic system and in the blood and where 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:10.000
 in the lymphatic system of these viruses and 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.890
 mushrooms more than in the blood 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.229
 what a time I am again 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.120
 looked and it turned out so first 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.979
 there is a maximum ejection then it goes 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.120
 less less less less less and 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:20.860
 turns out that 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.610
 to bring a person into conformity 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:29.410
 you need to drink away for about a month 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:31.300
 such a head and then the body is cleansed and 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.580
 internal state becomes different 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.740
 that is, for our lives we collect 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.440
 enough to carry output 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.360
 all these parasites 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:45.510
 and chew effect is completely different 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.820
 I mean, yes, and a number of you 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:53.480
 able to eat it anyway this 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.480
 load on the system and here you need everything
