it's going to rain at some point which
is<00:02:56.320> why<00:02:56.530> we<00:02:56.680> also<00:02:56.890> test<00:02:57.340> in<00:02:57.489> wet<00:02:57.730> conditions

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
is why we also test in wet conditions

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.690 
is why we also test in wet conditions
and<00:02:58.600> in<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.230> wet<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.800> can<00:02:59.950> expect<00:03:00.250> grip<00:03:00.519> will

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
and in the wet you can expect grip will

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.520 
and in the wet you can expect grip will
be<00:03:00.850> less<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.330> braking<00:03:01.750> distances<00:03:02.260> will<00:03:02.500> be

be less and braking distances will be
longer<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.190> just<00:03:03.730> because<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.090> have<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.300> tire

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
longer and just because you have a tire

longer and just because you have a tire
that<00:03:04.570> performs<00:03:05.140> well<00:03:05.320> in<00:03:05.350> dry<00:03:05.590> conditions

that performs well in dry conditions
doesn't<00:03:06.700> mean<00:03:06.820> it's<00:03:06.970> going<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.180> be<00:03:07.269> as<00:03:07.390> good<00:03:07.540> in

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690

on about 16,000 miles but you can see

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.210 
on about 16,000 miles but you can see

tread depth left than this one yeah and

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.890

that<00:05:03.370> affects<00:05:03.700> the<00:05:03.760> performance<00:05:03.970> at<00:05:04.540> a<00:05:04.630> tire

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
best but we've also seen in our tests

that<00:06:04.060> sometimes<00:06:04.510> rolling<00:06:04.840> resistance<00:06:04.960> is<00:06:05.380> a

that sometimes rolling resistance is a

that sometimes rolling resistance is a

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
which is why we recommend you pick

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.710 
which is why we recommend you pick
performance<00:06:09.550> first<00:06:09.790> and<00:06:10.090> use<00:06:10.390> rolling

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
performance first and use rolling

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.570 
performance first and use rolling
resistance<00:06:10.840> as<00:06:11.229> a<00:06:11.260> tiebreaker

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
resistance as a tiebreaker

resistance as a tiebreaker
and<00:06:13.800> remember<00:06:14.800> don't<00:06:15.310> skimp<00:06:15.759> on<00:06:15.909> tires<00:06:16.270> don't

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
and remember don't skimp on tires don't

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.110 
and remember don't skimp on tires don't
put<00:06:17.289> off<00:06:17.439> replacing<00:06:17.710> them<00:06:18.129> for<00:06:18.400> too<00:06:18.550> long<00:06:18.819> and

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
put off replacing them for too long and

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.200 
put off replacing them for too long and
never<00:06:19.569> buy<00:06:19.840> used<00:06:20.229> tires<00:06:20.650> again<00:06:21.580> you<00:06:21.909> can't

never buy used tires again you can't
