on meeting your egg whites

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.010 
on meeting your egg whites
first<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.619> should<00:01:40.680> make<00:01:41.640> your<00:01:41.789> eggs

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
first you should make your eggs

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
first you should make your eggs
room-temperature<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.789> using<00:01:44.789> a<00:01:44.910> metal<00:01:45.210> bowl

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
room-temperature and using a metal bowl

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.900 
room-temperature and using a metal bowl
is<00:01:45.630> better<00:01:45.869> versus<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> plastic<00:01:47.070> bowl<00:01:47.310> because

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
is better versus a plastic bowl because

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.969 
is better versus a plastic bowl because
on<00:01:48.360> plastic<00:01:48.810> bowls<00:01:48.990> they<00:01:49.289> can<00:01:49.470> leave<00:01:49.649> traces

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
on plastic bowls they can leave traces

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.880 
on plastic bowls they can leave traces
of<00:01:50.160> oil<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.690> can<00:01:51.869> ruin<00:01:52.020> your<00:01:52.289> egg<00:01:52.440> whites

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
of oil and it can ruin your egg whites

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.240 
of oil and it can ruin your egg whites
okay<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.450> now<00:01:55.050> you're<00:01:55.289> going<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> mix<00:01:55.710> the
