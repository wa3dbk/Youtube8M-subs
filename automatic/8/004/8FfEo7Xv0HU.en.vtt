the<00:02:14.860> problem<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:17.440> mutation<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:19.420> we

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
the problem is is is a mutation so we

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.880 
the problem is is is a mutation so we
can<00:02:20.650> call<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.250> problem<00:02:21.610> as<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.420> transcription
