00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.340
 welcome to the taste of my kitchen 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.800
 we are on the 5th day of the week 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.930
 of celebration and if you came to this 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.510
 video is that you want to make the palms 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.240
 or you can make the puff pastry 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.070
 home and watch the previous video that goes to 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.340
 be connected to the information box 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.960
 or you can well buy the pasta 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.880
 puff pastry that they sell refrigerated in the 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.489
 sometimes transfigured shop opens its 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.489
 freeze then let's continue with the process 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.950
 I'm going to put some flour and we're going to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.130
 start making our little ears 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.470
 I need to stretch this as if it were a 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.690
 box in which they usually come what 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.890
 thinnest you can 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.890
 and it is very hard 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.439
 and so we already have a rectangle 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.220
 and now that we 're going to do again, we're going to 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.369
 put a little sugar about 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.190
 a teaspoon do not put a lot of sugar 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.080
 because if you put a lot of sugar after 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.080
 mass is not going to stick with one another 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.300
 it is well distributed 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.810
 and then with the roller we're going to 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.090
 spend nothing more to be integrated into the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.730
 mass not to stretch it but nothing else 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.040
 so that it integrates 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.720
 and here we are not going to calculate the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.400
 center 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.400
 and we are going to fold that in 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.340
 and inward 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.190
 let's 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.190
 and roll over one more time 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.520
 and we are going to put sugar again 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.439
 and I'm going to go back to 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:20.230
 crush for the sugar to be integrated 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:22.210
 more and I'm going to fold once more towards the 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.050
 center 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.050
 and so the center 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.220
 toward the center 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.220
 It is the center 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.970
 once for it to sink 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.130
 and now let's do it will come back to 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.760
 close 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.760
 once again 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.969
 let's crush it a little bit 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.290
 although we have space because it was not 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.290
 no space to close 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.860
 and 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.530
 I'm going to flip like I do not have space 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.450
 to close one more time and now I close one 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.290
 with the other one and it must stay like that 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.290
 two rolls 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.729
 and we are going to capture them very well that the 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.729
 mass paste one with another 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.660
 try not to do it with your hand like me 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.310
 I did it because you're going to heat the dough and 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.310
 the butter is going to melt 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.080
 in the waxed 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:05.959
 I'm going to cut the first principle because 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.059
 it has all the Czech banks but you 

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:10.569
 fixed more or less there you can see 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:13.459
 the two rolls then I'm going to cut 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:14.899
 I like delgaditas there orejitas not 

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:17.029
 I like them thick because I do not like that 

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:19.339
 If you have doubts, you can cut them from a 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.869
 centimeter to a half centimeter that 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:23.199
 it would be more or less the thickness of 

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:23.199
 your finger 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.670
 I do not know, I'm going to cut 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:36.819
 and when you put it in a tray we're going 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:38.760
 to do so and so for the outside to stay 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.920
 as a type of b 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.080
 and do not put them in meetings because you're 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.100
 instead of growing up are to 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.100
 be like that for the sides 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.500
 and so we will do successively until 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:00.980
 that we have the whole tray full and the 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.980
 let's bake at 400 degrees ok 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.419
 then they just came out of the oven 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.040
 after 10 minutes flip them over 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.320
 ears to finish browning 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.090
 on both sides as I did not have much 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.130
 sugar is better to put the little 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.969
 What a lot now I will pass 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.759
 hot 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:33.689
 and giving me a fork on a plate 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.689
 with sugar 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.509
 and seeing us imposing on the plate 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:57.040
 and so until we finish this is the 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.500
 final result of the ears or 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.330
 let as they want to say does 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.280
 they lasted a little bit the more they became brown 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.560
 obviously the dough is more dry and 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.790
 they are more crispy although there are 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.600
 take into account that when they are 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:12.550
 hot are still slightly 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.760
 softly then I do not want to complain 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.440
 of more then here is I hope that you 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.300
 have liked this recipe I hope that what 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.300
 try at home and good profit
