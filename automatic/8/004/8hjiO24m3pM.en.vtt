00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
things very differently and mercury is

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.330 
things very differently and mercury is
you<00:02:54.000> know<00:02:54.139> coming<00:02:55.139> into<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:55.859> very<00:02:56.099> unique

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
you know coming into this very unique

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.949 
you know coming into this very unique
zone<00:02:56.760> because<00:02:57.060> we're<00:02:57.269> getting<00:02:57.480> ready<00:02:57.840> for

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
zone because we're getting ready for

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.780 
zone because we're getting ready for
mercury<00:02:58.439> to<00:02:58.620> go<00:02:58.769> retrograde<00:02:59.430> here<00:02:59.639> in<00:02:59.730> a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
mercury to go retrograde here in a

starting<00:04:14.009> to<00:04:14.069> make<00:04:14.189> that<00:04:14.400> squirt<00:04:14.669> of<00:04:14.699> Saturn

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
starting to make that squirt of Saturn

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.159 
starting to make that squirt of Saturn
we<00:04:15.120> talked<00:04:15.329> about<00:04:15.479> that<00:04:15.719> in<00:04:15.750> yesterday's

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
we talked about that in yesterday's

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.529 
we talked about that in yesterday's
horoscope<00:04:16.650> but<00:04:17.639> I<00:04:17.669> think<00:04:17.909> that's<00:04:18.090> making<00:04:18.419> us

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
horoscope but I think that's making us

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.500 
horoscope but I think that's making us
really<00:04:18.780> take<00:04:19.349> our<00:04:19.530> time<00:04:19.829> to<00:04:20.099> enjoy<00:04:20.280> things<00:04:20.609> to

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
really take our time to enjoy things to

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.709 
really take our time to enjoy things to
to<00:04:21.989> respect<00:04:22.680> things<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.789> really<00:04:24.000> start<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.479> see

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:24.719 
to respect things to really start to see

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:27.050 
to respect things to really start to see
that<00:04:25.050> in<00:04:25.320> order<00:04:25.590> for<00:04:25.740> us<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:26.039> really<00:04:26.400> go<00:04:26.699> on

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
that in order for us to really go on

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.830 
that in order for us to really go on
new<00:04:27.419> journey<00:04:28.050> we<00:04:28.860> got<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.220> take<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.490> in<00:04:29.820> we<00:04:30.630> got

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
new journey we got to take it in we got

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.970 
new journey we got to take it in we got
to<00:04:31.080> be<00:04:31.200> able<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.710> not<00:04:31.860> just<00:04:33.080> disconnect<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.380> I

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
to be able to not just disconnect and I

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.270 
to be able to not just disconnect and I
think<00:04:35.480> Aquarius<00:04:36.480> wants<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:36.930> disconnect<00:04:37.500> but<00:04:38.250> I

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
think Aquarius wants to disconnect but I

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.860 
think Aquarius wants to disconnect but I
think<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.790> we<00:04:38.940> also<00:04:39.150> have<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.570> look<00:04:39.660> at<00:04:39.750> the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
think that we also have to look at the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.570 
think that we also have to look at the
other<00:04:39.990> side<00:04:40.230> of<00:04:40.260> Aquarius<00:04:40.800> which<00:04:40.950> loves<00:04:41.280> to

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
other side of Aquarius which loves to

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.180 
other side of Aquarius which loves to
connect<00:04:42.000> it's<00:04:42.690> like<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.840> plug<00:04:43.260> plugging<00:04:43.919> in<00:04:44.040> and

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
connect it's like a plug plugging in and

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.950 
connect it's like a plug plugging in and
out<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.730> I<00:04:45.150> think<00:04:45.419> this<00:04:45.540> is<00:04:45.600> about<00:04:45.840> us

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
out and I think this is about us

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.129 
out and I think this is about us
plugging<00:04:46.800> in<00:04:46.980> now<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.310> new<00:04:47.760> energies<00:04:48.210> without

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
plugging in now to new energies without

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.120 
plugging in now to new energies without
that<00:04:49.470> fear<00:04:49.980> of<00:04:51.410> that<00:04:52.410> something's<00:04:52.950> going<00:04:53.010> to

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
that fear of that something's going to

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.100 
that fear of that something's going to
happen<00:04:53.840> or<00:04:54.840> bad<00:04:55.110> or<00:04:55.440> something's<00:04:56.040> not<00:04:56.220> right

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
happen or bad or something's not right

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.150 
happen or bad or something's not right
when<00:04:58.110> I<00:04:58.169> think<00:04:58.440> that<00:04:58.560> you'll<00:04:58.680> realize<00:04:58.980> today

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
when I think that you'll realize today

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.760 
when I think that you'll realize today
