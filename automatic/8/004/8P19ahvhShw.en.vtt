to me it sounds like there's more to
this<00:03:53.860> story<00:03:54.010> because<00:03:54.430> it's<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:54.970> irrational

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
this story because it's so irrational

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.930 
this story because it's so irrational
why<00:03:56.500> would<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.800> not<00:03:56.920> put<00:03:57.160> this<00:03:57.280> case<00:03:57.520> an<00:03:57.670> Amber

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
why would you not put this case an Amber

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.700 
why would you not put this case an Amber
Alert<00:03:58.210> and<00:03:58.240> the<00:03:58.480> only<00:03:58.750> thing<00:03:59.380> that<00:03:59.530> makes

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
Alert and the only thing that makes

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.500 
Alert and the only thing that makes
sense<00:03:59.920> to<00:04:00.100> me<00:04:00.130> is<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.580> cops<00:04:00.910> know<00:04:01.120> something

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
sense to me is that cops know something

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.480 
sense to me is that cops know something
they're<00:04:01.630> not<00:04:01.780> telling<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.160> may<00:04:03.280> not<00:04:03.310> be

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
they're not telling and that may not be

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.280 
they're not telling and that may not be
true<00:04:03.610> but<00:04:03.820> it's<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.210> only<00:04:04.360> explosion<00:04:05.110> why

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
true but it's the only explosion why

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.550 
true but it's the only explosion why
would<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.560> not<00:04:05.770> do<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.600> Georgia<00:04:11.020> Crime
