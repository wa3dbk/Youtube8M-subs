00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
can you for some of the other breeders

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.690 
can you for some of the other breeders
give<00:00:09.110> us<00:00:09.200> a<00:00:09.290> little<00:00:09.379> information<00:00:09.740> on<00:00:10.219> why<00:00:10.460> we

give us a little information on why we

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.000 
give us a little information on why we
should<00:00:10.730> be<00:00:11.150> using<00:00:12.080> these<00:00:12.200> scour<00:00:12.530> products

should be using these scour products
sure<00:00:13.370> management<00:00:14.360> for<00:00:14.630> scours<00:00:15.170> issue<00:00:15.410> can<00:00:15.679> be

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
sure management for scours issue can be

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.790 
sure management for scours issue can be
very<00:00:16.070> complex<00:00:16.790> and<00:00:17.210> a<00:00:17.509> very<00:00:17.689> complex<00:00:18.170> issue<00:00:18.500> to

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
manage from year to year scours can

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.670 
manage from year to year scours can
cause<00:00:21.710> a<00:00:21.740> lot<00:00:22.460> of<00:00:22.490> different<00:00:22.939> syndromes<00:00:23.680> of

cause a lot of different syndromes of
course<00:00:24.980> scours<00:00:25.460> can<00:00:25.699> cause<00:00:25.939> diarrhea<00:00:26.570> that

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
course scours can cause diarrhea that

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.250 
course scours can cause diarrhea that
diarrhea<00:00:27.769> can<00:00:28.340> lead<00:00:28.550> to<00:00:28.820> dehydration<00:00:29.140> it<00:00:30.140> can

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
diarrhea can lead to dehydration it can

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.549 
diarrhea can lead to dehydration it can
lead<00:00:30.680> to<00:00:30.890> a<00:00:31.180> hypoglycemia<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:32.599> it<00:00:33.260> all<00:00:33.410> can

lead to a hypoglycemia and it all can

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.439 
lead to a hypoglycemia and it all can
also<00:00:34.070> can<00:00:34.220> lead<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.580> death<00:00:34.790> so<00:00:35.000> there's<00:00:35.180> a<00:00:35.269> lot

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
also can lead to death so there's a lot

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:36.970 
also can lead to death so there's a lot
of<00:00:35.570> serious<00:00:35.930> issues<00:00:36.260> related<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:36.830> the

of serious issues related to the
management<00:00:37.190> of<00:00:37.549> scours<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:38.659> how<00:00:38.839> prevalent<00:00:39.140> is

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
management of scours so how prevalent is

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.759 
management of scours so how prevalent is
scours<00:00:40.549> in<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:40.909> industry<00:00:41.320> scours<00:00:42.320> can<00:00:42.559> be<00:00:42.739> a

scours in the industry scours can be a
very<00:00:43.309> significant<00:00:44.059> issue<00:00:44.180> when<00:00:44.600> it<00:00:44.629> comes<00:00:44.900> to

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
very significant issue when it comes to

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.619 
very significant issue when it comes to
col.caf<00:00:45.260> production<00:00:46.100> we<00:00:46.489> see<00:00:46.729> scours<00:00:47.330> as

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
col.caf production we see scours as

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.869 
col.caf production we see scours as
probably<00:00:48.199> one<00:00:48.290> of<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.769> the<00:00:49.339> leading<00:00:49.640> causes

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
probably one of the the leading causes

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.420 
probably one of the the leading causes
of<00:00:50.150> production<00:00:50.960> losses<00:00:51.440> both<00:00:52.010> from<00:00:52.309> the

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
of production losses both from the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.100 
of production losses both from the
production<00:00:52.670> standpoint<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.570> an<00:00:53.629> economic

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.189 
standpoint calves experience scours
early<00:00:57.530> in<00:00:57.650> life<00:00:57.680> can<00:00:58.369> can<00:00:59.239> reduce<00:00:59.659> their<00:00:59.930> gain

early in life can can reduce their gain

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.770 
early in life can can reduce their gain
and<00:01:00.470> weaning<00:01:01.129> weights<00:01:01.369> can<00:01:01.549> be<00:01:01.729> as<00:01:01.850> much<00:01:02.059> as<00:01:02.269> 35

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.880 
and weaning weights can be as much as 35
pounds<00:01:03.260> lighter

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
pounds lighter

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.070 
pounds lighter
due<00:01:04.549> to<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.850> scours<00:01:05.269> so<00:01:05.390> it<00:01:05.479> can<00:01:05.659> be<00:01:05.780> a<00:01:05.810> very

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
due to the scours so it can be a very

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.620 
due to the scours so it can be a very
significant<00:01:06.979> problem<00:01:07.670> when<00:01:08.180> it<00:01:08.270> comes<00:01:08.479> to

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
significant problem when it comes to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.140 
significant problem when it comes to
both<00:01:08.750> production<00:01:09.410> and<00:01:09.530> economics<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:10.880> in<00:01:11.000> your

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
both production and economics so in your

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.220 
both production and economics so in your
opinion

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
opinion

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.890 
opinion
we<00:01:12.740> as<00:01:12.920> cattleman<00:01:13.490> what<00:01:14.180> do<00:01:14.270> you<00:01:14.360> feel<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:14.600> we

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
we as cattleman what do you feel that we

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.160 
we as cattleman what do you feel that we
can<00:01:15.110> do<00:01:15.290> to<00:01:15.590> manage<00:01:16.040> this<00:01:16.220> problem<00:01:17.050> Stephen<00:01:18.050> we

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
can do to manage this problem Stephen we

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.680 
can do to manage this problem Stephen we
look<00:01:18.350> at<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.710> management<00:01:19.460> issues<00:01:20.180> related<00:01:20.660> to

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
look at the management issues related to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.930 
look at the management issues related to
calf<00:01:20.960> scours<00:01:21.290> we<00:01:21.620> can<00:01:21.770> kind<00:01:21.980> of<00:01:22.040> take<00:01:22.220> a<00:01:22.610> look

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
calf scours we can kind of take a look

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.230 
calf scours we can kind of take a look
at<00:01:23.150> two<00:01:23.360> approaches<00:01:24.020> one<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:25.460> organisms<00:01:26.090> that

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
at two approaches one the organisms that

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.810 
at two approaches one the organisms that
cause<00:01:26.540> calf<00:01:26.930> scours<00:01:27.230> we'd<00:01:27.680> like<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.220> not<00:01:28.790> have

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
cause calf scours we'd like to not have

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
cause calf scours we'd like to not have
them<00:01:29.360> cause<00:01:30.200> any<00:01:30.500> issues<00:01:30.980> as<00:01:31.190> far<00:01:31.220> as<00:01:31.840> exposure

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
them cause any issues as far as exposure

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.230 
them cause any issues as far as exposure
to<00:01:33.230> the<00:01:33.350> cap<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:33.800> we<00:01:33.920> can<00:01:34.100> look<00:01:34.280> at<00:01:34.430> issues

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
to the cap so we can look at issues

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.899 
to the cap so we can look at issues
related<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.810> keeping<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.980> calf<00:01:37.250> away<00:01:37.490> from

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
related to keeping the calf away from

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.700 
related to keeping the calf away from
those<00:01:38.060> organisms<00:01:38.480> that<00:01:38.750> cause<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.290> scours

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
those organisms that cause the scours

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.330 
those organisms that cause the scours
and<00:01:40.010> secondly<00:01:40.970> if<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:42.080> cap<00:01:42.350> is<00:01:42.590> exposed<00:01:43.070> to

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
and secondly if that cap is exposed to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.450 
and secondly if that cap is exposed to
those<00:01:43.460> organisms<00:01:44.030> we'd<00:01:44.750> like<00:01:44.900> to<00:01:45.050> have

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
those organisms we'd like to have

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.680 
those organisms we'd like to have
protection<00:01:46.460> in<00:01:46.640> that<00:01:46.670> calf<00:01:47.150> that<00:01:47.480> comes

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
protection in that calf that comes

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.660 
protection in that calf that comes
through<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.990> colostrum<00:01:48.440> of<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.740> cow<00:01:48.979> we'd

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
through the colostrum of the cow we'd

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.640 
through the colostrum of the cow we'd
have<00:01:49.850> to<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.479> have<00:01:50.510> that<00:01:50.810> calf<00:01:51.050> protected

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
have to like to have that calf protected

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.920 
have to like to have that calf protected
from<00:01:51.890> those<00:01:52.100> organisms<00:01:52.520> if<00:01:53.030> they<00:01:53.270> are<00:01:53.420> exposed

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
from those organisms if they are exposed

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.350 
from those organisms if they are exposed
to<00:01:54.140> those<00:01:54.260> organisms<00:01:55.060> John<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.270> our

at that calf being able to to fight off
scours<00:02:08.929> we<00:02:09.080> look<00:02:09.229> at<00:02:09.319> that<00:02:09.440> calf<00:02:09.709> receiving

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
scours we look at that calf receiving

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.520 
scours we look at that calf receiving
some<00:02:10.549> good<00:02:10.759> antibodies<00:02:11.450> against<00:02:12.019> those<00:02:12.170> scour

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530

the cost room from the cow so we need to

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.030 
the cost room from the cow so we need to

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
you take these calves in through the

you take these calves in through the

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
carcass quality and they don't have the

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.410

would have had if they had not had the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.240 
would have had if they had not had the
scours<00:03:18.390> early<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:18.900> life<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.440> think<00:03:19.620> some<00:03:20.130> of

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
scours early in life so I think some of

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.699 
scours early in life so I think some of
the<00:03:20.340> new<00:03:20.550> data<00:03:20.910> will<00:03:21.030> tell<00:03:21.360> us<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:22.530> will

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
the new data will tell us that it will

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.320 
the new data will tell us that it will
affect<00:03:23.040> them<00:03:23.280> throughout<00:03:23.550> their<00:03:23.760> entire<00:03:23.880> life

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
affect them throughout their entire life

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.370 
affect them throughout their entire life
so<00:03:25.140> John<00:03:25.519> if<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:27.030> had<00:03:27.269> some<00:03:27.510> cows<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.050> wasn't

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
so John if I had some cows that I wasn't

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.250 
so John if I had some cows that I wasn't
able<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.799> get<00:03:29.069> backs<00:03:29.340> Nady<00:03:30.019> vaccinated<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.200> I

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
able to get backs Nady vaccinated and I

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.809 
able to get backs Nady vaccinated and I
was<00:03:31.410> concerned<00:03:31.590> about<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.160> scours<00:03:32.549> what

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
was concerned about the scours what

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.460 
was concerned about the scours what
would<00:03:32.970> your<00:03:33.180> program<00:03:33.750> be<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:35.190> attack<00:03:35.880> that

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
would your program be to to attack that

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.710 
would your program be to to attack that
Steve<00:03:37.470> from<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.860> Cattlemen's<00:03:38.519> perspective<00:03:39.209> we

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
Steve from a Cattlemen's perspective we

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.990 
Steve from a Cattlemen's perspective we
need<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.049> look<00:03:40.230> at<00:03:40.470> ways<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:41.130> prevent<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.610> cat

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
need to look at ways to prevent that cat

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.150 
need to look at ways to prevent that cat
from<00:03:42.239> being<00:03:42.480> exposed<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:43.440> organisms<00:03:44.099> that

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
from being exposed to the organisms that

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.199 
from being exposed to the organisms that
coughs<00:03:44.700> calf's

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209

paws calf scours those management

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.880 
paws calf scours those management
techniques<00:03:49.049> would<00:03:49.260> be<00:03:49.410> things<00:03:49.769> like

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
techniques would be things like

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.460 
techniques would be things like
isolating<00:03:50.819> calves<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.330> do<00:03:51.450> get<00:03:51.630> scours<00:03:52.170> away

isolating calves that do get scours away

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.990 
isolating calves that do get scours away
from<00:03:52.680> calves<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.190> aren't<00:03:53.430> experienced<00:03:53.849> in

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
from calves that aren't experienced in

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000 
from calves that aren't experienced in
scours<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:54.569> we<00:03:54.660> don't<00:03:54.840> pass<00:03:55.110> it<00:03:55.319> from<00:03:55.470> from

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
scours so we don't pass it from from

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.559 
scours so we don't pass it from from
those<00:03:56.160> that<00:03:56.400> do<00:03:56.580> have<00:03:56.610> scours<00:03:57.150> under<00:03:57.450> those

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
calves that are healthy so we want to

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.880 
calves that are healthy so we want to
look<00:03:59.760> at<00:03:59.910> those<00:04:00.120> kind<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.570> situations<00:04:00.890> keeping

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
look at those kind of situations keeping

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.699

where where things are clean and dry so

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.400 
where where things are clean and dry so
those<00:04:21.180> are<00:04:21.329> some<00:04:21.510> of<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.720> things<00:04:22.109> we<00:04:22.229> could

we<00:04:56.590> look<00:04:56.770> at<00:04:56.919> the<00:04:57.039> cow's<00:04:57.249> ability<00:04:57.879> to

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
we look at the cow's ability to

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.420 
we look at the cow's ability to
concentrate<00:04:58.449> antibodies<00:04:59.289> in<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.830> colostrum

that<00:05:01.210> starts<00:05:01.779> about<00:05:01.900> 5<00:05:02.349> weeks<00:05:02.710> prior<00:05:03.009> to

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
that starts about 5 weeks prior to

calving and continues to about 2 weeks
prior<00:05:05.319> to<00:05:05.379> calving<00:05:05.979> so<00:05:06.639> it's<00:05:06.759> important<00:05:07.300> to

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
prior to calving so it's important to

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.510 
prior to calving so it's important to
follow<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:08.169> manufacturer's<00:05:08.979> label

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520
