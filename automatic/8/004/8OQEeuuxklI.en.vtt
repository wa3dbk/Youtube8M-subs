00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.470
 hi mock youtube xo me 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.210
 cream when we all remember about the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.160
 best shooting games in super 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.230
 nintendo automatically sprout the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.140
 memories of the contra 3 and sonseca riders 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.910
 two indisputable classics but in this 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.440
 nintendo platform there are more than not 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.780
 they were treated for the respect that they 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.640
 should they give either bad publicity or 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.559
 because they were launched in the final life 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.000
 of the platform but in this first 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.680
 episode of hidden gems of the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.449
 videogames I bring you a game that in 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.790
 my personal opinion surpasses both 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.500
 mentioned above I'm talking about wild 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.649
 camps this game developed by 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.390
 natsume and released in 1995 is perhaps the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.460
 game that maybe having launched it in 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.320
 full apogee of super nintendo and it's not 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.210
 his final stage would have been the king 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.220
 indisputable in the shooting genre 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.410
 that this platform despite being very 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.899
 short only with six levels and two phases 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.640
 of bonuses are full of pure adrenaline 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.800
 that will not let you drop the command until 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.140
 spend everything in the game we can 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.640
 select two clint and annie characters 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.950
 each one with his special charisma 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.530
 clearly they and how the game are 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.600
 Inspired by the old west as websites 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.369
 16 bit reuters we have to kill 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.980
 how much enemy we saw on the screen and 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.780
 in the end 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.240
 scene was not expected a final front 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.740
 which each and every one of them are 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.930
 very ingenious and with their own 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.910
 strategy to kill them in our 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.550
 arsenal we had guns 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.800
 submachine guns grenade launchers 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.600
 bombs and a devastating super 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.340
 machine gun which was activated when 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.380
 the special bar was filled when 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.660
 you manage to activate it you are completely 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.400
 immune and powerful is when the 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.010
 climax of this game then that 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.750
 experience is sensational too 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.150
 we have a melee attack 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.340
 to elevate nearby enemies already 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.350
 which the bullets and do not affect them the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.760
 double jump button is also very useful 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.890
 to dodge enemy attacks 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.350
 we also had a special tie 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.330
 which when released immobilizes 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.670
 the opponent is very useful for when 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.430
 played by two players graphically it was 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.440
 a whole revolution and it's even still very 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.390
 Nice to see with good effects and 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.830
 very good scenario designs every 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.860
 one is different from the previous 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.780
 the simply superb sound with some 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.520
 sublime effects like when we shot 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.310
 our weapons that send them and upload 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.990
 the volume is very scary the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.560
 melodies are also very good and 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.660
 as well 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.489
 inspired by the good as this could 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.470
 spend a lot of time talking about this 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.900
 hidden gem you're better than if you do not 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.489
 You know, you enjoy it for yourself. 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.920
 has fallen in love for original console story 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.300
 but this last alternative maybe you 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.580
 cost a lot because the game has 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.590
 become a cult classic so 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.140
 which find a cartridge at a low price 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.519
 It is a difficult task but there is 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.560
 emulation for those who can not 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.390
 afford the original game all a 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.430
 referent that was released at the time 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.160
 wrong one of the best jewelry 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.069
 hidden from the videogames granted him a 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.750
 rating of 9.5 then the only 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.030
 problem that the game has is that it is 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.209
 too short and it leaves you wanting 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.209
 plus
