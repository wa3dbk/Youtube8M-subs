versions<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:59.219> those<00:00:59.460> tubes<00:00:59.820> now<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> purpose

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
versions of those tubes now the purpose

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.979 
versions of those tubes now the purpose
of<00:01:01.410> having<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.770> second<00:01:02.190> tube<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.989> replaces

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
of having the second tube is it replaces

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.160 
of having the second tube is it replaces
the<00:01:04.379> output<00:01:04.920> transformer<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> gemini<00:01:06.869> is

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the output transformer so the gemini is

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.480 
the output transformer so the gemini is
a<00:01:07.880> transformer<00:01:08.880> --less<00:01:09.119> mic<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.950> instead<00:01:11.310> of

also<00:02:13.730> when<00:02:13.939> powering<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.540> Gemini<00:02:14.959> on<00:02:15.140> you'll

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
also when powering the Gemini on you'll

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.649 
also when powering the Gemini on you'll
notice<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.400> LED<00:02:16.579> light<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.299> front

of the power supply will blink this is

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.839 
of the power supply will blink this is
because<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.379> voltage<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.189> tube<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.610> being
