00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
second year I mean its halls first year

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.890 
second year I mean its halls first year
which<00:01:32.790> everyone's<00:01:33.210> been<00:01:33.390> saying<00:01:33.570> that's<00:01:33.810> like

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
which everyone's been saying that's like

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.410 
which everyone's been saying that's like
the<00:01:33.990> best<00:01:34.140> thing<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.409> do<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:36.150> should<00:01:36.390> be

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the best thing to do so that should be

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.749 
the best thing to do so that should be
good<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:36.900> if<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.590> get<00:01:37.710> house<00:01:37.950> together<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.549> mean

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
about how i got into cod I mean I got

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.010 
about how i got into cod I mean I got
into<00:01:48.630> cod<00:01:48.840> well<00:01:49.140> when<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.159> was<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:50.460> 13<00:01:51.030> when

other<00:02:15.530> FPS<00:02:15.950> games<00:02:16.400> like<00:02:16.580> Battlefield<00:02:17.090> halo<00:02:17.720> I

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
other FPS games like Battlefield halo I

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.780 
other FPS games like Battlefield halo I
just<00:02:18.709> haven't<00:02:18.950> really<00:02:19.099> found<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.340> interest<00:02:19.700> I

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
just haven't really found the interest I

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.000 
just haven't really found the interest I
mean<00:02:19.940> in<00:02:20.599> my<00:02:20.750> opinion<00:02:21.019> Cod's<00:02:21.379> the<00:02:21.560> best<00:02:21.739> game

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
mean in my opinion Cod's the best game

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.490 
mean in my opinion Cod's the best game
because<00:02:22.489> it's<00:02:23.180> got<00:02:23.330> such<00:02:23.569> like<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.840> fast-paced

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
because it's got such like a fast-paced

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.360 
because it's got such like a fast-paced
action<00:02:24.950> type<00:02:25.940> game<00:02:26.150> rather<00:02:26.390> than<00:02:27.010> like<00:02:28.010> just

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
action type game rather than like just

action type game rather than like just

in my opinion is the best out of the
series<00:03:11.629> just<00:03:11.870> because<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.859> amount<00:03:13.069> of

we'll<00:03:24.709> talk<00:03:24.889> about<00:03:24.980> next<00:03:25.099> and<00:03:25.609> one<00:03:26.569> of<00:03:26.599> those

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
we'll talk about next and one of those

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.500 
we'll talk about next and one of those
is<00:03:26.840> ghost<00:03:27.349> and<00:03:27.730> I'm<00:03:28.730> pretty<00:03:29.000> sure<00:03:29.120> ghost<00:03:29.359> is

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
is ghost and I'm pretty sure ghost is

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.789 
is ghost and I'm pretty sure ghost is
obviously<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:29.900> big<00:03:30.079> part<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.410> game<00:03:30.590> it's

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
obviously a big part of the game it's

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.190 
obviously a big part of the game it's
going<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.069> be<00:03:31.160> in<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.340> next<00:03:31.489> game<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.720> my<00:03:32.840> idea

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
going to be in the next game and my idea

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.220 
going to be in the next game and my idea
for<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.560> is<00:03:33.769> that<00:03:34.519> instead<00:03:35.000> of<00:03:35.150> ghost<00:03:35.989> just

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
for it is that instead of ghost just

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.229 
for it is that instead of ghost just
completely<00:03:36.620> neutralizes<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.519> from<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:37.760> radar

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
completely neutralizes you from a radar

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.930 
completely neutralizes you from a radar
it<00:03:38.900> neutralizes<00:03:39.500> like<00:03:39.739> every<00:03:40.040> other<00:03:40.129> pulse<00:03:40.459> so

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
it neutralizes like every other pulse so

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.330 
it neutralizes like every other pulse so
with<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.239> UAV<00:03:41.569> pot<00:03:42.139> light<00:03:42.319> pulses<00:03:42.799> constantly

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
with a UAV pot light pulses constantly

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.970 
with a UAV pot light pulses constantly
but<00:03:44.209> it's<00:03:44.389> like<00:03:44.540> 11<00:03:45.049> policy<00:03:45.440> it'll<00:03:45.590> show<00:03:45.739> goes

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
but it's like 11 policy it'll show goes

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.759 
but it's like 11 policy it'll show goes
person<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.639> the<00:03:46.730> next<00:03:46.940> it<00:03:47.120> won't<00:03:47.299> so<00:03:48.049> but<00:03:48.560> they

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
person and the next it won't so but they

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.159 
person and the next it won't so but they
ghost<00:03:49.220> has<00:03:49.459> some<00:03:49.669> advantage<00:03:50.120> over<00:03:50.299> a<00:03:50.449> radar

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
ghost has some advantage over a radar

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.589 
ghost has some advantage over a radar
but<00:03:51.829> they<00:03:51.949> don't<00:03:52.129> have<00:03:52.310> full<00:03:52.519> advantage<00:03:52.669> so

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
but they don't have full advantage so

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.449 
but they don't have full advantage so
you'd<00:03:54.169> like<00:03:54.379> after<00:03:54.799> you've<00:03:54.919> worked<00:03:55.099> hard<00:03:55.310> for

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
you'd like after you've worked hard for

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.039 
you'd like after you've worked hard for
your<00:03:55.519> kill<00:03:55.730> street<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.329> can<00:03:56.449> actually<00:03:56.810> still

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
your kill street you can actually still

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.500 
your kill street you can actually still
find<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.410> person<00:03:57.699> which<00:03:58.699> I<00:03:58.819> think<00:03:59.180> would<00:03:59.329> be

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
find a person which I think would be

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.180 
find a person which I think would be
like<00:04:00.199> I<00:04:00.349> think<00:04:00.590> that's<00:04:00.709> a<00:04:00.769> really<00:04:00.799> good<00:04:01.129> idea

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
like I think that's a really good idea

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.150 
like I think that's a really good idea
in<00:04:01.669> my<00:04:01.790> opinion<00:04:01.819> but<00:04:02.239> that's<00:04:02.660> just<00:04:02.750> me<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.169> how

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
in my opinion but that's just me and how

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.979 
in my opinion but that's just me and how
it<00:04:04.220> work<00:04:04.519> for<00:04:04.669> like<00:04:04.760> kill<00:04:05.239> streaks<00:04:05.569> will<00:04:05.810> be

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
it work for like kill streaks will be

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.400 
it work for like kill streaks will be
say<00:04:06.949> every<00:04:07.400> other<00:04:07.519> deaf<00:04:07.849> so<00:04:08.299> like<00:04:08.540> on<00:04:08.720> one<00:04:09.199> life

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
say every other deaf so like on one life

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.259 
say every other deaf so like on one life
a<00:04:09.859> helicopter<00:04:10.609> wouldn't<00:04:10.819> be<00:04:10.879> able<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:11.120> see<00:04:11.239> you

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
a helicopter wouldn't be able to see you

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.170 
a helicopter wouldn't be able to see you
and<00:04:11.810> on<00:04:12.049> the<00:04:12.139> next<00:04:12.319> it<00:04:12.500> would<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.970> then<00:04:13.970> for

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
and on the next it would and then for

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.819 
and on the next it would and then for
player<00:04:14.359> control<00:04:14.810> killstreaks<00:04:15.290> it'll<00:04:15.590> be<00:04:15.680> like

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
player control killstreaks it'll be like

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.039 
player control killstreaks it'll be like
you<00:04:16.370> have<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.519> red<00:04:16.789> box<00:04:17.030> around<00:04:17.180> you<00:04:17.599> for<00:04:17.900> one

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
you have a red box around you for one

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.500 
you have a red box around you for one
life<00:04:18.289> and<00:04:18.530> then<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.709> next<00:04:18.829> life<00:04:19.070> you<00:04:19.099> wouldn't

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
life and then the next life you wouldn't

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.450 
life and then the next life you wouldn't
but<00:04:20.510> also<00:04:20.690> as<00:04:21.140> soon<00:04:21.349> as<00:04:21.500> you<00:04:21.620> try<00:04:21.769> and<00:04:21.859> take<00:04:22.280> out

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
but also as soon as you try and take out

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.320 
but also as soon as you try and take out
someone

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
someone

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.379 
someone
of<00:04:23.389> a<00:04:23.569> helicopter<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:25.550> appear<00:04:26.060> on<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.240> radar

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
of a helicopter you appear on the radar

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.089 
of a helicopter you appear on the radar
so<00:04:26.599> if<00:04:26.689> you<00:04:26.810> fire<00:04:26.990> rocket<00:04:27.349> a<00:04:27.379> helicopter<00:04:27.949> you

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
so if you fire rocket a helicopter you

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.129 
so if you fire rocket a helicopter you
immediately<00:04:28.490> appear<00:04:28.849> as<00:04:28.939> a<00:04:29.000> redbox<00:04:29.419> because

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
immediately appear as a redbox because

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.059 
immediately appear as a redbox because
then<00:04:30.229> they<00:04:30.349> get<00:04:30.439> a<00:04:30.500> chance<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.919> actually

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
then they get a chance to actually

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.830 
then they get a chance to actually
prevent<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:31.699> killing<00:04:32.060> them<00:04:32.210> because<00:04:32.509> I<00:04:32.599> think

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
prevent you killing them because I think

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.559 
prevent you killing them because I think
it's<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:33.020> bit<00:04:33.169> unfair<00:04:33.530> if<00:04:34.280> they<00:04:34.580> just<00:04:34.759> like<00:04:35.270> if

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.569 
it's a bit unfair if they just like if

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.510 
it's a bit unfair if they just like if
you<00:04:35.780> had<00:04:35.990> no<00:04:36.229> chance<00:04:36.500> of<00:04:36.710> defending<00:04:36.979> yourself

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
you had no chance of defending yourself

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.580 
you had no chance of defending yourself
against<00:04:37.789> rockets<00:04:38.000> which<00:04:38.419> is<00:04:38.689> how<00:04:39.289> the<00:04:39.349> game

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
against rockets which is how the game

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.779 
against rockets which is how the game
works<00:04:39.770> at<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.039> moment<00:04:40.340> really<00:04:40.460> if<00:04:40.669> they've

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
works at the moment really if they've

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.029 
works at the moment really if they've
got<00:04:40.909> ghost<00:04:41.180> pro<00:04:41.449> and<00:04:41.659> are<00:04:42.349> using<00:04:42.560> like<00:04:42.830> a

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
got ghost pro and are using like a

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.950 
got ghost pro and are using like a
speller<00:04:43.490> then<00:04:43.909> you<00:04:44.030> really<00:04:44.240> have<00:04:44.360> no<00:04:44.659> chance

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
speller then you really have no chance

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.619 
speller then you really have no chance
on<00:04:45.199> this<00:04:45.319> and<00:04:45.650> get<00:04:45.800> lucky<00:04:46.009> on<00:04:46.099> like<00:04:46.939> play<00:04:47.210> earth
