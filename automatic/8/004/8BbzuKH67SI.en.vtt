how<00:01:40.979> much<00:01:41.220> planning<00:01:41.790> goes<00:01:42.030> into<00:01:42.210> something

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
how much planning goes into something

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.120 
how much planning goes into something

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
like this so you sort of winging it as

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.230 
like this so you sort of winging it as
you<00:01:44.220> go<00:01:44.369> or<00:01:44.549> did<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.729> plan<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.030> whole<00:01:45.180> thing

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
from start to finish and then you just

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.230 
from start to finish and then you just
sort<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.009> navigated<00:01:47.610> around<00:01:47.850> some<00:01:48.000> issues

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240

that<00:01:48.270> popped<00:01:48.540> up

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
that popped up

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.480
