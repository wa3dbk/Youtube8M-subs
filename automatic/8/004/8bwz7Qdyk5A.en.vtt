the<00:00:13.679> Wildcat<00:00:14.160> offense<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:15.030> could<00:00:15.599> see<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> lot<00:00:15.929> of

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
the Wildcat offense I could see a lot of

mad<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.260> think<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.650> going<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> be<00:00:19.920> really

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
mad and I think is going to be really

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
it's simple fact that EA finally did

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.660 
it's simple fact that EA finally did
their<00:00:25.230> homework<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.960> actually<00:00:27.960> fixed<00:00:28.670> Madden
