 all those exposed from the universe of 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.820
 legendary 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.440
 when I started the series I 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.390
 did not even expect to do a second 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.060
 so much at first I did not believe 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.320
 myself not in my own series here is the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.550
 youth format it was because I 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.690
 am very strong at the start and it's true 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.980
 that when I started doing some 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.080
 legendary I did not know if I was going 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.730
 to be able to make good comic 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.440
 youth with the right ingredients 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.080
 the right mix of action humor 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.270
 of adventurous passers found that yes 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.300
 and I'm happy but imagine 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.310
 that one day this series becomes the 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.680
 bestsellers one of the youth bd the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.790
 most read in the last ten years 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.790
 who could have imagined such a thing 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.950
 unknown aspects of the festival of spaces 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.570
 reserved for professionals like the 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.990
 rights market a subject of Sebastian 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.990
 tidy 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.560
 I came mainly to sell 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.379
 the comics of my French and French customers 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.120
 germany north america and uk i 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.950
 come every year angoulême since 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.260
 is a comics editor 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.150
 English language so we buy them 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.489
 Belgian franco rights is well here 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.680
 what surprises them is the variety is 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.659
 that these two small is big it is 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.209
 ya it's hard to say what is a 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.769
 bd you know when you say what is a 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.170
 comics that's pretty much what it is 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.750
 so there is but what is a comic and so 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.260
 he feels he comes here he loves the concept 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:09.299
 that it's really a huge variety of 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:12.130
 products to make listen to it works 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.020
 pretty well right now so 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.150
 so it's okay we have a market that 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.310
 develops very well that it starts 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.140
 really to get a foothold but it's not the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.540
 great sales ssrs air ski attractive 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.460
 for Americans and especially Anglo 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.250
 saxons is that for a nap 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.620
 you can buy the right to a series 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.490
 for example complete of twelve volumes 6 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.980
 Perhaps we had to review the 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.180
 concept of the bd ago can adjust 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.040
 some things 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.319
 that's what we did and so we did not 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.269
 really hard to do 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.500
 know and to allow the 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.989
 development of the comic abroad 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.120
 is a publisher for example with whom I have 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.859
 tried to convince to buy the comics 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.220
 Franco-Belgian they never buy anything 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.260
 g 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.780
 I had them come here and the year 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.890
 last they bought 68 type they are 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.890

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.210
