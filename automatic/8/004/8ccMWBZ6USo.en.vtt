00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
comfortable and instead of like because

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.940 
comfortable and instead of like because
we<00:01:44.030> don't<00:01:44.210> have<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.600> boots<00:01:44.870> exactly<00:01:45.740> boots

it's the leg warmer design on boots and

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.120 
it's the leg warmer design on boots and
then<00:01:49.310> what<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:49.910> did<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.690> I<00:01:51.050> just<00:01:51.260> got<00:01:51.470> some<00:01:51.860> black

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
then what I did is I just got some black

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.310 
then what I did is I just got some black
regular<00:01:52.880> flat<00:01:53.150> shoes<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.810> just<00:01:53.870> put<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:54.200> on

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
regular flat shoes and just put it on

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.310 
regular flat shoes and just put it on
with<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:54.710> it's<00:01:55.460> really<00:01:55.670> great<00:01:55.940> this<00:01:56.480> is<00:01:56.870> the

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
with it it's really great this is the

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.420 
with it it's really great this is the
second<00:01:57.890> choice<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.330> shoes<00:02:00.370> black<00:02:01.370> boots<00:02:02.060> I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
second choice of the shoes black boots I

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.880 
second choice of the shoes black boots I
chose<00:02:04.430> black<00:02:04.880> boots<00:02:05.210> because<00:02:05.480> I<00:02:05.990> thought<00:02:06.650> they

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
chose black boots because I thought they

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.650 
chose black boots because I thought they
would<00:02:06.980> probably<00:02:07.190> stand<00:02:07.670> out<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.450> whole

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
would probably stand out the whole

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.040 
would probably stand out the whole
outfit<00:02:09.140> class<00:02:09.410> tricky<00:02:10.280> Laura's<00:02:11.050> favorite

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
outfit class tricky Laura's favorite

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.550 
outfit class tricky Laura's favorite
colors<00:02:12.350> are<00:02:12.590> black<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.210> pink<00:02:14.210> and<00:02:14.420> white<00:02:14.600> so<00:02:15.530> I

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
colors are black and pink and white so I

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.310 
colors are black and pink and white so I
thought<00:02:16.040> maybe<00:02:16.190> black<00:02:16.790> would<00:02:17.180> go<00:02:17.390> kids<00:02:17.870> people

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
thought maybe black would go kids people

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.350 
thought maybe black would go kids people
say<00:02:18.500> black<00:02:18.770> goes<00:02:19.010> with<00:02:19.040> everything<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:20.210> black

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
say black goes with everything so black

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.710 
say black goes with everything so black
probably<00:02:20.960> would<00:02:21.140> go<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.590> something

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
probably would go to something

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.560 
probably would go to something
