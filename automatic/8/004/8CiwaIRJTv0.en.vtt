whether it was the Joker or Lex Luthor
I'm<00:05:01.870> leaning<00:05:02.110> towards<00:05:02.410> more<00:05:02.470> Lex<00:05:02.830> Luthor<00:05:03.250> just

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
I'm leaning towards more Lex Luthor just

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.910 
I'm leaning towards more Lex Luthor just
because<00:05:04.090> um<00:05:04.420> I<00:05:04.690> feel<00:05:05.080> like<00:05:05.230> Lex<00:05:05.530> is<00:05:05.680> going<00:05:05.860> to

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
because um I feel like Lex is going to

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.680 
because um I feel like Lex is going to
be<00:05:05.980> the<00:05:06.100> puppet<00:05:06.430> master<00:05:06.790> in<00:05:07.030> this<00:05:07.150> movie<00:05:07.510> or

be the puppet master in this movie or

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.820 
be the puppet master in this movie or
he's<00:05:07.900> going<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:08.080> try<00:05:08.290> to<00:05:08.350> be<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.590> puppet

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
he's going to try to be the puppet

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.080 
he's going to try to be the puppet
master<00:05:09.160> where<00:05:09.310> he's<00:05:09.430> pulling<00:05:09.820> all<00:05:09.940> these

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
master where he's pulling all these

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.330 
master where he's pulling all these
strings<00:05:10.450> he's<00:05:11.140> pitting<00:05:11.560> Batman<00:05:12.040> against

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
strings he's pitting Batman against

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.950 
strings he's pitting Batman against
Superman<00:05:12.670> he's<00:05:13.030> the<00:05:13.150> one<00:05:13.300> that<00:05:13.420> creates<00:05:13.780> all

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
Superman he's the one that creates all

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.810 
Superman he's the one that creates all
this<00:05:14.110> conflict<00:05:14.470> that<00:05:14.770> makes<00:05:14.980> him<00:05:15.190> go<00:05:15.640> at<00:05:15.790> each

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
this conflict that makes him go at each

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.270 
this conflict that makes him go at each
other<00:05:16.090> at<00:05:16.390> first<00:05:16.690> I<00:05:17.020> think<00:05:17.500> it's<00:05:17.800> a<00:05:17.860> little<00:05:17.950> I

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
other at first I think it's a little I

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.400 
other at first I think it's a little I
don't<00:05:18.730> think<00:05:18.790> the<00:05:18.970> Joker<00:05:19.210> would<00:05:20.140> write<00:05:20.380> that

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
don't think the Joker would write that

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.930 
don't think the Joker would write that
just<00:05:20.860> because<00:05:21.010> first<00:05:21.250> of<00:05:21.310> all<00:05:21.430> the

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
just because first of all the

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.320 
just because first of all the
handwriting<00:05:22.360> was<00:05:22.390> too<00:05:22.630> neat<00:05:22.840> yeah<00:05:23.290> and<00:05:24.330> him

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
handwriting was too neat yeah and him

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.120 
handwriting was too neat yeah and him
like<00:05:25.720> putting<00:05:25.990> a<00:05:26.050> guilt<00:05:26.260> trip<00:05:26.380> on<00:05:26.590> Batman<00:05:26.980> is

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
like putting a guilt trip on Batman is

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.460 
like putting a guilt trip on Batman is
not<00:05:27.280> really<00:05:27.520> i<00:05:27.850> don't<00:05:28.390> see<00:05:28.600> Joker<00:05:28.990> doing<00:05:29.290> that

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
not really i don't see Joker doing that

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.900 
not really i don't see Joker doing that
and<00:05:29.680> plus<00:05:29.770> he<00:05:29.950> already<00:05:30.130> had<00:05:30.430> one<00:05:30.730> of<00:05:30.820> those

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
and plus he already had one of those

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.840 
and plus he already had one of those
little<00:05:31.060> like<00:05:31.300> notes<00:05:32.200> from<00:05:32.410> Joker<00:05:32.800> on<00:05:32.980> Robins

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
which will get to ya so I don't think he

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.130 
which will get to ya so I don't think he

would I think it was Lex messing with
Batman<00:05:38.710> Bruce<00:05:39.160> Wayne
