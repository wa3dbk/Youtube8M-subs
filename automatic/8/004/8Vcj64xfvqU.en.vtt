00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.710
 hello to everyone today for ours 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.829
 try we want to focus on a car 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.090
 with boxer engine two dry seats e 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.940
 sporting guess what it is 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.940
 just to her porsche boxster gts 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.490
 the box and its is 4 meters long and 40 meters long 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.229
 in short, so to speak about 10 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.450
 centimeters more than normal and there 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.570
 put in segment c is one meter wide and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.580
 eighty and is only one meter high and 27 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.649
 given this that allowed together with the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.170
 aerodynamic work a coefficient of 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.080
 penetration of the front of only 0 32 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.880
 when a car with a central engine is 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.490
 at the front than at the rear at two 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.850
 luggage compartments at the front the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.679
 stick and deep and from 150 liters then 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.479
 you can definitely put a 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.950
 pair of bags in other friends more 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.920
 small and at the rear 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.960
 only in quotes of 130 liters though 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.960
 helps with a third trolley 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.459
 at the center of the dashboard we find the PCs e 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.920
 porsche communication management and the 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.019
 porsche multimedia system managed 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.410
 from a touchscreen display with diagonal 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.940
 from 7 inches basically to all 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.220
 functions that are required of a 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.209
 system of this caliber even it 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.220
 slot for the sim 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.890
 if you do not want to connect the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.110
 phone via bluetooth 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.280
 then we have the physical keys to manage 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.720
 the air conditioner 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.230
 I'm actually not in a position 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.230
 very convenient especially when driving 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.269
 because the gear selector disturbs 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.190
 a little at the center of the tunnel 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.980
 then we have the key to lift or 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.470
 lower the rear spoiler to open or 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.629
 less to the exhaust valve insert 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.730
 or deactivate the start stop and then 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.160
 select sport and sport modes 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.410
 plus the deactivation of the controls 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.220
 electronic the two taxis to open e 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.220
 close the hood 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.459
 two dry places you can't escape from here 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.989
 they were as much as the miracle succeeds 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.180
 do not oppress the occupants 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.459
 indeed it is possible to have a wide range 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.670
 thanks to a low seat as well 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.590
 also the line of the windows seated at 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.140
 side visibility driving cost 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.030
 discreet while at the front yes 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.010
 they can perceive almost well 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.480
 exclusively the humps to do therefore 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.950
 you have to do a little eye to the 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.950
 advice instead visibility is 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.680
 limited by the small from the small rear window 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.780
 in glass you should in theory walk 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.260
 always worth lowered ratio anyway 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.260
 nothing transcendental 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.980
 OK perfect 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.050
 now we ask for the hood that is more or 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.760
 it takes less than 10 seconds 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:32.060
 unless we go to consider the 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.060
 window movement and off we go 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.350
 we finally arrived at the test on 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.280
 road and we are driven by a boxer engine 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.280
 6 cylinders of 3.4 liters has a power 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.000
 up to 330 horses to be exact 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.860
 on 18 15 more than the s 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.980
 while instead the newtonmetri of couple 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:02.870
 they are 370 and are available at 5,800 rpm 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.320
 this engine drives well that it is 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.260
 strong so much that it does not seem to have between 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.270
 only 330 horses in quotes 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.800
 merit also among other things of a weight a 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.960
 empty reading of 1,375 kg and a 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.980
 pdk change we have supplied 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:25.190
 but it is a forge given around 3,500 euros 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:29.030
 which allows you to never catch invaded 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.640
 both maintaining the mode of then 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.830
 fully automatic either by shifting 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.560
 the selector in md using the fact 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.790
 from the steering wheel the operating logic e 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.070
 great we liked it so much 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.350
 and then we want to talk about the 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.700
 sound of this engine over 4,000 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.700
 laps becomes este 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.290
 with the central engine among other things to the 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.860
 which is accessed only by lifting the car 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.790
 on the bridge 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:23.300
 the boxster gts in our opinion has one 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.680
 very effective weight distribution 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.770
 we have the workhorse though 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:31.550
 found in the steering very responsive e 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:35.210
 precise where you think the car should 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.520
 go to the vat obey and without problems 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.710
 in a sudden way 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.050
 merit also among other things of a structure 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:47.330
 lowered than the normal version 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:50.090
 and with the standard puzzle system the 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.640
 suspension and shock absorber system 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.710
 that adjusts automatically based 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.560
 to driving style and conditions 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.290
 of the road surface 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.800
 in this regard he marveled 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:04.510
 the most comfortable absorption of roughness 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.260
 than we clearly expected 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.260
 as far as possible 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.919
 and not even today we arrived at 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.380
 end of our appointment 

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:49.840
 I want to send our price right 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:53.470
 the porsche boxster gts starts from a base 

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:55.270
 almost 73 thousand euros and clearly those 

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.500
 all the optional extras must be added 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.720
 like 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.000
 the price has ballooned so easily 

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:05.280
 true that the model we had in 

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.280
 trial costs just over 90 thousand euros
