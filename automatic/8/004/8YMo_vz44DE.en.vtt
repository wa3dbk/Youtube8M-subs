00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello and welcome to Zermatt 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.509
 again from me i am a star and 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.730
 today the video for the lÃ¼bzer 2h 5 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.460
 premium over hans now by one 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.080
 universal car smartphone holder and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.020
 the whole thing works with mobile 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.480
 devices have a display size of 32 to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.810
 4.8 inches and I would do that 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.859
 simply anna the iphone 5 today 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.560
 demonstrate how the whole thing in the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.080
 practice looks otherwise is now the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.359
 h5 mainly made of high quality 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.460
 aluminum and is also very high quality 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.590
 processed when I'm poor in ten 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.390
 now aluminum and the handles where 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.280
 holding the smartphone are now with 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.140
 a gummed so that there 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.860
 nothing really scratched afterwards either 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.840
 can be 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.940
 we can do it all on your own 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.120
 Fasten by her simply the button 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.640
 press on the disc and then the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.340
 lever operates so that a negative pressure 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.660
 is generated and then it raises as well 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.500
 really tight and there's nothing left 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.420
 fly down 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.190
 and if you want to solve it all there 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.500
 you just have to turn the switch again 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.420
 Press and release the vacuum again 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.589
 remove it and then you can do it the same 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.390
 pull off again 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.520
 otherwise the bracket is now 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.439
 of course firmly attached and you can 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.409
 then also place your smartphone 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.030
 see jokes in the video and the whole 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.070
 then just by these terms here 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.799
 Held and as I said the handles 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.380
 are made of plastic, respectively 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.750
 bordered with plastic and therefore needs 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.270
 yes, then really no fear is there 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.799
 something could be scratched and 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.509
 the advantage of the whole is simple 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.640
 that if you can be smartphone here 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.229
 attached has still continued to 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.670
 perspective of the whole itself 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.619
 can determine as you can 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.270
 bracket will move pretty well like her 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.250
 in the video you can see as you can 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.229
 turn it all over and you can do that 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.700
 View from the direction of the passenger seat 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.750
 to overturn or just to you 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.490
 to overturn even 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.770
 depending on what it is currently using 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.630
 if, for example, the passenger now 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.579
 could want to watch a movie 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.200
 Whole to which turn itself - completely 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.299
 then it could be used as a navi 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.579
 turn and then always just one 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.350
 overview of the na'vi have in the 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.780
 test phase I could now no defects 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.869
 so find the only point of me 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.369
 disturbed is the iphone 5 now 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.259
 unfortunately the volume regulator and the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.510
 newsweek will be covered as me 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.459
 Pension again a picture 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.290
 one has to see the whole can as 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.670
 looks at other smartphones 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.079
 Unfortunately, I do not say it now 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.180
 Of course that always depends on where 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.739
 But the battles on smartphones are 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.019
 Of course you still come 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.909
 to all the other controls 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.980
 ran normally so I could now 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.319
 here for example my iphone 5 as navi 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.989
 use and at the same time load that 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.329
 lux 2 h 5 is also available in 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.620
 red and silver and if you are interested 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.480
 got on this bracket 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.930
 should you find links to the individual 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.579
 colors on amazon also down in 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.750
 the video description there you will find 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.569
 of course, then the prices 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.670
 However, it must also say that of 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.989
 color to color the prices vary 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.879
 That's why I can not do any here now 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.500
 Call fixed price because it really 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.760
 should have interest looks easy 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.379
 and in the video describes 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.480
 there you will find the price and so on 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.920
 otherwise I would say if 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.209
 I would like the video 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.959
 me a thumbs up 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.909
 looking forward 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.319
 if not far and videos of miss 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.450
 tab does not want this in any case 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.280
 Channel the links to twitter and facebook 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.019
 are all in the video below 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.849
 description otherwise I would say 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.560
 Thanks for watching until the 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.919
 next time because I'm pulling mine 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.919
