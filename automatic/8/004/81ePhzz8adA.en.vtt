definitely back on I'd say J don't looks

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.480 
definitely back on I'd say J don't looks
like<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> zombie<00:01:15.720> right<00:01:16.320> now<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:17.009> I'm<00:01:17.189> getting<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
like a zombie right now as I'm getting a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.859 
like a zombie right now as I'm getting a
lot<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.640> sleep<00:01:17.939> lately<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.659> see<00:01:18.810> what

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
lot of sleep lately and you can see what

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.149 
lot of sleep lately and you can see what
the<00:01:18.990> eye<00:01:19.020> twitching<00:01:19.470> their<00:01:19.560> flash<00:01:19.799> probably

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the eye twitching their flash probably

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.149 
the eye twitching their flash probably
hasn't<00:01:20.310> either<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> chances<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.650> both<00:01:22.860> player

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
hasn't either so chances are both player

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.800 
hasn't either so chances are both player
has<00:01:23.280> definitely<00:01:23.640> prepared<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.150> lot<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.720> this

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
has definitely prepared a lot for this

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.230 
has definitely prepared a lot for this
match<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.950> think<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.549> definitely<00:01:26.729> needed

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
match and I think it's definitely needed

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.450 
match and I think it's definitely needed
it's<00:01:27.990> hard<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.320> say<00:01:28.500> who's<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> favorite<00:01:29.189> coming

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
it's hard to say who's a favorite coming

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.980 
it's hard to say who's a favorite coming

fighting spirit yes let me go ahead and
bring<00:01:48.869> up<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> map<00:01:49.290> here<00:01:49.560> real<00:01:49.740> quick<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.100> we

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
bring up the map here real quick so we

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.940 
bring up the map here real quick so we
have<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.759> do<00:01:51.329> feel<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:52.110> I've<00:01:52.229> said<00:01:52.409> every

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
have it on I do feel as I've said every

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.460 
have it on I do feel as I've said every
time<00:01:53.130> we've<00:01:53.790> talked<00:01:54.030> about<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.840> Terran

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
time we've talked about this that Terran

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.899 
time we've talked about this that Terran
has<00:01:55.619> an<00:01:55.740> advantage<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.340> map<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.729> from

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
has an advantage on this map just from

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.459 
has an advantage on this map just from
the<00:01:57.000> ability<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.450> take<00:01:57.600> three<00:01:57.840> bases<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the ability to take three bases and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.709 
the ability to take three bases and
defend<00:01:58.799> them<00:01:58.950> fairly<00:01:59.399> easily<00:01:59.759> at<00:02:00.540> least

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
defend them fairly easily at least

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.899 
defend them fairly easily at least
before<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.229> Zerg<00:02:01.439> gets<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.860> late-game<00:02:02.460> tech

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
before the Zerg gets the late-game tech

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.170 
before the Zerg gets the late-game tech
up<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.360> filers<00:02:04.130> but<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> mean<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:06.060> an

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
up with the filers but I mean it's an

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.119 
up with the filers but I mean it's an
easy<00:02:06.450> map<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.930> push<00:02:07.110> out<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:07.680> an<00:02:07.770> easy<00:02:07.920> map

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
easy map to push out on it's an easy map

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.070 
easy map to push out on it's an easy map
to<00:02:08.280> defend<00:02:08.550> your<00:02:08.640> secondary<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.020> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
to defend your secondary on and so I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.510 
to defend your secondary on and so I
just<00:02:10.289> feel<00:02:10.410> because<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:11.069> any<00:02:11.280> sort<00:02:11.459> of

just feel because of that any sort of

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.040 
just feel because of that any sort of

map stats right currently they're
actually<00:02:19.440> pretty<00:02:19.620> even<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.490> might<00:02:20.670> prove

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
actually pretty even so it might prove

percent advantage over zerg which

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.000 
percent advantage over zerg which
doesn't<00:02:25.170> really<00:02:25.260> mean<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> whole<00:02:25.680> lot<00:02:25.710> so

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
doesn't really mean a whole lot so

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.230 
doesn't really mean a whole lot so
there's<00:02:26.070> not<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.310> lot<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.520> games<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.030> have

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
there's not a lot of games that have

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.510 
there's not a lot of games that have
been<00:02:27.330> played<00:02:27.600> here<00:02:28.160> but<00:02:29.160> it's<00:02:29.280> it's

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.330 
been played here but it's it's
interesting<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.120> mean<00:02:30.150> jaedong<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.990> is<00:02:31.350> not

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
interesting I mean jaedong is is not

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.990 
interesting I mean jaedong is is not
quite<00:02:32.790> as<00:02:33.030> good<00:02:33.240> overall<00:02:33.630> vs<00:02:34.230> terran<00:02:34.490> as<00:02:35.490> as

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
quite as good overall vs terran as as

quite as good overall vs terran as as
flashes<00:02:36.450> versus<00:02:36.810> ered<00:02:36.990> but<00:02:37.590> Jaden<00:02:38.010> has<00:02:38.190> one

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
flashes versus ered but Jaden has one

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.210 
flashes versus ered but Jaden has one
what<00:02:38.850> about<00:02:39.030> three<00:02:39.450> more<00:02:39.630> games<00:02:39.840> there<00:02:40.290> like

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
what about three more games there like

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.100 
what about three more games there like
12<00:02:41.460> and<00:02:41.640> 9<00:02:41.760> yeah<00:02:41.970> between<00:02:42.120> jaedong<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.810> flash

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
12 and 9 yeah between jaedong and flash

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.040 
12 and 9 yeah between jaedong and flash
jaedong<00:02:44.040> has<00:02:44.160> won<00:02:44.400> 12<00:02:44.760> games<00:02:44.970> with<00:02:45.210> flashes<00:02:45.660> 19

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
jaedong has won 12 games with flashes 19

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.380 
jaedong has won 12 games with flashes 19
of<00:02:46.170> those<00:02:46.260> games<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.920> generally<00:02:47.700> has<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.820> three

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
of those games so generally has a three

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.990 
of those games so generally has a three
game<00:02:48.570> advantage<00:02:48.900> but<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.650> mean<00:02:50.070> that's<00:02:50.250> not<00:02:50.550> too

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
game advantage but I mean that's not too

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.670 
game advantage but I mean that's not too
huge<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.570> difference<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.290> do<00:02:52.440> want<00:02:52.650> to

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
huge of a difference I do want to

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.870 
huge of a difference I do want to
mention<00:02:52.830> about<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.220> Matt<00:02:53.430> one<00:02:53.610> thing<00:02:53.790> I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
mention about this Matt one thing I

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.940 
mention about this Matt one thing I
noticed<00:02:54.180> earlier<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:55.650> i<00:02:55.680> said<00:02:55.890> i

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
noticed earlier is that like i said i

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.650 
noticed earlier is that like i said i
think<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.460> map<00:02:56.730> seems<00:02:57.210> like<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.540> would<00:02:57.600> be

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
think this map seems like it would be

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.280 
think this map seems like it would be
Tara<00:02:57.960> because<00:02:58.650> there's<00:02:58.980> these<00:02:59.250> big<00:02:59.310> cracks

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
Tara because there's these big cracks

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.110 
Tara because there's these big cracks
basically<00:03:01.290> where<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.400> base<00:03:02.640> areas<00:03:02.910> little

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
basically where the base areas little

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.850 
basically where the base areas little

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
bridges that go across to your base and

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.710 
bridges that go across to your base and
as<00:03:05.070> long<00:03:05.190> if<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.430> have<00:03:05.520> siege<00:03:05.730> tanks<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.690> know

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
as long if you have siege tanks you know

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.300 
as long if you have siege tanks you know
on<00:03:06.960> that<00:03:07.140> side<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.530> bridge<00:03:07.770> you're<00:03:08.070> able

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
on that side of the bridge you're able

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.280 
on that side of the bridge you're able
to<00:03:08.400> cover<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.730> large<00:03:09.270> amount<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.720> space<00:03:09.990> and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
to cover a large amount of space and

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.990 
to cover a large amount of space and
guard<00:03:10.500> both<00:03:10.710> your<00:03:10.920> secondary<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.640> your<00:03:11.790> third

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
guard both your secondary and your third

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.430 
guard both your secondary and your third
base<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.810> seems<00:03:13.080> like<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.290> would<00:03:13.350> be

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
base so it seems like that would be

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.750 
base so it seems like that would be
advantage<00:03:13.770> for<00:03:13.950> teryn<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.550> looks<00:03:14.700> like

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
advantage for teryn and it looks like

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.930 
advantage for teryn and it looks like
they<00:03:15.750> don't<00:03:15.960> outputting<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.470> 12<00:03:16.980> skip<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.700> and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
they don't outputting is 12 skip so and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.490 
they don't outputting is 12 skip so and
also<00:03:18.360> scaling<00:03:18.750> with<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.900> drone<00:03:19.080> scouting<00:03:19.440> in

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
also scaling with the drone scouting in

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.600 
also scaling with the drone scouting in
the<00:03:19.560> wrong<00:03:19.739> direction<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.430> looks<00:03:20.550> like

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
the wrong direction and it looks like

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.170 
the wrong direction and it looks like
bear<00:03:20.910> barracks<00:03:21.630> going<00:03:21.870> up<00:03:21.989> for<00:03:22.850> flash<00:03:23.850> and

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
bear barracks going up for flash and

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.880 
bear barracks going up for flash and
also<00:03:24.390> his<00:03:24.510> sv<00:03:24.840> out<00:03:24.989> was<00:03:25.260> going<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.470> say<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.860> that

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
also his sv out was going to say is that

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.060 
also his sv out was going to say is that
um<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.810> interesting<00:03:28.200> thing<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.590> flash

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
um the interesting thing is that flash

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.030 
um the interesting thing is that flash
thumb<00:03:29.700> down<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.180> map<00:03:30.450> in<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.780> MSL<00:03:31.560> basically

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
thumb down this map in the MSL basically

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.340 
thumb down this map in the MSL basically
in<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.160> MSO<00:03:32.550> if<00:03:33.270> you're<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.810> leading<00:03:34.020> player

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
in the MSO if you're the leading player

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.840 
in the MSO if you're the leading player
going<00:03:34.739> into<00:03:34.980> your<00:03:35.130> group<00:03:35.340> into<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.580> round<00:03:35.760> of

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
going into your group into the round of

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.570 
going into your group into the round of
16<00:03:36.270> you're<00:03:36.840> able<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.140> choose<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:38.070> say<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.489> you

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
16 you're able to choose to say that you

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.070 
16 you're able to choose to say that you
don't<00:03:38.790> want<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.060> play<00:03:39.180> one<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.690> maps<00:03:39.840> one

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
don't want to play one of the maps one

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.020 
don't want to play one of the maps one
of<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.200> like<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.470> four<00:03:40.650> maps<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.130> flash<00:03:41.760> chose

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
of the like the four maps so flash chose

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.270 
of the like the four maps so flash chose
not<00:03:42.300> to<00:03:42.450> play<00:03:42.600> this<00:03:42.720> map<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.680> don't<00:03:44.040> know<00:03:44.130> why

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
not to play this map so I don't know why

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.250 
not to play this map so I don't know why
that<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.670> but<00:03:45.090> for<00:03:45.420> whatever<00:03:45.570> reason<00:03:45.720> Flass

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
that is but for whatever reason Flass

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.229 
that is but for whatever reason Flass
may<00:03:47.010> not<00:03:47.220> feel<00:03:47.370> as<00:03:47.520> comfortable<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.090> Matt

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
may not feel as comfortable in this Matt

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.490 
may not feel as comfortable in this Matt
maybe<00:03:48.390> he<00:03:48.600> didn't<00:03:48.780> practice<00:03:49.080> as<00:03:49.140> much<00:03:49.170> or

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
maybe he didn't practice as much or

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.650 
maybe he didn't practice as much or
didn't<00:03:49.709> want<00:03:49.830> to<00:03:49.890> play<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.420> could<00:03:51.630> be

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
didn't want to play it so that could be

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.570 
didn't want to play it so that could be
a<00:03:51.750> factor<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.709> flush<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.370> know<00:03:53.459> maybe

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
a factor that that flush you know maybe

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.010 
a factor that that flush you know maybe
flash<00:03:53.790> know<00:03:54.000> something<00:03:54.300> I<00:03:54.390> why<00:03:54.510> no<00:03:54.660> flash<00:03:54.870> just

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
flash know something I why no flash just

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.560 
flash know something I why no flash just
knows<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.350> lot<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.620> things<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:55.830> don't<00:03:55.890> know<00:03:56.100> about

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
knows a lot of things I don't know about

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.330 
knows a lot of things I don't know about
this<00:03:57.570> match<00:03:57.870> esta<00:03:58.260> too<00:03:58.470> but<00:03:58.770> I<00:03:58.800> do<00:03:58.950> think<00:03:59.220> that

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
this match esta too but I do think that

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.130 
this match esta too but I do think that
this<00:03:59.550> map<00:03:59.790> is<00:03:59.820> very<00:04:00.209> open<00:04:00.450> on<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.780> middle<00:04:00.989> and

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
this map is very open on the middle and

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.050 
this map is very open on the middle and
so<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.410> could<00:04:01.590> be<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.739> problem<00:04:01.920> for<00:04:02.130> Terrans

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
so that could be a problem for Terrans

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.850 
so that could be a problem for Terrans
because<00:04:03.360> like<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.080> said<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.320> can<00:04:04.410> push<00:04:04.650> out

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
because like you said you can push out

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.960 
because like you said you can push out
but<00:04:05.070> then<00:04:05.160> once<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.340> push<00:04:05.520> out<00:04:05.640> there<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:05.880> many

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
but then once you push out there so many

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.430 
but then once you push out there so many
places<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.420> get<00:04:06.570> surrounded<00:04:07.020> just<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:07.320> much

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
places to get surrounded just so much

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.530 
places to get surrounded just so much
open<00:04:07.739> field<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.489> think<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.060> know<00:04:09.180> lurkers

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
open field that I think you know lurkers

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.759 
open field that I think you know lurkers
and<00:04:09.690> wings<00:04:09.810> could<00:04:09.989> be<00:04:10.080> really<00:04:10.290> effective<00:04:10.500> on

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
and wings could be really effective on

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.250 
and wings could be really effective on
this<00:04:10.890> map<00:04:11.100> yeah<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:11.880> personally<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:12.840> don't<00:04:12.959> give

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
this map yeah I personally I don't give

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.750 
this map yeah I personally I don't give
and<00:04:13.769> I've<00:04:13.890> said<00:04:14.070> this<00:04:14.100> before<00:04:14.220> but<00:04:14.459> I<00:04:14.610> don't

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
give a ton of credence to map stats and

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.970 
give a ton of credence to map stats and
that's<00:04:17.190> kind<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.459> thing<00:04:17.640> yeah

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
that's kind of thing yeah

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.660

play<00:04:32.220> style<00:04:32.280> in<00:04:33.030> order<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.480> you<00:04:33.960> know<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.140> deal

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
play style in order to you know to deal

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.720 
play style in order to you know to deal
with<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:35.010> kind<00:04:35.130> of<00:04:35.220> thing<00:04:35.370> like<00:04:35.400> you

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
with that that kind of thing like you

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.420 
with that that kind of thing like you
know<00:04:35.820> so<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.510> a<00:04:36.660> map<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:37.650> going<00:04:37.890> to<00:04:37.950> make<00:04:38.100> it<00:04:38.250> so

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
know so of a map is going to make it so

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.220 
know so of a map is going to make it so
that<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.880> know<00:04:39.000> as<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.150> Protoss<00:04:39.600> reserved<00:04:40.080> for

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
that you know as a Protoss reserved for

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.080 
that you know as a Protoss reserved for
instance<00:04:40.530> you<00:04:40.950> can't<00:04:41.220> expand<00:04:41.610> as<00:04:41.760> much<00:04:41.910> and

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
instance you can't expand as much and

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.950 
instance you can't expand as much and
they're<00:04:42.180> going<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.330> play<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.540> more<00:04:42.720> aggressive

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
they're going to play a more aggressive

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.810 
they're going to play a more aggressive
game<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.560> go<00:04:43.650> for<00:04:43.680> a<00:04:43.920> clicker<00:04:44.220> game<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:44.670> kind

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
game and go for a clicker game that kind

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.430 
game and go for a clicker game that kind
of<00:04:44.850> thing<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:45.210> i<00:04:45.420> don't<00:04:45.840> think<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.050> map<00:04:46.200> stats

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
of thing so i don't think the map stats

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.260 
of thing so i don't think the map stats
are<00:04:46.530> going<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.710> matter<00:04:46.830> that<00:04:46.920> much<00:04:47.120> right<00:04:48.120> up

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
are going to matter that much right up

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.490 
are going to matter that much right up
dynamics<00:04:48.750> because<00:04:48.990> they're<00:04:49.110> both<00:04:49.260> going<00:04:49.440> to

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
dynamics because they're both going to

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.040 
dynamics because they're both going to
be<00:04:49.560> able<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.800> adapt<00:04:50.040> their<00:04:50.250> play<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:51.750> fit

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
be able to adapt their play to fit

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.810 
be able to adapt their play to fit
whatever<00:04:52.230> is<00:04:52.380> going<00:04:52.530> on<00:04:52.650> anyways<00:04:52.950> flash<00:04:53.520> going

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
arresting he didn't try wall in or

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.700 
arresting he didn't try wall in or
anything<00:04:57.420> like<00:04:57.600> that<00:04:57.720> yeah<00:04:58.230> very<00:04:58.500> very

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
anything like that yeah very very

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.500

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.710 
servings we don't see a bump or anything
I'm<00:05:08.370> surprised<00:05:08.820> a<00:05:08.970> little<00:05:09.090> bit<00:05:09.270> surprised<00:05:09.510> by

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
I'm surprised a little bit surprised by

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.120 
I'm surprised a little bit surprised by
that<00:05:09.900> you<00:05:10.410> don't<00:05:10.560> see<00:05:10.680> at<00:05:10.740> least<00:05:10.830> a<00:05:10.980> little

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
that you don't see at least a little

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.340 
that you don't see at least a little
bunker<00:05:11.460> starting<00:05:11.940> but<00:05:12.750> I<00:05:12.810> guess<00:05:13.020> he's<00:05:13.200> going

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
bunker starting but I guess he's going

bunker starting but I guess he's going
to<00:05:13.410> maybe<00:05:13.530> pull<00:05:13.830> some<00:05:13.980> stds<00:05:14.340> or<00:05:14.490> what<00:05:14.610> have<00:05:14.760> you

as well so you know I mean again it was
this<00:05:29.280> top-level<00:05:29.520> play<00:05:30.000> they're<00:05:30.240> going<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:30.420> be

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
this top-level play they're going to be

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.000 
this top-level play they're going to be
able<00:05:30.540> to<00:05:30.660> know<00:05:30.750> exactly<00:05:30.780> what's<00:05:31.320> going<00:05:31.380> on<00:05:31.650> and

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
able to know exactly what's going on and

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.440 
able to know exactly what's going on and
the<00:05:32.370> other<00:05:32.460> guys<00:05:32.610> base<00:05:32.820> and<00:05:33.030> not<00:05:33.210> do<00:05:33.420> anything

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
the other guys base and not do anything

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.000 
the other guys base and not do anything
more<00:05:34.020> than<00:05:34.170> they<00:05:34.260> really<00:05:34.470> have<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:34.800> so<00:05:34.950> that's

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
more than they really have to so that's

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.010 
more than they really have to so that's
why<00:05:35.190> we<00:05:35.340> saw<00:05:35.520> flash<00:05:36.150> not<00:05:36.420> making<00:05:36.690> that<00:05:36.750> bunker

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
why we saw flash not making that bunker

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.150 
why we saw flash not making that bunker
actually<00:05:37.140> in<00:05:37.350> hindsight<00:05:37.590> because<00:05:37.830> he<00:05:37.950> had<00:05:38.130> a

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
actually in hindsight because he had a

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.650 
actually in hindsight because he had a
SC<00:05:38.580> be<00:05:38.700> there<00:05:38.880> he<00:05:39.030> knew<00:05:39.150> exactly<00:05:39.240> how<00:05:39.600> many

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
SC be there he knew exactly how many

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.780 
SC be there he knew exactly how many
circles<00:05:40.110> were<00:05:40.290> coming<00:05:40.620> that<00:05:41.190> kind<00:05:41.370> of<00:05:41.400> thing<00:05:41.490> I

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
circles were coming that kind of thing I

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.760 
circles were coming that kind of thing I
just<00:05:42.390> wanted<00:05:42.600> to<00:05:42.660> say<00:05:42.750> I'm<00:05:43.080> gonna<00:05:43.590> give<00:05:43.740> a

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
just wanted to say I'm gonna give a

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.110 
just wanted to say I'm gonna give a
flash<00:05:44.040> and<00:05:44.250> edge<00:05:44.400> even<00:05:44.640> though<00:05:44.790> he<00:05:44.850> said<00:05:44.970> it's

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
flash and edge even though he said it's

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.120 
flash and edge even though he said it's
hard<00:05:45.300> to<00:05:45.420> call<00:05:45.650> personally<00:05:46.650> I<00:05:46.710> think<00:05:46.770> flash

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
hard to call personally I think flash

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.440 
hard to call personally I think flash
has<00:05:47.340> been<00:05:47.490> playing<00:05:47.730> a<00:05:47.820> little<00:05:48.120> bit<00:05:48.360> better

back to ultimate weapon status this last

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.990 
back to ultimate weapon status this last
season<00:06:03.420> so<00:06:03.840> I<00:06:04.230> think<00:06:04.770> you<00:06:04.920> know<00:06:05.040> if<00:06:05.790> they're

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
season so I think you know if they're

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.760 
season so I think you know if they're
playing<00:06:06.360> at<00:06:06.660> both<00:06:06.930> players<00:06:07.230> were<00:06:07.350> playing<00:06:07.620> at

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
playing at both players were playing at

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.070 
playing at both players were playing at
their<00:06:07.890> very<00:06:08.130> very<00:06:08.280> top<00:06:08.670> level<00:06:08.870> it<00:06:09.870> would<00:06:09.960> be<00:06:10.020> a

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
their very very top level it would be a

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.080 
their very very top level it would be a
lot<00:06:10.260> harder<00:06:10.410> call<00:06:10.860> but<00:06:11.310> right<00:06:11.670> now<00:06:11.850> I<00:06:11.880> don't

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
lot harder call but right now I don't

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.340 
lot harder call but right now I don't
think<00:06:12.240> Jae<00:06:12.450> dong<00:06:12.570> is<00:06:12.720> playing<00:06:12.960> in<00:06:13.080> his<00:06:13.140> top

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
think Jae dong is playing in his top

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.470 
think Jae dong is playing in his top
level<00:06:13.710> so<00:06:14.430> I<00:06:14.460> made<00:06:14.640> his<00:06:14.730> point<00:06:14.880> that<00:06:15.150> jaedong

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480
