00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
in this video I'm going to start with

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.980 
in this video I'm going to start with
the<00:01:16.920> black<00:01:17.189> mushroom<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:18.479> get<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> black

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
mushroom I did that in story mode I find

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.020 
mushroom I did that in story mode I find
it<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.530> lot<00:01:22.680> simpler<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.670> story<00:01:23.939> mode

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
it a lot simpler to do in story mode

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.570 
it a lot simpler to do in story mode
versus<00:01:24.630> adventure<00:01:25.110> mode<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:26.189> what<00:01:26.430> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
versus adventure mode because what you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.120 
versus adventure mode because what you
can<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.149> teleport<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.439> Cathedral
