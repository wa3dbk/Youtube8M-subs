position<00:01:11.650> then<00:01:12.650> I<00:01:12.800> can<00:01:12.980> go<00:01:13.130> up<00:01:13.280> another<00:01:13.580> half

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
position then I can go up another half

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:22.060 
position then I can go up another half
step<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.870> it's<00:01:15.110> B<00:01:15.350> major<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:21.140> one<00:01:21.500> more<00:01:21.800> half

and I could go back down here if I want
a<00:01:37.400> teenager

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:12.740 

you<00:01:55.850> can<00:01:56.060> even<00:01:56.180> do<00:01:56.570> F<00:01:56.900> major

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.950 

and<00:02:13.500> that's<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.980> higher<00:02:14.220> octave<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.090> started<00:02:15.840> on

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
and that's a higher octave I started on

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.370 
and that's a higher octave I started on
the<00:02:16.110> open<00:02:16.530> G<00:02:16.710> now<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.430> end<00:02:17.850> up<00:02:18.030> on<00:02:18.240> 3rd<00:02:18.810> position

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
the open G now I end up on 3rd position

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.960 
the open G now I end up on 3rd position
first<00:02:20.040> finger<00:02:20.490> on<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.000> D<00:02:21.180> string<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:23.790> can

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
first finger on the D string you can

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.450 
first finger on the D string you can
also<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.780> with<00:02:25.080> your<00:02:25.200> minor<00:02:25.440> keys<00:02:25.800> you

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
can do them in two octaves which means

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.340 
can do them in two octaves which means
you<00:02:28.710> can<00:02:28.890> start<00:02:29.250> down<00:02:29.520> here<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.180> then<00:02:30.720> up<00:02:30.960> here

there's also natural minor but I do the
two<00:03:49.910> kinds<00:03:50.859> listening<00:03:51.859> and<00:03:52.099> spend<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:53.060> little

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
two kinds listening and spend a little

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.680 
two kinds listening and spend a little
more<00:03:53.420> time<00:03:53.750> on<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:54.590> upper<00:03:54.980> octave<00:03:55.690> especially

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
more time on the upper octave especially

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.199 
more time on the upper octave especially
of<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.959> minor<00:03:57.260> because<00:03:57.950> you<00:03:58.340> have<00:03:58.609> some<00:03:58.879> steps

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
of the minor because you have some steps

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.780 
of the minor because you have some steps
that<00:03:59.420> can<00:03:59.690> be<00:03:59.870> wider<00:04:00.200> up<00:04:00.560> there<00:04:00.829> and<00:04:01.069> closer

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
that can be wider up there and closer

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.930 
that can be wider up there and closer
and<00:04:02.510> you<00:04:02.720> have<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.170> really<00:04:03.470> listen<00:04:03.739> a<00:04:04.129> lot<00:04:04.280> for

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
and you have to really listen a lot for

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.480 
and you have to really listen a lot for
those<00:04:05.120> two
