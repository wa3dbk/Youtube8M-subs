00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:12.850 
alright we're back with an update just a

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.750 
alright we're back with an update just a
couple<00:00:13.059> of<00:00:13.209> things<00:00:13.480> I<00:00:13.629> wanted<00:00:13.900> to<00:00:13.959> show<00:00:14.350> I<00:00:14.760> got

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
couple of things I wanted to show I got

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.330 
couple of things I wanted to show I got
a<00:00:15.789> new<00:00:15.939> case<00:00:16.320> wasn't<00:00:17.320> really<00:00:17.800> a<00:00:17.830> big<00:00:18.070> fan<00:00:18.100> of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
a new case wasn't really a big fan of

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.220 
a new case wasn't really a big fan of
the<00:00:18.519> last<00:00:18.760> one<00:00:18.939> it<00:00:19.060> was<00:00:19.119> very<00:00:19.359> basic<00:00:19.779> as<00:00:19.900> i<00:00:20.019> said

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
the last one it was very basic as i said

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.260 
the last one it was very basic as i said
before<00:00:21.090> now<00:00:22.090> i<00:00:22.119> have<00:00:22.330> the<00:00:22.600> easel<00:00:23.470> case<00:00:23.980> so<00:00:24.340> just

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
before now i have the easel case so just

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.900 
before now i have the easel case so just
kind<00:00:25.449> of<00:00:25.480> show<00:00:25.660> you<00:00:25.690> how<00:00:25.869> that<00:00:25.900> works<00:00:26.050> out<00:00:26.910> it's

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
kind of show you how that works out it's

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.330 
kind of show you how that works out it's
basically<00:00:28.390> normal-looking<00:00:29.260> case<00:00:29.619> as<00:00:29.860> you<00:00:30.190> can

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
basically normal-looking case as you can

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.240 
basically normal-looking case as you can
see<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:31.660> there's<00:00:31.840> a<00:00:32.020> couple<00:00:32.289> other<00:00:32.469> pieces<00:00:32.829> to

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
see but there's a couple other pieces to

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.920 
see but there's a couple other pieces to
it<00:00:33.280> here<00:00:33.879> and<00:00:33.910> if<00:00:34.329> i<00:00:34.390> can<00:00:34.570> do<00:00:34.690> it<00:00:34.719> very

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
it here and if i can do it very

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.569 
it here and if i can do it very
carefully<00:00:35.289> it's<00:00:35.949> going<00:00:36.070> to<00:00:36.129> put<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.309> camera

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
carefully it's going to put the camera

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:48.470 
carefully it's going to put the camera
down<00:00:36.609> from<00:00:36.850> one<00:00:36.999> second<00:00:37.390> here

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.590 

you<00:00:49.480> can<00:00:49.630> see<00:00:49.870> now<00:00:50.110> it<00:00:50.649> is<00:00:50.860> an<00:00:51.129> easel<00:00:51.700> so

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
you can see now it is an easel so

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.530 
you can see now it is an easel so
basically<00:00:53.020> set<00:00:53.350> it<00:00:53.500> up<00:00:53.590> and<00:00:53.739> it's<00:00:54.000> magnetic<00:00:55.000> so

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
basically set it up and it's magnetic so

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.600 
basically set it up and it's magnetic so
to<00:00:55.660> stay<00:00:55.870> that<00:00:56.079> way<00:00:56.260> it's<00:00:56.650> fairly<00:00:57.309> sturdy

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
to stay that way it's fairly sturdy

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.540 
to stay that way it's fairly sturdy
actually<00:00:58.120> works<00:00:58.600> very<00:00:58.840> very<00:00:58.930> well<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.309> the

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
actually works very very well so the

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.490 
actually works very very well so the
other<00:01:00.699> thing<00:01:00.790> I<00:01:00.970> wanted<00:01:01.180> to<00:01:01.239> show<00:01:01.329> you<00:01:01.510> very

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
other thing I wanted to show you very

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.830 
other thing I wanted to show you very
quickly<00:01:02.559> is<00:01:03.720> I've<00:01:04.720> done<00:01:05.050> another<00:01:05.710> overclock

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
quickly is I've done another overclock

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.020 
quickly is I've done another overclock
which<00:01:07.840> now<00:01:08.680> it<00:01:08.830> says<00:01:08.979> stock<00:01:09.250> voltage<00:01:09.700> so<00:01:09.880> it's

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
which now it says stock voltage so it's

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.940 
which now it says stock voltage so it's
not<00:01:10.180> under<00:01:10.479> bolted<00:01:10.810> as<00:01:10.900> it<00:01:11.050> was<00:01:11.200> before<00:01:11.380> its

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
not under bolted as it was before its

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.070 
not under bolted as it was before its
stock<00:01:12.310> voltage<00:01:12.790> but<00:01:13.390> that's<00:01:13.600> running<00:01:13.840> that's

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
stock voltage but that's running that's

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.719 
stock voltage but that's running that's
one<00:01:14.740> gigahertz<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:16.830> runs<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:17.979> very<00:01:18.310> very<00:01:18.490> well

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
one gigahertz and runs it very very well

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.510 
one gigahertz and runs it very very well
actually<00:01:18.940> so<00:01:19.509> very<00:01:20.050> very<00:01:20.110> stable<00:01:20.560> its<00:01:21.280> stock

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
actually so very very stable its stock

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.400 
actually so very very stable its stock
voltage<00:01:21.970> and<00:01:22.240> hopefully<00:01:22.780> going<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:23.020> be<00:01:23.110> moving

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
voltage and hopefully going to be moving

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.370 
voltage and hopefully going to be moving
towards<00:01:23.860> one<00:01:24.130> point<00:01:24.430> one<00:01:24.990> gigahertz<00:01:25.990> very

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
towards one point one gigahertz very

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.719 
towards one point one gigahertz very
shortly<00:01:26.619> i'm<00:01:26.740> going<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:26.950> upload<00:01:27.009> a<00:01:27.250> colonel

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
shortly i'm going to upload a colonel

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.350 
shortly i'm going to upload a colonel
and<00:01:27.910> see<00:01:28.810> what<00:01:28.930> I<00:01:28.960> get<00:01:29.080> so<00:01:30.030> let's<00:01:31.030> go<00:01:31.149> ahead<00:01:31.179> and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
and see what I get so let's go ahead and

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.320 
and see what I get so let's go ahead and
fire<00:01:31.630> this<00:01:31.869> on<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:33.399> i'll<00:01:33.700> type<00:01:34.000> in<00:01:34.179> my

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
fire this on and i'll type in my

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.850 
fire this on and i'll type in my
password<00:01:34.360> here<00:01:35.259> and<00:01:37.320> you'll<00:01:38.320> see<00:01:38.500> i'm<00:01:38.619> on<00:01:38.770> my

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
password here and you'll see i'm on my

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.190 
password here and you'll see i'm on my
home<00:01:39.039> page<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.729> auto<00:01:40.119> orientation<00:01:40.990> as

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
home page and the auto orientation as

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.669 
home page and the auto orientation as
you<00:01:41.410> can<00:01:41.530> see<00:01:41.649> works<00:01:41.890> very<00:01:42.100> very<00:01:42.190> well<00:01:42.399> and

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
you can see works very very well and

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.820 
you can see works very very well and
it's<00:01:44.679> gonna<00:01:44.860> pick<00:01:45.190> it<00:01:45.310> up<00:01:45.429> perfect<00:01:45.910> great<00:01:46.830> so

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
it's gonna pick it up perfect great so

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.380 
it's gonna pick it up perfect great so
that's<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.369> home<00:01:48.490> screen<00:01:48.850> still<00:01:49.090> running<00:01:49.330> the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
that's the home screen still running the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.840 
that's the home screen still running the
same<00:01:49.539> home<00:01:49.720> screen<00:01:50.050> and<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.979> orientation<00:01:51.759> i

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
same home screen and the orientation i

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.249 
same home screen and the orientation i
was<00:01:51.970> just<00:01:52.150> changed<00:01:52.479> based<00:01:52.659> on<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.990> way<00:01:53.079> that<00:01:53.200> i

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
was just changed based on the way that i

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.990 
was just changed based on the way that i
have<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.680> it's<00:01:54.100> going<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.369> click<00:01:54.549> here<00:01:54.790> it's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
have it it's going to click here it's

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.850 
have it it's going to click here it's
very<00:01:55.210> very<00:01:55.450> snappy<00:01:55.780> now<00:01:56.290> it's<00:01:56.470> definitely<00:01:56.680> a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
very very snappy now it's definitely a

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.109 
very very snappy now it's definitely a
lot<00:01:56.950> quicker<00:01:57.189> as<00:01:57.490> far<00:01:57.700> as<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.939> way<00:01:58.060> things

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
lot quicker as far as the way things

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.649 
lot quicker as far as the way things
move<00:01:58.570> so<00:01:59.500> let<00:01:59.770> me<00:01:59.860> go<00:02:00.009> down<00:02:00.189> here<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:00.909> i<00:02:01.450> just

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
move so let me go down here and i just

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.770 
move so let me go down here and i just
want<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.930> show<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.170> in<00:02:02.380> setcpu<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:04.479> it's<00:02:04.630> now

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
want to show you in setcpu that it's now

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:12.270 
want to show you in setcpu that it's now
running<00:02:05.049> at<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:06.909> to<00:02:07.530> one<00:02:08.530> gig<00:02:08.739> arts<00:02:09.040> max<00:02:09.790> and<00:02:11.280> as

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
running at up to one gig arts max and as

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.920 
running at up to one gig arts max and as
you<00:02:12.400> can<00:02:12.519> see<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.760> min<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.090> 300<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:13.780> it's

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
you can see the min is 300 so it's

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.270 
you can see the min is 300 so it's
basically<00:02:16.140> using<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.230> throttling<00:02:17.709> system<00:02:18.100> or<00:02:18.250> a

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
basically using a throttling system or a

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.060 
basically using a throttling system or a
scaling<00:02:18.820> system<00:02:19.239> on<00:02:19.420> demand<00:02:20.049> which<00:02:20.769> is<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
scaling system on demand which is the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.800 
scaling system on demand which is the
best<00:02:21.250> as<00:02:21.549> far<00:02:21.730> as<00:02:21.850> battery<00:02:22.239> life<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.690> also

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
best as far as battery life you can also

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.150 
best as far as battery life you can also
set<00:02:23.079> it<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.320> performance<00:02:23.860> which<00:02:24.010> will

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
set it to performance which will

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.699 
set it to performance which will
permanently<00:02:24.610> run<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.030> at<00:02:25.120> 1000<00:02:25.900> or<00:02:26.049> 1

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
permanently run it at 1000 or 1

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.250 
permanently run it at 1000 or 1
gigahertz<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.600> will<00:02:28.750> definitely<00:02:28.989> help

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
gigahertz and that will definitely help

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.900 
gigahertz and that will definitely help
with<00:02:29.410> performance<00:02:30.040> but<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.280> also<00:02:30.430> drains<00:02:30.700> your

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
with performance but it also drains your

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.270 
with performance but it also drains your
battery<00:02:30.970> or<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.269> lot<00:02:31.420> quicker<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:32.190> depends<00:02:33.190> on

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
battery or a lot quicker so depends on

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.400 
battery or a lot quicker so depends on
what<00:02:33.400> you're<00:02:33.489> after<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.820> suppose<00:02:34.269> so<00:02:34.959> very<00:02:35.320> very

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
what you're after I suppose so very very

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.630 
what you're after I suppose so very very
well<00:02:35.829> as<00:02:36.700> far<00:02:37.060> as<00:02:37.500> performance<00:02:38.500> goes<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.340> also

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
well as far as performance goes and also

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.479 
well as far as performance goes and also
just<00:02:39.940> overall<00:02:40.620> stability<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.920> haven't<00:02:42.220> had<00:02:42.280> any

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
just overall stability I haven't had any

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.440 
just overall stability I haven't had any
issues<00:02:42.880> no<00:02:43.120> loop<00:02:44.079> booting<00:02:44.440> nothing<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:46.030> it's

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
issues no loop booting nothing so it's

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.050 
issues no loop booting nothing so it's
been<00:02:46.630> very<00:02:46.660> very<00:02:47.109> good<00:02:47.230> love<00:02:47.829> it<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.100> far<00:02:48.130> so

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
been very very good love it so far so

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.229 
been very very good love it so far so
check<00:02:49.390> back<00:02:49.570> soon<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:50.190> hopefully<00:02:51.239> we're

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
check back soon and hopefully we're

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.530 
check back soon and hopefully we're
going<00:02:52.359> to<00:02:52.420> be<00:02:52.739> running<00:02:53.739> in<00:02:54.100> one<00:02:54.700> point<00:02:55.360> 1

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
going to be running in one point 1

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.230 
going to be running in one point 1
gigahertz<00:02:56.319> range

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
gigahertz range

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.020 
gigahertz range
and<00:02:57.380> as<00:02:58.380> far<00:02:58.620> as<00:02:58.770> I<00:02:58.860> can<00:02:58.920> tell<00:02:59.070> there

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
and as far as I can tell there

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.700 
and as far as I can tell there
definitely<00:03:00.240> is<00:03:00.510> some<00:03:00.540> some<00:03:01.140> big<00:03:01.470> big

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
definitely is some some big big

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.270 
definitely is some some big big
performance<00:03:02.340> issues<00:03:03.710> you<00:03:04.710> know<00:03:04.830> with<00:03:05.040> with

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
performance issues you know with with

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.310 
performance issues you know with with
the<00:03:05.430> stock<00:03:05.730> in<00:03:06.330> comparison<00:03:06.960> to<00:03:07.550> slightly

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
the stock in comparison to slightly

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.750 
the stock in comparison to slightly
bumped<00:03:10.320> up<00:03:10.440> as<00:03:10.620> far<00:03:10.800> as<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.130> megahertz<00:03:11.490> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
bumped up as far as the megahertz and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.930 
bumped up as far as the megahertz and
also<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.150> l3<00:03:12.570> cache<00:03:13.220> which<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.400> going<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:14.880> make

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
also the l3 cache which is going to make

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.210 
also the l3 cache which is going to make
a<00:03:15.060> big<00:03:15.330> big<00:03:15.480> difference<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.110> performance<00:03:16.770> as

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
a big big difference in performance as

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.950 
a big big difference in performance as
far<00:03:17.400> as<00:03:17.490> videos<00:03:17.820> concerned<00:03:18.270> HD<00:03:18.720> video

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
far as videos concerned HD video

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.220 
far as videos concerned HD video
especially<00:03:19.200> H<00:03:19.740> dot<00:03:19.980> 264<00:03:20.870> that<00:03:21.870> sort<00:03:22.140> of<00:03:22.170> thing

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
especially H dot 264 that sort of thing

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.750 
especially H dot 264 that sort of thing
so<00:03:22.470> for<00:03:22.650> movies<00:03:22.920> it's<00:03:23.100> definitely<00:03:23.490> a<00:03:23.520> lot<00:03:23.700> more

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
so for movies it's definitely a lot more

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.860 
so for movies it's definitely a lot more
stable<00:03:24.180> thing<00:03:24.570> a<00:03:24.750> lot<00:03:24.870> better<00:03:25.080> now<00:03:25.580> and<00:03:26.630> as<00:03:27.630> far

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
stable thing a lot better now and as far

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.080 
stable thing a lot better now and as far
as<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.200> future<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.770> think<00:03:29.580> it's<00:03:29.700> only<00:03:29.820> going<00:03:30.000> to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
as the future I think it's only going to

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.030 
as the future I think it's only going to
get<00:03:30.180> brighter<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.570> mean<00:03:30.750> this<00:03:30.840> is<00:03:30.980> very<00:03:31.980> very

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
get brighter I mean this is very very

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.040 
get brighter I mean this is very very
new<00:03:32.430> stuff<00:03:32.760> but<00:03:33.030> right<00:03:33.180> now<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.660> absolutely

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
new stuff but right now it absolutely

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.700 
new stuff but right now it absolutely

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
creams what a galaxy tab can do as far

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.670 
creams what a galaxy tab can do as far
as<00:03:37.770> overall<00:03:38.100> performance<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:40.230> tablet

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
as overall performance of the tablet

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.850 
as overall performance of the tablet
itself<00:03:40.800> so<00:03:41.400> very<00:03:41.820> very<00:03:42.060> impressed<00:03:42.450> for<00:03:42.860> $249

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.610 
itself so very very impressed for $249
you<00:03:43.980> cannot<00:03:44.550> go<00:03:44.730> wrong<00:03:45.200> so<00:03:46.200> check<00:03:46.410> back<00:03:46.560> soon
