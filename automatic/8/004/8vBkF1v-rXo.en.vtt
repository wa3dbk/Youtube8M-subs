00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.980 
hello again everyone Bach salesman here
with<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.550> torment<00:00:02.939> 6<00:00:03.149> version<00:00:03.600> of<00:00:03.750> my

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
with the torment 6 version of my

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.930 
with the torment 6 version of my
immortal<00:00:04.470> King<00:00:04.650> whirlwind<00:00:05.160> built<00:00:05.370> I'll<00:00:05.609> try

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
immortal King whirlwind built I'll try

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.130 
immortal King whirlwind built I'll try
to<00:00:06.000> keep<00:00:06.240> it<00:00:06.390> short<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.020> point

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
to keep it short and to the point

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.169 
to keep it short and to the point
because<00:00:07.529> torment<00:00:08.099> 6<00:00:08.250> doesn't<00:00:08.639> need<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.000> much

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
because torment 6 doesn't need that much

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.870 
because torment 6 doesn't need that much
optimization<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.250> use<00:00:11.400> six<00:00:11.639> piece

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
optimization so we use six piece

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.209 
optimization so we use six piece
immortal<00:00:12.300> King<00:00:12.480> just<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.620> four<00:00:13.889> set<00:00:14.070> and

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219

it<00:00:18.090> gives<00:00:18.420> movement<00:00:18.810> speed<00:00:19.020> as<00:00:19.140> well<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.680> we

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
it gives movement speed as well so we

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.070 
it gives movement speed as well so we
use<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.490> then<00:00:21.180> there<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.660> book<00:00:21.840> Cotto's

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
use that then there is the book Cotto's

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.130 
use that then there is the book Cotto's
we<00:00:23.039> use<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.369> for<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> few<00:00:24.180> regeneration<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.960> lot

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
we use this for a few regeneration a lot

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.240 
we use this for a few regeneration a lot
of<00:00:25.230> attack<00:00:25.470> speed<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.710> movement<00:00:26.130> speed

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
of attack speed and movement speed

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.160 
of attack speed and movement speed
honestly<00:00:26.789> nothing<00:00:26.970> rivals<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.960> speed

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
honestly nothing rivals this and speed

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.490 
honestly nothing rivals this and speed
farming<00:00:29.090> then<00:00:30.090> we<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.689> focus<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.080> restraint

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
farming then we just focus on restraint

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.930 
farming then we just focus on restraint
simply<00:00:31.890> because<00:00:32.160> they<00:00:32.250> are<00:00:32.369> really<00:00:32.700> great

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
simply because they are really great

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.750 
simply because they are really great
damage<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.739> we<00:00:34.739> don't<00:00:34.920> really<00:00:35.130> mind<00:00:35.399> using

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
damage and we don't really mind using

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.490 
damage and we don't really mind using
frenzy<00:00:36.180> now<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.510> then<00:00:36.630> because<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.200> gives<00:00:37.410> us

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
frenzy now and then because it gives us

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.190 
frenzy now and then because it gives us
movement<00:00:37.890> speed<00:00:38.100> anyway<00:00:38.809> then<00:00:39.809> profane

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
movement speed anyway then profane

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.740 
movement speed anyway then profane
pauldrons<00:00:40.710> extra<00:00:41.040> pickup<00:00:41.370> radius<00:00:41.750> there's

pauldrons extra pickup radius there's

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.510 
pauldrons extra pickup radius there's
not<00:00:42.930> really<00:00:43.110> any<00:00:43.350> great<00:00:43.739> shoulder<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.309> might

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
not really any great shoulder so might

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.979 
not really any great shoulder so might
as<00:00:44.640> well<00:00:44.670> go<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.090> pickup<00:00:45.329> radius<00:00:45.780> and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
as well go for the pickup radius and

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.990 
as well go for the pickup radius and
depending<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> braces<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> pickup

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
depending on the braces the pickup

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.430 
depending on the braces the pickup
radius<00:00:48.270> might<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.570> really<00:00:48.840> useful<00:00:48.930> as<00:00:49.289> well

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
radius might be really useful as well

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860 
radius might be really useful as well
then<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> amulets<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:51.210> use<00:00:51.390> any<00:00:51.629> high

but<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:09.869> use<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.080> under<00:01:10.530> rank<00:01:10.710> 25<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.490> need

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
but don't use it under rank 25 you need

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.609 
but don't use it under rank 25 you need
to<00:01:11.790> rank<00:01:11.939> 25<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.930> work<00:01:13.140> because<00:01:13.350> we

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
to rank 25 on this to work because we

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.219 
to rank 25 on this to work because we
don't<00:01:13.830> really<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.250> any<00:01:14.540> any<00:01:15.540> crowd<00:01:15.720> control

don't really have any any crowd control
so<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.920> need<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.250> rank<00:01:17.490> 25<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.240> proc<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.600> damage

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
so we need to rank 25 to proc the damage

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.460 
so we need to rank 25 to proc the damage

depending<00:03:27.200> on<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.410> rift<00:03:27.739> layout<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.220> can<00:03:28.400> go

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
depending on the rift layout it can go

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.210 
depending on the rift layout it can go
really<00:03:28.970> fast<00:03:29.379> but<00:03:30.379> it<00:03:30.470> can<00:03:30.620> also<00:03:30.769> take<00:03:30.980> like

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
really fast but it can also take like

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.890 
really fast but it can also take like
three<00:03:31.489> minutes<00:03:31.670> if<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.090> rift<00:03:32.269> out<00:03:32.510> is<00:03:32.660> pretty

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
three minutes if the rift out is pretty

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.080 
three minutes if the rift out is pretty
bad<00:03:33.110> generally<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.160> will<00:03:34.370> never<00:03:34.640> really<00:03:34.940> be

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
bad generally it will never really be

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.500 
bad generally it will never really be
much<00:03:35.510> more<00:03:35.750> than<00:03:35.870> three<00:03:36.050> minutes<00:03:37.510> just

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
much more than three minutes just

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.479 
much more than three minutes just
activate<00:03:39.080> all<00:03:39.230> your<00:03:39.410> buffs<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.980> start

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
activate all your buffs and start

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.600 
activate all your buffs and start
spinning<00:03:40.730> keep<00:03:41.450> your<00:03:41.629> fury<00:03:41.989> up<00:03:42.080> now<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.440> then

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
spinning keep your fury up now and then

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.650 
spinning keep your fury up now and then
often<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:43.640> alone<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.060> managed<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.420> actually

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
often you alone you managed to actually

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.630 
often you alone you managed to actually
hit<00:03:44.989> something<00:03:45.410> with<00:03:45.500> fury<00:03:45.799> on<00:03:45.890> an<00:03:46.099> elite<00:03:46.340> back

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
hit something with fury on an elite back

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.720 
hit something with fury on an elite back
so<00:03:47.680> don't<00:03:48.680> really<00:03:48.799> need<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.099> care<00:03:49.280> that<00:03:49.580> much

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
so don't really need to care that much

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.180 
so don't really need to care that much
about<00:03:49.790> keeping<00:03:50.510> him<00:03:50.690> wide<00:03:51.500> why<00:03:51.830> am<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:52.010> saying

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
about keeping him wide why am I saying

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.180 
about keeping him wide why am I saying
fury<00:03:52.519> I'm<00:03:52.700> in<00:03:52.819> frenzy<00:03:56.560> it's<00:03:57.560> really<00:03:57.799> great<00:03:58.010> to

fury I'm in frenzy it's really great to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.970

use<00:03:58.400> on<00:03:58.549> an<00:03:58.670> elite<00:03:58.880> back<00:03:59.260> just<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.739> get<00:04:00.860> the

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
use on an elite back just to get the

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.949 
use on an elite back just to get the
100%<00:04:01.400> damage<00:04:01.790> from<00:04:02.030> focus<00:04:02.329> and<00:04:02.450> restraint<00:04:02.540> as

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
well and of course it's a dead end

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.539 
well and of course it's a dead end
as<00:04:05.989> you<00:04:06.110> see<00:04:06.260> here<00:04:06.440> BAM<00:04:06.650> just<00:04:06.680> hit<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:07.370> once

increase oh there's a goblin here what

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.180 
increase oh there's a goblin here what

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
is that one of the new ones now this new

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.909 
is that one of the new ones now this new
looting<00:04:19.489> is<00:04:19.609> really<00:04:19.880> amazing<00:04:20.299> I<00:04:20.739> think<00:04:21.739> was

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
looting is really amazing I think was

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.909 
looting is really amazing I think was
one<00:04:22.100> of<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.310> new<00:04:22.430> ones<00:04:22.580> oh<00:04:22.850> well<00:04:23.800> it's<00:04:24.800> a

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
one of the new ones oh well it's a

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.500 
one of the new ones oh well it's a
pretty<00:04:25.100> bad<00:04:25.370> riff<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:25.789> be<00:04:25.910> honest<00:04:26.210> let's<00:04:26.449> be

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
pretty bad riff to be honest let's be

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.480 
pretty bad riff to be honest let's be
fair<00:04:26.810> here<00:04:26.870> there's<00:04:27.260> a<00:04:27.320> huge<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:28.130> end<00:04:28.280> in<00:04:28.400> the

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
fair here there's a huge that end in the

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.279 
fair here there's a huge that end in the
beginning<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:28.970> density<00:04:29.389> is<00:04:29.479> terrible<00:04:29.990> so

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
beginning the density is terrible so

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.990 
beginning the density is terrible so
this<00:04:30.830> will<00:04:31.010> probably<00:04:31.160> be<00:04:31.430> one<00:04:31.460> of<00:04:31.700> those<00:04:31.789> three

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
this will probably be one of those three

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.409 
this will probably be one of those three
minutes<00:04:32.360> rift<00:04:33.430> but<00:04:34.430> as<00:04:34.550> you<00:04:34.669> can<00:04:34.820> see<00:04:35.060> the

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
minutes rift but as you can see the

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.150 
minutes rift but as you can see the
movement<00:04:35.780> speed<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.110> everything<00:04:36.200> this<00:04:36.979> can

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
movement speed and everything this can

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.040 
movement speed and everything this can
definitely<00:04:37.639> just<00:04:37.669> rush<00:04:38.510> through<00:04:38.750> rifts

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
definitely just rush through rifts

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.380 
definitely just rush through rifts
really<00:04:39.289> fast

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.060 

again<00:04:44.390> we<00:04:44.540> just<00:04:44.570> frenzy<00:04:45.140> this<00:04:45.260> once<00:04:45.530> and<00:04:45.830> then

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
again we just frenzy this once and then

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.690 
again we just frenzy this once and then
keep<00:04:46.250> spinning<00:04:46.670> a<00:04:48.340> shielding<00:04:49.340> is<00:04:49.460> always

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
keep spinning a shielding is always

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.150 
keep spinning a shielding is always
pretty<00:04:49.940> annoying<00:04:50.210> on<00:04:50.420> torment<00:04:50.780> 6<00:04:54.010> and<00:04:55.010> keep

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
pretty annoying on torment 6 and keep

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.810 
pretty annoying on torment 6 and keep
all<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.460> buffs<00:04:55.670> up

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.060 

you<00:04:59.360> can<00:04:59.510> often<00:04:59.750> just<00:04:59.930> run<00:05:00.350> through<00:05:00.590> monsters

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
you can often just run through monsters

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.530 
you can often just run through monsters
and<00:05:01.250> then<00:05:01.340> leave<00:05:01.640> them<00:05:01.790> behind<00:05:01.940> to<00:05:02.210> die<00:05:02.480> you

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
and then leave them behind to die you

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.150 
and then leave them behind to die you
don't<00:05:02.840> really<00:05:02.990> need<00:05:03.290> to<00:05:03.350> stay<00:05:03.680> till<00:05:03.920> there

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
don't really need to stay till there

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.450 
don't really need to stay till there
till<00:05:04.550> they're<00:05:04.700> completely<00:05:05.060> killed<00:05:06.460> because

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
till they're completely killed because

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.190 
till they're completely killed because
the<00:05:07.700> pain<00:05:07.850> enhancer<00:05:08.360> and<00:05:08.480> the<00:05:08.600> tornadoes<00:05:09.050> will

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
the pain enhancer and the tornadoes will

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.630 
the pain enhancer and the tornadoes will
really<00:05:09.500> take<00:05:09.650> care<00:05:09.860> of<00:05:09.980> that<00:05:10.100> for<00:05:10.340> you<00:05:10.460> so<00:05:10.610> even

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
really take care of that for you so even

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.090 
really take care of that for you so even
on<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.060> deep<00:05:11.210> packs<00:05:11.450> you<00:05:11.570> can<00:05:11.630> just<00:05:11.980> once<00:05:12.980> you

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
on the deep packs you can just once you

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.130 
on the deep packs you can just once you
get<00:05:13.250> them<00:05:13.370> to<00:05:13.490> 50%<00:05:13.970> health<00:05:14.360> you<00:05:14.480> can<00:05:14.660> just<00:05:14.840> go

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
get them to 50% health you can just go

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.750 
get them to 50% health you can just go
on<00:05:15.350> of<00:05:15.860> course<00:05:15.950> this<00:05:16.220> depends<00:05:16.580> on<00:05:16.700> your

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
on of course this depends on your

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.360 
on of course this depends on your
personal<00:05:17.180> DPS<00:05:17.570> values<00:05:17.960> if<00:05:18.140> your<00:05:18.380> gear<00:05:19.250> is

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
personal DPS values if your gear is

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.540 
personal DPS values if your gear is
really<00:05:19.610> bad<00:05:20.890> then<00:05:21.890> you<00:05:21.980> might<00:05:22.130> need<00:05:22.250> to<00:05:22.310> world

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
really bad then you might need to world

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.710 
really bad then you might need to world
in<00:05:22.670> a<00:05:22.760> little<00:05:22.940> bit<00:05:23.060> longer<00:05:23.240> but<00:05:23.390> like<00:05:23.540> now<00:05:23.690> I

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
in a little bit longer but like now I

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.360 
in a little bit longer but like now I
just<00:05:23.810> go<00:05:24.140> away<00:05:24.290> again<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:24.830> you<00:05:24.980> see<00:05:25.160> the<00:05:25.280> earth

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
just go away again and you see the earth

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.430 
just go away again and you see the earth
dying<00:05:25.670> the<00:05:25.940> tornadoes<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.690> pain<00:05:26.930> announcer

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
dying the tornadoes the pain announcer

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.240 
dying the tornadoes the pain announcer
its<00:05:27.620> it's<00:05:27.950> all<00:05:28.070> just<00:05:28.280> killing<00:05:28.610> it

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.040 

of<00:05:33.640> course<00:05:33.850> we<00:05:34.000> go<00:05:34.120> back<00:05:34.300> for<00:05:34.480> Legendary's

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
of course we go back for Legendary's

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.120 
of course we go back for Legendary's
that's<00:05:35.200> kind<00:05:35.410> of<00:05:35.470> the<00:05:35.560> whole<00:05:35.710> point<00:05:35.980> of

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
that's kind of the whole point of

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.930 
that's kind of the whole point of
torment<00:05:36.550> 6<00:05:37.890> yeah<00:05:38.890> this<00:05:39.040> is<00:05:39.190> a<00:05:39.220> kind<00:05:39.640> of<00:05:39.700> a<00:05:39.820> slow

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
torment 6 yeah this is a kind of a slow

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.280 
torment 6 yeah this is a kind of a slow
run<00:05:40.680> and<00:05:42.180> actually<00:05:43.180> did<00:05:43.480> mess<00:05:43.660> up<00:05:43.810> the<00:05:43.900> bleat<00:05:44.110> I

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
run and actually did mess up the bleat I

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.200 
run and actually did mess up the bleat I
really<00:05:44.650> didn't<00:05:44.980> I<00:05:47.520> yeah<00:05:48.520> sometimes<00:05:48.940> you<00:05:49.060> can

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
really didn't I yeah sometimes you can

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.520 
really didn't I yeah sometimes you can
mess<00:05:49.360> it<00:05:49.540> up<00:05:49.600> but<00:05:49.750> it's<00:05:49.930> worth<00:05:50.200> it<00:05:50.350> to<00:05:50.500> just

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
mess it up but it's worth it to just

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.550 
mess it up but it's worth it to just
keep<00:05:51.010> going<00:05:51.340> faster<00:05:51.930> even<00:05:52.930> if<00:05:53.050> you<00:05:53.170> mess<00:05:53.350> it<00:05:53.500> up

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
keep going faster even if you mess it up

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.690 
keep going faster even if you mess it up
once<00:05:53.800> or<00:05:53.980> twice<00:05:55.950> we<00:05:56.950> are<00:05:57.040> pretty<00:05:57.280> bad<00:05:57.430> rift

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
once or twice we are pretty bad rift

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.430 
once or twice we are pretty bad rift
honestly<00:05:58.120> needing<00:05:58.450> three<00:05:58.780> levels<00:05:59.140> just<00:05:59.320> to

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
honestly needing three levels just to

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.480 
honestly needing three levels just to
get<00:05:59.650> to<00:06:00.070> the<00:06:00.160> rift<00:06:00.340> guardian<00:06:00.400> oh<00:06:02.280> yeah<00:06:03.280> let's

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
get to the rift guardian oh yeah let's

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.160 
get to the rift guardian oh yeah let's
not<00:06:03.670> cherry<00:06:03.940> pick<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:04.180> rift<00:06:04.450> let's<00:06:04.870> just<00:06:05.020> show

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.170 
not cherry pick the rift let's just show

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.740 
not cherry pick the rift let's just show
you<00:06:05.230> guys<00:06:05.500> an<00:06:05.830> actual<00:06:06.460> pretty<00:06:07.030> bad<00:06:07.270> rift<00:06:07.540> so

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
you guys an actual pretty bad rift so

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.210 
you guys an actual pretty bad rift so
you<00:06:07.840> can<00:06:07.990> still<00:06:08.200> see<00:06:08.380> how<00:06:08.500> it<00:06:08.590> goes<00:06:08.740> fast<00:06:09.040> in

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
you can still see how it goes fast in

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.640 
you can still see how it goes fast in
those<00:06:09.400> then<00:06:10.240> the<00:06:10.390> rift<00:06:10.540> garden<00:06:10.870> is<00:06:10.990> is<00:06:11.230> kinda

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
those then the rift garden is is kinda

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.820 
those then the rift garden is is kinda
slow<00:06:11.710> honestly<00:06:12.630> but<00:06:13.630> it's<00:06:13.960> what<00:06:14.200> it's<00:06:14.380> just<00:06:14.710> to

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
slow honestly but it's what it's just to

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.110 
slow honestly but it's what it's just to
get<00:06:14.950> all<00:06:15.070> the<00:06:15.190> movement<00:06:15.520> speed<00:06:15.670> even<00:06:15.940> if<00:06:16.030> the

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
get all the movement speed even if the

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.280 
get all the movement speed even if the
real<00:06:16.270> garden<00:06:16.540> takes<00:06:16.720> maybe<00:06:16.960> like<00:06:17.170> a<00:06:17.260> few

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
real garden takes maybe like a few

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.530 
real garden takes maybe like a few
seconds<00:06:17.920> extra<00:06:18.370> by<00:06:18.910> taking<00:06:19.270> the<00:06:19.360> full

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
seconds extra by taking the full

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.450 
seconds extra by taking the full
movement<00:06:19.720> speeds<00:06:20.080> back<00:06:20.350> you<00:06:20.800> make<00:06:20.980> up<00:06:21.160> for<00:06:21.370> it

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
movement speeds back you make up for it

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.610 
movement speeds back you make up for it
by<00:06:21.610> just<00:06:21.820> clearing<00:06:22.090> your<00:06:22.270> IFFT

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
by just clearing your IFFT

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.600 
by just clearing your IFFT
well<00:06:23.620> I<00:06:23.770> hope<00:06:23.980> you<00:06:24.100> guys<00:06:24.220> learned<00:06:24.490> something

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
well I hope you guys learned something

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.830 
well I hope you guys learned something
and<00:06:25.030> I<00:06:25.150> hope<00:06:25.180> you<00:06:25.390> enjoyed<00:06:25.660> the<00:06:25.810> guide<00:06:25.990> and<00:06:26.230> bye
