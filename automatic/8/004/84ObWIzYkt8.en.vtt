00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.530
 that people cost and well they are 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.020
 welcome here to a year of achievements more 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.119
 about halo 4 already know that we are at 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.529
 full with the achievements of champions goodness 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.990
 and well, you're going to do the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.600
 achievement from the center good this achievement 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.370
 what is good consists in scoring 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.539
 let's say a goal that can not be 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.810
 call like this from a distance 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.710
 approximately 30 meters ok 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.060
 Sincerely, my recommendation is that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.920
 go a little further 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.260
 and let's say the reasons why I press 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.090
 is half played in the matter then 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.530
 it may be necessary to say have a 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.970
 recommended distance 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.010
 now there are three areas where you can 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.560
 do it in a very simple way the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.540
 first left zone center right ok 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.040
 are the three zones that we say more 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.280
 recommended to make this achievement 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.430
 Now this depends a lot on two factors 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.350
 luck and that the enemies are not 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.120
 Ok, this game mode is 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.370
 characterized because once the team 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.620
 Otherwise, have the ball good 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.540
 they dedicate to camp in the area where 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.610
 then the ball is thrown not for 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.470
 recover it there well in the first 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.660
 try left side for me the 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.860
 simplest side is the right side ok 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.750
 this side why I'm here 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.729
 strolling in this moment is the side 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.920
 easier to write down and let's say 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.840
 you have a higher rank there they saw another 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.640
 I try facebook because it hit the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.340
 wall but the point is that this is the 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.509
 most recommended area now what is it 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.360
 most important when trying 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.390
 write down ok to start pointing a 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.040
 little bit higher than the indicated area be 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.810
 a slightly higher distance from the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.970
 indicated so that for you 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.290
 can easily score the ball there 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.120
 it happened again 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.300
 it was nothing fun they were going three attempts 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.060
 face to make that annotation 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.580
 now how do I tell you to jump that too 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.380
 it's very important they can jump jump and 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.870
 throw it with a little more lift 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.180
 wide than normal for it to fall 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.920
 it's exactly a bit of luck 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.410
 definitely how are you going to see it here 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.250
 is luck and the fact that it 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.080
 have 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.990
 let's say the precision to some extent 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.240
 not then here because you already know luck 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.280
 that are not changing and let's say a little 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.550
 of extra precision not but honestly 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.890
 it's easy once you no longer search is the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.090
 achievement as such ok well then I hope 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.680
 that this little one that has served you 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.030
 from the center 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.980
 remember to give likes you liked 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.959
 share it with your friends and follow me on 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.970
 social networks here in the description already 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.800
 they know that any 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.209
 no doubt I answer it for comments or 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.340
 by facebook and good but that has been 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.340
 all see you next and bye
