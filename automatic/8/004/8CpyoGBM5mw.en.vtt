 the rest of bronze the worst I do not know what it is 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760
 the worst 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.490
 to think that it will be robbed beyond the dressing room 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:21.960
 of a crime and leave it in place in 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.670
 components does not have to go through all the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.560
 channel to look for the lauros left the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.429
 keys generally also took the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.429
 guys I know how many 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.100
 was the lawyer unleashed in houses where 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:45.859
 the night was very big 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.859
 and also asked favorite game 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.270
 fun good this obviously the part 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.760
 out there because I 'm not committed 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.990
 then it does not hurt me but well 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.990
 it seems that it is in something 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:22.459
 very bad 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:31.680
 it's clear but you can see it after 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:35.210
 the perfect nothing was to prohibit 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.520
 also said the uruguay the nice game 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.150
 god if you do not get angry your boyfriend couple 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.150
 it was initial 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.540
 I am what would be the problem 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.960
 If you are not in a couple there is no 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.220
 problem of playing or is to play 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:59.180
 Caterpillar with the cat yesterday was an attempt 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.860
 but it would be good with time and for a 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.810
 point but if the issue is that is the 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.610
 head of the cat does not enter below 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.350
 when we have to shoot, not really 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.650
 you have to reach a body to ground more 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.650
 high 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.430
 in the capitanas we are knowing a 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.500
 little bit more also through time 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.390
 and of course throughout all this 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.620
 fourth generation of dance and no dance 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.480
