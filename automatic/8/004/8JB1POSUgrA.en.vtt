 a tool that I love so much and not 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.510
 that I wouldn't trade it like this 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.670
 for depilation from lady caramel 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.340
 I'm really very very his 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.290
 I like to try different creams for 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.480
 depilation anyway come back to this 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.180
 cream because for me it's perfect 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.460
 he removes hair well he slows down 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.880
 hair growth while not annoying 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.870
 skin of a leg after this cream looks 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.870
 just gorgeous super moisturized skin 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.689
 thing i really advise you this 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.899
 exactly cream he is awesome low 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.429
 great value for money 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.579
 My second masthev is such 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:15.340
 argan oil from van concept i have it 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.219
 just adore and really this for 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.310
 I was a godsend from this product I 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.020
 now I can not do either 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.299
 first she is really very good 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.619
 moisturizes hair gives shine to hair 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.490
 nourishes hair 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:33.670
 protect the tips in general super thing on 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.740
 our after every shampoo on 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.139
 tip a larger amount 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.849
 and then the remains distributed along it 

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:42.389
 quickly absorbed but not fat hair 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:45.069
 while working on all 100 

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:48.520
 I advise the only thing of course it is expensive 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.329
 but she really is worth it one more 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.639
 my masthead 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.159
 This here is here means biphasic 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:56.079
 lotion two in one for up makeup from 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.430
 Faberlik I used to use 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.620
 with 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.080
 place in phase from garnier when 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.210
 I tried this tool then moved 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.490
 it is not at him first she is a little 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.100
 cheaper than garnier remedy 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.380
 work is also the only thing if you 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.190
 very resistant mascara the first time it is 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:18.000
 the tool does not cope with the task I wash off 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.280
 up to this mascara but i like it like that 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.110
 lotion works i like only con 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.330
 washes makeup 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.310
 I like the fact that there is no greasy film and 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.280
 the fact that it does not irritate the eyes therefore 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.920
 for me this is a super thing a super find and 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.050
 really my masthead 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.530
 another remedy is such a varnish 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.430
 for nails from Riga and I really love these 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.220
 little ones 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.260
 and what papers I have not tried it all 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.440
 come back and we roll the little ones ebb 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.190
 it's a 454 shade 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.680
 nails also i love 457 shade 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.630
 he's so dark plum but you i can't 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.610
 to show you because to me now it 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.430
 there is no availability and it is the fastest 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.470
 ends with regards to these varnishes 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.989
 they have excellent stamina 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.120
 they are applied in one layer like this two 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.170
 the layers are very good and the first cheekbones 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.180
 appears somewhere on the fifth day but it 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.799
 despite the fact that I clean the dishes in 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.110
 apartment is generally for me 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.450
 really mast hev for me this 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.360
 the best likes, but they are not expensive 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.489
 absolutely very low cost but with 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.190
 This awesome quality and they have very 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.080
 large color palette so every 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.840
 can find exactly what he likes 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.940
 and the last mast hev this here such 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.880
 fragrance water from gerlen small 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.570
 black dress I have it for almost a year and 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.190
 the most interesting thing is that I have a lot 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.290
 perfume in dedsek but i don't care 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.950
 I return to this fragrance 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.250
 him in love 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.980
 8 really fell in love and this is the best 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.040
 my scent is cold 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.890
 gamma but I just like those flavors he 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.709
 mysterious air is revealed in 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.540

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.150
