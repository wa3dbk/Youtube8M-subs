00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.110
 and hello to all and not everyone 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.170
 found today with fishing the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.029
 potato is the fucking banana and yes 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.050
 so today we find ourselves on 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.600
 the chain of the rage team for the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.150
 presentation of a new player of the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.390
 team rage or rather should say 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.750
 players and eight players and players 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.009
 with a s and yes because for the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.750
 first time and in my opinion it's a 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.600
 world first also since it is the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.760
 first time that triplets here are 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.800
 triplets one of the binoculars his two bullets 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.290
 enough triplets and these are three 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.489
 ladies who will join the team 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.070
 rage it is about riri fifi and loulou 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.739
 So here I present you rage riri 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.469
 fifi and rage loulou who will integrate 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.570
 so today the team rage with this 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.859
 beautiful performance that takes place on 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.170
 strike zone on call of duty ghost which 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.320
 is simply you are going to see so 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.430
 a fucking massacre of over 200 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.080
 he has the remington r5 in hardcore 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.450
 so you 'll understand my joke 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.680
 of course of course I'm sorry he 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.000
 must say that I am a little caught 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.360
 short since I'm taking care of my 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.240
 children 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.340
 and it's true that recently I 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.930
 presented members without making them 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.060
 little shot of I smash your nickname 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.040
 is so suddenly you have me a little 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.329
 little wanted so here I tried fast 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.470
 it's true that usually take a 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.759
 little time to think there 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.100
 I did not necessarily have too much time 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.170
 I just had time to comment on 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.759
 gameplay so you will have understood no 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.860
 it's not about treating I'm 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.740
 sorry and yes I know here you are 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.149
 already say super ah triplets nabila 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.399
 in the rage team it's going to be huge 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.960
 faith how tahri and company no no 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.079
 perverse non- salesman it's all about 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.149
 simply mister trickster so here 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.549
 yarn for sure I promise you this is 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.920
 his nickname is sir filou here 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.320
 anyway his username all by himself 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.990
 is already a big joke 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.030
 here 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.320
 poor he feels not eat well listening 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.479
 you wanted to join the rage team it's 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.250
 like that it's always like that they our 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.899
 present quantities and ben they make you 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.730
 a little misery but hey it's 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.840
 no problem you can give me the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.970
 Coin currency there are no worries 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.170
 so if you see the gameplay that is 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.489
 cut is simply because the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.880
 gameplay as you know on ghost 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.950
 there is no no two 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.870
 there is no maximum time 1 10 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.060
 minutes and so it's the parties 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.540
 can last 15 20 minutes so there 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.060
 clearly he was playing so with a team 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.530
 ultimate performance performance especially 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.860
 a team supports so that is to say that 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.769
 there were his allies who he is 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.760
 more or less in the in the game for 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.560
 spy on him 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.970
 so suddenly the game down they did a 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.650
 little bit hard and suddenly it lasts and I 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.790
 believe 15 20 minutes 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.380
 so suddenly I told him listen do 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.069
 me a digest of really what is 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.019
 Most important 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.160
 so that's why his cut and 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.049
 we put you really the most important 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.269
 the most intense though all gameplay 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.530
 very intense but that's it reduced that 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.019
 gameplay and I think that's a lot 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.370
 more pleasant to watch 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.709
 when we do like it's a digest of 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.470
 gameplay there's nothing to hide from any 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.940
 way the gameplay we have it all 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.370
 anyway I think I'm hyper 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.739
 known for that the slightest bit is very 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.090
 well it equals direct excluded from rabies 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.760
 without even discussing 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.690
 here they know they are warned 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.550
 I said so do not play so here is 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.480
 it was just a little aside but 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.440
 it is true that you ask me the 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.830
 question there and was pleased 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.080
 to have that credibility that's at least 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.420
 that's it it's rewarding my work and 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.590
 then my righteousness so that's nice of 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.130
 your part to make me fully 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.870
 trust 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.610
 so that's like I said mr philo 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.980
 which will simply achieve a 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.280
 sacred performance since it will be 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.890
 you will see a triple case m 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.610
 triple still loved friends in 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.100
 hardcore and a more than 200 they in 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.570
 have the talent then supposedly art 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.220
 checked since because he did it 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.360
 now it may be a month or so 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.530
 finally it's been a while now 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.630
 when he did it was a 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.030
 world first so all that feels the metra 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.750
 in the title if it's still confirmed 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.950
 that it's a wafer always of course 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.090
 with attention ie we can 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.380
 very well be it's in wafers the 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.150
 girls will unfortunately we have not seen 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.560
 this video that could hang out on a 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.239
 other youtube site other a brief 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.580
 but apparently good on a golfer of 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.160
 anyway considering the score that I do 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.230
 think that if he is beaten he will not be 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.800
 beaten 15 times because it's very very 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.250
 big hard perf difficult to do 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.500
 still 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.760
 even if he has support he must not 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.009
 to believe people is a very big 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.180
 organization and 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.650
 here are two stations you can 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.419

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.009
 cardboard a little bit we are really 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.659

 fast with or a commentary stowed in 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.990
 90% of cases 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.270

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.099
