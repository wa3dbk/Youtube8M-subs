00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.480
 attempt to climb the mountain but now hundreds 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.700
 under the microphone Andrei said that his 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.340
 size you 41 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.740
 and here are these mounts they are still 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.710
 a little bit free for him about 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:23.519
 the same boots as mine here in general 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:33.390
 then maybe we chose a mountain which 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:35.809
 can only be overcome sideways here 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.809
 burando 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.690
 but surely I agree m what else on 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.780
 skiing must be able to walk maybe we 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.380
 not such a staff and but in general it is on 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.580
 winter hunting we go skiing constantly 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.550
 your not a big mistake now 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.170
 the address of his ski did not suggest that it does not matter 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.409
 what shoe size do you have because 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.840
 not only this site is regulated 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.600
 yes and this playground is also regulated 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.350
 that is, we can safely take off to 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:32.780
 pad and already well roughly here 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:39.640
 here's a stick though and in general it will be 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:41.659
 work already on a small shoe size 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.940
 now just a second to type 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.000
 a bit uncomfortable 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.750
 where is she here here she is all 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.600
 accordingly we have 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.310
 decreased size I will now rearrange 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.880
 under your size under 43 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.950
 I made her do a little story but 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.540
 and output on and such a kind of last test 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.299
 the manufacturer says it is some kind of 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.299
 nano-coating will work after 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.239
 contact somewhere two kilometers I am so 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.650
 I understand chiffonier that nanocoating because 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.190
 that as I said a man who 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.829
 attended 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.900
 finland factory this is a nano coating 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:22.430
 which allows you to not slip applied 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.489
 just brush good finals here by 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.090
 about slipping and I can say that 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.799
 slip like cross-country skiing although itâ€™s the same 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.070
 coating used on cross-country skiing 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.650
 same company but me as a person 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.989
 who moves in the forest in the field 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.989
 tantra full bunny or like a hoof 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.600
 in the forest no speed is particularly needed for 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.690
 I am the main rollback I do not know what will happen 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.579
 after there 2 4 kilometers can better not 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.859
 will go but let's say this is how they are now 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.019
 go it suits me a little descent 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.239
 and now I try to move out well, that was 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.810
 I understand how they go 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.810
 that is to rise 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:22.930
 Well, nothing so special there 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:26.860
 smooth descent but no longer needed with 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.530
 connectors and snow, too, not everyone will 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.480
 useful but try accordingly 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.480
 climb next to your path 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:42.659
 the snow is deep enough well, that's probably 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.870
 my elevation angle here does not allow 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.870
 do this 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.830
 although 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.830
 little by little I think it's possible 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:14.970
 anyway it's problematic by the way my weight 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:17.180
 along with weapons and warm suit 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:23.030
 winter about 93 kilograms 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:26.790
 These skis they absolutely normally holds 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:32.450
 in its wake I climb absolutely 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:37.250
 quietly Well Well, so accordingly 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:43.050
 Here are my kilos which I think 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:47.160
 comfortable well let's not say so last 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:51.870
 my conclusion is probably I am pretty skiing they 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.630
 very light very maneuverable I never 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.680
 for today's hunt I did not roll back 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.410
 thought a couple of times 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.980
 but it's my legs tangled when 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.520
 fall on its side to mount itself 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.850
 come unfastened in general is also convenient 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.130
 the next if urgently needed 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.640
 somewhere to support somewhere get up this 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.250
 happens very quickly all you ran 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.400
 that is, there is no hemorrhoids 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.690
 so this is my subjective opinion on 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.920
 about the quality of these skis they are to me 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.120
 if someone liked my information 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.800
 I will be useful, I will be glad 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.990
 thank you all 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.990
 neither fluff nor feather of a good hunt
