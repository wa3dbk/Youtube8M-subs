00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
kick right there but the way about that

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.889 
kick right there but the way about that
one<00:00:49.770> jump<00:00:50.399> onto<00:00:50.640> number<00:00:50.730> free<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> number

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
one jump onto number free so a number

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.709 
one jump onto number free so a number
free<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.590> here<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.280> very<00:00:53.640> unusual<00:00:53.879> clip

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
free right here is a very unusual clip

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.020 
free right here is a very unusual clip
you<00:00:54.899> not<00:00:55.800> really<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.579> every<00:00:56.789> day<00:00:56.940> are<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
you not really see every day are you

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.619 
you not really see every day are you
well<00:00:57.840> things<00:00:58.770> I'm<00:00:58.920> demolition<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.969> think

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
well things I'm demolition and I think

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.299 
well things I'm demolition and I think
this<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.930> potentially<00:01:01.260> glitch<00:01:01.800> I'm<00:01:02.129> not

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
this is potentially glitch I'm not

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.210 
this is potentially glitch I'm not
really<00:01:02.460> sure<00:01:02.809> it<00:01:03.809> looks<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.260> because<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
really sure it looks like it because the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.340 
really sure it looks like it because the
way<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.549> guy<00:01:05.729> did<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.270> his<00:01:06.960> point<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.290> view

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
way the guy did it is his point of view

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.340 
way the guy did it is his point of view
our<00:01:07.619> planning<00:01:08.150> probably<00:01:09.150> try<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.900> out<00:01:09.930> see

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
our planning probably try that out see

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.140 
our planning probably try that out see
if<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.560> works<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.100> same<00:01:11.130> invincible<00:01:12.000> push

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
if it works the same invincible push

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.820 
if it works the same invincible push
something<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.750> don't<00:01:13.320> know<00:01:13.380> but<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.590> looks<00:01:13.619> like

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
something I don't know but it looks like

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.670 
something I don't know but it looks like
him<00:01:14.130> because<00:01:14.310> skills<00:01:15.180> do<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.390> proper<00:01:16.350> failed

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
him because skills do you proper failed

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.770 
him because skills do you proper failed
that<00:01:17.340> shoulda<00:01:17.580> going<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:17.970> them<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.390> birds<00:01:18.600> I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
that shoulda going all them for birds I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.179 
that shoulda going all them for birds I

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
show his head that should are going on

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.340 
show his head that should are going on
professor<00:01:20.369> sure<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.880> go<00:01:21.000> him<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.689> then<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.049> hard

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
professor sure to go him but then I hard

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.590 
professor sure to go him but then I hard
and<00:01:22.500> again<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> called<00:01:23.640> geologic

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
and again this is called geologic

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.800 
and again this is called geologic
obviously<00:01:25.049> black<00:01:25.650> ops<00:01:25.799> 2<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.250> win<00:01:26.720> so<00:01:27.720> as

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
obviously black ops 2 for the win so as

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.940 
obviously black ops 2 for the win so as
you<00:01:27.869> see<00:01:28.049> why<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.500> turned<00:01:28.680> his<00:01:28.799> body

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
you see why they just turned his body

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.600 
you see why they just turned his body
off<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.640> um<00:01:29.939> around<00:01:30.659> and

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
off a um around and

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.560 
off a um around and
he<00:01:32.270> was<00:01:32.450> invincible<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:35.060> jumping<00:01:35.390> in<00:01:35.540> right

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
he was invincible so jumping in right

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.020 
he was invincible so jumping in right
into<00:01:35.870> second<00:01:36.380> clip<00:01:36.620> and<00:01:36.860> this<00:01:37.520> one<00:01:37.760> actually

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
into second clip and this one actually

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.290 
into second clip and this one actually
made<00:01:38.480> me<00:01:38.630> laugh<00:01:38.660> a<00:01:39.020> bit<00:01:39.050> I<00:01:39.860> kind<00:01:40.550> of<00:01:40.700> watched<00:01:41.120> a
