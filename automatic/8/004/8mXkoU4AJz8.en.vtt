00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
one two those what I did was I did this

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.120 
one two those what I did was I did this
one<00:02:11.659> first<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:12.340> pulled<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.459> back

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
one first I pulled that back

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
lift it up and then I got this one

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.820 
lift it up and then I got this one
undone<00:02:16.970> then<00:02:17.970> after<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.360> do<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:19.530> guy

you<00:03:10.440> have<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.650> apart<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.100> you'll<00:03:11.220> need<00:03:11.340> to

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
you have it apart so you'll need to

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.750 
you have it apart so you'll need to
worry<00:03:11.550> about<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.740> this<00:03:13.740> will<00:03:14.040> more<00:03:14.700> than

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
worry about it and this will more than

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.720 
worry about it and this will more than
likely<00:03:14.940> at<00:03:15.390> least<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.660> happened<00:03:15.960> with<00:03:16.050> me

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
likely at least it happened with me

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.370 
likely at least it happened with me
you'll<00:03:17.730> take<00:03:17.940> whenever<00:03:18.900> you're<00:03:19.050> flipping

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
you'll take whenever you're flipping

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.130 
you'll take whenever you're flipping
this<00:03:19.440> around<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.920> stuff<00:03:20.690> this<00:03:21.690> might<00:03:21.960> come

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
this around and stuff this might come

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.800 
this around and stuff this might come
undone<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:23.310> might<00:03:23.550> move<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.970> little<00:03:24.180> bit<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:24.750> you

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
undone it might move a little bit so you

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.510 
undone it might move a little bit so you
whenever<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.590> have<00:03:25.710> it<00:03:25.740> back<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.160> vehicle

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
whenever you have it back in the vehicle

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.670 
whenever you have it back in the vehicle
use<00:03:26.790> your<00:03:26.970> adjuster<00:03:27.480> your<00:03:27.750> display<00:03:28.140> go<00:03:28.290> up<00:03:28.500> and

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
use your adjuster your display go up and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.810 
use your adjuster your display go up and
down<00:03:28.830> so<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.070> adjust<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:31.250> but<00:03:32.250> yeah<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.670> mean

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
down so you adjust it but yeah I mean

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.310 
down so you adjust it but yeah I mean
after<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.240> get<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.510> all<00:03:33.690> done<00:03:33.720> you're<00:03:34.290> not

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
after you get that all done you're not

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.590 
after you get that all done you're not
it's<00:03:34.740> pretty<00:03:35.250> much<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:36.000> put<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.270> all<00:03:36.420> back

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
it's pretty much it you put it all back

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.320 
it's pretty much it you put it all back
together<00:03:37.100> like<00:03:38.100> just<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.000> way<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.150> took<00:03:39.270> it

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
together like just the way you took it

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.430 
together like just the way you took it
off<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.870> you're<00:03:40.530> done

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
off and you're done

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.920 
off and you're done
just<00:03:43.440> remember<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.400> already<00:03:45.300> had<00:03:45.510> mine<00:03:45.720> back
