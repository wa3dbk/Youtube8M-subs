00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.590
 hello to all of you I hope that 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.150
 you're fine then today we get 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.710
 found for a special makeup 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.690
 halloween 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.420
 I decided to make you a makeup 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.400
 a dead and mexicana or better known as 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.980
 the gasconne cabbage so here I have 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.019
 offered a little germanize makeup 1 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.800
 I've never done it yet so it's okay 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.730
 to be in my side for me I hope the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.460
 succeed 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.010
 I do not really have a great palette of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.840
 qualities to make makeups 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.540
 halloween or makeup always 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.320
 a good slip is already better than 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.700
 nothing we will say but it's not the top 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.260
 I hope to manage with that try 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.329
 to do something right when 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.680
 even because white paint level 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.910

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.829
