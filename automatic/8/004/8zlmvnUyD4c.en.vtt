if<00:00:04.350> you<00:00:04.440> get<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.650> lot<00:00:04.920> from<00:00:05.130> our<00:00:05.310> customers<00:00:06.350> they

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
if you get a lot from our customers they

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.070 
if you get a lot from our customers they
want<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.770> know<00:00:07.980> when<00:00:08.760> they<00:00:08.970> install<00:00:09.660> an

in order for the bike to function
properly<00:00:33.290> when<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.320> take<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.710> stock<00:00:34.890> exhaust

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100

off<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.760> stock<00:00:36.000> exhaust<00:00:36.149> has<00:00:36.719> usually<00:00:37.710> a

some<00:00:43.680> sort<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:45.079> baffle<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.440> they're<00:00:46.710> very

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
some sort of baffle it's they're very

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.799 
some sort of baffle it's they're very
very<00:00:47.100> restricted<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> really

they<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.360> whole<00:00:51.629> lot<00:00:51.809> of

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
they don't have to have a whole lot of

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.380 
they don't have to have a whole lot of

air fuel and historically the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.720 
air fuel and historically the
manufacturers<00:00:58.980> would<00:00:59.129> make<00:00:59.340> these<00:00:59.489> bikes

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
manufacturers would make these bikes

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.760 
manufacturers would make these bikes
super<00:01:00.359> lean<00:01:00.539> from<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> factory<00:01:01.320> owner<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> get

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
super lean from the factory owner to get

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.100 
super lean from the factory owner to get
into<00:01:01.890> pass<00:01:02.070> emissions<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.780> you've<00:01:03.930> noticed

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
into pass emissions so you've noticed

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.719 
into pass emissions so you've noticed
the<00:01:04.290> trend<00:01:04.409> over<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.799> last<00:01:04.920> few<00:01:05.159> years<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.640> got

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the trend over the last few years we got

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.200 
the trend over the last few years we got
bigger<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.240> bigger<00:01:06.299> bikes<00:01:07.790> 1,300<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.970> mean

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
bigger and bigger bikes 1,300 I mean

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.000 
bigger and bigger bikes 1,300 I mean
they<00:01:09.330> went<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:09.720> 750<00:01:10.470> s<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:11.580> 1100<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.869> 1300<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
they went from 750 s to 1100 to 1300 to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.520 
they went from 750 s to 1100 to 1300 to
1800<00:01:14.880> s<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.180> we're<00:01:15.330> looking<00:01:15.420> at<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.409> know

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
1800 s and now we're looking at you know

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.700 
1800 s and now we're looking at you know
we<00:01:16.830> got<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.189> 2300<00:01:18.180> rocket<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.780> mean<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.500> getting

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
we got the 2300 rocket I mean we getting

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.830 
we got the 2300 rocket I mean we getting
bigger<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.009> bigger<00:01:20.070> over<00:01:20.520> forum<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.630> pass

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
bigger and bigger over forum to pass

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.660 
bigger and bigger over forum to pass
emissions<00:01:22.170> they've<00:01:22.979> got<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.369> something

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
emissions they've got to do something

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.370 
emissions they've got to do something
about<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.299> they<00:01:24.840> leave<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> factory

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
about that so they leave the factory

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.510 
about that so they leave the factory
super<00:01:25.920> lean<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.970> get<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:28.159> much<00:01:29.159> motor

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
super lean so they can get as much motor

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.170 
super lean so they can get as much motor
as<00:01:30.180> much<00:01:30.450> performance<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.460> with<00:01:32.460> as

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
as much performance as they can with as

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.660 
as much performance as they can with as
little<00:01:33.420> exhaust<00:01:34.079> emissions<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.430> soon<00:01:35.579> as

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
little exhaust emissions so as soon as

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.130 
little exhaust emissions so as soon as
you<00:01:35.729> take<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.060> restrictive<00:01:36.540> exhaust<00:01:36.659> dose

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
you take that restrictive exhaust dose

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.700 
you take that restrictive exhaust dose
off<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:38.100> are<00:01:39.259> accelerating<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> amount<00:01:40.619> of

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
off you are accelerating the amount of

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.350 
off you are accelerating the amount of
air<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.100> leave<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> bike<00:01:41.610> therefore

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
air that can leave the bike therefore

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.789 
air that can leave the bike therefore
it's<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.720> suck<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.229> little<00:01:43.500> bit<00:01:43.619> more

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
it's going to suck in a little bit more

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.770 
it's going to suck in a little bit more
and<00:01:44.369> you've<00:01:44.820> got<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.180> you've<00:01:45.509> gotta<00:01:45.689> just

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and you've got it you've gotta just

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.469 
and you've got it you've gotta just
airfield<00:01:47.689> if<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.250> slip-on<00:01:50.280> exhaust

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
airfield if you have slip-on exhaust

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.530 
airfield if you have slip-on exhaust
do<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.810> still<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:53.040> starting<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.000> recheck

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
do you still just starting to recheck

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.800 
do you still just starting to recheck
the<00:01:54.750> bike<00:01:55.100> that's<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.250> great<00:01:56.579> question<00:01:57.149> some

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the bike that's a great question some

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.770 
the bike that's a great question some
people<00:01:58.079> say<00:01:58.259> yes<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.530> some<00:01:58.829> people<00:01:59.219> say<00:01:59.369> no

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
people say yes and some people say no
