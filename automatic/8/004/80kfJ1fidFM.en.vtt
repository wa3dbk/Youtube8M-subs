00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.100
 and live 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.380
 if he was winning but he did not either 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.720
 they are not things that happen thanks 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.360
 I call a point the goal is to get to 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.380
 global let's go to the step we are and third 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.380
 and good, we hope it's like that 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.949
 we all saw that a clown was a referee 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.990
 so serious a forgiveness a tie 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.880
 as serious as it is not because whistles 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.800
 alvedro as how is the video that everything 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.120
 he's a clown I think he showed it in 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.390
 all ways it does not cost a party 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.699
 more than 10 cards inhospitable a penalty 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.239
 so clear that everyone saw it only 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.800
 who did not see it 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.350
 the truth that we're going with a 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.059
 feeling of serve that we could make a 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.989
 little more we could win we were able to take us 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.989
 three points but good 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.860
 If we are third parties, well, we are going to 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.050
 work on point with colombia out there 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.399
 with some difference they go to the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.239
 second place but we're fine but 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.239
 we are then also 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.380
 painful because 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.010
 Without a doubt, I work to win because 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.100
 out there the end was very clear 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.570
 so the game the truth that 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.700
 the people that last week 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.740
 they interned to say that in the player there 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.730
 It was also criminal that I could not 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.030
 support is watching there is 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.710
 Well yes the truth that we add 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.410
 adding in this position and it's important 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.330
 in which I had to whistle and 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.060
 eject for the goalkeeper but he did not 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.100
 and he's making a move that he's going to play in 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.470
 against everything that surrounds us that is 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.470
 arbitration and everything else 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.140
 and the point is useful but we had 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.960
 the conviction of you can achieve all three 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.850
 points for me we lost two we 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.560
 we deserved but like I told you and you have to 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.219
 think about what is coming short for 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.289
 big things 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.020
 see you today and we hope 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.090
 continue with the same mystic 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.659
 If quiet thinking and well back 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.659
