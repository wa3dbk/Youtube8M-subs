see<00:00:11.280> fruit<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> sliding<00:00:12.210> door<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:13.370> first<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.549> all

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
see fruit a sliding door so first of all

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.590 
see fruit a sliding door so first of all
we'll<00:00:14.880> start<00:00:14.910> by<00:00:15.330> doing<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:16.910> selecting<00:00:17.910> a

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.599 

texture<00:00:21.600> for<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> type<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:22.949> metal<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
texture for the type of metal in the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.370 
texture for the type of metal in the
filter

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.200 

is<00:00:29.359> that<00:00:30.359> natural<00:00:30.929> tension

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
is that natural tension

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.950 
is that natural tension
well<00:00:32.780> windows<00:00:33.370> at<00:00:34.370> least<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.970> grid<00:00:35.360> size<00:00:35.540> I

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
well windows at least the grid size I

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.700 
well windows at least the grid size I
can<00:00:36.350> think<00:00:36.890> good-sized<00:00:37.640> oh<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.350> is<00:00:39.500> make

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
can think good-sized oh and it is make

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.600 
can think good-sized oh and it is make
brush<00:00:42.130> is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.779 

96<00:00:48.610> by<00:00:49.590> 128

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.340 

so<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:53.750> okay

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.710 

so<00:00:56.770> they're<00:00:56.950> out<00:00:57.040> for<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.250> glass<00:00:57.880> I'll<00:00:58.540> get

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
so they're out for the glass I'll get

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.840 
so they're out for the glass I'll get
back<00:00:58.840> in<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.080> textures<00:00:59.500> and<00:00:59.650> the<00:00:59.710> type<00:01:00.630> yes

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.730 

and<00:01:04.000> I'll<00:01:04.390> choose<00:01:04.809> this<00:01:05.320> one<00:01:05.590> here<00:01:06.180> click<00:01:07.180> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and I'll choose this one here click and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.850 
and I'll choose this one here click and
make<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.979> new<00:01:09.369> brush<00:01:09.610> which<00:01:10.150> has<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:11.140> be<00:01:11.290> smooth

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
make a new brush which has to be smooth

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.219 
make a new brush which has to be smooth
but<00:01:12.220> just<00:01:12.970> copy<00:01:13.299> exactly<00:01:13.840> same<00:01:14.020> things

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
but just copy exactly same things

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.710 
but just copy exactly same things
underneath<00:01:14.710> it<00:01:14.830> so<00:01:15.549> I'm<00:01:15.640> making<00:01:15.850> a<00:01:16.330> brush

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
underneath it so I'm making a brush

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.770 
underneath it so I'm making a brush
which<00:01:17.049> is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.870 

which<00:01:23.780> fits<00:01:24.170> inside<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:24.980> frame<00:01:25.250> like<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.520> so

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
which fits inside the frame like that so

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.720 
which fits inside the frame like that so
it's<00:01:26.030> 64<00:01:26.660> by<00:01:26.840> 96<00:01:28.120> mothers<00:01:29.120> okay<00:01:29.480> Anna<00:01:30.730> and

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
it's 64 by 96 mothers okay Anna and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.460 
it's 64 by 96 mothers okay Anna and
what's<00:01:32.000> happening<00:01:32.390> is<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.930> textures<00:01:33.320> are

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
what's happening is the textures are

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.380 
what's happening is the textures are
colliding<00:01:33.890> like<00:01:34.040> that<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:35.000> what<00:01:35.150> we'll<00:01:35.270> do

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
colliding like that so what we'll do

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.930 
colliding like that so what we'll do
well<00:01:35.570> well<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.260> glass<00:01:36.470> dick<00:01:36.740> glass<00:01:36.770> brush<00:01:37.640> is

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
well well the glass dick glass brush is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.630 
well well the glass dick glass brush is
selected<00:01:38.720> okay<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.110> tools<00:01:39.380> in<00:01:40.160> that<00:01:40.220> click

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
selected okay the tools in that click

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.240 
selected okay the tools in that click
carve<00:01:40.990> like<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.530> what<00:01:42.800> I'll<00:01:42.920> do<00:01:43.100> is

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
carve like that and what I'll do is

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.420 
carve like that and what I'll do is
carve<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.840> metal<00:01:45.260> out<00:01:45.470> of<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.860> door<00:01:46.040> like

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
carve the metal out of the door like

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.980 
carve the metal out of the door like
that

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.660 

as<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.409> see<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
as you can see that

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.820 
as you can see that
but<00:01:52.240> then<00:01:52.390> what<00:01:52.570> happens<00:01:52.930> in<00:01:53.110> game<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.590> the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
but then what happens in game is the

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.040 
but then what happens in game is the
inside<00:01:54.700> of<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.060> glass<00:01:55.240> texture<00:01:55.870> and<00:01:55.990> the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
inside of the glass texture and the

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.010 
inside of the glass texture and the
metal<00:01:56.260> texture<00:01:56.560> collide<00:01:57.310> I<00:01:57.580> think<00:01:57.850> so<00:01:58.659> what<00:01:58.900> we

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
metal texture collide I think so what we

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.140 
metal texture collide I think so what we
would<00:01:59.110> have<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.409> do<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.680> apply<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.310> nose<00:02:00.760> raw

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
would have to do is apply the nose raw

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.410 
would have to do is apply the nose raw
texture<00:02:01.780> on<00:02:02.460> I'll<00:02:03.460> show<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.880> site's<00:02:04.119> no

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
texture on I'll show the site's no

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.630 
texture on I'll show the site's no
typing<00:02:04.840> no<00:02:04.900> drawing

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.840 

and<00:02:10.789> I'll<00:02:11.210> deselect<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.950> classics<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.670> this

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
and I'll deselect the classics of this

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.610 
and I'll deselect the classics of this
just<00:02:14.210> by<00:02:14.330> clicking<00:02:14.510> in<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.750> black<00:02:15.080> area

I changed to label like that sorry
that's<00:02:47.900> enough<00:02:48.500> now<00:02:49.310> detective<00:02:49.790> on<00:02:49.969> collide

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
that's enough now detective on collide

so<00:02:52.849> now<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:53.120> need<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:53.390> do<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.690> apply<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.560> make

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
so now we need to do is apply it to make

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.440 
so now we need to do is apply it to make
it<00:02:54.890> an<00:02:55.040> intensity<00:02:55.640> swell<00:02:56.060> dude

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
it an intensity swell dude

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.780 
it an intensity swell dude

different to mine because only using the
orange<00:03:33.049> box<00:03:33.349> version<00:03:33.590> is<00:03:33.920> pretty<00:03:34.700> much<00:03:34.849> the

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
orange box version is pretty much the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.580 
orange box version is pretty much the
same<00:03:36.129> so<00:03:38.079> at<00:03:39.079> the<00:03:39.650> moment<00:03:40.000> this<00:03:41.000> if<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:42.019> click

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
same so at the moment this if the click

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.369 
same so at the moment this if the click
on<00:03:42.799> move<00:03:43.370> direction<00:03:43.910> which<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.180> here<00:03:44.420> and<00:03:44.629> as

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
on move direction which is here and as

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:46.720 
on move direction which is here and as
you<00:03:45.530> can<00:03:45.560> see<00:03:45.859> it's<00:03:45.980> pointing<00:03:46.400> that<00:03:46.430> way

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
you can see it's pointing that way

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.210 
you can see it's pointing that way
whichever<00:03:47.299> this<00:03:47.569> line<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:47.870> pointing<00:03:48.079> the<00:03:49.010> door

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
whichever this line is pointing the door

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.809 
whichever this line is pointing the door
one<00:03:49.340> room

one room

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.720
