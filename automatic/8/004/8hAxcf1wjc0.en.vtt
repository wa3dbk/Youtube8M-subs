 You already left the first good afternoon of 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.680

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.630
 You guys have a little better crew.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.690
 here tomorrow if I do not know now 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.030
 even though it is the same 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.309
 But look, this is what people look at here 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.890
 quantity of water and going through this 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.860
 forest then a mold, that's it folks 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.890
 You're being trafficked here. 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.930
 simple just you and iron rod and 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.340
 I'll do a bucket normally, I'll go 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.890

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.390
 All right, here comes Booty boot. 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.879
 do the following order here you go 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.790
 make the bucket to get you guys go get 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.520
 in the same way but with how it is done and 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.600
 tsunami in the game is a bit different with 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.509
 hunger 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.869
 you raise the height is not with 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.510
 relation to the sun is greater will be 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.159
 name of where I played that she judges top 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.470
 of that tree so I'm not mistaken 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.270
 It was from this tree that I played 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.090
 That was not like the guys I 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.180
 I threw your support here that you took 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.159
 this whole proportion and it seems to me is what 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.030
 everything indicates that the tsunami will not end 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.460
 Not today 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.250
 But check out guys thing here. 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.369
 epic is really sensational and also 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.939
 we have the bucket to wash the galley if the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.170
 people are likely to do the various 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.020
 two years ago nÃ© 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.689
 the stone depending on where I would like to 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.640
 People, you can see here that 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.220
 it is already forming a tsunami of 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:00.640
 lava and now in an epic meeting encounter 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.560
 epic and go go boy locked beautiful that I 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.659
 I already have both the amount of up to 70 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.009
 km 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.040
 Did you do any on target here? 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:14.260
 at least we'll find out why 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:17.260
 playing a lot now I just see the sky and 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.370
 liver was to take a look 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.099
 Vixi we want to leave here to remember and not 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.189
 join washing your name of the lava the tsunami 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.720
 and it's very interesting you 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.239
 put this motto here along with the mold 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.530
 made several disasters in practice here 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.299
 at once 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.069
 It's funny, it's getting stuck, but this 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.349
 it is not on account of the recording if on account 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.200
 I'll try to distance myself from the game. 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.190
 of these stops to see if it improves 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.290
 a little, right 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.379
 I think you're improving at last. 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.680
 The template was the one 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:53.290
 you catch it is a normal bucket or 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.299
 is nothing more than a bucket of lava and a 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.639
 normal water bucket for you that does not 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.109
 You know how I gave olavo water, just squeeze the 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.400
 right on top of it that you go 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.139
 inform that water 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.420
 in the case of creative feedback then this 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:07.239
 It was why he had not informed yet and 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.609
 so a template was this guys if you guys 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.769
 liked nor a liquid is the favorite 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:16.060

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.680
