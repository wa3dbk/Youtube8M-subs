00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.930
 today's video channel will be about 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.570
 natural beauty oil 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.429
 of our hair, I will not talk about 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.280
 specific oils today I want 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.130
 share with you two approaches to 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.119
 hair care that I opened for 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.800
 yourself this year two ways that not 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.830
 perfectly help and helps to achieve 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.390
 silky healthy and well-groomed hair 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.910
 there is a huge market 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.890
 variety of oils natural prices for 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.989
 hair that are designed to give chic 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.440
 the result on the hair but not all know how 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.520
 use them correctly and often 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.410
 many throw this thing in the middle of it 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.570
 this occupation is better to buy usually 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.059
 any conditioner mask because 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.270
 that the oil is very difficult to remove from the hair and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.039
 then they hang like icicles and say 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.350
 why does she need this oil if she 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.340
 makes hair dirty and ugly if 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.489
 it's very difficult with him 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.400
 for the time being, I also tried 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.240
 make oil masks i was very 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.710
 it's hard to wash the oil out of the hair and then 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.439
 for a while I'm the whole thing 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.229
 abandoned enjoyed only the fact that 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.960
 bought in the store that is already ready 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.790
 conditioners ready masks but then by 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.880
 pure chance I discovered 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.119
 the first way to use oils when 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.630
 I dissolve it in the conditioner and it was 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.170
 very very happy how easy 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 here is washed away oil money from 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.960
 you now have hair oil in pure 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.890
 I don't put on my hair 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.810
 connect them with any cream mask 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.310
 either hair conditioner 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.409
 it is desirable that this air conditioner 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.450
 of course he had a natural composition 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.070
 Now I will show you closer here 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.640
 there must be such an inscription 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.070
 but mineral oil but silicone, that is, you 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.649
 must be sure that this balm 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.990
 no mineral oil no silicone then 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.969
 there are silicones and mineral oil in 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.459
 Composition basis balms will be 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.500
 prevent the penetration of beneficial 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.700
 oils inside the hair 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.040
 which is very important therefore take any 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.410
 natural balsam conditioner or 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.420
 mask and use it as a base I 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.670
 now chose this love 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.260
 the mix organic 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.959
 I will honestly say as usual nutritional 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.850
 mask as stated on the bottle not 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.590
 does not work with hair 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:37.410
 does nothing but in combination with oils 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.230
 working perfectly preparing the mask is very 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.840
 just add balsam as 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.520
 bases about one 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.180
 can two tablespoons depending 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.390
 from the length of your hair and add oil 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.880
 very often I add oil and my 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.590
 pure too about a tablespoon 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.300
 I really like to add argan 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.680
 butter all you know is liquid gold 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.380
 very valuable for our hair and oil 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.930
 macadamia is also a great oil for 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:15.870
 hair supply and mix 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.150
 up to a uniform consistency here too 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.159
 can add essential oils all this on 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.950
 your discretion and see it turns out 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.769
 Here is such a uniform creamy 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.489
 substance that is very easy to apply 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.400
 on hair 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:33.120
 which is easy to wash off the hair and at the same 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.639
 time here contains all those oils 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.670
 which you wanted to put on your hair i 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.569
 I guarantee that this mask will wash off 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.549
 with your hair 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.670
 wonderful but at the same time on their 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.950
 nourishes because all those oils that 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.750
 you wanted to put on your hair by 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.739
 added here just like this I now 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.650
 I use oil for my hair 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.739
 I put this mask on my head 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.319
 dry hair leave on my hair somewhere 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.139
 about 30 minutes per hour and this is basically 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.730
 enough and then I wanted you 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.469
 tell about coconut oil with 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.389
 coconut oil I also could not very 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.489
 I tried to make friends for a long time 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.049
 put on dry hair then seemingly 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.109
 said that it is wet but better 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:23.250
 works right on the wet but the effect is not 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.550
 Much better was obtained and not methoxide 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.070
 pleased therefore I also began to look 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.030
 information how to use oil and 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.909
 Once I decided to put oil on the whole 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.120
 night before morning I turned my head back and realized 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:41.610
 how silky beautiful hair do u 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.099
 It turned out when I applied oil 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:48.030
 a few hours she did not work did not give 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.680
 such a gorgeous result for all 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.599
 but what their professional I probably was 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.870
 somewhere around nine eleven on 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:58.919
 hair and soaked or to that extent 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:02.550
 that my hair was just gorgeous like 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.970
 silk no purchase conditioner 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.930
 so professional some kind of mask 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.759
 rich in silicone 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.220
 make hair like they do 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:16.370
 coconut oil if you have it 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.889
 on hair all night as 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.500
 coconut oil for hair and me bye 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.539
 I use oil from the hut I have a big 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.270
 a jar she had not yet had time to approach 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:29.360
 end a good butter maker even 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.150
 recommend using it for food 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.690
 usability I pour it 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.740
 in a dispenser bottle a few clicks 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.050
 on pump 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.440
 I rub in hands and just like that 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:47.199
 I put it on my hair and then I braid 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.199
 hair in a braid and leave for the whole night 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.599
 waking up in the morning i just wash 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.729
 Any shampoo-free shampoo hair 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:13.509
 which you have availability 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:16.569
 and voila hair look great they 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:19.210
 like silk they are smooth shiny and very 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:21.810
 obedient try using butter 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.490
 in the way I told you 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.560
 I hope that my advice will help to make 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.590
 your hair is even more beautiful 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.719

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.449
