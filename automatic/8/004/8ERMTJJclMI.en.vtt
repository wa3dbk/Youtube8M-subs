00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
we've acid-etched repaired it it's a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.839 
we've acid-etched repaired it it's a
first<00:00:21.619> product<00:00:21.980> we're<00:00:22.099> going<00:00:22.130> to<00:00:22.279> use<00:00:22.429> on<00:00:22.609> here

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
first product we're going to use on here

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.320 
first product we're going to use on here
is<00:00:23.000> the<00:00:23.449> thin<00:00:23.859> 5001<00:00:24.859> primer<00:00:25.250> and<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:26.029> reason

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
is the thin 5001 primer and the reason

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.390 
is the thin 5001 primer and the reason
why<00:00:26.449> we're<00:00:26.660> using<00:00:26.869> this<00:00:27.080> is<00:00:27.289> it's<00:00:27.740> very<00:00:27.830> thin

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
why we're using this is it's very thin

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.189 
why we're using this is it's very thin
and<00:00:28.429> it<00:00:28.669> seals<00:00:28.939> off<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:29.179> concrete<00:00:29.779> it<00:00:29.960> pulls

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
and it seals off the concrete it pulls

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.440 
and it seals off the concrete it pulls
any<00:00:30.410> moisture<00:00:30.890> out<00:00:31.070> of<00:00:31.099> the<00:00:31.249> concrete<00:00:31.609> and<00:00:31.880> or

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
any moisture out of the concrete and or

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.990 
any moisture out of the concrete and or
surface<00:00:32.809> and<00:00:32.989> brings<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.039> air<00:00:34.190> out<00:00:34.399> this

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
surface and brings the air out this

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.369 
surface and brings the air out this
stabilizes<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:35.660> product<00:00:35.989> so<00:00:36.110> when<00:00:36.200> we<00:00:36.289> go

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
stabilizes the product so when we go

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.040 
stabilizes the product so when we go
back<00:00:36.410> on<00:00:36.829> with<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:37.039> 5001<00:00:37.940> thick<00:00:38.239> then<00:00:38.899> we've

back on with the 5001 thick then we've

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.319 
back on with the 5001 thick then we've
got<00:00:39.230> a<00:00:39.260> good<00:00:39.469> bond<00:00:39.680> coat<00:00:39.949> to<00:00:40.129> go<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:41.030> what

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.080 
primer and actually cut in along this
edge<00:01:39.439> through<00:01:39.710> here<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.640> way<00:01:40.759> we<00:01:40.909> make

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
edge through here so that way we make

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.060 
edge through here so that way we make
sure<00:01:41.119> we<00:01:41.360> get<00:01:41.479> good<00:01:41.540> penetration<00:01:42.470> if<00:01:42.860> there's

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
sure we get good penetration if there's

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.950 
sure we get good penetration if there's
any<00:01:43.189> holes<00:01:43.430> we<00:01:44.000> can<00:01:44.149> work<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.420> in<00:01:44.540> with<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.719> brush

any holes we can work it in with a brush

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.539 
any holes we can work it in with a brush
and<00:01:45.170> then<00:01:45.469> after<00:01:45.710> that<00:01:45.799> we<00:01:45.950> actually<00:01:46.280> go<00:01:46.399> over

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
and then after that we actually go over

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.010 
and then after that we actually go over
it<00:01:46.610> again<00:01:46.640> with<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:46.909> roller<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:47.299> make<00:01:47.540> sure<00:01:47.810> that

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.150 
don't get to them right then and there
now<00:02:56.959> one<00:02:57.110> of<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.260> tricks<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.530> we<00:02:57.680> used<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:58.010> do

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
now one of the tricks that we used to do

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.039 
now one of the tricks that we used to do
with<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.549> we<00:02:58.700> just<00:02:58.880> use<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.120> rope<00:02:59.269> a<00:02:59.540> roller

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
with is we just use the rope a roller

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.720 
with is we just use the rope a roller
cover<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:00.560> we<00:03:00.680> take<00:03:00.860> duct<00:03:01.099> tape<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.519> put<00:03:01.700> it

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
cover and we take duct tape and put it

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.729 
cover and we take duct tape and put it
around<00:03:01.849> this<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.630> put<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.840> on<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.019> on<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.349> pole

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
around this and put it on it on a pole

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.380 
around this and put it on it on a pole
and<00:03:03.980> as<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.519> see<00:03:04.730> them<00:03:04.849> you<00:03:04.970> can<00:03:05.120> take<00:03:05.269> and

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
and as you see them you can take and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.300 
and as you see them you can take and
roll<00:03:05.480> over<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:05.870> don't<00:03:06.140> use<00:03:06.319> a<00:03:06.349> cover<00:03:06.650> just<00:03:06.950> use

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
roll over and don't use a cover just use

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.220 
roll over and don't use a cover just use
this<00:03:07.549> roller<00:03:07.849> then<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.630> just<00:03:08.780> roll<00:03:08.900> over<00:03:08.959> the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
this roller then you just roll over the

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.110 
this roller then you just roll over the
top<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.620> them<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:10.010> it'll<00:03:10.519> break<00:03:10.670> them<00:03:10.849> up<00:03:10.970> for

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
top of them and it'll break them up for

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.820 
top of them and it'll break them up for
you<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.540> can<00:03:11.810> do<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.200> while<00:03:12.470> it's<00:03:12.650> still

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
you and you can do that while it's still

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.699 
you and you can do that while it's still
wet<00:03:13.069> you<00:03:13.310> save<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.060> whole<00:03:14.180> process<00:03:14.709> we've

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
wet you save the whole process we've

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.650 
wet you save the whole process we've
already<00:03:15.860> got<00:03:16.099> the<00:03:16.220> first<00:03:16.400> layer<00:03:16.640> on<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.209> the

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
already got the first layer on and the

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.020 
already got the first layer on and the
second<00:03:17.989> layer<00:03:18.079> this<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.410> our<00:03:18.700> 5001<00:03:19.700> thick

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
second layer this is our 5001 thick

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.330 
second layer this is our 5001 thick
which<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.810> primer<00:03:21.079> of<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.350> base<00:03:21.500> coat<00:03:21.829> and

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
which is the primer of the base coat and

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.160 
which is the primer of the base coat and
you<00:03:23.150> can<00:03:23.299> see<00:03:23.450> where<00:03:23.600> it's<00:03:23.690> nice<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:23.870> shiny

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
you can see where it's nice and shiny

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.780 
you can see where it's nice and shiny
but<00:03:24.440> we<00:03:24.500> still<00:03:24.650> have<00:03:24.799> some<00:03:24.890> imperfections<00:03:25.609> on

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
but we still have some imperfections on

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.699 
but we still have some imperfections on
it<00:03:25.970> there's<00:03:26.450> old<00:03:26.600> bumps<00:03:27.109> and<00:03:27.230> niches<00:03:27.500> stuff

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
it there's old bumps and niches stuff

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.259 
it there's old bumps and niches stuff
like<00:03:27.859> that<00:03:28.040> so<00:03:28.220> anything<00:03:28.640> that's<00:03:28.760> high<00:03:28.940> what

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
like that so anything that's high what

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.940 
like that so anything that's high what
we're<00:03:29.390> going<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.600> do<00:03:29.690> is<00:03:29.780> take<00:03:29.989> a<00:03:30.019> sander<00:03:30.560> and

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
patches where we just come back around

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.610 
patches where we just come back around
and<00:04:08.120> feather<00:04:08.389> those<00:04:08.630> in<00:04:08.870> so<00:04:09.079> that<00:04:09.230> way<00:04:09.380> when<00:04:09.530> we

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
and feather those in so that way when we

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.349 
and feather those in so that way when we
should<00:04:09.799> our<00:04:09.920> product<00:04:10.310> over<00:04:10.609> it<00:04:10.700> then<00:04:11.120> we<00:04:11.269> don't

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
should our product over it then we don't

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.420 
should our product over it then we don't
have<00:04:11.569> to<00:04:11.720> worry<00:04:11.870> about<00:04:12.170> it<00:04:12.319> now<00:04:13.069> already<00:04:13.250> to

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
have to worry about it now already to

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.069 
have to worry about it now already to
start<00:04:13.519> spraying<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.030> product<00:04:14.420> there's<00:04:14.989> a

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
start spraying the product there's a

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.449 
start spraying the product there's a
couple<00:04:15.410> concerns<00:04:15.560> that<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:16.010> need<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.280> think

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
couple concerns that you need to think

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.979 
couple concerns that you need to think
about<00:04:16.579> before<00:04:16.820> you<00:04:17.000> start<00:04:17.060> spraying<00:04:17.570> is<00:04:17.840> that

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
about before you start spraying is that

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.409 
about before you start spraying is that
this<00:04:18.109> is<00:04:18.229> a<00:04:18.260> real<00:04:18.530> heavy<00:04:18.979> viscosity<00:04:19.760> product

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
this is a real heavy viscosity product

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.240 
this is a real heavy viscosity product
we're<00:04:20.780> going<00:04:20.900> out<00:04:21.019> to<00:04:21.139> make<00:04:21.260> sure<00:04:21.320> it's<00:04:21.620> at<00:04:21.739> 90

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
we're going out to make sure it's at 90

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.040 
we're going out to make sure it's at 90
degrees<00:04:22.580> so<00:04:22.970> that<00:04:23.000> it<00:04:23.240> has<00:04:23.450> enough<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:23.900> we<00:04:23.990> can

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
degrees so that it has enough so we can

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.750 
degrees so that it has enough so we can
even<00:04:24.200> get<00:04:24.349> it<00:04:24.440> through<00:04:24.560> the

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
even get it through the

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.390 
even get it through the
the<00:04:25.450> gun<00:04:25.660> were<00:04:25.810> using<00:04:26.080> it<00:04:26.140> has<00:04:26.230> a<00:04:26.260> 45<00:04:26.770> -<00:04:27.040> ratio

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
the gun were using it has a 45 - ratio

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.010 
the gun were using it has a 45 - ratio
piston<00:04:27.940> on<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.210> so<00:04:28.420> that<00:04:28.570> we<00:04:28.660> were<00:04:28.720> able<00:04:28.990> to

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
piston on it so that we were able to

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.290 
piston on it so that we were able to
create<00:04:29.260> a<00:04:29.320> 3000<00:04:29.950> psi<00:04:30.130> at<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.640> tip<00:04:30.850> we're<00:04:31.150> using

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
create a 3000 psi at the tip we're using

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.390 
create a 3000 psi at the tip we're using
a<00:04:31.390> very<00:04:31.630> large<00:04:31.750> tip<00:04:32.230> but<00:04:32.560> when<00:04:32.740> we<00:04:32.860> start<00:04:33.220> to

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
a very large tip but when we start to

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.070 
a very large tip but when we start to
spray<00:04:33.730> you<00:04:34.300> need<00:04:34.480> to<00:04:34.570> make<00:04:34.720> sure<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:34.990> whole

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
spray you need to make sure the whole

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.990 
spray you need to make sure the whole
room<00:04:35.350> is<00:04:35.530> masked<00:04:35.950> off<00:04:36.100> or<00:04:36.310> anything<00:04:36.580> that<00:04:36.790> can

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
room is masked off or anything that can

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.150 
room is masked off or anything that can
possibly<00:04:37.270> get<00:04:37.780> this<00:04:38.140> overspray<00:04:38.770> on<00:04:38.800> because

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
possibly get this overspray on because

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.740 
possibly get this overspray on because
once<00:04:39.310> it<00:04:39.430> gets<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.640> overspray<00:04:40.000> is<00:04:40.120> permanent<00:04:40.600> -

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
once it gets a overspray is permanent -

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.630 
once it gets a overspray is permanent -
so<00:04:41.260> we'll<00:04:41.410> mask<00:04:41.650> off<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.040> room<00:04:42.190> completely

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
so we'll mask off the room completely

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.280 
so we'll mask off the room completely
and<00:04:42.730> then<00:04:42.820> start<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.120> spray<00:04:43.360> when<00:04:43.960> we<00:04:44.080> get<00:04:44.200> the

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
and then start to spray when we get the

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.230 
and then start to spray when we get the
product<00:04:44.650> mix<00:04:44.800> and<00:04:45.010> ready<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.370> go<00:04:45.520> we're<00:04:46.210> going

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
product mix and ready to go we're going

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.300 
product mix and ready to go we're going
to<00:04:46.540> start<00:04:47.050> spring<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:47.680> we're<00:04:47.770> gonna<00:04:47.860> take<00:04:48.100> the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
to start spring and we're gonna take the

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.610 
to start spring and we're gonna take the
top<00:04:48.520> first<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.330> work<00:04:49.720> our<00:04:49.900> way<00:04:50.050> down<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.530> where

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
top first and work our way down to where

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.990 
top first and work our way down to where
the<00:04:50.770> slope<00:04:51.010> of<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.190> ball<00:04:51.340> in<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.550> pool<00:04:51.760> is

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
the slope of the ball in the pool is

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.940 
the slope of the ball in the pool is
we're<00:04:52.570> not<00:04:52.660> gonna<00:04:52.780> be<00:04:52.900> able<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.050> get<00:04:53.170> 35<00:04:53.650> mils

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
we're not gonna be able to get 35 mils

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.800 
we're not gonna be able to get 35 mils
on<00:04:54.100> in<00:04:54.250> one<00:04:54.430> shot<00:04:54.700> so<00:04:55.000> what<00:04:55.150> we<00:04:55.270> need<00:04:55.450> to<00:04:55.540> do<00:04:55.660> is

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
on in one shot so what we need to do is

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.810 
on in one shot so what we need to do is
start<00:04:56.050> at<00:04:56.170> one<00:04:56.320> point<00:04:56.620> work<00:04:57.220> over<00:04:57.490> around<00:04:57.700> the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
start at one point work over around the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.840 
start at one point work over around the
pool<00:04:58.090> possibly<00:04:59.050> two<00:04:59.290> to<00:04:59.500> three<00:05:00.010> times<00:05:00.280> to<00:05:00.700> make

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
pool possibly two to three times to make

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.160 
pool possibly two to three times to make
sure<00:05:00.880> you<00:05:01.240> have<00:05:01.390> enough<00:05:01.600> product<00:05:01.840> on<00:05:02.080> the

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
sure you have enough product on the

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.830 
sure you have enough product on the
walls<00:05:02.410> of<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.160> pool<00:05:03.400> to<00:05:04.330> make<00:05:04.480> sure<00:05:04.630> that<00:05:04.750> we

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
walls of the pool to make sure that we

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.010 
walls of the pool to make sure that we
hit<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.170> 35<00:05:05.620> mils<00:05:05.920> of<00:05:06.190> product<00:05:07.150> once<00:05:07.780> we<00:05:07.930> get

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
hit the 35 mils of product once we get

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.210 
hit the 35 mils of product once we get
that<00:05:08.230> done<00:05:08.290> then<00:05:08.650> what<00:05:08.770> we're<00:05:08.920> gonna<00:05:09.010> do<00:05:09.130> is

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
that done then what we're gonna do is

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.270 
that done then what we're gonna do is
start<00:05:09.460> one<00:05:09.760> in<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:10.000> pool<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:10.450> use<00:05:11.080> one<00:05:11.530> coat

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
start one in the pool and use one coat

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.720 
start one in the pool and use one coat
the<00:05:12.880> 35<00:05:13.360> mils<00:05:13.660> thick<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:14.110> do<00:05:14.380> a<00:05:14.410> flooding<00:05:15.130> so

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
the 35 mils thick and do a flooding so

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.220 
the 35 mils thick and do a flooding so
you<00:05:15.910> just<00:05:16.030> want<00:05:16.240> to<00:05:16.330> keep<00:05:16.420> spraying<00:05:16.810> until

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
you just want to keep spraying until

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.660 
you just want to keep spraying until
where<00:05:17.380> you<00:05:17.500> flood<00:05:17.800> it<00:05:17.830> thick<00:05:18.160> enough<00:05:18.400> to<00:05:18.550> get

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
where you flood it thick enough to get

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.000 
where you flood it thick enough to get
your<00:05:18.790> 35<00:05:19.180> mils<00:05:19.540> and<00:05:20.110> work<00:05:20.290> your<00:05:20.470> way<00:05:20.560> back<00:05:20.770> out

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
your 35 mils and work your way back out

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.040 
your 35 mils and work your way back out
the<00:05:21.220> steps<00:05:21.520> once<00:05:22.240> you're<00:05:22.390> done<00:05:22.480> with<00:05:22.660> that<00:05:22.690> and

seal it off make sure no dust gets in

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.300 
seal it off make sure no dust gets in

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
can get in that pool till this cures off

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.890 
can get in that pool till this cures off
you<00:05:29.890> have<00:05:30.040> a<00:05:30.070> drying<00:05:30.970> time<00:05:31.330> there<00:05:31.570> of<00:05:31.660> about

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
you have a drying time there of about

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.740 
you have a drying time there of about
two<00:05:32.140> hours<00:05:32.880> 45<00:05:33.880> minutes<00:05:33.940> it's<00:05:34.390> pretty<00:05:34.570> well

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
gone with and starting to get tacky but

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.370 
gone with and starting to get tacky but
I<00:05:36.850> prefer<00:05:37.270> to<00:05:37.390> let<00:05:37.510> it<00:05:37.660> go<00:05:37.750> for<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.020> couple<00:05:38.290> hours

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
I prefer to let it go for a couple hours

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.380 
I prefer to let it go for a couple hours
and<00:05:38.740> make<00:05:38.830> sure<00:05:38.980> it's<00:05:39.160> sealed<00:05:39.340> off<00:05:39.610> and<00:05:40.240> then

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
and make sure it's sealed off and then

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.610 
and make sure it's sealed off and then

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
what happens it gets so hard it gets a

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.430 
what happens it gets so hard it gets a

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
nothing's going to stick to that so if

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.130 
nothing's going to stick to that so if
you<00:06:18.640> figure<00:06:18.820> 24<00:06:19.330> hours<00:06:19.600> and<00:06:19.750> in<00:06:19.840> some

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
you figure 24 hours and in some

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.810 
you figure 24 hours and in some
circumstances<00:06:20.800> depend<00:06:21.100> on<00:06:21.250> the<00:06:21.340> humidity<00:06:21.760> and

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
circumstances depend on the humidity and

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
stuff up to 48 hours but if it gets

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.590 
stuff up to 48 hours but if it gets
really<00:06:23.860> hard<00:06:24.040> and<00:06:24.190> glossy<00:06:24.670> then<00:06:25.180> you<00:06:25.330> need<00:06:25.450> to

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
really hard and glossy then you need to

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.450 
really hard and glossy then you need to
resurface<00:06:26.080> it<00:06:26.500> and<00:06:26.680> all<00:06:26.770> we<00:06:26.800> do<00:06:27.010> is<00:06:27.130> just<00:06:27.310> take
