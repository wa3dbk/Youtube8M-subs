00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
I'm going to be showing you how to make

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.599 
I'm going to be showing you how to make
infinite<00:00:17.699> snow<00:00:18.210> or<00:00:18.600> snow<00:00:19.140> ball<00:00:19.460> moving<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
infinite snow or snow ball moving the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.970 
infinite snow or snow ball moving the
snowballs<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.449> then<00:00:22.170> make<00:00:22.350> them<00:00:22.470> its<00:00:22.680> snow

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
snowballs and then make them its snow

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.500 
snowballs and then make them its snow
block<00:00:23.300> I'm<00:00:24.300> thinking<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.810> where<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.080> put<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:26.510> in

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
block I'm thinking of where to put it in

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.310 
block I'm thinking of where to put it in
right<00:00:27.840> here<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:29.939> let<00:00:30.210> me<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.510> take<00:00:31.140> this

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
right here so let me just take this

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.700 
right here so let me just take this
torch<00:00:31.619> out<00:00:31.859> yeah<00:00:32.809> so<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.710> first<00:00:35.100> step<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:36.710> you

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
torch out yeah so the first step is you

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.610 
torch out yeah so the first step is you
just<00:00:37.980> place<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.730> slob<00:00:39.210> down<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> ground

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
just place a slob down for the ground

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.770 
just place a slob down for the ground
and<00:00:41.899> on<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.410> border<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.520> or<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
and on the border of it or not the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.529 
and on the border of it or not the
corners<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:46.829> one<00:00:47.160> side<00:00:47.489> we're<00:00:48.059> going<00:00:48.329> to

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
corners and not one side we're going to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.529 
corners and not one side we're going to
do<00:00:48.750> three<00:00:49.110> high<00:00:51.199> with<00:00:52.199> box<00:00:53.120> with<00:00:54.120> your

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
do three high with box with your

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.049 
do three high with box with your
building<00:00:54.899> material<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.789> it's<00:00:56.789> very

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
building material and it's very

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.729 
building material and it's very
important<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.750> put<00:00:58.020> your<00:00:58.140> slob<00:00:58.440> there

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
important that you put your slob there

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.639 
important that you put your slob there
so<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.460> made<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.820> like<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.510> pattern<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
so I made it like a little pattern the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.119 
so I made it like a little pattern the
slave<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.430> then<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.170> snow<00:01:04.170> golem<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.890> get

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
slave is so then the snow golem can get

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.080 
slave is so then the snow golem can get
out<00:01:05.309> or<00:01:05.700> golem<00:01:06.330> or<00:01:06.510> however<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.290> pronounce<00:01:07.320> it

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
out or golem or however you pronounce it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.789 
out or golem or however you pronounce it
so<00:01:09.500> you<00:01:10.500> put<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.600> roof<00:01:12.600> thing<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.530> snow

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
so you put this roof thing so it snow

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.570 
so you put this roof thing so it snow
golem<00:01:14.460> can't<00:01:15.330> get<00:01:15.689> out<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.220> you<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.250> collect

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
golem can't get out and you can collect

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.450 
golem can't get out and you can collect
it<00:01:18.000> from<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.330> corner<00:01:18.600> there<00:01:19.290> there's<00:01:20.130> snow

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
it from the corner there there's snow

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.539 
it from the corner there there's snow
ever<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.909> stuck<00:01:21.090> there<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:23.159> takes<00:01:23.400> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
ever get stuck there like it takes a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.929 
ever get stuck there like it takes a
while<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.759> me<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.180> pick<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.509> up<00:01:24.630> there<00:01:24.979> but<00:01:25.979> if

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
while for me to pick it up there but if

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.539 
while for me to pick it up there but if
our<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.570> throw<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
our to just throw it in and go to the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.280 
our to just throw it in and go to the
corner<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.170> instantly<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.530> pick<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:32.009> so

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
corner I instantly just pick it up so

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.440 
corner I instantly just pick it up so
I'm<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> put<00:01:35.369> stairs<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> top

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
I'm going to put stairs in the top

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.289 
I'm going to put stairs in the top
because<00:01:37.020> we're<00:01:37.200> basically<00:01:37.560> we're<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.579> we're

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
because we're basically we're just we're

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.200 
because we're basically we're just we're
done<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.659> we're<00:01:40.079> done<00:01:41.509> so<00:01:43.759> we<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:44.970> put

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
done this we're done so we just put

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.219 
done this we're done so we just put
stairs<00:01:45.930> are<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:47.689> put<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:49.020> snow<00:01:49.320> there<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:51.229> the

stairs are and put to snow there and the
pumpkin<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.189> make<00:01:53.430> these<00:01:53.790> mobile<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.619> it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
pumpkin to make these mobile and it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.850 
pumpkin to make these mobile and it
should<00:01:56.310> track<00:01:56.670> snow<00:01:56.909> here<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.540> minute<00:01:57.750> or

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
should track snow here in a minute or

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.570 
should track snow here in a minute or
and<00:01:58.950> there<00:01:59.940> it<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:01.170> what<00:02:01.800> you<00:02:01.920> basically<00:02:02.070> do

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.170 
and there it is so what you basically do
is<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.560> keep<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:05.190> shovel<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.730> this<00:02:06.000> now

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
is you just keep on a shovel in this now

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.180 
is you just keep on a shovel in this now
where's<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> shovel<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:09.320> I<00:02:10.320> forgot<00:02:11.039> to
