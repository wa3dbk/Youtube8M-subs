00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.330
 I from experience and a little too 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.540
 accompanied with information that does not 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.320
 comes from these investigations 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.200
 last ones that have managed to rescue the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.410
 emotions as an important factor in 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.869
 the state of health I tell you that a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.440
 repressed emotion for example is or not 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.770
 cinema for any disease I can you 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.620
 say that there are emotional states that 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.239
 no doubt corresponds in a state 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.149
 physiological and that to be maintained 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.800
 permanently break the balance that 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.660
 is the most sacred word we have 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.149
 towards us our bodies are 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.200
 prepared to register tensions but 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.670
 tensions that are acute non-chronic 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.880
 many of us live in a way 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.830
 exasperating where attention invades 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.620
 our whole body where anxiety 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.870
 it consumes us where it expels us from our 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.180
 area of excellence and today we know those 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.670
 states as well you say you take this in a 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.930
 laboratory you can check what it is 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.490
 the concern for the things that 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.930
 still did not happen in the song that 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.860
 It is not bigger for our body 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.080
 Well, not you as a doctor do not know so much or 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.440
 better than anyone how do we do 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.810
 preserve a patient from avoiding 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.690
 imaginary catastrophes when you want a 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.080
 thing and what you imagine is the worst what 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.620
 it is irritability what is 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.430
 There is fear, fear of feeling the 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.680
 despair next to helplessness today 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.070
 you know the lethal state for 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.870
 body incidios 2 that is not feeling 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.670
 hopelessly helpless and unhappily 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.310
 medicine gives us a lot but also 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.960
 It takes away a lot when it comes to not giving 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.750
 false hopes what they give us is 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.240
 false hopelessness believing that if not 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.220
 they do what they would be doing is 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.500
 accept that people use a 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.600
 crutch to not accept degradation 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.310
 of its biology that's terrible because 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.110
 a person with hope can do 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.020
 something hopeless can not do 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.810
 absolutely nothing then good as 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.140
 working with those states is quite a 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.880
 challenge because if I did not authorize if not 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.160
 we act from the plasticity of 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.530
 brain those neural networks that are 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.770
 contaminated with fear makes the 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.210
 person can not defend 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.890
 We know that the best states for 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.630
 immunity has to do with peace 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.520
 with joy with tranquility 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.040
 because they are messages that the system 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.910
 immunological in a simple language 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.350
 receives from what I want to live when the 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.360
 rest and in state when in my 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.730
 somatic indicators are of malaise 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.430
 where it exacerbated the sympathetic system very 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.870
 little the parasympathetic system the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.330
 messages that the system receives 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.060
 immune is I do not want to live then 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.060
 there in wanting a total incoherence 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.580
 but how does a person do that 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.800
 I was never happy before receiving the 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.600
 diagnosis and now that you get a 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.150
 diagnosis has the perfect excuse 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.040
 to say that he is not feeling well 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.320
 because of what is happening to him but in 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.720
 actually those states were already states 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.200
 addictive anxiety anxiety 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.500
 anguish 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.450
 now it is the challenge to generate a 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.220
 through totalizing plans that 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.470
 change the perception and that the person 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.170
 can experience peace despite what 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.819
 it's happening to him that he can be happy to 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.129
 despite what is happening to him because 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.110
 there is scientific evidence that says that 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.940
 happiness can never be a state 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.310
 reactive that happiness is a state 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.800
 in the endogenous when all the chemicals 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.160
 or those molecules of emotion can flow 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.900
 freely in that network that studies the 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.879
 psycho neuro endocrine immunology 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.269
 so good that's what it's about 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:59.480
 produce that biological counter-attack the 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.670
 tsunami that biological tsunami that has 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.709
 what to do with with I want to live if 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.040
 I really want to live I can do 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.079
 many things to at least perceive 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.110
 what is happening to me in a way 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.420
 significant and allow to give another 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.950
 resignified to what I thought 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.310
 came to ruin my life is not a 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.000
 vision a little more wider but it's 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.000
 healthier 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.730
 ah
