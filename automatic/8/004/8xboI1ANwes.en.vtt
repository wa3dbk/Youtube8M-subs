00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 imagine with just two or three months of 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.879
 pregnancy the moment you get 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.670
 they will start taking the pre classes 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.460
 childbirth is imagining transiting the straight 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.259
 final accompanied by a huge belly and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.719
 the inexplicable sensations of the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.160
 movements of the baby adjusting is 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.080
 look very close to the birth of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.980
 our son with everything they 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.539
 entails 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.460
 joys and fears that coexist 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.859
 contributing one more quota of uncertainty 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.680
 to a moment full of feelings 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.720
 contradictory especially for a mom 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 primeriza that does not know what it is to feel 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.010
 a contraction and how much and how much 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.630
 they can hurt and that is about 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.430
 replace that fear with the idea of 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.450
 Hold your child in arms for the first time 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.580
 time 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.740
 it's more or less like how I approached 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.080
 the first class with the hope of 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.480
 have reassuring answers and 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.150
 Container certainties for that I 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.510
 they were expecting eight matches in which 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.330
 supposed to surpass at least the majority of 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.130
 my doubts the topics will be pre-delivery 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.510
 period of dilatation of the expulsive period 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.260
 rupture of membranes rupture 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.700
 puerperium visits the facilities and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.909
 I need to know about my baby 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.560
 the negative impact was instantaneous to 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.479
 simple view what most called me my 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.490
 attention were some words that 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.679
 never before had he associated with the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.229
 time to have a child period 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:26.530
 expulsive for example it turned out to be 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.619
 repulsive and immediately I thought following 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.539
 that logic the class below 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.000
 should carry the title of expulsion 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.969
 Fortunately they decided to call 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.950
 birth unfortunately again 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.049
 they resumed the cold tendencies and 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.959
 distant and mechanistic with a sad 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.179
 rupture of membranes but I do not want 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:49.119
 that break me nothing is necessary to conjugate 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:52.090
 that verb these eight classes are dictated in 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.880
 continuous cycles then beyond the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.939
 correlativity between them the order with 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.950
 that are taken is randomly marked 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.630
 always marked by the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.709
 incorporation of new parents in each 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.569
 class my first meeting was puerperium 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.020
 but before each talk relaxation and 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.760
 breathing 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.450
 the labor they have to do 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.070
 so crisp sweetly sharp 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.890
 lie on his left side and 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.360
 they breathe it like that they close their eyes like this 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.730
 accustom and when they are doing 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.860
 labor next visits 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.230
 his roommate not 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.550
 deconcentrate unless they are willing 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.680
 to pay the high costs of a 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.719
 single room 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.659
 the sweet voice of the midwife who stops 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:38.030
 many can be a sign of a vocation 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:40.790
 unbreakable to me it sounds bad to me and 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.540
 full of mistrust while breathing 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.590
 I thought I would consider high costs 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.709
 we can pay a room to 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.439
 we alone what scares me most is 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.969
 that my husband can not be with me 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:56.659
 It is also saying that I did not relax 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:03:00.439
 too much after the breaths 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.510
 the parents all sitting together joined me 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.250
 he remembered are in faculty and the idea 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.439
 from having a bank mate to me 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.629
 husband was fun served for 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:11.659
 fantasize and make a couple of jokes between 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:14.120
 us but that cheerful atmosphere 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.359
 she cut herself immediately when the teacher 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.060
 said the dads they believe they take 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:23.209
 that impeccable woman like new but 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.650
 above the reality is that the woman 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.960
 feels like a truck passed by 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.690
 over 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.760
 after such a statement the faces of 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.860
 they all changed their expression in our 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.560
 partner know that during the puerperium 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.930
 It is normal that we spend much of the 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.120
 day anguished and wanting to cry 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.400
 can help unpack a 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.470
 traumatic situation I thought but at the same 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.900
 I had to redouble my efforts 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.140
 to reassure me and visualize me in 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.820
 a future and happy family scene 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.330
 they followed recommendations about the 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.400
 visits that it is better to avoid and about 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.310
 pay attention to the grandmothers who are better 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.040
 avoid and give too much place to 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.510
 friends that are better to avoid 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.700
 issues that sounded nasty to me 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.319
 full of prejudices and 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.030
 generalizations 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.519
 the list of elements that can 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.100
 making us postpartum more enjoyable includes 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.130
 a foam rubber ring to sit and 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.870
 that the points do not throw us 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.020
 immediately asked is practiced in 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.949
 special routine meals not always and 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.150
 when the baby does not exceed 3 kilos 100 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.820
 in this case an episiotomy is done 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.639
 because it's sung that if you do not have a 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.710
 tear I do not remember how many years 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.500
 that evokes that he has his career as 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.120
 midwife but they are many and add my 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.979
 experience tells me that if the baby is 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.560
 more than 3 kilos it is impossible to leave 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.349
 without tearing not satisfied with that 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.699
 answer asked but if we have a 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.590
 4 kilos baby is not because 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.820
 physiologically we are prepared for 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.130
 give birth 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.530
 and you're going to have it but you're going to be all 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.850
 reflected more sad than this phrase 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.130
 were the laughs of the rest of the 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.420
 course participants who never 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.080
 it occurred to them to question the 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:09.460
 procedure and the episiotomy maybe not 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:13.100
 is a more neat delicate retruque if 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.280
 I accept and I add a tear not what 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.690
 future is much more difficult for 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.240
 strengthen the idea that episiotomy 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.530
 is the best thing that can happen to us 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.200
 drawing on the board in which 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.240
 compared the damage of a neat cut and 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.190
 easy to suture with the tear 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.990
 uncontrollable that can put you at risk 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.760
 our integrity 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.560
 my husband's frightening face was 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.410
 instantaneous and from that moment 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.710
 He went on to believe that the best he can 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.140
 to happen is that they cut me neatly and 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.409
 that the idea of ​​my part to do the most 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.939
 possible to avoid it is a whim 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.559
 I guess everyone will have thought 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:50.719
 the same thing because I did ended the debate 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:53.539
 on the need and urgency of the 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:56.360
 point episiotomy for the pair that the 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.159
 midwife who got away with it is 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.869
 resumed with the rest of the things that is 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.089
 convenient to take to the clinic for 

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:04.969
 liven up our by period 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:07.189
 black weight breast aerators 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:09.830
 silicones and creams to be ready 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:12.860
 for when we give of suck and breasts and 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.439
 We spoil the nipples again more 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.509
 Questions arise parallel to the topic 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:19.569
 particular class and the midwife is 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:21.889
 forced to answer about breastfeeding 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:23.869
 after clarifying some questions 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.539
 fundamentals such as the importance of 

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:30.210
 colostrum and not give milk to 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:32.580
 a newborn reflected loudly 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.990
 I'm thinking of giving from the year 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.960
 that comes a course on breastfeeding 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.389
 because here in silver there is nothing but 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.460
 I have to see how I find the way 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.139
 that I am not associated with the subject and 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.520
 have calls at 3 o'clock in the morning 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.860
 mothers who do not know what to do with the 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.889
 tit 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.729
 with the last object of the list is 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:51.729
 class is over 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.460
 what I just read is the story of a 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.680
 anna mother clear 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.720
 visibly upset by his 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.300
 experience in his passage through the course of 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.050
 Obstetric psycho-prophylaxis or course of 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.790
 preparation for childbirth there is more 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.919
 Anaclara is in the radio studio 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.780
 to share with us what 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:13.990
 he lived while he has attended said 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.450
 courses 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.670
 we are in the program that we call you 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.830
 you know and that is the program that connects 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:24.730
 women with their deepest knowing the 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:28.030
 of being mothers we are in fm keops in the 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:30.460
 90.1 of the city of silver- soil 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.650
 urine ribot and next to rosarios perú and a 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.930
 The whole group, you know, we try to 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.060
 spread through this channel and through 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.760
 social networks the new paradigm 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.160
 that says that if we can we are 

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.490
 protagonists that giving birth is our 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.750
 domain that we know how to listen to 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.750
 you know 

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:04.830
 you lie 

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.830
 and more 

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:12.630
 I need to give people
