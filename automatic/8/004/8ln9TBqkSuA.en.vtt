really<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:19.290> handheld<00:02:20.290> gun<00:02:20.620> mode<00:02:22.950> which<00:02:23.950> you

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
really the handheld gun mode which you

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.410 
really the handheld gun mode which you
can<00:02:24.570> do<00:02:25.570> by<00:02:25.990> folding<00:02:26.470> him<00:02:26.680> very<00:02:27.040> simply<00:02:27.520> this

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
can do by folding him very simply this

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.560 
can do by folding him very simply this
way

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
way

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.430 
way
just<00:02:31.570> like<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> regular<00:02:32.020> mini<00:02:32.410> con<00:02:34.140> okay<00:02:35.140> and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
just like a regular mini con okay and

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.600 
just like a regular mini con okay and
then<00:02:36.100> no<00:02:37.030> it's<00:02:37.240> only<00:02:37.390> on<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.710> right<00:02:38.980> arm<00:02:39.310> with

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
then no it's only on the right arm with

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.740 
then no it's only on the right arm with
the<00:02:39.760> mini<00:02:40.090> con<00:02:40.300> pick<00:02:40.600> right<00:02:41.560> forearm<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.490> then

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
the mini con pick right forearm and then

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.330 
the mini con pick right forearm and then
you<00:02:43.750> can<00:02:43.930> do<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.290> Arnold<00:02:44.740> Schwarzenegger

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
you can do the Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.250 
you can do the Arnold Schwarzenegger
Terminator<00:02:46.140> Terminator<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.470> Gatling<00:02:48.340> guns<00:02:49.260> so

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
Terminator Terminator to Gatling guns so

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.360 
Terminator Terminator to Gatling guns so
we<00:02:50.290> need<00:02:50.500> two<00:02:50.650> three<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.980> three

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
we need two three a three

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.300 
we need two three a three
I<00:02:51.640> think<00:02:52.209> -<00:02:52.709> yeah<00:02:53.709> -<00:02:54.100> Terminator<00:02:54.700> 2<00:02:55.770> 0<00:02:56.770> rifle

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
I think - yeah - Terminator 2 0 rifle

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.190 
I think - yeah - Terminator 2 0 rifle
tease<00:02:59.220> the<00:03:00.220> other<00:03:00.400> mode<00:03:00.640> is<00:03:01.120> really<00:03:03.720> his<00:03:04.720> armor

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
tease the other mode is really his armor

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.120 
tease the other mode is really his armor
mode<00:03:06.840> instead<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:08.550> easy<00:03:10.110> just<00:03:11.110> have<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.530> open

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
mode instead of easy just have to open

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.100 
mode instead of easy just have to open
the<00:03:12.600> wings<00:03:13.600> up<00:03:13.840> or<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.500> shoulders<00:03:14.860> up<00:03:15.070> and

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
the wings up or the shoulders up and

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.770 
the wings up or the shoulders up and
just<00:03:17.110> full<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.590> feet<00:03:17.800> upwards<00:03:18.600> cover<00:03:19.600> the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
just full of the feet upwards cover the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.720 
just full of the feet upwards cover the
head<00:03:20.130> like<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.950> official<00:03:24.280> mode<00:03:24.459> is<00:03:24.700> really

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
head like so the official mode is really

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.060 
head like so the official mode is really
just<00:03:25.630> like<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:28.690> kind<00:03:29.110> of<00:03:29.230> looks<00:03:29.470> corny

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
just like this it kind of looks corny

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.660 
just like this it kind of looks corny
there<00:03:30.430> is<00:03:30.550> a<00:03:30.580> peg<00:03:30.880> which<00:03:31.600> folds<00:03:32.110> in<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.350> out<00:03:32.670> on

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
there is a peg which folds in and out on

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.759 
there is a peg which folds in and out on
the<00:03:33.910> chest<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.750> forgot<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.410> fold<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.739> down

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
the chest and I forgot to fold it down

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.479 
the chest and I forgot to fold it down
in<00:03:36.310> robot<00:03:36.670> mode<00:03:36.959> but<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.860> looks<00:03:39.100> kind<00:03:39.489> of<00:03:39.610> corny

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
in robot mode but it looks kind of corny

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.520 
in robot mode but it looks kind of corny
yeah<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:42.940> think<00:03:43.360> it's<00:03:43.660> best<00:03:43.840> if<00:03:43.959> you<00:03:44.080> just<00:03:44.110> fold

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
yeah I think it's best if you just fold

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.170 
yeah I think it's best if you just fold
the<00:03:44.680> wings<00:03:44.860> a<00:03:45.010> bit<00:03:45.190> or<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.519> shoulders<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:45.940> bit

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
the wings a bit or the shoulders a bit

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.060 
the wings a bit or the shoulders a bit
and<00:03:46.360> then<00:03:46.480> point<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.989> gun<00:03:47.200> forward<00:03:47.530> at<00:03:47.830> least

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
and then point the gun forward at least

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.490 
and then point the gun forward at least
that<00:03:48.250> makes<00:03:48.580> a<00:03:48.700> little<00:03:48.820> bit<00:03:48.940> more<00:03:49.030> sense<00:03:49.510> but

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
that makes a little bit more sense but

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.880 
that makes a little bit more sense but
he's<00:03:50.709> had<00:03:50.860> he<00:03:51.519> has<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.670> huge<00:03:52.570> front<00:03:53.380> load<00:03:53.590> here

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
he's had he has a huge front load here

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.670 
he's had he has a huge front load here
right<00:03:54.070> and<00:03:54.310> then<00:03:54.489> I<00:03:55.230> guess<00:03:56.230> this<00:03:56.380> one<00:03:56.530> could

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
right and then I guess this one could

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.680 
right and then I guess this one could
worked<00:03:56.890> better<00:03:57.850> than<00:03:58.000> the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.830 

all<00:04:01.690> right<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.080> then<00:04:02.740> the<00:04:03.700> last<00:04:04.120> mode<00:04:04.510> is

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
all right and then the last mode is

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.170 
all right and then the last mode is
really<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:06.160> weapon<00:04:06.550> in<00:04:06.700> vehicle<00:04:07.150> mode

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
really the the weapon in vehicle mode

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:19.229 
really the the weapon in vehicle mode
which<00:04:07.480> we're<00:04:07.630> gonna<00:04:07.720> do<00:04:07.900> now<00:04:16.140> okay<00:04:17.140> just<00:04:18.239> fold

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
which we're gonna do now okay just fold

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.400 
which we're gonna do now okay just fold
it<00:04:19.420> this<00:04:19.630> way<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:20.590> looks<00:04:20.830> like<00:04:20.920> a<00:04:20.980> real<00:04:21.220> gun<00:04:22.410> an

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
it this way it looks like a real gun an

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.950 
it this way it looks like a real gun an
old<00:04:23.790> old-fashioned<00:04:24.790> gun<00:04:25.000> with<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.210> gears<00:04:25.450> and

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
old old-fashioned gun with the gears and

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:35.760 
old old-fashioned gun with the gears and
then<00:04:26.590> just<00:04:28.110> fold<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:30.580> feet<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.110> side<00:04:34.770> like

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
then just fold the feet to the side like

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.220 
then just fold the feet to the side like
that<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:36.580> okay<00:04:38.580> transform<00:04:39.580> Huffer<00:04:40.150> into<00:04:40.840> robot

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
that so okay transform Huffer into robot

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.990 
that so okay transform Huffer into robot
mode<00:04:41.470> it's<00:04:41.980> very<00:04:42.190> easy<00:04:42.430> one<00:04:42.730> of<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:42.910> more

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
mode it's very easy one of the more

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.400 
mode it's very easy one of the more
simple<00:04:43.180> transformations<00:04:43.930> I've<00:04:44.020> seen<00:04:44.260> the

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
simple transformations I've seen the

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.100 
simple transformations I've seen the
first<00:04:44.530> code<00:04:44.800> class<00:04:45.010> but<00:04:45.310> before<00:04:45.610> we<00:04:45.700> do<00:04:45.850> that

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
first code class but before we do that

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.540 
first code class but before we do that
you<00:04:47.110> know<00:04:47.230> I<00:04:47.500> just<00:04:47.860> wanted<00:04:48.100> to<00:04:48.190> show<00:04:48.340> quickly

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
you know I just wanted to show quickly

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.370 
you know I just wanted to show quickly
that<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.060> could<00:04:49.180> also<00:04:49.360> turn<00:04:49.840> it<00:04:50.020> into<00:04:50.170> the

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
that you could also turn it into the

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.870 
that you could also turn it into the
body<00:04:50.560> of<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:51.040> Vegas<00:04:51.730> dog<00:04:52.050> or<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.290> combined<00:04:54.220> mode

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
body of a Vegas dog or the combined mode

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.460 
body of a Vegas dog or the combined mode
of<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.150> parkour<00:04:55.600> combiner<00:04:55.960> with<00:04:56.230> the<00:04:56.320> other

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
of the parkour combiner with the other

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.820 
of the parkour combiner with the other
drones<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:57.040> you<00:04:57.130> just<00:04:57.840> it's<00:04:58.840> not<00:04:58.990> that<00:04:59.050> big<00:04:59.710> of

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
drones and you just it's not that big of

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.130 
drones and you just it's not that big of
a<00:04:59.920> deal<00:05:00.100> I<00:05:00.370> mean<00:05:00.490> you<00:05:00.610> just<00:05:00.640> flip<00:05:01.240> there<00:05:01.510> hold

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
a deal I mean you just flip there hold

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.180 
a deal I mean you just flip there hold
on<00:05:02.260> his<00:05:02.440> head<00:05:03.870> just<00:05:04.870> open<00:05:05.260> up<00:05:05.350> the<00:05:05.530> legs<00:05:05.710> and<00:05:06.040> we

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
on his head just open up the legs and we

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.080

altmed<00:06:52.389> but<00:06:52.720> the<00:06:52.840> transformation<00:06:53.440> is<00:06:53.500> a

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
altmed but the transformation is a

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.990 
altmed but the transformation is a
little<00:06:53.710> bit<00:06:53.800> too<00:06:53.949> simplistic<00:06:54.190> for<00:06:54.699> me<00:06:54.789> it<00:06:54.909> was

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
little bit too simplistic for me it was

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.279 
little bit too simplistic for me it was
quite<00:06:55.270> surprised<00:06:55.659> how<00:06:55.690> easy<00:06:55.990> it<00:06:56.139> was<00:06:56.229> to

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289 
quite surprised how easy it was to

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:59.550 
quite surprised how easy it was to
transform<00:06:57.270> again<00:06:58.270> they<00:06:58.449> said<00:06:58.659> you<00:06:58.810> can<00:06:59.050> you

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
transform again they said you can you

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.060 
transform again they said you can you
can<00:06:59.770> point<00:07:00.070> it<00:07:00.220> this<00:07:00.400> way<00:07:00.610> so<00:07:01.599> you<00:07:01.690> could<00:07:01.840> ever

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
can point it this way so you could ever

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.560 
can point it this way so you could ever
have<00:07:03.070> an<00:07:03.190> attack<00:07:03.490> mode<00:07:03.760> or<00:07:03.940> something

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
have an attack mode or something

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.370 
have an attack mode or something
you<00:07:05.229> could<00:07:05.380> actually<00:07:05.500> fire<00:07:05.860> a<00:07:06.130> weapon<00:07:06.780> so<00:07:07.780> very

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.380 
you could actually fire a weapon so very

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.159 
you could actually fire a weapon so very
