like<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> character<00:01:23.520> models<00:01:23.880> don't<00:01:24.450> live<00:01:24.630> up

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
like the character models don't live up

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
to what they should have been for the

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.450 
to what they should have been for the
most<00:01:26.940> part<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:27.510> look<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:28.020> bland<00:01:28.500> some<00:01:29.370> of

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
most part they look really bland some of

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.550 
most part they look really bland some of
the<00:01:29.550> attacks<00:01:29.850> are<00:01:30.090> also<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:30.630> not<00:01:31.020> done<00:01:31.260> like

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the attacks are also just not done like

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.580 
the attacks are also just not done like
for<00:01:32.310> example<00:01:32.630> Titan<00:01:33.630> looks<00:01:33.840> solid<00:01:34.380> rather

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
for example Titan looks solid rather

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.040 
for example Titan looks solid rather
than<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.980> giant<00:01:35.340> rotating<00:01:35.490> massive<00:01:36.240> chakra<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
than the giant rotating massive chakra a

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.080 
than the giant rotating massive chakra a
great<00:01:37.770> example<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.400> what<00:01:38.580> they<00:01:38.730> should<00:01:39.000> have

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
great example of what they should have

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.830 
great example of what they should have
done<00:01:39.300> is<00:01:39.570> Kiva's<00:01:40.320> bangles<00:01:40.920> offense<00:01:41.690> when<00:01:42.690> he

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
done is Kiva's bangles offense when he

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840 
done is Kiva's bangles offense when he
first<00:01:43.080> starts<00:01:43.500> spinning<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.100> chose<00:01:44.340> motion

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
first starts spinning of chose motion

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.550 
first starts spinning of chose motion
and<00:01:45.030> looks

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
and looks

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.469 
and looks
but<00:01:46.159> then<00:01:46.310> it<00:01:46.430> switches<00:01:46.729> over<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.299> looks

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
but then it switches over and looks

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.080 
but then it switches over and looks
solid<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:48.110> fact<00:01:48.490> again<00:01:49.490> if<00:01:49.640> there's<00:01:49.850> some

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
solid in fact again if there's some

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.090 
solid in fact again if there's some
