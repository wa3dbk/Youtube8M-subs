00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
Jeremy Lin case was only last year and

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
granted this year actually if you had to

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.940 
granted this year actually if you had to
predict<00:05:48.690> you<00:05:48.810> have<00:05:48.930> a<00:05:48.960> sense<00:05:49.229> of<00:05:49.350> how<00:05:49.500> is<00:05:49.800> this

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
how this case will end up I would think

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.060 
how this case will end up I would think
that<00:05:53.640> the<00:05:54.600> most<00:05:54.750> likely<00:05:54.930> outcome<00:05:55.200> would<00:05:55.710> be<00:05:55.740> a

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
that the most likely outcome would be a

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.830 
that the most likely outcome would be a
gentleman<00:05:56.490> if<00:05:56.610> you<00:05:56.820> were<00:05:56.970> counseling<00:05:57.479> Jordan

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
gentleman if you were counseling Jordan

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.240 
gentleman if you were counseling Jordan
what<00:05:58.140> would<00:05:58.260> you<00:05:58.350> be<00:05:58.470> telling<00:05:58.650> him<00:05:58.890> here<00:05:59.070> I

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
what would you be telling him here I

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.770 
what would you be telling him here I
think<00:05:59.669> it's<00:05:59.820> going<00:05:59.970> to<00:06:00.060> be<00:06:00.120> a<00:06:00.240> difficult<00:06:00.660> case

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
think it's going to be a difficult case

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.140 
think it's going to be a difficult case
for<00:06:00.840> Jordan<00:06:01.410> he<00:06:02.310> needs<00:06:02.520> to<00:06:02.669> have<00:06:02.820> realistic

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
for Jordan he needs to have realistic

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.680 
for Jordan he needs to have realistic
expectations<00:06:03.570> and<00:06:04.110> I<00:06:05.180> think<00:06:06.180> it's<00:06:06.360> a<00:06:06.540> matter

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
expectations and I think it's a matter

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.260 
expectations and I think it's a matter
of<00:06:06.870> strategy<00:06:07.110> and<00:06:07.590> then<00:06:08.100> he<00:06:08.340> should<00:06:08.610> really<00:06:09.120> be

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
of strategy and then he should really be

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.840 
of strategy and then he should really be
looking<00:06:09.300> at<00:06:09.990> trying<00:06:10.650> to<00:06:10.830> gain<00:06:11.640> some<00:06:11.820> leverage

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
looking at trying to gain some leverage

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.450
