is<00:01:01.649> because<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.280> doesn't<00:01:02.579> make<00:01:02.640> any<00:01:02.699> sense<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
is because it doesn't make any sense and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.359 
is because it doesn't make any sense and
the<00:01:03.420> more<00:01:03.660> mysterious<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.250> more

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the more mysterious it is and the more

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.580 
the more mysterious it is and the more
nonsensical<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.840> more<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> think<00:01:07.229> it
