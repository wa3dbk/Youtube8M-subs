00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hello, Alexey Grapes 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.030
 in this short video tutorial I will show 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.300
 how can you easily know your temperature 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.870
 video card in this will help us one of 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.080
 programs that I want to show today 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.210
 the first program is called creeping 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.119
 run this program here 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.029
 choose a graphics card which temperature 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.010
 you want to see if you have a laptop 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.740
 then you may have two video cards 1 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.950
 built-in external one also it can 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.260
 be and on desktops 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.460
 choose a video card and go here to 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.870
 The sensors tab, that is, the sensors and 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.920
 here we can see the temperature 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.910
 video card in the parameter jeep speech rate 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.449
 i.e. temperature graphic 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:57.230
 cpu here we see the value 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.109
 temperature in degrees and such a schedule 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.710
 if you click on the temperature can be changed 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.390
 value 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.150
 minimum temperature 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.150
 during the work program for the most 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.799
 fixed value and average a in g 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.119
 moving on the schedule can be observed 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.420
 that temperature that was at that moment 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.920
 when the schedule was drawn like this 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.570
 simple way to see the temperature 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.900
 there are also other options here. 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.939
 such as fan speed in 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.530
 percent let's say I now have 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.970
 passively video card that is without 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.829
 the fan here is equally shown 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.020
 number that is forty percent of 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.420
 maximum speed though i have it 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.460
 not at all that is how would you thank him for 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.009
 graphics card then this parameter attention 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.930
 Do not pay in principle to active 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.119
 video cards will not always be here 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.119
 show the correct value because 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.579
 that cheap cards don't have built in 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.740
 fan speed sensor 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.710
 there could be some crap here too 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.610
 appear well in general here and there 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:09.360
 other different video card parameters 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.430
 Well, this lesson is not about them, let me tell you 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:19.000
 show the second interesting program 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:20.500
 it is called piriform spc means to 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.280
 see temperatures days 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.500
 go to the graphics device section 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.450
 here we also find our video card and 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.819
 move down to the parameter 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.569
 temperature 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.060
 immediately see that the temperature is 65 degrees 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.090
 we can click on this graph icon and 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.799
 look more so magnified 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.549
 temperature change graph 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.379
 graphics card temperature 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.389
 it looks something like a task manager 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.739
 windows 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.180
 here you can also follow the story 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.019
 video card changes for example 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.810
 run the game program minimize 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.519
 then close the game back go into this 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.230
 program and see how skipped 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:10.419
 temperature in time and last 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:14.790
 the program is called aida64 here 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.790
 go to the computer sensors section 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:21.489
 The temperature of the graphics card is shown in 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.260
 Parameters diode gp gp means graphic 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.690
 CPU 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.409
 you can see that 65 degrees Celsius 140 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.199
 degrees fahrenheit in this program 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.699
 we can still test 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:36.430
 how does the cooling system handle 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:39.310
 video card with a load for this we go 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:45.189
 in the service menu system stability test 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:47.590
 and here we need to remove all the checkboxes 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.620
 leave only the passion of pauses that is 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.959
 test graphics processor only 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.970
 we press start program on full 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.470
 loads the video chip that is won 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.180
 loads calculations look so minutes 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.410
 10-15 are watching 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.390
 if the temperature does not change 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.610
 does not exceed critical means everything 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.830
 normally the cooling system is working 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.620
 perfectly 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.260
 if here you have no check mark and g by y 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.110
 the diode that is, the graph is not drawn 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.980
 temperatures of the video card go in the pro 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:24.560
 Ferenzi with parameters here take any 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.110
 free value for example delay 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.530
 free yes nothing here we choose 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.330
 here gp diode to blue 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.380
 draw a graph of the load on the video card 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:40.490
 that is, the graphics temperature graph 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:42.830
 all then click stop and close in 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.410
 Basically everything is easy temperature can 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.380
 view any person using these 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.470
 the programs on this video tutorial are finished before 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.470
