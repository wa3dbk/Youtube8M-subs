requirement<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.710> actually<00:01:53.040> kinda<00:01:53.369> high

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
requirement this is actually kinda high

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.090 
requirement this is actually kinda high
you're<00:01:53.729> looking<00:01:53.939> at<00:01:54.000> an<00:01:54.090> Intel<00:01:54.479> Core<00:01:54.689> i7<00:01:55.100> 3770

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
you're looking at an Intel Core i7 3770

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.959 
you're looking at an Intel Core i7 3770
3.48<00:01:57.000> your<00:01:57.149> turn<00:01:57.450> AMD<00:01:57.899> FX<00:01:58.049> 8350<00:01:58.829> 4.0<00:01:59.520> gigahertz

3.48 your turn AMD FX 8350 4.0 gigahertz
now<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:01.110> key<00:02:01.320> takeaway<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.009> can

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
now the one key takeaway that you can

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.160 
now the one key takeaway that you can
take<00:02:02.579> from<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.149> requirement<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.990> this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
take from that requirement is that this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.289 
take from that requirement is that this
game<00:02:04.380> will<00:02:04.649> utilize<00:02:05.189> more<00:02:05.520> than<00:02:05.700> four<00:02:05.939> cores

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
game will utilize more than four cores

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.440 
game will utilize more than four cores
the<00:02:06.780> i7<00:02:07.350> 3770<00:02:08.250> while<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> four<00:02:09.000> core<00:02:09.179> CP

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the i7 3770 while it is a four core CP

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.180 
the i7 3770 while it is a four core CP
it<00:02:09.539> also<00:02:09.660> has<00:02:09.869> hyper-threading<00:02:10.259> effectively

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
it also has hyper-threading effectively

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.730 
it also has hyper-threading effectively
making<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.670> an<00:02:11.790> 8<00:02:12.060> core<00:02:12.390> CPU<00:02:12.959> and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
making it an 8 core CPU and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.770 
making it an 8 core CPU and
you<00:02:13.770> see<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.100> FX<00:02:14.430> 8350<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.210> one<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.540> best

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
you see the FX 8350 is one of the best

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.210 
you see the FX 8350 is one of the best
eight<00:02:16.020> core<00:02:16.200> CPUs<00:02:16.590> for<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.800> really<00:02:17.070> decent

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
eight core CPUs for a really decent

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.070 
eight core CPUs for a really decent
price<00:02:17.610> but<00:02:17.880> that's<00:02:18.300> pretty<00:02:18.540> interesting<00:02:18.780> you

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
price but that's pretty interesting you

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.870 
price but that's pretty interesting you
see<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.380> Mortal<00:02:19.620> Kombat<00:02:19.920> X<00:02:20.040> will<00:02:20.370> use<00:02:20.640> more

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
see that Mortal Kombat X will use more

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.070 
see that Mortal Kombat X will use more
than<00:02:21.090> four<00:02:21.300> cores<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.600> really<00:02:21.900> wasn't
