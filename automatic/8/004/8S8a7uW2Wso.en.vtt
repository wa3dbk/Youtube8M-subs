00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.320
 noticed that we do not have on the site 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.080
 review on this model and and in principle 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.750
 buy this smartphone i decided to write 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.519
 A short unpacking review and 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.650
 explain a little 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.810
 first of all for those who will 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.970
 buy this smartphone because special 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.250
 tests I will not do now and just 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.399
 I'll tell you what to focus on the model 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.149
 this is called repeat lenovo 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.719
 a66 8 t 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.489
 this is a similar smartphone lenovo a660 on 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.090
 which I have already done full 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.059
 video review 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.329
 they are completely identical in all their 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.199
 parameters besides supporting 3g networks 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.489
 this model is cheaper with 668 tons it is cheaper 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.199
 roughly cheaper dollars by 20 to 30 and 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.600
 so the price of the presence in Ukraine stis 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.239
 but also much lower 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.090
 the rest of the functionality of the model is completely 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.950
 identical lack of support 3g 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.890
 Internet means that you can not 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.350
 use full 3g cards 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.460
 but 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.610
 2g internet mobile there with 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.009
 gsm cards tomsk 100 times pay with life 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.880
 and you can use absolutely without 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.820
 problems and here is this model lenovo a66 8 t 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.700
 a video review on s660 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.409
 I have already made a record can it 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.880
 look at the link that we 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.650
 let's place somewhere here so as not to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.710
 talk too much in that model 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.840
 completely identical identical in all 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.909
 its parameters in appearance 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.049
 by battery capacity by firmware 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.679
 inside the camera 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.219
 processor performance 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:59.280
 RAM assembly and so that 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.590
 that kind of smartphone completely 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.149
 works no different from 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.069
 full version 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.250
 the only thing you can't 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:10.229
 use 3g internet but mine 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.959
 practice in my experience 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.330
 3g internet special cards 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.510
 Separate 3g cards are used 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.430
 units literally mostly private 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.970
