00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.160
 Hi, people, the house is yours today. 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.380
 here telling us a bit about the history of 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.550
 and a story that everything 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.199
 home world will have to get a 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.779
 recently married couple has a 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.270
 small apartment 45 square meters 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.980
 just and we wanted to do it 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.200
 space in the best way possible for 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.700
 meet all their needs 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:43.789
 Let's do a little bit the history of 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:47.739
 parking lot but the delay in the 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.739
 delivery spent almost two years 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:01:00.440
 transform the apartment buy in 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:07.100
 really satisfactory start for the 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:09.320
 need for a special call for 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.920
 he because it shows he portrays a lot 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.170
 well this question and the architect 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.170
 the other side is at home 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.730
 however large the apartment is or 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.890
 environment, or does everyone want 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.460
 make the best use of the 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.460
 spaces 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.890
 thinks he is even bigger than he 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.890
 is 45 square meters and even more 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.440
 the first thing you 'll see in the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.870
 image aa plant layout that was sold 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.620
 the consultant showed that it would 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:05.840
 here a bench with 3 stools and a 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:08.830
 square table for six people who will 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.230
 buy apartment believe in it and 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.170
 professional design that you hire 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.310
 another view of the scale as soon as 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.159
 I took the plant I saw it was 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.720
 impossible to put all 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.000
 real estate in the dining room 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:03:07.690
 not to mention that it would compromise 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:03:12.319
 circulation in the kitchen with reference to 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.560
 my grandmother's house what kind do you do 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.560
 what you want 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.760
 I really was wanting something more 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.400
 sophisticated 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.849
 but he was really inspired and glued 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.549
 a lightweight piece with the base at 55 chairs 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.530
 a fabric in light shade 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.810
 then you will see in the whole apartment 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.640
 he has this modern profile but he 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.829
 there's also that thing of coziness he 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.079
 it would not say from home in 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.790
 flight but he has that thing to welcome 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:48.560
 even because the case I like to receive in 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.079
 house a mirror in the background to give 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.489
 amplitude take the look at infinity as 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.599
 we have been showing in other 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.549
 apartments 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.549
 the very important mirror function 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.269
 This is wonderful and 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.650
 It's just a little break from your house. 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.650
 back now
