00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
carriers you've got to remember this is

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.659 
carriers you've got to remember this is
a<00:00:27.900> van<00:00:28.199> based<00:00:28.529> people<00:00:29.130> carrier<00:00:29.519> with<00:00:31.550> far<00:00:32.550> more

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
a van based people carrier with far more

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.760 
a van based people carrier with far more
