00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
be good if it walked over here but say

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.720 
be good if it walked over here but say
the<00:00:44.460> Sheep<00:00:44.730> tried<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> walk<00:00:45.329> over<00:00:45.480> here<00:00:45.750> I

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
the Sheep tried to walk over here I

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
the Sheep tried to walk over here I
could<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.879> come<00:00:48.030> over<00:00:48.090> here<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:49.129> flip<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
could just come over here and flip a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.590 
could just come over here and flip a
switch<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.539> drawbridge<00:00:51.989> goes<00:00:52.230> up<00:00:53.600> which

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
switch and the drawbridge goes up which

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.290 
switch and the drawbridge goes up which
is<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:55.140> good<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.559> then<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.340> flick<00:00:57.120> it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
is really good and then I can flick it

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.720 
is really good and then I can flick it
back<00:00:57.329> down<00:00:59.329> now<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.390> only<00:01:01.460> good<00:01:02.460> thing<00:01:02.489> about

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
back down now the only good thing about

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.450 
back down now the only good thing about
this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.589> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.619> activate<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.220> phone

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
this is that you can activate a phone

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.730 
this is that you can activate a phone
over<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.939> side<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.600> then<00:01:06.990> anything<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.500> fall

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
over this side and then anything to fall

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.960 
over this side and then anything to fall
in<00:01:08.240> but<00:01:09.240> there<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.260> many<00:01:10.500> bad<00:01:10.890> points<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.580> make

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
in but there are many bad points to make

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.830 
in but there are many bad points to make
any<00:01:12.330> drawbridge<00:01:12.869> similar<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.159> no<00:01:14.960> one

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
any drawbridge similar to this no one

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.609 
any drawbridge similar to this no one
hello<00:01:18.840> sheep<00:01:19.400> number<00:01:20.400> one<00:01:20.780> if<00:01:21.780> someone<00:01:22.259> breaks

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
hello sheep number one if someone breaks

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.880 
hello sheep number one if someone breaks
all<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.460> these<00:01:23.670> red<00:01:24.360> stone<00:01:24.689> pieces<00:01:25.020> because

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
all of these red stone pieces because

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.700 
all of these red stone pieces because
they<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.610> from<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.000> side<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.479> mean<00:01:27.750> unless<00:01:27.960> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
they can from the side I mean unless you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.770 
they can from the side I mean unless you
make<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.009> very<00:01:29.340> long<00:01:29.549> which<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.600> probably

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
make it very long which is probably

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:43.639 
make it very long which is probably
better<00:01:31.729> someone<00:01:32.729> could<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:34.189> do<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:42.649> yep

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
better someone could just do this yep

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.039 
better someone could just do this yep
and<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.180> renders<00:01:45.659> your<00:01:45.810> bridge

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and then that renders your bridge

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.219 
and then that renders your bridge
basically<00:01:46.710> useless<00:01:48.229> or<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.040> put<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:52.020> red

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
basically useless or if I put the red

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.330 
basically useless or if I put the red
stone<00:01:52.500> back<00:01:54.409> now<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.890> they<00:01:56.130> decided<00:01:56.850> not<00:01:57.149> to

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
stone back now if they decided not to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.440 
stone back now if they decided not to
and<00:02:00.079> you

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
and you

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.149 
and you
the<00:02:01.509> bridge<00:02:01.659> up<00:02:01.780> like<00:02:01.930> that<00:02:02.110> they<00:02:02.680> could<00:02:02.829> still

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
the bridge up like that they could still

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.740 
the bridge up like that they could still
jump<00:02:03.820> up<00:02:04.030> on<00:02:04.240> it<00:02:04.390> like<00:02:04.570> this<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:05.259> walk<00:02:06.250> across

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
jump up on it like this and walk across

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.000 
jump up on it like this and walk across
ninja<00:02:07.750> style<00:02:07.810> but<00:02:10.260> I'm<00:02:11.260> gonna<00:02:11.440> have<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.739> try

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
only like a few good points to using

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.710 
only like a few good points to using
this<00:02:28.720> it's<00:02:28.959> quite<00:02:29.140> simple<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.620> make<00:02:29.920> but<00:02:30.720> I'm

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
this it's quite simple to make but I'm

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.300 
this it's quite simple to make but I'm
going<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.019> try<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.260> develop<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.709> way<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:33.010> making

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
going to try and develop a way of making

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.660 
going to try and develop a way of making
it<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.489> lot<00:02:33.610> more<00:02:34.200> advanced<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.380> then<00:02:35.950> I'll<00:02:36.370> put

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
it a lot more advanced and then I'll put

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.479 
it a lot more advanced and then I'll put
up<00:02:36.760> another<00:02:36.910> video<00:02:37.480> soon<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.989> them<00:02:38.370> if<00:02:39.370> you

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
up another video soon to them if you
