 good this video that I'm doing today 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.619
 is to talk to you about the law of 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.930
 attraction if maybe you've never heard 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.330
 from her I ask you to take a lot 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:27.039
 attention but I know there's a lot now 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.590
 people who read articles or are pending 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.570
 in books or on the internet same 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.469
 know what is freedom action this is 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:38.170
 a law that talks about us 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.460
 we attract our whole life through 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.520
 our thoughts and our 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.050
 believe this law so that you understand 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.720
 enough as always as it works 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.360
 the law of gravity means that 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.140
 has no questioning works 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.090
 only that because they do not know or 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.460
 let's ignore how it works does not mean 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.950
 that does not work in our life now 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.350
 maybe you 'll understand why one of the 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.200
 previous videos we have been talking about 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.390
 power of thought the power of 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:16.869
 words and of the mind and like us 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.310
 we have responsibility in everything that 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.750
 we live, I want you to understand that we come 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.259
 provided with all the tools to 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.119
 create our life itself being 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.259
 unconscious or ignorant of this from 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.360
 soon makes us weather vanes in the 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.750
 sea ​​in the wind and we do not know towards 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.119
 where to go we have the possibility 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.399
 to change our life through 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.470
 know ourselves and there are 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.300
 tools to be able to do it and 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.400
 I also want you to know what 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.620
 something wonderful that is the distraction 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.570
 but law of attraction is one thing that 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.270
 something is subway from now this existed 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.070
 since a long time and you investigate that 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.020
 I would like you to do it 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:04.690
 data from times before Christ 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.240
 statements that have been of interest 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.910
 of many people and that some time ago 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.319
 it was believed that they were secrets only from 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.620
 the successful people but now it 's 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.230
 into the hands of anyone who 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.889
 be in interest and investigate and about 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.040
 everything is willing to work on itself 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:30.159
 same and knowing that your life can be 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.950
 create through first of knowing you and 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:36.069
 know how this law works this is 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.650
 law has the foundation that we 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.359
 we attract to our life all that is 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.340
 in our mind in our 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:45.129
 thoughts of iu that is very important 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.650
 that we explain what we are having 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.480
 as permanent thoughts or 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.099
 dominant of our mind is 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.980
 very important as I said 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.569
 previously hear your inner dialogue 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.379
 You also have to see our 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:02.199
 vibrations there are only two types 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.980
 of negative or positive vibrations and 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:07.959
 the negatives are all those that 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.569
 we can say love honesty the 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.450
 gratitude honorability 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.939
 all those that make us feel good and of 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.609
 the opposite also the negatives that 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:22.500
 are those like anger, resentment and 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:26.709
 resentment those are 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.930
 negative vibrations of the law of the 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.660
 attraction says that we attract to 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.930
 our life all the racing then it's 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.140
 important to know that if you stay 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.180
 anchored for x reasons without giving you 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.390
 Count your thoughts where they are 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.459
 suddenly in the past on things that you 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.650
 they vibrate in negative your life will continue 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.709
 will remain that way for that is that such 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.300
 Once you have not achieved what you want 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.900
 but we always have the ability to 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.840
 turn towards the positive vibration 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.610
 with that is a process that you will die 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.930
 helping to understand and also to 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.250
 identify what is happening 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.620
 within you now the law of attraction 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.430
 it's really wonderful 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:16.530
 remember that by bringing in the affine 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:20.799
 at the end it also makes us 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.169
 let's keep in mind that what we want 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.900
 but there is a key that is very important 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:29.290
 gratitude is also one of the 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.729
 positive vibrations and is the key to 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.100
 achieve what you want 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.560
 Remember everyone who is grateful 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.900
 with what they have will be given more and that 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.990
 that is not grateful even for what 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.810
 you do not have to be wrested this 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.360
 it is also a law and yes the truth is 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.090
 I like to get into the subject of 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.430
 the grace crushes but in the bible you 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.039
 you are going to find statements that speak 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.680
 about the law of traction you are told that 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.889
 what he asks will be given to you 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.229
 this is true it is important that you 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:06.460
 investigues is for you to understand a 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:11.949
 little more now it's a process to know about the 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:15.039
 distraction and it's a learning that 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:17.560
 it will change your life I really ask you 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:20.020
 What do you investigate? 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.510
 give room to the things that we have 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.280
 been talking about reconsidering 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.280
 those who suddenly out of ignorance do not 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.650
 we know but they are there and they are for 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.900
 take care of people now have 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.470
 information in your hand and can change 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:39.120
 all they want themselves not knowing 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:43.450
 himself and be able to change the feeding 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.420
 it is very important now it is decisive 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.270
 As you wish 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.790
 is one of the most important things and 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.760
 first we must identify what is 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.440
 what we want and as 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.350
 that we will work with 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.850
 tools like 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.950
 the identification of our 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:07.400
 thoughts the imagination the focus and 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:10.820
 faith the gratitude that is decisive 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.040
 to be able to achieve what you want good in 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.590
 the next video what you are going to 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.920
 see you are going to understand a little more I'm going to 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:22.520
 give exact rules of how to define 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.020
 to start what you want and we will go 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.300
