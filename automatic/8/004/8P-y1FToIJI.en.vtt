whatnot

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.740 
whatnot
what<00:01:36.210> inside<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.689> here<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:36.990> not<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.320> 760

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
what inside of here is not the 760

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.270 
what inside of here is not the 760
inside<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> 760<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
inside of here it's not the 760 it's the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.840 
inside of here it's not the 760 it's the
670<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.799> an<00:01:43.920> upgrade<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.490> current

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
670 so it is an upgrade of the current

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.450 
670 so it is an upgrade of the current
card<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.360> also<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.750> 2<00:01:45.960> gigabytes<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.740> video

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
card and also it's 2 gigabytes of video

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.539 
card and also it's 2 gigabytes of video
memory<00:01:48.030> instead<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.570> one<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.490> to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
memory instead of one so it's going to

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.109 
memory instead of one so it's going to
be<00:01:50.670> quite<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.030> upgrade<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.979> I<00:01:53.119> really
