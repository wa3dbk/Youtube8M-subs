kill streak and you need a predator you

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.420 
kill streak and you need a predator you
need<00:03:00.169> a<00:03:00.200> photo<00:03:00.500> shoot<00:03:00.769> for<00:03:00.799> a<00:03:00.889> predator<00:03:01.159> missle

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
need a photo shoot for a predator missle

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.149 
need a photo shoot for a predator missle
you<00:03:02.000> capture<00:03:02.419> a<00:03:02.450> flag<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:03.530> get<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:03.829> predator

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
you capture a flag you get the predator

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.740 
you capture a flag you get the predator
missile<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.519> just<00:03:04.699> like<00:03:04.849> that<00:03:04.879> and<00:03:05.269> the
