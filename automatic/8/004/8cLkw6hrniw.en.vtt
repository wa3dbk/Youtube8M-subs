seem<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.820> responding<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.950> was<00:01:40.950> looking<00:01:41.310> for

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
seem to be responding I was looking for

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.990 
seem to be responding I was looking for
any<00:01:41.790> idea<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.689> could<00:01:42.750> get<00:01:43.579> but<00:01:44.579> there<00:01:44.759> seem

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
any idea that I could get but there seem

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.609 
any idea that I could get but there seem
to<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.149> none<00:01:46.759> well<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.149> decided<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.290> would

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
to be none well I decided that I would

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.889 
to be none well I decided that I would
try<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.000> after<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.659> while

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
try this and that and after a while

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.289 
try this and that and after a while
certain<00:01:52.409> techniques<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.399> got<00:01:53.670> through<00:01:54.000> to

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
certain techniques that got through to

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.530 
certain techniques that got through to
Amy<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.920> emerged<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.329> day<00:01:57.509> I

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
Amy is emerged and then one day I

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.630 
Amy is emerged and then one day I
realized<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.350> Amy<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.920> making<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> same

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
realized that Amy was making the same

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.780 
realized that Amy was making the same
progress<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.390> some<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.600> my<00:02:00.659> other<00:02:00.869> students<00:02:03.380> so

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
progress of some of my other students so

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.119 
progress of some of my other students so
that<00:02:05.790> thus<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.450> idea<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.110> piano<00:02:07.469> for<00:02:07.740> special

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that thus the idea of piano for special

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.900 
that thus the idea of piano for special
needs<00:02:08.160> was<00:02:08.610> born<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:10.160> organized<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.520> methods
