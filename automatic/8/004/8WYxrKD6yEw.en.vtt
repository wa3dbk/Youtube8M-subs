00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.330
 Well in this video we will focus on 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.279
 clearing the beds specifically this one when 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.349
 it grew strawberries on me then 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.689
 strawberries froze from her alone 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.730
 lumps and these lumps I tried 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.220
 to propagate long tried so nothing 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.070
 came here on a roll and I just 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.280
 protecting her from fresh vymahala weed 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.290
 weed is powerful and healthy than I do it 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.390
 here you are 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.610
 tool heart plug 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.739
 which is bent from a piece of steel flocks 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.199
 I put a piece of rubber wire 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.120
 hose and turned his instrument 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.879
 sizes and its size and here on this 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.070
 photos will fall down photographed it 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.850
 next to the tape measure, in principle, it turns out 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.430
 drawing is not what you need dimensions 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.059
 pretend to him and if you like it 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.759
 you need to do something like this 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.700
 no bed no I pick up and start 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.610
 shout out the ground itself 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.429
 from weeds why should I do it why 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.170
 so carefully clean the roots to 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.940
 weed throw in the bucket then I 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.270
 threw a barrel of water where he me 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.929
 get wet agrees with those germs 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.119
 which remained on the roots and get 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.910
 so to speak liquid green fertilizer 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.729
 that's why I pull them and so that the microbes 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.729
 the whole lithosphere which swarms on 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.179
 the roots of this allocated trash about 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.670
 good beast squirrels yet as and then 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.670
 I do not remember this 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.520
 in order for this earth and these microbes 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.310
 left directly beds of course 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.570
 microbes are sleeping now because they say up to 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.369
 walls end of may 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.000
 it is clear that everything else has dried up 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.080
 impossibility she me sandy 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.130
 dries for 6 seconds is not something that someone 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.229
 more suitable clay 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.990
 but nowhere to go as later 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.019
 it turned out but I'm sandy soil without 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.040
 mulch is one big mockery 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.680
 weed Nemer moisture with doubt 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.480
 so what I am doing right now 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.549
 enough of them and rip this one 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.860
 syrnichek 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.549
 get out he got out to rip this one out 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.769
 here is syrnichek 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.100
 it is a merit of the long time 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:32.959
 rains but you can see here right now my 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:36.799
 hand will clear that miserable choice 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.390
 wife trying to squeeze land to a beggar 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.450
 in the end it will not be so but 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.299
 I try not to see that earthling to no 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.859
 and here is the annual weed next to them 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:51.799
 or monica and I tell her what is the most ideal 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:53.840
 why cover material which i 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.519
 at least for myself found it were on 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.670
 combed since autumn 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.340
 fallen leaves of trees here they give 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.859
 tight crust that hold well 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.959
 water and decomposed they give masses 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.510
 nutrients for this very 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.840
 ground that is both wet and tasty and 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.040
 no weed well you used to me across 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.510
 our district was heated freshly fallen 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.549
 leaves in autumn 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.829
 and now the district was covered with asphalt 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.760
 crumbs and rowing became impossible 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.950
 so you have to get by 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.780
 or sawdust for which is pretty hard 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.760
 ride or something like this 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.440
 melee 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.590
 melee version is the most uncomfortable 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.720
 okay okay, this is the first part of my 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.299
 video basically say nothing more 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.359
 now the land for dubbing 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.430
 and start the second part of the video I'm on it 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:49.629
 have nothing to say 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.629
 that's probably all 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.089
 not 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.229
 not understood 

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.910
 Who
