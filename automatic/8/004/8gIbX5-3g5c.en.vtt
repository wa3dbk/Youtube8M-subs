is the new i79 ATX today we're going to

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.060 
is the new i79 ATX today we're going to
be<00:00:39.420> doing<00:00:39.570> some<00:00:39.810> overclocking<00:00:40.080> we're<00:00:40.950> going

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
be doing some overclocking we're going

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.590 
be doing some overclocking we're going
to<00:00:41.130> begin<00:00:41.250> with<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.580> series<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:41.940> air<00:00:42.300> cooling

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
to begin with a series of air cooling

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.300 
to begin with a series of air cooling
for<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:42.960> CPU<00:00:43.320> because<00:00:43.530> i<00:00:43.740> know<00:00:43.800> many<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.160> you

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
for this CPU because i know many of you

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.160 
for this CPU because i know many of you
don't<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.670> water<00:00:45.000> cooling<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.630> so<00:00:46.050> these

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
don't have water cooling and so these

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.480 
don't have water cooling and so these
videos<00:00:46.560> are<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.130> you

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490

introduction to this overclocking video
we're<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.579> to<00:01:08.609> show<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.909> some<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
we're just going to show you some of the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.859 
we're just going to show you some of the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
core temperatures at idle speeds what

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.870 
core temperatures at idle speeds what
that<00:01:13.079> means<00:01:13.320> there's<00:01:13.649> absolutely<00:01:14.189> no<00:01:14.490> load<00:01:14.729> on

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
that means there's absolutely no load on

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.980 
that means there's absolutely no load on
the<00:01:14.999> system<00:01:15.179> whatsoever

we<00:01:16.409> are<00:01:16.469> just<00:01:16.710> currently<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.399> BIOS<00:01:17.759> take

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
we are just currently in the BIOS take

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.539 
we are just currently in the BIOS take
me<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> look<00:01:18.749> and<00:01:19.200> right<00:01:19.409> now<00:01:19.649> things<00:01:20.369> are

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
me a look and right now things are

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.880 
me a look and right now things are
looking<00:01:20.909> pretty<00:01:21.390> damn<00:01:21.749> good<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.289> a<00:01:22.350> 6<00:01:22.649> core

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
looking pretty damn good for a 6 core

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.999 
looking pretty damn good for a 6 core
CPU<00:01:23.520> we've<00:01:24.270> got<00:01:24.479> 31<00:01:24.929> Celsius<00:01:25.499> which<00:01:25.649> comes<00:01:25.890> out

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
CPU we've got 31 Celsius which comes out

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.340 
CPU we've got 31 Celsius which comes out
to<00:01:26.069> 87<00:01:26.700> point<00:01:26.939> 5<00:01:27.079> Fahrenheit<00:01:28.079> which<00:01:28.259> is

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
to 87 point 5 Fahrenheit which is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.779 
to 87 point 5 Fahrenheit which is
actually<00:01:28.679> lower<00:01:28.950> than<00:01:29.340> your<00:01:29.579> body

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
actually lower than your body

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.520 
actually lower than your body
temperature<00:01:30.359> now<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.990> should<00:01:31.229> give<00:01:31.350> us<00:01:31.409> a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
temperature now that should give us a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.169 
temperature now that should give us a
little<00:01:31.679> bit<00:01:31.859> of<00:01:32.009> room<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.219> work<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:32.729> because

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
little bit of room to work with because

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.010 
little bit of room to work with because
you<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.569> get<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> CPU<00:01:34.139> Ranger<00:01:34.530> probably<00:01:34.859> 110

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
you can get the CPU Ranger probably 110

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.450 
you can get the CPU Ranger probably 110
115<00:01:37.020> Fahrenheit<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.799> still<00:01:38.039> get<00:01:38.219> a<00:01:38.249> good

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
115 Fahrenheit and still get a good

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.569 
115 Fahrenheit and still get a good
overclock<00:01:38.969> so<00:01:39.630> after<00:01:40.139> that<00:01:40.520> bringing<00:01:41.520> around

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
overclock so after that bringing around

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.980 
overclock so after that bringing around
over<00:01:41.969> here<00:01:41.999> this<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.020> not<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> cooler

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
over here this is the not to a cooler

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.050 
over here this is the not to a cooler
right<00:01:45.990> here<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.679> the<00:01:46.829> 24<00:01:47.399> gigabytes<00:01:47.909> of

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
right here this is the 24 gigabytes of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.959 
right here this is the 24 gigabytes of
HyperX<00:01:48.569> memory<00:01:48.719> from<00:01:49.350> Kingston<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.939> I

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
HyperX memory from Kingston and so I

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.099 
HyperX memory from Kingston and so I
mean<00:01:51.209> even<00:01:51.420> though<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:51.569> really<00:01:51.659> hard<00:01:51.990> for

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
mean even though it's really hard for

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:53.629 
mean even though it's really hard for
you<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.289> actually<00:01:52.380> see<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:53.009> are<00:01:53.159> using<00:01:53.189> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
in all as you can see this is the basis

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.570 
in all as you can see this is the basis
of<00:02:09.840> our<00:02:10.170> test<00:02:10.439> system<00:02:10.590> we're<00:02:11.340> all

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
of our test system we're all

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.750 
of our test system we're all
so<00:02:11.700> using<00:02:11.940> two<00:02:12.570> Western<00:02:13.320> Digital<00:02:13.560> these<00:02:14.550> are

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so using two Western Digital these are

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.420 
so using two Western Digital these are
the<00:02:14.880> old<00:02:15.330> 74<00:02:16.140> gigabyte<00:02:16.740> Raptor<00:02:17.160> drives

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
the old 74 gigabyte Raptor drives

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.280 
the old 74 gigabyte Raptor drives
actually<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.090> second-generation<00:02:18.540> series

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
actually the second-generation series

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.690 
actually the second-generation series
that<00:02:19.470> came<00:02:19.650> out<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.070> we're<00:02:20.190> using<00:02:20.370> two<00:02:20.670> of

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
that came out and we're using two of

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.410 
that came out and we're using two of
those<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.450> raid<00:02:21.870> zero<00:02:22.410> configuration<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:24.060> as

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
those in a raid zero configuration so as

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.810 
those in a raid zero configuration so as
you<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:24.630> see<00:02:24.690> that's<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.530> test<00:02:25.770> system<00:02:25.980> now

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
you can see that's the test system now

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.790 
you can see that's the test system now
we<00:02:26.880> will<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.750> we'll<00:02:28.110> show<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.320> some<00:02:28.710> of

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
we will on and we'll show you some of

00:02:28.800 --> 00:03:25.680 
we will on and we'll show you some of
the<00:02:28.860> overclocking<00:02:29.310> results

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.200 

okay<00:03:26.690> well<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.260> results<00:03:27.710> are<00:03:27.830> in<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.340> since

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
okay well the results are in and since

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.970 
okay well the results are in and since
the<00:03:29.420> exist<00:03:29.810> motherboard<00:03:30.260> has<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:30.860> many

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
the exist motherboard has so many

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.340 
the exist motherboard has so many
features<00:03:31.340> for<00:03:31.730> overclocking<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.960> may<00:03:33.170> be<00:03:33.230> a

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
features for overclocking it may be a

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.810 
features for overclocking it may be a
little<00:03:33.590> bit<00:03:33.770> daunting<00:03:34.220> for<00:03:34.340> those<00:03:34.490> new<00:03:34.790> to

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
little bit daunting for those new to

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.000 
little bit daunting for those new to
overclocking<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.540> figure<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:35.930> all<00:03:36.020> out<00:03:36.080> but<00:03:36.890> if

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
overclocking to figure it all out but if

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.650 
overclocking to figure it all out but if
you<00:03:37.040> do<00:03:37.310> some<00:03:37.520> online<00:03:37.880> reading<00:03:38.270> and<00:03:38.390> do<00:03:38.480> some

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660
