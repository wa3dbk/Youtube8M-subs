00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:10.690
 hello friends study 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.869
 the first tutorial we're going to see 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:17.570
 and some subjects such as lighting 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:19.670
 maybe camera handling 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.070
 among others that we are going to see here in day 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.560
 of study 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.090
 that many more employees will be able to see 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.660
 inside 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.220
 good in this case piling a topic of 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.040
 some favorite accessories for 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:39.610
 photographers or cinema or the software 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.610
 He is few 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:52.990
 two meters 150 for maybe 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.990
 photography of portraits in this case 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.370
 Let's do a test 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.899
 doll 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.899
 accompanies almost undertook 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.290
 and let's see what life is like 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.820
 as you see here we already have one of the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.330
 software with illuminated modeling that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.240
 is giving us a bit of where it is going to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.299
 direct light 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.299
 and obviously the difference 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.310
 is to soften some strong lights and 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.150
 the time shadows that are generated when not 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.940
 there is a diffuser like this 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.450
 then the software will help us 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.470
 dissipate with strong lights that are going to 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.750
 burn the door envelopes or some 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.240
 very harsh shadows that also bother 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.930
 when photographing yourself of portraits to 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.620
 product let's see how it works with and 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.620
 without partners 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.940
 90 degree 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.350
 and let's see how it affects 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.090
 this hard strong light 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.090
 in the object that we are going to photograph 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:27.160
 already there is a strong light and a 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.690
 strong shadow also very hard 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.320
 all this kind of stuff without any 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.320
 diffuser 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.500
 good and now let's see how 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.660
 will affect softball 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.120
 another object let's see how 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.640
 the software we make the angle of 45 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.000
 firing degrees 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.000
 ah 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.490
 hello friends we can see how the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.680
 software 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.370
 the accessories then we'll see it in 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.690
 portraits but by now we already know for 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.020
 what is the use of this accessory I could use 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.540
