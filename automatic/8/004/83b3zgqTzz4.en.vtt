all<00:00:06.460> right<00:00:06.700> we<00:00:06.939> did<00:00:07.180> multiple<00:00:07.809> frame<00:00:08.109> designs

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
all right we did multiple frame designs

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.980 
all right we did multiple frame designs
for<00:00:09.790> our<00:00:09.879> first<00:00:10.090> car<00:00:10.299> which<00:00:10.480> was<00:00:10.629> semi

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
for our first car which was semi

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.720 
for our first car which was semi
successful<00:00:11.559> we<00:00:11.740> started<00:00:12.070> with<00:00:12.219> a<00:00:12.250> Pinewood

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
successful we started with a Pinewood

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.529 
successful we started with a Pinewood
Derby<00:00:13.059> kit<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:14.590> used<00:00:14.859> the<00:00:15.730> Pinewood<00:00:16.119> Derby

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
Derby kit we used the Pinewood Derby

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.300 
Derby kit we used the Pinewood Derby
wheels<00:00:16.810> in<00:00:17.050> the<00:00:17.140> front<00:00:17.410> and<00:00:17.560> we<00:00:17.680> had<00:00:17.890> wood

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
wheels in the front and we had wood

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.579 
wheels in the front and we had wood
wheels<00:00:18.490> in<00:00:18.670> the<00:00:18.760> back<00:00:18.789> the<00:00:19.689> front<00:00:20.199> wheels<00:00:20.380> were

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:20.589 
wheels in the back the front wheels were

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.829 
wheels in the back the front wheels were
good<00:00:20.800> they<00:00:21.580> didn't<00:00:21.849> have<00:00:21.939> much<00:00:22.119> traction<00:00:22.480> they

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:22.839 
good they didn't have much traction they

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:25.829 
good they didn't have much traction they
moved<00:00:23.050> easily<00:00:23.849> the<00:00:24.849> back<00:00:24.999> wheels<00:00:25.269> were<00:00:25.810> a

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:25.839 
moved easily the back wheels were a

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.599 
moved easily the back wheels were a
little<00:00:26.019> heavy<00:00:26.289> didn't<00:00:26.859> work<00:00:26.980> very<00:00:27.009> well<00:00:27.279> with

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
little heavy didn't work very well with

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.100 
little heavy didn't work very well with
the<00:00:27.789> frame<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:29.199> decided<00:00:29.949> on<00:00:30.249> using<00:00:30.699> a<00:00:30.970> dowel<00:00:31.720> to

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
the frame we decided on using a dowel to

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.770 
the frame we decided on using a dowel to
extend<00:00:32.529> the<00:00:32.800> swing<00:00:33.100> arm<00:00:33.280> to<00:00:34.090> control<00:00:34.660> the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
extend the swing arm to control the

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.290 
extend the swing arm to control the
throw<00:00:35.079> a<00:00:35.110> little<00:00:35.320> bit<00:00:35.470> more<00:00:35.710> we<00:00:36.699> also<00:00:36.940> settled

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
throw a little bit more we also settled

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.880 
throw a little bit more we also settled
on<00:00:37.390> putting<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.780> mousetrap<00:00:38.260> in<00:00:38.469> the<00:00:38.559> front<00:00:38.800> of

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
on putting the mousetrap in the front of

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
on putting the mousetrap in the front of
the<00:00:38.980> car

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
the car

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.639 
the car
basically<00:00:40.750> what<00:00:40.989> didn't<00:00:41.199> work<00:00:41.320> for<00:00:41.350> that

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
basically what didn't work for that

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.920 
basically what didn't work for that
first<00:00:41.859> car<00:00:42.129> was<00:00:42.399> the<00:00:42.519> axle<00:00:42.940> was<00:00:43.149> too<00:00:43.329> loose<00:00:43.570> we

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
first car was the axle was too loose we

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.959 
first car was the axle was too loose we
used<00:00:44.109> I<00:00:44.320> hooks<00:00:44.530> to<00:00:44.739> connect<00:00:45.039> it<00:00:45.219> there<00:00:45.699> was<00:00:45.820> too

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
used I hooks to connect it there was too

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.639 
used I hooks to connect it there was too
much<00:00:46.180> movement<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.870> car<00:00:47.050> wouldn't<00:00:47.289> really<00:00:47.440> go

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
much movement the car wouldn't really go

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.049 
much movement the car wouldn't really go
straight

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
straight

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.360 
straight
the<00:00:49.449> rear<00:00:49.690> axle<00:00:49.899> wasn't<00:00:50.410> very<00:00:50.559> aligned<00:00:51.129> very

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
the rear axle wasn't very aligned very

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.430 
the rear axle wasn't very aligned very
well<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:51.969> the<00:00:52.329> overall<00:00:52.929> car<00:00:53.230> was<00:00:53.410> too<00:00:53.590> heavy

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.400 

we<00:00:58.829> decided<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> redesign<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.660> our<00:01:00.989> second

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
we decided to redesign it on our second

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.090 
we decided to redesign it on our second
car<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:02.340> went<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.820> an<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.210> style<00:01:03.539> frame<00:01:04.100> we

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
car we went with an a style frame we

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
car we went with an a style frame we
decided<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.700> move<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> mousetrap<00:01:06.509> to<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
decided to move the mousetrap to the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
decided to move the mousetrap to the
front<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.220> our<00:01:08.340> swing<00:01:08.610> arm<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.210> would

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
front so with our swing arm it would

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.639 
front so with our swing arm it would
extend<00:01:09.750> back<00:01:10.110> right<00:01:10.470> above<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.009> rear<00:01:11.640> axle<00:01:12.649> we

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
extend back right above the rear axle we

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.289 
extend back right above the rear axle we
use<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> smaller<00:01:14.369> wheels<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> front<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
use the smaller wheels in the front the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.359 
use the smaller wheels in the front the
same<00:01:15.479> design<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:15.899> used<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> first<00:01:16.500> car<00:01:16.830> we

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
same design we used on the first car we

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.690 
same design we used on the first car we
decided<00:01:17.490> those<00:01:17.909> wheels<00:01:18.119> were<00:01:18.299> good<00:01:19.700> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
decided those wheels were good the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.359 
decided those wheels were good the
construction<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.810> rear<00:01:21.990> axle<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:23.159> did<00:01:23.340> a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
construction on the rear axle we did a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.020 
construction on the rear axle we did a
lot<00:01:23.610> differently<00:01:24.229> we<00:01:25.229> had<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.440> fixed<00:01:25.799> dowel<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
lot differently we had a fixed dowel and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.170 
lot differently we had a fixed dowel and
we<00:01:27.299> had<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.869> spindle<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:29.039> the<00:01:29.220> CDs<00:01:29.580> connected

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
we had a spindle with the CDs connected

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.690 
we had a spindle with the CDs connected
we<00:01:31.050> used<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.350> bigger<00:01:31.560> circumference<00:01:32.100> wheel<00:01:32.429> so

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
we used a bigger circumference wheel so

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.520 
we used a bigger circumference wheel so
that<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.909> could<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.149> more<00:01:33.390> traction<00:01:33.690> with

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that we could have more traction with

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.649 
that we could have more traction with
the<00:01:34.649> rubber<00:01:34.830> band<00:01:35.130> around<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.640> which<00:01:36.300> helped

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the rubber band around it which helped

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.370 
the rubber band around it which helped
out<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> lot<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:39.149> things<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.539> do<00:01:39.690> different

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
out a lot the things we do different

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.830 
out a lot the things we do different
next<00:01:40.409> time<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.789> would<00:01:41.940> try<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.630> more

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
next time is we would try to get more

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.980 
next time is we would try to get more
torque<00:01:43.229> out<00:01:43.440> of<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.649> car<00:01:44.450> we<00:01:45.450> would<00:01:45.600> shorten

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
torque out of the car we would shorten

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.180 
torque out of the car we would shorten
up<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.710> swing<00:01:47.039> arm<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.830> goes<00:01:49.950> more

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
up the swing arm so that it goes more

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.969 
up the swing arm so that it goes more
straight<00:01:50.640> we'd<00:01:51.270> also<00:01:51.479> put<00:01:52.049> less<00:01:52.289> wobble<00:01:52.860> in

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
straight we'd also put less wobble in

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.109 
straight we'd also put less wobble in
the<00:01:53.159> axle<00:01:53.580> and<00:01:54.530> we'd<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.740> more<00:01:55.950> trials<00:01:56.459> so<00:01:57.000> we

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the axle and we'd do more trials so we

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:06.090 
the axle and we'd do more trials so we
can't

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.380 

all<00:02:07.100> right<00:02:07.190> there's<00:02:07.370> a<00:02:07.430> few<00:02:07.640> limitations<00:02:08.210> this

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
all right there's a few limitations this

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.900 
all right there's a few limitations this
model<00:02:08.810> one<00:02:09.770> of<00:02:09.800> them<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.130> a<00:02:10.160> can<00:02:10.399> only<00:02:10.520> go<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:10.820> a

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
model one of them is a can only go in a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.940 
model one of them is a can only go in a

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
linear direction it can't at all change

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.760 
linear direction it can't at all change

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
of friction allowed the car and the

lots of rear-wheel contact with the
ground<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:42.290> did<00:02:42.500> this<00:02:42.680> by<00:02:42.829> having<00:02:43.069> a<00:02:43.159> bigger

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
ground we did this by having a bigger

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.490 
ground we did this by having a bigger
circumference<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.939> the<00:02:44.060> wheel<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:45.319> that

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
circumference of the wheel and that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.920 
circumference of the wheel and that
contact<00:02:45.980> allowed<00:02:46.879> it<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.090> also<00:02:47.629> have<00:02:47.900> that

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
contact allowed it to also have that

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.069 
contact allowed it to also have that
friction<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:49.549> we<00:02:49.730> also<00:02:49.879> did<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.299> by<00:02:50.480> adding

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
friction and we also did that by adding

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.619 
friction and we also did that by adding
the<00:02:51.260> rubber<00:02:51.500> band<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:51.980> rear<00:02:52.159> tire<00:02:52.629> through

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
the rubber band to the rear tire through

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.319 
the rubber band to the rear tire through
the<00:02:53.780> trial<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.379> error<00:02:54.620> process<00:02:55.000> we<00:02:56.000> learned

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
the trial and error process we learned

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.140 
the trial and error process we learned
that<00:02:56.599> if<00:02:57.079> we<00:02:57.140> had<00:02:57.379> a<00:02:57.409> longer<00:02:57.709> swing<00:02:58.250> arm<00:02:58.489> it

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
that if we had a longer swing arm it

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.660 
that if we had a longer swing arm it
helped<00:02:59.629> control<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.590> force<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.400> pull

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
helped control the force of the pull

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.649 
helped control the force of the pull
from<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:02.030> back<00:03:02.299> strap<00:03:03.790> which<00:03:04.790> helped<00:03:05.180> control

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
from the back strap which helped control

I<00:03:10.269> just<00:03:11.269> seen<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.480> weight<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.989> car

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
I just seen the weight of the car

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.460 
I just seen the weight of the car
allowed<00:03:13.129> for<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.519> pole<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.909> mousetrap<00:03:14.470> to

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
allowed for the pole of the mousetrap to

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.039 
allowed for the pole of the mousetrap to
allow<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.799> car<00:03:16.069> to<00:03:16.220> accelerate<00:03:17.049> more

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
allow the car to accelerate more

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.379 
allow the car to accelerate more
effectively<00:03:18.859> as<00:03:19.519> far<00:03:19.700> as<00:03:19.790> about<00:03:19.939> half<00:03:20.180> the
