because today I'm going to show you how

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.170 
because today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:25.500> replace<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.919> headlight<00:00:26.369> assembly<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.000> your

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
to replace a headlight assembly on your

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.740 
to replace a headlight assembly on your
car

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
car

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.779 
car
now<00:00:28.320> modern<00:00:28.560> headlight<00:00:29.039> assemblies<00:00:29.519> are<00:00:29.640> much

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
now modern headlight assemblies are much

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.269 
now modern headlight assemblies are much
more<00:00:29.939> complex<00:00:30.390> than<00:00:30.509> all<00:00:30.720> cars<00:00:31.050> they<00:00:31.919> come<00:00:32.129> in

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
more complex than all cars they come in

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.530 
more complex than all cars they come in
sections<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:32.879> you<00:00:32.970> got<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> take<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> whole

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
sections so you got to take a whole

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.390 
sections so you got to take a whole
bunch<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.899> stuff<00:00:34.140> off<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.710> order<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.980> get<00:00:35.190> to

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
bunch of stuff off in order to get to

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.759 
bunch of stuff off in order to get to
them<00:00:35.629> so<00:00:36.629> the<00:00:36.750> first<00:00:36.780> thing<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.409> do<00:00:37.589> is

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
them so the first thing we have to do is

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.640 
them so the first thing we have to do is
unbolt<00:00:37.949> this<00:00:38.309> cover<00:00:38.900> it<00:00:39.900> covers<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.409> front

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
unbolt this cover it covers the front

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.610 
unbolt this cover it covers the front
bumper<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.629> case<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.019> gotta<00:00:43.199> unbolt

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
bumper and in this case you gotta unbolt

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.689 
bumper and in this case you gotta unbolt
the<00:00:43.769> bottom<00:00:44.129> parts<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.699> wear<00:00:46.129> and<00:00:47.129> take<00:00:47.489> off

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
the bottom parts to wear and take off

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.030 
the bottom parts to wear and take off
the<00:00:47.909> turn<00:00:48.120> signal<00:00:48.629> there<00:00:48.809> get<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:50.010> of

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
the turn signal there get that out of

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.340 
the turn signal there get that out of
the<00:00:50.220> way<00:00:50.340> because<00:00:51.149> hiding<00:00:51.660> inside<00:00:51.960> here<00:00:52.230> are

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
the way because hiding inside here are

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.830 
the way because hiding inside here are
two<00:00:52.530> 10<00:00:52.769> millimeter<00:00:52.800> bolts<00:00:53.730> they<00:00:54.359> hold<00:00:54.629> this

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
two 10 millimeter bolts they hold this

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.479 
two 10 millimeter bolts they hold this
part<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.590> got<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.859> bolt<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.190> off<00:00:56.280> from

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
part in and you got to bolt it off from

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.849 
part in and you got to bolt it off from
the<00:00:56.640> inside<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.260> stick<00:00:58.649> your<00:00:58.800> hand

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the inside so just stick your hand

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.180 
the inside so just stick your hand
inside<00:00:59.219> and<00:01:00.350> start<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.469> both<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> ten

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
inside and start on both with a ten

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.359 
inside and start on both with a ten
millimeter<00:01:02.399> wrench<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:04.589> out<00:01:04.739> comes<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.160> bolt

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
millimeter wrench and out comes the bolt

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.900 
millimeter wrench and out comes the bolt
then<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.750> pull<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.140> half<00:01:07.380> off<00:01:07.910> to

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
then you can just pull this half off to

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.999 
then you can just pull this half off to
access<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> headlight<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.080> if<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.710> notice

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
assembly rowdy because then you know

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.380 
assembly rowdy because then you know
here's<00:01:23.190> the<00:01:23.280> mounting<00:01:23.700> bolts<00:01:23.849> and<00:01:24.239> here's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
here's the mounting bolts and here's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.969 
here's the mounting bolts and here's
another<00:01:24.509> mounting<00:01:25.050> bug<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.739> there's

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
another mounting bug you know there's

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.290 
another mounting bug you know there's
only<00:01:26.069> three<00:01:26.429> and<00:01:26.489> you<00:01:26.640> know<00:01:26.670> where<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.149> take

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
only three and you know where to take

only three and you know where to take
them<00:01:27.450> off<00:01:27.599> now<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.590> bottom<00:01:28.979> bolt<00:01:29.099> doesn't

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
them off now the bottom bolt doesn't

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.040 
them off now the bottom bolt doesn't
have<00:01:29.640> much<00:01:29.819> working<00:01:30.239> room<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.599> I'm<00:01:30.690> using<00:01:30.899> a

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
have much working room so I'm using a

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.449 
have much working room so I'm using a
quarter<00:01:31.440> inch<00:01:31.619> socket<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.190> a<00:01:32.220> ten

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
quarter inch socket with a ten

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.219

millimeter<00:01:32.700> cuz<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.300> small<00:01:33.539> and<00:01:33.569> it'll<00:01:34.020> fit

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
millimeter cuz it's small and it'll fit

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.290 
millimeter cuz it's small and it'll fit
in<00:01:34.349> the<00:01:34.440> hole<00:01:34.619> it'll<00:01:35.610> fit<00:01:35.819> right<00:01:35.849> in<00:01:36.179> the

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
in the hole it'll fit right in the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.139 
in the hole it'll fit right in the
bottom<00:01:36.660> here<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.080> then<00:01:37.819> you<00:01:38.819> can<00:01:38.910> get<00:01:39.060> it

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
bottom here and then you can get it

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.859 
bottom here and then you can get it
right<00:01:39.360> off

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
right off

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.229 
right off

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:49.379 
mechanic's tip for buying a new assembly

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:51.260 
mechanic's tip for buying a new assembly
they're<00:01:49.679> pretty<00:01:49.890> expensive<00:01:50.160> so<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.910> just

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
they're pretty expensive so I just

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.180 
they're pretty expensive so I just
google<00:01:51.660> it<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.929> find<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.500> cheapest<00:01:52.979> one

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190
