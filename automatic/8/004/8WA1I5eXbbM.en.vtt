00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.970
 what do we continue to play on the tank until 28 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.330
 go square-1 to the heavy tank want to 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.250
 him play pump it see 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.830
 what is he like 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.670
 Well, in general, the game on the T-28 does not bring 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.830
 the moment is just huge huge 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.410
 delight 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.109
 shrapnel shells is just 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.519
 phenomenal phenomenal shells 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.029
 breaks almost everyone on it 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.820
 level 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.250
 I do not know how in reality you whether these 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.010
 shells are effective but in the game they just 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.780
 awesome 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.579
 so what are we doing in this fight we are going to 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.100
 point a 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.170
 the former. ah here before it was 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.260
 try to capture it hold this 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.670
 position well and in the future just go 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.620
 on the base of opponents and go to them from the rear 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:00.050
 if we succeed we will be able to 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.050
 win well then 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.689
 first opponent 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:14.110
 vanshot here and so that's enough 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.400
 shrapnel projectiles are excellent as well as already 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.400
 spoke unfortunately they are random sometimes 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:27.010
 either you donâ€™t apply anything either 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:33.130
 bring vanshot as it is now 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:35.500
 two opponents destroyed so and there 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:42.940
 somewhere peteshechka is worth not see to 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:47.100
 sorry for the mountains for the forests plus here 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.570
 from this tank t-28 is still that he 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.320
 quite tenacious he has huge in 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.230
 dimensions thereby when it hurts 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.900
 do not always destroy any critically 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:04.470
 important modules such as motor or 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:09.310
 the crew thus you continue to live 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.490
 continue to inflict damage to 3 opponents 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.490
 defeated 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.600
 but in general 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.010
 t28 is currently one of those tanks 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.040
 which is really nice to play on 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.010
 is some kind of imba monstrous imba 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.260
 but now he started this one 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.260
 a mistake a very serious mistake 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.490
 Well, I won't give you three opponents 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.490
 it's all the same nice 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.000
 and so again the ashen river again without 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.420
 the same forest by try this time already 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.739
 not so rashly to play last time 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.260
 I flew to the thing made of course 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:06.459
 the mistake is thereby embodied paid 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.060
 access to the hangar I hope this time and 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.540
 I will not make the mistake try 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.840
 more or less 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.860
 Carefully play this tank he gives 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.040
 such a sense of security perhaps because of 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.650
 that you just fly at enemies 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.459
 and in fact the tank is still fragile 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.650
 armor as such no and yes he 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.440
 big hefty but if it shoots 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.670
 critical module then you 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.840
 of course go straight to the hangar 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.840
 so don't forget about it 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.030
 any feeling 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.519
 self preservation must be present 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.930
 unfortunately I am practically alone here 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:52.329
 no t-34 yet with me now try 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.600
 push this direction last time 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.519
 I have quite successfully turned 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.019
 svanshot three opponents 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.019
 let's see how it will be now 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.910
 until the enemies are visible, first went 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.910
 missed 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.090
 so try again in the same direction 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.000
 go see what it is now! 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.040
 will end now I will not be so 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.970
 recklessly go straight to the enemy 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:36.830
 block + not here now ally will help 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:40.560
 I hope it will help and puddle or well and 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:44.760
 again vanshot before stages for three but all 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:50.580
 equal wide panel shells at given 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:54.290
 the moment is doing wonders so hope there is not 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.290
 there will be no opponents on the side 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:10.970
 the target was intact so here they are 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:14.120
 random shells and again did not hurt 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:19.640
 who stage 4 as I understand there is at 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:25.400
 for three all destroyed great going 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:29.990
 forward and we are still tentative like me 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:34.420
 I understand we win while the initiative for 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:41.990
 we kind of like more tanks 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:42.620
 Well try to drag that no doubt 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.960
 will be 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:52.340
 certainly plus now we are slowly but 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:54.580
 right we move to the rear and the first 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.580
 enemy 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.650
 to vanshot 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.360
 just wonderful shrapnel shells don't 

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:14.729
 I know why I used to be on this tank 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:19.229
 played probably no reason not to 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.229
 the hits are great 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.919
 still getting hit by a strong guy 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:45.470
 czech tank surprisingly lives you even 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:52.599
 not trying to go to the hangar so hard here 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:52.599
 vyselivat dice get here so here 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:04.000
 and somewhere here the enemy 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:07.820
 was on the side we need to move forward 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.210
 this is this strange in the back of the tower is not 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.210
 struck 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.080
 fine 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.160
 now we will finish this Czech 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:29.530
 boyfriend 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:34.570
 where the wives are fine here and go further 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:35.290
 first line there someone else is worth it 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.990
 bt-7 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:44.950
 Well, sort of destructible 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:49.080
 great little rasinh chick we're going 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:54.010
 forward four opponents already and bt-7 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:56.410
 well and at the moment it's one of 

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.580
 most pleasant tanks one of the most 

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:01.380
 noticeable on 

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:03.400
 on this wave let's say so on wave 

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.530
 closed beta 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.470
 Well, I hope you enjoyed it 

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:11.400
 I hope something else will write well and to 

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.400
 See you all bye
