in response to our video on how to swing
a<00:00:11.550> rope<00:00:11.929> had<00:00:12.929> several<00:00:13.320> requests<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:14.790> how<00:00:15.030> to

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
a rope had several requests on how to

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.279 
a rope had several requests on how to
throw<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:17.210> lariat<00:00:18.210> room<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.779> I'm<00:00:19.020> going<00:00:19.230> to

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
throw a lariat room so I'm going to

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.439 
throw a lariat room so I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:19.710> here<00:00:19.920> simple<00:00:20.789> technique<00:00:21.150> for

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
demonstrate here simple technique for

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.580 
demonstrate here simple technique for
learning<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:22.279> throw<00:00:23.279> or<00:00:23.730> as<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.449> say

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
learning to throw or as I like to say

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.859 
learning to throw or as I like to say
deliver<00:00:25.590> your<00:00:25.740> loop<00:00:25.949> because<00:00:26.789> actually<00:00:27.240> you

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
deliver your loop because actually you

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.300 
deliver your loop because actually you
don't<00:00:28.019> really<00:00:28.140> want<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.410> throw<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:29.099> you

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
don't really want to throw it like you

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.510 
don't really want to throw it like you
would<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.630> baseball<00:00:30.630> or<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> rock<00:00:31.320> although<00:00:32.130> your

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
would a baseball or a rock although your

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.910 
would a baseball or a rock although your
arm<00:00:32.700> does<00:00:33.000> extend<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.500> would<00:00:34.649> if<00:00:34.800> you're

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
arm does extend as it would if you're

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.470 
arm does extend as it would if you're
throwing<00:00:35.160> another<00:00:35.250> object<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.090> difference

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
throwing another object the difference

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.790 
throwing another object the difference
is<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.860> you<00:00:37.860> need<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> wait<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.540> tip<00:00:39.800> when

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
is that you need to wait on the tip when

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.139 
is that you need to wait on the tip when
your<00:00:40.920> tip<00:00:41.129> gets<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> point<00:00:41.850> where<00:00:42.030> that

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
your tip gets to the point where that

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.600 
your tip gets to the point where that
momentum<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.980> pulling<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> loop<00:00:44.219> out<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.430> your

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
momentum is pulling the loop out of your

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.060 
momentum is pulling the loop out of your
hand<00:00:44.850> that's<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.329> release<00:00:45.629> point<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.289> you're

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
hand that's your release point so you're

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.290 
hand that's your release point so you're
not<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.370> much<00:00:47.550> throwing<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.180> are

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
not so much throwing is you are

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
not so much throwing is you are
releasing<00:00:48.690> at<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> correct<00:00:49.289> time<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.739> then

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
releasing at the correct time and then

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.650 
releasing at the correct time and then
what's<00:00:50.879> more<00:00:51.059> important<00:00:51.390> than<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.510> is

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
what's more important than that is

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.350 
what's more important than that is
following<00:00:52.590> through<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:53.070> delivery<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
following through with your delivery to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.660 
following through with your delivery to
help<00:00:54.629> bring<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.899> natural<00:00:55.890> momentum<00:00:56.280> that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
help bring that natural momentum that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.060 
help bring that natural momentum that
you've<00:00:56.820> created<00:00:57.059> by<00:00:57.300> swinging<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:57.809> loop

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
you've created by swinging your loop

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.470 
you've created by swinging your loop
especially<00:00:59.070> when<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.059> trying<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> rope

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
especially when you're trying to rope

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.319 
especially when you're trying to rope
the<00:01:00.690> horns<00:01:01.079> or<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.160> feet<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.640> matter<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the horns or the feet for that matter to

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.270 
the horns or the feet for that matter to
help<00:01:03.719> continue<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.350> rotation<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> loop

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
help continue that rotation of the loop

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.550 
help continue that rotation of the loop
around<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.820> capture<00:01:06.150> your<00:01:06.270> target<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.470> what

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
around to capture your target so what

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.170 
around to capture your target so what
we're<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:07.890> here<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.880> try<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
we're going to do here is just try to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.109 
we're going to do here is just try to
note<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.720> point<00:01:10.020> where<00:01:10.260> our<00:01:10.909> loop<00:01:11.909> is

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
note the point where our loop is

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.530 
note the point where our loop is
starting<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.770> try<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> rotate<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.060> pull<00:01:15.270> out

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
starting to try to rotate and pull out

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.490 
starting to try to rotate and pull out
of<00:01:15.570> our<00:01:15.750> hand<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.020> little<00:01:16.140> bit<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.409> that

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
of our hand a little bit and that

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.260 
of our hand a little bit and that
generally<00:01:16.830> happens<00:01:17.159> when<00:01:17.369> your<00:01:17.729> top<00:01:17.939> strand

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
generally happens when your top strand

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.560 
generally happens when your top strand
starts<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.720> turn<00:01:18.869> over<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.070> point<00:01:20.570> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
starts to turn over at this point and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.120 
starts to turn over at this point and
that's<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> point<00:01:22.200> where<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.710> want<00:01:22.950> to

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that's the point where you want to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.289 
that's the point where you want to
release<00:01:23.340> your<00:01:23.520> rope<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:23.970> don't<00:01:24.150> really

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
release your rope and you don't really

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.530 
release your rope and you don't really
have<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.659> try<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> swing<00:01:25.860> hard<00:01:26.159> or<00:01:26.490> deliver<00:01:27.420> it

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
have to try to swing hard or deliver it

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.630 
have to try to swing hard or deliver it
hard<00:01:27.860> your<00:01:28.860> loop<00:01:29.040> will<00:01:29.189> generally<00:01:29.549> have

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
hard your loop will generally have

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.130 
hard your loop will generally have
enough<00:01:29.909> momentum<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.450> carry<00:01:30.630> towards<00:01:30.990> your

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
enough momentum to carry towards your

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.800 
enough momentum to carry towards your
target<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.860> remember<00:01:32.280> once<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.820> deliver<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
target but remember once you deliver you

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
target but remember once you deliver you
want<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.200> ahead<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.650> continue<00:01:34.920> finish

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
want to go ahead and continue finish

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.580 
want to go ahead and continue finish
follow-through<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.720> you're<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.470> know

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
follow-through is if you're you know

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.170 
follow-through is if you're you know
letting<00:01:37.979> go<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.369> rope<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:38.790> important

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
letting go of the rope that's important

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.080 
letting go of the rope that's important
part<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.540> need<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.840> release<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.740> rope<00:01:41.090> when

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
part you need to release the rope when

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
part you need to release the rope when
it<00:01:42.210> gets<00:01:42.360> out<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.810> point<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.920> hold<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
it gets out to that point but hold on to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.550 
it gets out to that point but hold on to
it<00:01:44.549> long<00:01:44.729> enough<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.170> helps<00:01:46.290> bring

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
it long enough so that it helps bring

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.260 
it long enough so that it helps bring
the<00:01:46.619> tip<00:01:46.860> around<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:47.790> hand<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the tip around and your hand is in a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.660 
the tip around and your hand is in a
position<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.899> grab<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.590> slack<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.460> I'm<00:01:50.520> going

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
position to grab the slack so I'm going

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.279 
position to grab the slack so I'm going
to<00:01:50.729> demonstrate<00:01:50.880> here
