gonna put this little Valentine's plate
now<00:04:44.000> if<00:04:44.090> you<00:04:44.210> have<00:04:44.360> a<00:04:44.390> smaller<00:04:44.840> silicon<00:04:45.500> or<00:04:45.800> a

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
now if you have a smaller silicon or a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.520 
now if you have a smaller silicon or a
tray<00:04:46.370> with<00:04:46.550> smaller<00:04:46.880> hearts<00:04:47.390> in<00:04:47.600> it<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:48.440> would

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
tray with smaller hearts in it you would

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.380 
tray with smaller hearts in it you would
probably<00:04:48.740> get<00:04:49.130> more<00:04:49.460> this<00:04:49.760> is<00:04:49.820> just<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.240> one

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
probably get more this is just the one

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.140 
probably get more this is just the one
that<00:04:50.540> I<00:04:50.570> found<00:04:51.020> and<00:04:51.500> it<00:04:52.220> was<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.730> little<00:04:52.970> bit

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
that I found and it was a little bit

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.900 
that I found and it was a little bit
larger<00:04:53.690> but<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:54.650> know<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:55.040> Wilton<00:04:55.430> makes<00:04:55.640> one

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
larger but I know that Wilton makes one

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.640 
larger but I know that Wilton makes one
that<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.330> hearts<00:04:56.630> are<00:04:56.780> a<00:04:56.810> lot<00:04:56.990> smaller<00:04:57.350> so<00:04:57.620> you

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
that the hearts are a lot smaller so you

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:16.670 
that the hearts are a lot smaller so you
could<00:04:57.860> get<00:04:58.010> a<00:04:58.040> lot<00:04:58.220> more<00:04:58.280> candy<00:04:58.820> out<00:04:58.940> of<00:04:59.120> it

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.490 

so<00:05:17.250> this<00:05:17.430> is<00:05:17.550> what<00:05:17.729> they<00:05:17.850> look<00:05:18.030> like<00:05:21.350> these<00:05:22.350> are

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
so this is what they look like these are

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.070 
so this is what they look like these are
Valentine's<00:05:23.070> Day<00:05:23.430> white<00:05:23.820> chocolate<00:05:24.180> bark<00:05:24.720> I

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
Valentine's Day white chocolate bark I

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:49.519 
Valentine's Day white chocolate bark I
hope<00:05:25.830> you<00:05:26.009> enjoy<00:05:26.340> them

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529
