00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.980 
what's going on guys welcome back to
another<00:00:31.040> hybrid<00:00:31.400> character<00:00:32.090> video<00:00:32.360> class<00:00:32.720> and

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
another hybrid character video class and

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.960 
another hybrid character video class and
in<00:00:33.050> this<00:00:33.140> video<00:00:33.320> we'll<00:00:33.530> be<00:00:33.590> looking<00:00:33.710> at<00:00:34.070> what<00:00:34.130> a

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
in this video we'll be looking at what a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.070 
in this video we'll be looking at what a
ranger<00:00:35.810> is<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.380> what<00:00:36.920> I<00:00:36.950> would<00:00:37.160> think<00:00:37.489> that<00:00:38.080> he

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
ranger is and what I would think that he

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.369 
ranger is and what I would think that he
would<00:00:39.110> be<00:00:39.410> portrayed<00:00:39.860> as<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:41.420> Ranger<00:00:42.230> is

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
would be portrayed as and the Ranger is

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.940 
would be portrayed as and the Ranger is
basically<00:00:43.040> a<00:00:43.070> Nord<00:00:43.730> I<00:00:44.090> would<00:00:44.870> feel<00:00:45.440> that<00:00:45.680> the

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
basically a Nord I would feel that the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.790 
basically a Nord I would feel that the
Nord<00:00:46.280> would<00:00:46.580> portray<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.330> Ranger<00:00:47.720> as<00:00:47.960> best<00:00:48.440> as

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
Nord would portray the Ranger as best as

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.920 
Nord would portray the Ranger as best as
any<00:00:49.309> other<00:00:49.400> character<00:00:49.910> in<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:50.330> game<00:00:50.450> you

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
any other character in this game you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.840 
any other character in this game you
could<00:00:51.110> now<00:00:51.830> the<00:00:51.890> Breton<00:00:52.280> doesn't<00:00:52.489> really<00:00:52.610> fit

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
could now the Breton doesn't really fit

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.510 
could now the Breton doesn't really fit
him<00:00:52.970> the<00:00:53.540> Imperial<00:00:54.290> could<00:00:54.559> fit<00:00:54.890> him<00:00:55.070> and<00:00:55.309> the

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
him the Imperial could fit him and the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.000 
him the Imperial could fit him and the
orc<00:00:55.879> would<00:00:56.180> be<00:00:56.690> probably<00:00:57.370> be<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.519> second

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
orc would be probably be the second

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.000 
orc would be probably be the second
priority<00:01:01.010> wise<00:01:01.659> but<00:01:02.659> the<00:01:03.080> norwood<00:01:03.559> be<00:01:03.680> above

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
priority wise but the norwood be above

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.090 
priority wise but the norwood be above
him<00:01:04.309> so<00:01:05.059> you'd<00:01:05.330> have<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:05.750> Nord<00:01:06.110> being<00:01:06.979> the

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
him so you'd have the Nord being the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.620 
him so you'd have the Nord being the
Ranger<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.610> Rangers<00:01:07.970> basically<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.390> dual

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
Ranger and the Rangers basically a dual

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.020 
Ranger and the Rangers basically a dual
flurry<00:01:10.240> combatant<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.920> we'll<00:01:12.920> also<00:01:13.250> use<00:01:13.460> a

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
flurry combatant and we'll also use a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.050 
flurry combatant and we'll also use a
bow<00:01:14.510> if<00:01:14.810> needed<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.040> can<00:01:16.550> think<00:01:16.670> about<00:01:16.820> him

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
bow if needed so you can think about him

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.800 
bow if needed so you can think about him
as<00:01:17.210> basically<00:01:17.540> a<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:18.110> July<00:01:18.799> tur<00:01:19.600> I'll<00:01:20.600> go<00:01:20.780> with

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
as basically a a July tur I'll go with

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.120 
as basically a a July tur I'll go with
the<00:01:21.020> North<00:01:21.200> because<00:01:21.440> he<00:01:21.500> already<00:01:21.620> has<00:01:21.799> a<00:01:21.830> point

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
the North because he already has a point

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.390 
the North because he already has a point
bonus<00:01:22.370> and<00:01:22.760> one-handed<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:23.990> light<00:01:24.710> armor

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
bonus and one-handed and light armor

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.800 
bonus and one-handed and light armor
which<00:01:25.520> is<00:01:25.670> basically<00:01:26.180> what<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.630> going<00:01:26.780> to

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
which is basically what is going to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.570 
which is basically what is going to
round<00:01:27.170> up<00:01:27.290> our<00:01:27.409> character<00:01:27.680> right<00:01:27.979> at<00:01:28.220> right

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
round up our character right at right

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.980 
round up our character right at right
off<00:01:28.760> at<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:28.970> beginning<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:29.450> then<00:01:29.570> he<00:01:29.869> also

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
off at the beginning and then he also

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.550 
off at the beginning and then he also
has<00:01:30.289> increase<00:01:31.159> on<00:01:31.369> smithing<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.180> block<00:01:32.689> which

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
has increase on smithing and block which

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.060

like to kind of zoom in stuff like that

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.690 
like to kind of zoom in stuff like that
but<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.630> basically<00:03:29.290> only<00:03:29.739> grabbed<00:03:30.160> five<00:03:30.430> out<00:03:30.610> of

but I basically only grabbed five out of
five<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.239> then<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.680> basically<00:03:32.980> your

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
five and then so basically your

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.850 
five and then so basically your
character<00:03:33.549> is<00:03:33.610> going<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.820> be<00:03:34.620> pulling<00:03:35.620> off

guys from distance with archery and then

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.110 
guys from distance with archery and then
once<00:03:39.519> you<00:03:39.730> finish<00:03:40.090> with<00:03:40.239> that<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:41.380> go<00:03:41.620> into

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
once you finish with that you go into

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.520 
once you finish with that you go into
one-handed

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
one-handed

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.670 
one-handed
and<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:44.310> use<00:03:45.000> your<00:03:45.120> dual<00:03:45.330> flurry<00:03:45.780> which<00:03:46.530> is

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
and you use your dual flurry which is

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.380 
and you use your dual flurry which is
not<00:03:46.890> so<00:03:47.130> bad<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.550> then<00:03:47.730> light<00:03:47.970> armor<00:03:48.270> you're

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
not so bad and then light armor you're

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.540 
not so bad and then light armor you're
basically<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.840> grab<00:03:49.020> everything<00:03:49.400> so<00:03:50.400> you're

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
basically to grab everything so you're

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.610 
basically to grab everything so you're
going<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.730> be<00:03:50.880> doing<00:03:51.120> agile<00:03:51.420> defender<00:03:52.260> 5<00:03:52.470> out

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
going to be doing agile defender 5 out

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.340 
going to be doing agile defender 5 out
of<00:03:52.650> 5<00:03:52.740> so<00:03:53.250> you're<00:03:53.930> increasing<00:03:54.930> your<00:03:54.959> armory

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
of 5 so you're increasing your armory

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.160 
of 5 so you're increasing your armory
rating<00:03:55.740> by<00:03:55.920> from<00:03:56.910> light<00:03:57.180> arm<00:03:57.360> by<00:03:57.600> one<00:03:58.050> hundred

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
rating by from light arm by one hundred

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.490 
rating by from light arm by one hundred
percent<00:03:58.350> so<00:03:58.740> it's<00:03:58.890> going<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.040> uh<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.810> twice<00:04:01.350> as

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
percent so it's going to uh so twice as

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.340 
percent so it's going to uh so twice as
much<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.670> then<00:04:03.000> custom-fit<00:04:03.540> grab<00:04:03.750> custom-fit

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
much and then custom-fit grab custom-fit

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.430 
much and then custom-fit grab custom-fit
unhindered<00:04:05.300> windwalker<00:04:06.300> deft<00:04:06.810> movement<00:04:07.020> and

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
unhindered windwalker deft movement and

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.729 
unhindered windwalker deft movement and
matching<00:04:07.800> set<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.370> all<00:04:08.850> this<00:04:09.060> will<00:04:09.300> basically

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
matching set and all this will basically

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.320 
matching set and all this will basically
increase<00:04:10.739> your<00:04:12.200> armor<00:04:13.200> rating<00:04:13.380> on<00:04:13.830> your<00:04:14.459> while

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
increase your armor rating on your while

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.580 
increase your armor rating on your while
using<00:04:15.540> light<00:04:15.870> armor<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:16.260> you're<00:04:16.350> going<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.530> be

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
using light armor so you're going to be

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.259 
using light armor so you're going to be
using<00:04:16.709> light<00:04:17.040> armor<00:04:17.370> so<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.609> don't<00:04:17.880> lose<00:04:18.060> as

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
using light armor so you don't lose as

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.849 
using light armor so you don't lose as
much<00:04:18.450> stamina<00:04:18.750> having<00:04:19.230> to<00:04:19.350> run<00:04:19.530> all<00:04:19.709> that

gear maybe or make some yourself so you

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.090 
gear maybe or make some yourself so you
