00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
round areas that you might see

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.650 
round areas that you might see
throughout<00:04:12.220> Central<00:04:12.550> Pennsylvania<00:04:12.660> they

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
throughout Central Pennsylvania they

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.960 
throughout Central Pennsylvania they
were<00:04:13.720> used<00:04:14.020> over<00:04:14.350> and<00:04:14.440> over<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.770> over<00:04:14.970> several

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
were used over and over and over several

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.180 
were used over and over and over several
times<00:04:16.180> in<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.420> season<00:04:16.600> so<00:04:17.380> if<00:04:17.530> we<00:04:17.680> just<00:04:17.859> let<00:04:18.010> this

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
times in a season so if we just let this

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.190 
times in a season so if we just let this
pit<00:04:18.459> here<00:04:18.730> clogging<00:04:19.269> up<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.540> pit<00:04:19.750> or<00:04:20.019> this

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
pit here clogging up the pit or this

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.230 
pit here clogging up the pit or this
this<00:04:20.470> mound<00:04:20.769> here<00:04:21.010> clogging<00:04:21.370> up<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.489> pit<00:04:21.760> then

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
this mound here clogging up the pit then

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.820 
this mound here clogging up the pit then
that's<00:04:22.420> one<00:04:22.660> extra<00:04:22.990> day<00:04:23.140> or<00:04:23.290> two<00:04:23.320> extra<00:04:23.620> days

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
that's one extra day or two extra days

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.980 
that's one extra day or two extra days
that<00:04:23.980> this<00:04:24.100> pit<00:04:24.340> can't<00:04:24.670> be<00:04:24.820> put<00:04:25.480> into<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.780> next

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
that this pit can't be put into the next

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.290 
that this pit can't be put into the next
burn<00:04:26.200> so<00:04:26.920> the<00:04:27.070> sooner<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.580> charcoal<00:04:27.970> can<00:04:28.180> be

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
burn so the sooner the charcoal can be

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.830 
burn so the sooner the charcoal can be
harvested<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.230> the<00:04:29.740> process<00:04:30.190> begins<00:04:30.520> again

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
harvested and the process begins again

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.510 
harvested and the process begins again
the<00:04:31.840> more<00:04:32.050> maximum<00:04:32.650> production<00:04:32.950> you<00:04:33.190> can<00:04:33.220> get

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
the more maximum production you can get

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:42.330 
the more maximum production you can get
in<00:04:33.670> a<00:04:33.730> season<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:41.500> I<00:04:41.620> think<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:41.980> charring

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
in a season and I think the charring

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.760 
in a season and I think the charring
process<00:04:42.790> has<00:04:42.970> pretty<00:04:43.180> much<00:04:43.350> come<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.500> an<00:04:44.620> end

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
process has pretty much come to an end

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.070 
process has pretty much come to an end
as<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.820> saying<00:04:46.060> goes<00:04:46.270> that<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.720> mound<00:04:46.900> has

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
as the saying goes that the mound has

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.740 
as the saying goes that the mound has
now<00:04:47.200> come<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.530> foot<00:04:47.980> so<00:04:48.610> now<00:04:49.120> is<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.390> time<00:04:49.419> we

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
now come to foot so now is the time we

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.940 
now come to foot so now is the time we
get<00:04:49.870> ready<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:50.260> start<00:04:50.440> raking<00:04:50.620> out<00:04:50.830> the

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
get ready to start raking out the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.950 
get ready to start raking out the
charcoal<00:04:51.370> so<00:04:52.210> what<00:04:52.390> we're<00:04:52.510> going<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:52.660> do<00:04:52.810> is

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
charcoal so what we're going to do is

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.810 
charcoal so what we're going to do is
start<00:04:53.140> to<00:04:53.290> rake<00:04:53.470> out<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.800> coal<00:04:54.070> and<00:04:54.370> as<00:04:54.490> fires

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
start to rake out the coal and as fires

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.880 
start to rake out the coal and as fires
pop<00:04:55.210> up<00:04:55.450> we're<00:04:55.630> going<00:04:55.720> to<00:04:55.780> have<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.110> put<00:04:56.650> dirt

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
pop up we're going to have to put dirt

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.010 
pop up we're going to have to put dirt
on<00:04:57.070> those<00:04:57.340> fires<00:04:57.730> and<00:04:58.000> try<00:04:58.150> and<00:04:58.300> keep<00:04:58.419> it<00:04:58.600> under

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
on those fires and try and keep it under

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.580 
on those fires and try and keep it under
control<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:01.030> process<00:05:01.419> of<00:05:01.720> cooling<00:05:02.020> out<00:05:02.350> or

raking<00:05:02.890> out<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.250> coal<00:05:03.460> was<00:05:03.640> not<00:05:03.820> something

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
raking out the coal was not something

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.020 
raking out the coal was not something
you<00:05:04.270> did<00:05:04.419> haphazardly<00:05:05.169> or<00:05:05.320> quickly<00:05:06.030> instead

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
you did haphazardly or quickly instead

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.700 
you did haphazardly or quickly instead
just<00:05:07.240> a<00:05:07.419> few<00:05:07.660> bushels<00:05:08.050> at<00:05:08.169> a<00:05:08.229> time<00:05:08.440> would<00:05:08.590> be

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
just a few bushels at a time would be

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.580 
just a few bushels at a time would be
raked<00:05:08.950> out<00:05:09.130> using<00:05:09.790> a<00:05:09.970> Colliers<00:05:10.390> rake<00:05:10.690> and

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
raked out using a Colliers rake and

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.500 
raked out using a Colliers rake and
you'll<00:05:11.740> notice<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:12.160> tines<00:05:12.400> on<00:05:12.669> this<00:05:12.940> are

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
you'll notice the tines on this are

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.080 
you'll notice the tines on this are
quite<00:05:14.140> long<00:05:14.350> this<00:05:14.890> is<00:05:14.919> not<00:05:15.220> a<00:05:15.430> gardeners<00:05:15.880> rake

quite long this is not a gardeners rake
this<00:05:16.270> is<00:05:16.419> not<00:05:16.570> something<00:05:16.960> you<00:05:17.080> would<00:05:17.169> be<00:05:17.290> using

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
this is not something you would be using

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.140 
this is not something you would be using
for<00:05:17.770> any<00:05:17.890> other<00:05:18.040> purpose<00:05:18.430> except<00:05:18.729> raking<00:05:19.060> out

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
the charcoal and what we're going to be

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.810 
the charcoal and what we're going to be
doing<00:05:22.000> is<00:05:22.500> pulling<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.860> charcoal<00:05:24.310> through

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
doing is pulling the charcoal through

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
the dirt in other words instead of just

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.130 
the dirt in other words instead of just
raking<00:05:27.340> off<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.729> dirt<00:05:27.940> and<00:05:28.180> then<00:05:28.600> scooping

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
raking off the dirt and then scooping

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.780 
raking off the dirt and then scooping
out<00:05:29.200> charcoal<00:05:29.680> we're<00:05:30.280> actually<00:05:30.400> going<00:05:30.610> to<00:05:30.669> be

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
out charcoal we're actually going to be

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.040 
out charcoal we're actually going to be
trying<00:05:31.030> to<00:05:31.090> pull<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.419> charcoal<00:05:31.720> through<00:05:31.930> the

trying to pull the charcoal through the
dirt<00:05:32.229> and<00:05:32.740> what<00:05:32.919> that<00:05:33.070> will<00:05:33.190> do<00:05:33.340> is<00:05:33.370> it<00:05:33.610> will

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
dirt and what that will do is it will

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.360 
dirt and what that will do is it will
constantly<00:05:34.210> keep<00:05:34.479> a<00:05:34.630> layer<00:05:34.870> of<00:05:35.080> dirt<00:05:35.290> or<00:05:35.590> dust

to<00:05:42.220> see<00:05:42.370> us<00:05:42.490> do<00:05:42.700> is<00:05:42.850> we're<00:05:43.510> going<00:05:43.600> to<00:05:43.660> be

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
to see us do is we're going to be

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.690 
to see us do is we're going to be
pulling<00:05:44.020> out<00:05:44.290> bushels<00:05:44.950> of<00:05:45.040> charcoal<00:05:45.490> and

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
pulling out bushels of charcoal and

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.150 
pulling out bushels of charcoal and
piling<00:05:46.390> them<00:05:46.600> separate<00:05:47.500> in<00:05:47.650> two<00:05:47.680> separate

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
piling them separate in two separate

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.250 
piling them separate in two separate
bushels<00:05:48.490> of<00:05:48.610> charcoal<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.780> reason<00:05:50.140> we're

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
bushels of charcoal and the reason we're

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.900 
bushels of charcoal and the reason we're
doing<00:05:50.350> that<00:05:50.500> is<00:05:50.620> if<00:05:50.800> a<00:05:50.890> fire<00:05:51.130> were<00:05:51.160> to<00:05:51.550> rekindle

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
doing that is if a fire were to rekindle

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.969 
doing that is if a fire were to rekindle
we're<00:05:52.570> not<00:05:52.720> going<00:05:52.900> to<00:05:52.930> lose<00:05:53.110> the<00:05:53.290> entire<00:05:53.590> lot

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
we're not going to lose the entire lot

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.790 
we're not going to lose the entire lot
instead<00:05:54.490> we'll<00:05:54.640> just<00:05:54.669> use<00:05:55.030> we<00:05:55.660> will<00:05:56.050> have<00:05:56.590> one

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
instead we'll just use we will have one

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.380 
instead we'll just use we will have one
small<00:05:56.979> pile<00:05:57.400> that<00:05:57.580> we<00:05:57.700> can<00:05:57.850> then<00:05:57.940> control<00:05:58.240> the

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
small pile that we can then control the

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.360 
small pile that we can then control the
fire<00:05:58.600> now<00:05:59.140> talk<00:05:59.770> a<00:05:59.800> little<00:05:59.979> about<00:06:00.100> the

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
fire now talk a little about the

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.350 
fire now talk a little about the
industry<00:06:00.940> of<00:06:01.030> charcoal

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
industry of charcoal

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.560

the<00:06:04.360> whole<00:06:04.570> idea<00:06:04.930> for<00:06:05.140> making<00:06:05.440> charcoal<00:06:05.860> is<00:06:06.570> to

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
the whole idea for making charcoal is to

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.870 
the whole idea for making charcoal is to
make<00:06:07.720> a<00:06:07.750> fuel<00:06:08.170> that<00:06:09.010> could<00:06:09.310> be<00:06:09.430> used<00:06:09.640> in<00:06:09.760> the

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
make a fuel that could be used in the

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.300 
make a fuel that could be used in the
