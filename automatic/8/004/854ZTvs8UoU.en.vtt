very sophisticated software now we're

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.209 
very sophisticated software now we're
going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> scan<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.230> range<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.980> different

going to scan a range of different

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610 
going to scan a range of different
objects<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:39.719> how<00:00:40.020> easy<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
objects so that you can see how easy the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.319 
objects so that you can see how easy the
system<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> use<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.700> how<00:00:41.730> quickly<00:00:42.180> we

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
system is to use and how quickly we

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
system is to use and how quickly we
could<00:00:42.570> get<00:00:42.719> some<00:00:42.989> really<00:00:43.230> nice<00:00:43.500> results<00:00:43.640> I'm

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
could get some really nice results I'm

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.250 
could get some really nice results I'm
going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> start<00:00:45.180> off<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.600> mobile<00:00:46.020> phone

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
going to start off with my mobile phone

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.979 
going to start off with my mobile phone
which<00:00:47.039> I'm<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> position<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.690> front<00:00:48.840> of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
which I'm just in a position in front of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.500 
which I'm just in a position in front of
the<00:00:49.050> scale

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.830 

so<00:00:56.110> it's<00:00:56.230> just<00:00:56.320> cases<00:00:57.239> aiming<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.329> scanner<00:00:58.600> at

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
so it's just cases aiming the scanner at

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.480 
so it's just cases aiming the scanner at
the<00:00:58.960> object

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:12.649 

train

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.160 

two<00:01:13.170> seconds<00:01:13.500> later<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:14.009> stamp<00:01:14.899> this<00:01:15.899> one's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
two seconds later this stamp this one's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:27.390 
two seconds later this stamp this one's
about<00:01:16.350> half<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> million<00:01:17.280> police

high-resolution textures on
zooming<00:01:31.620> to<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.550> wireframe<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.510> that<00:01:33.660> you<00:01:33.780> can

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
zooming to the wireframe so that you can

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.390 
zooming to the wireframe so that you can
see

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
see

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:49.719 
see
the<00:01:35.390> kind<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:35.690> mesh<00:01:35.870> get

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.580 

next<00:01:50.390> we're<00:01:50.539> going<00:01:50.659> to<00:01:50.719> scan<00:01:50.899> three<00:01:51.289> different

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
next we're going to scan three different

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.859 
next we're going to scan three different
objects<00:01:51.950> in<00:01:52.159> quick<00:01:52.549> succession<00:01:52.869> to

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
objects in quick succession to

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.149 
objects in quick succession to
demonstrate<00:01:54.350> this<00:01:54.500> really<00:01:54.799> is<00:01:54.890> a

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
demonstrate this really is a

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.660 
demonstrate this really is a
point-and-shoot<00:01:55.670> 3d<00:01:56.390> scanning<00:01:56.630> system<00:01:57.670> okay

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
point-and-shoot 3d scanning system okay

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:43.780 
point-and-shoot 3d scanning system okay
first<00:01:58.969> up<00:01:59.179> a<00:01:59.659> piece<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.170> French<00:02:00.649> bread<00:02:42.760> all<00:02:43.760> the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
first up a piece of French bread all the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:03:27.310 
first up a piece of French bread all the
strength

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:04:40.270 

and<00:03:28.320> lastly<00:03:29.420> city<00:03:30.420> cop<00:03:30.750> starts

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.100 

as<00:04:41.280> well<00:04:41.520> as<00:04:41.639> scanning<00:04:41.880> objects<00:04:42.419> this<00:04:42.720> system

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
as well as scanning objects this system

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.870 
as well as scanning objects this system
is<00:04:43.229> right<00:04:43.410> for<00:04:43.470> scanning<00:04:43.889> people<00:04:44.250> so<00:04:44.760> now

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
is right for scanning people so now

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.790 
is right for scanning people so now
we're<00:04:45.030> going<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.210> do<00:04:45.330> a<00:04:45.360> few<00:04:45.630> scans<00:04:46.200> of<00:04:46.530> an

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
we're going to do a few scans of an

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.280 
we're going to do a few scans of an
opponent

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
opponent

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:58.280 
opponent
first<00:04:49.290> up<00:04:49.500> portray

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.950 

and<00:04:58.470> there's<00:04:58.890> a<00:04:59.010> match<00:04:59.220> just<00:04:59.780> sort<00:05:00.780> of<00:05:00.840> a

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
and there's a match just sort of a

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:13.589 
and there's a match just sort of a
million<00:05:01.260> polygons

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:18.060 

i<00:05:13.710> resolution

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:52.270 

changing

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.710 

and<00:05:53.280> then<00:05:53.550> we<00:05:53.640> still<00:05:53.910> leave<00:05:54.060> some<00:05:54.120> of<00:05:54.450> you<00:05:54.570> know

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
and then we still leave some of you know

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:36.390 
and then we still leave some of you know
from<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.530> side<00:05:55.710> of<00:05:55.920> time

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:43.270 

and<00:06:36.970> then<00:06:37.120> we<00:06:37.300> do<00:06:37.419> one<00:06:37.630> more<00:06:37.900> time

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.280 

okay
