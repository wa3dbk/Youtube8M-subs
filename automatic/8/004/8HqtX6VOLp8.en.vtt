00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.929
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.549
 mac skill tutorial where we will see 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.650
 today how to restore an icon 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.510
 which would have disappeared in the menu bar 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.670
 last week we saw how 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.230
 move the icons with the key 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.099
 commands but if you have mistakenly 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:32.460
 places and nikon for example here she 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.280
 disappears to restore it you have to go 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.809
 in system preferences 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.300
 so here it is the icon 1 of wifi by 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.770
 example that I deleted 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:47.039
 so you have to go back to network you 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.989
 lÃ© have wifi here and just check 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.500
 the box show wifi status in the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.309
 menu bar here is the icon came back to 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.340
 its place and the system is the same for 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.539
 the volume for example here you go 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.100
 in the sound and there you have the box 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.409
 display the volume in the bar of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.310
 menus 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.930
 so that's important because we can 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.510
 find quickly stuck in ten years I 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.520
 really makes a huge mistake then 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.470
 that in fact it's just 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.380
 the icon that was moved by mistake and 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.759
 so deleted so do not hesitate if 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.610
 you miss one to go around 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.130
 system preferences so the sound the wifi 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.680
 bluetooth etc to restore you 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.610
 will always have a small check box 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.610
 to find this icon 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.509
 here is so do not hesitate also to 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.280
 remove the icons behind me the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.799
 bluetooth I do not use so already we're going 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.140
 disable and that's really I have 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.570
 I really need press 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.130
 key commands and I'm going to extract it 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.850
 from the menu bar and one evaporates 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.840
 in a small cloud 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.360
 so that was a small point 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.590
 extra on the menu bar 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.610
 The best of wishes for the future 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.610
 on your mac
