guess you spoke about it at the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.890 
guess you spoke about it at the
beginning<00:02:35.579> is<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.970> kinetic<00:02:36.360> crisis<00:02:36.750> and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
beginning is the kinetic crisis and

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.050 
beginning is the kinetic crisis and
everybody's<00:02:37.290> talking<00:02:37.620> at<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.829> and<00:02:38.190> even<00:02:38.820> if

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
everybody's talking at that and even if

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.729 
everybody's talking at that and even if
at<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.720> festival<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.200> first<00:02:40.380> day<00:02:40.530> they<00:02:40.680> were

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
at the festival the first day they were

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.740 
at the festival the first day they were
sensing<00:02:41.340> are<00:02:41.670> they<00:02:41.790> gonna<00:02:41.940> be<00:02:42.120> as<00:02:42.329> much<00:02:42.510> people

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
sensing are they gonna be as much people

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.140 
sensing are they gonna be as much people
as<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.350> years<00:02:43.590> before<00:02:43.769> it's<00:02:44.760> not<00:02:44.910> gonna<00:02:45.000> be

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
as the years before it's not gonna be

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.680 
as the years before it's not gonna be
the<00:02:45.239> same<00:02:45.269> but<00:02:46.079> how<00:02:46.920> do<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.220> guys<00:02:47.459> cope<00:02:48.150> with

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
the same but how do you guys cope with

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.880 
the same but how do you guys cope with
what's<00:02:48.870> happening<00:02:49.170> around<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.500> world

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
what's happening around the world

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.340 
what's happening around the world
definitely<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:51.090> affected<00:02:51.660> all<00:02:51.810> businesses

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
definitely it affected all businesses

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.620 
definitely it affected all businesses
across<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.130> board<00:02:53.400> whether<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:53.940> fashion

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
across the board whether it's fashion

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.330 
across the board whether it's fashion
maybe<00:02:55.020> our<00:02:55.290> business<00:02:55.710> a<00:02:55.770> little<00:02:55.890> bit<00:02:56.040> less

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
maybe our business a little bit less

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.640 
maybe our business a little bit less
because<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:57.030> lot<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.720> people<00:02:58.050> are<00:02:58.140> coming<00:02:58.500> back

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
because a lot of people are coming back

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.250 
because a lot of people are coming back
to<00:02:58.800> true<00:02:59.070> values<00:02:59.520> they<00:02:59.910> are<00:03:00.020> really<00:03:01.020> buying

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
to true values they are really buying

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.230 
to true values they are really buying
the<00:03:01.560> diamond<00:03:02.010> because<00:03:02.310> they<00:03:02.460> can<00:03:02.610> hold<00:03:02.820> on<00:03:03.090> to

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
the diamond because they can hold on to

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.730 
the diamond because they can hold on to
something<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.870> they<00:03:03.990> have<00:03:04.200> something<00:03:04.590> that

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
something and they have something that

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.260 
something and they have something that
brings<00:03:04.950> some<00:03:05.190> joy<00:03:05.370> but<00:03:05.640> they<00:03:05.760> also<00:03:05.880> have<00:03:06.150> the

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
brings some joy but they also have the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.570 
brings some joy but they also have the
value<00:03:06.600> but<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.230> think<00:03:07.800> maybe<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.070> brings<00:03:08.250> people

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
value but I think maybe it brings people

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.640 
value but I think maybe it brings people
down<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.480> human<00:03:09.960> scale

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
down to a human scale

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.570 
down to a human scale
people<00:03:11.190> are<00:03:11.250> more<00:03:11.430> thinking<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.720> more

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
people are more thinking the more

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.440 
people are more thinking the more
reflecting<00:03:14.580> before<00:03:14.970> they're<00:03:15.150> doing

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
reflecting before they're doing

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.740 
reflecting before they're doing
something<00:03:15.690> if<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.470> if<00:03:16.710> you<00:03:16.860> have<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> strong

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
something if you if you have a strong

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.710 
something if you if you have a strong
ship<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:20.490> storm<00:03:20.820> is<00:03:20.970> coming<00:03:21.030> your<00:03:21.510> ship

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
ship and the storm is coming your ship

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.560 
ship and the storm is coming your ship
will<00:03:21.930> hold<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.740> go<00:03:23.580> through<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.000> storm<00:03:24.330> and

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
will hold and go through the storm and

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.690 
will hold and go through the storm and
that's<00:03:24.720> what's<00:03:25.260> gonna<00:03:25.560> happen<00:03:25.800> what's<00:03:26.400> this

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
that's what's gonna happen what's this

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.760 
that's what's gonna happen what's this
fatigue<00:03:27.330> points<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.020> you're<00:03:28.170> gonna<00:03:28.320> work<00:03:28.560> on

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
fatigue points that you're gonna work on

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.040 
fatigue points that you're gonna work on
for<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.250> let's<00:03:29.880> say<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.120> upcoming<00:03:30.540> five

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
for the let's say the upcoming five

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.100 
for the let's say the upcoming five
years<00:03:31.500> for<00:03:31.830> example<00:03:32.120> we<00:03:33.120> have<00:03:33.270> our<00:03:33.480> we<00:03:33.960> have

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
years for example we have our we have

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.590 
years for example we have our we have
our<00:03:34.320> strategy<00:03:35.010> still<00:03:35.280> we<00:03:35.460> have<00:03:35.640> some<00:03:36.330> places

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
our strategy still we have some places

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.750 
our strategy still we have some places
in<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:36.960> world<00:03:37.080> where<00:03:37.560> surprise<00:03:38.010> not<00:03:38.310> present

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
in the world where surprise not present

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.060 
in the world where surprise not present
with<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:38.940> boutique<00:03:39.420> it's<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.320> proper<00:03:40.590> boutique

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
with a boutique it's a proper boutique

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.970 
with a boutique it's a proper boutique
so<00:03:41.540> we<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.570> think<00:03:42.960> we<00:03:43.080> will<00:03:43.200> follow<00:03:43.530> what<00:03:43.830> we

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
so we I think we will follow what we

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.030 
so we I think we will follow what we
have<00:03:44.160> maybe<00:03:44.880> on<00:03:45.210> a<00:03:45.240> slower<00:03:45.900> path<00:03:46.260> or<00:03:46.620> depends

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
have maybe on a slower path or depends

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.720 
have maybe on a slower path or depends
if<00:03:47.130> things<00:03:47.370> pick<00:03:47.610> up<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.820> bit<00:03:48.090> faster<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:49.730> we

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
if things pick up a bit faster and we

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.490 
if things pick up a bit faster and we
have<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:51.090> stay<00:03:51.300> as<00:03:51.450> creative<00:03:51.960> as<00:03:52.170> we<00:03:52.380> are

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
have to stay as creative as we are

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.870 
have to stay as creative as we are
because<00:03:52.830> that's<00:03:52.980> what<00:03:53.250> makes<00:03:53.460> your<00:03:53.670> power

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
because that's what makes your power
