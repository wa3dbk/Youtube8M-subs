00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
looking at my mirror over here so this

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.430 
looking at my mirror over here so this
top<00:02:52.470> section<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:53.340> hair<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:54.000> going<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.170> remain

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
top section of hair is going to remain

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.090 
top section of hair is going to remain
untouched<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:57.120> I'm<00:02:57.180> gonna<00:02:57.360> clip<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.829> this

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
untouched so I'm gonna clip it to this

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.020 
untouched so I'm gonna clip it to this
side<00:02:59.450> and<00:03:01.010> I'm<00:03:02.010> going<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.430> start<00:03:02.880> with<00:03:03.000> a

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
side and I'm going to start with a

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:16.800 
side and I'm going to start with a
section<00:03:03.540> over<00:03:03.810> here

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.559 

and<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.680> pamphlet<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.430> comes<00:03:18.700> with<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.180> says

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
and the pamphlet that comes with it says

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.930 
and the pamphlet that comes with it says
that<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.020> will<00:03:20.260> leave<00:03:20.590> an<00:03:20.890> imprint<00:03:21.400> on<00:03:21.670> your

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
that it will leave an imprint on your

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.140 
that it will leave an imprint on your
hair<00:03:22.560> but<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.770> actually<00:03:24.250> goes<00:03:24.430> away<00:03:24.610> once<00:03:25.000> it

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
hair but that actually goes away once it

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.900 
hair but that actually goes away once it
cools<00:03:25.360> down<00:03:26.190> that's<00:03:27.190> what<00:03:27.340> they<00:03:27.459> say

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
cools down that's what they say

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:54.600 
cools down that's what they say
so<00:03:28.630> I'm<00:03:28.810> going<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:29.020> keep<00:03:29.200> going<00:03:52.830> so<00:03:53.830> that<00:03:54.400> is

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
so I'm going to keep going so that is

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.350 
so I'm going to keep going so that is
what<00:03:54.790> it<00:03:54.940> did<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.690> this<00:03:56.260> side<00:03:56.590> of<00:03:56.709> my<00:03:56.830> hair

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
what it did to this side of my hair

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.940 
what it did to this side of my hair
obviously<00:03:58.360> you<00:03:58.540> can<00:03:58.720> see<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.380> difference<00:03:59.769> in

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
obviously you can see the difference in

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.580 
obviously you can see the difference in
volume<00:04:00.130> this<00:04:01.120> side<00:04:01.390> doesn't<00:04:01.900> have<00:04:02.080> any<00:04:02.319> and

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
volume this side doesn't have any and

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.309 
volume this side doesn't have any and
this<00:04:02.800> side<00:04:03.040> does<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:04.510> now<00:04:04.840> I'm<00:04:04.989> going<00:04:05.110> to<00:04:05.200> do

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
this side does so now I'm going to do

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.830 
this side does so now I'm going to do
this<00:04:05.500> side<00:04:05.739> once<00:04:06.730> again<00:04:07.000> I'm<00:04:07.150> taking<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:07.569> top

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
this side once again I'm taking the top

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:27.930 
this side once again I'm taking the top
section<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.800> clipping<00:04:09.100> it<00:04:09.220> over<00:04:26.220> so<00:04:27.220> this<00:04:27.700> is

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
section and clipping it over so this is

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.450 
section and clipping it over so this is
the<00:04:28.120> result<00:04:28.570> I<00:04:28.780> definitely<00:04:29.530> see<00:04:29.830> a<00:04:29.860> difference

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
the result I definitely see a difference

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.180 
the result I definitely see a difference
I<00:04:30.880> will<00:04:31.510> insert<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.140> before<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:32.860> after

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
difference I actually think it's pretty

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.730 
difference I actually think it's pretty
