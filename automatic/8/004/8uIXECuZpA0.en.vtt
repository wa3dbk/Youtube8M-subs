00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.649 

inside<00:00:02.100> each<00:00:02.399> one<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.639> your<00:00:02.820> cells<00:00:03.030> there<00:00:03.510> is

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
inside each one of your cells there is

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.740 
inside each one of your cells there is
six<00:00:04.049> feet<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.710> DNA<00:00:05.009> made<00:00:05.790> up<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.089> six<00:00:06.420> billion

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
six feet of DNA made up of six billion

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.400 
six feet of DNA made up of six billion
letters<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.470> genetic<00:00:07.710> code<00:00:08.420> now<00:00:09.420> your<00:00:09.780> DNA<00:00:10.200> is

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
letters of genetic code now your DNA is

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.339 
letters of genetic code now your DNA is
split<00:00:10.769> into<00:00:10.950> 46<00:00:11.790> pieces<00:00:12.150> each<00:00:12.660> three<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.170> four

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
split into 46 pieces each three to four

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.950 
split into 46 pieces each three to four
centimetres<00:00:13.799> long<00:00:14.009> called<00:00:14.700> chromosomes<00:00:15.420> now

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
centimetres long called chromosomes now

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.330 
centimetres long called chromosomes now
normally<00:00:16.350> we<00:00:16.440> think<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.710> chromosomes<00:00:17.160> as

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
normally we think of chromosomes as

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.519 
normally we think of chromosomes as
looking<00:00:17.640> like<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.150> but<00:00:18.420> they<00:00:18.990> only<00:00:19.230> take

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
looking like this but they only take

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.109 
looking like this but they only take
that<00:00:19.740> form<00:00:19.980> when<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> cell<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.490> ready<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.000> divide

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
that form when a cell is ready to divide

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.410 
that form when a cell is ready to divide
so<00:00:22.020> usually<00:00:22.619> DNA<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.640> Wiggly<00:00:24.029> thread

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
so usually DNA is just a Wiggly thread

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.450 
so usually DNA is just a Wiggly thread
within<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.900> nucleus<00:00:25.320> now<00:00:26.010> if<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.310> can

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
within the nucleus now if you can

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.519 
within the nucleus now if you can
imagine<00:00:26.670> DNA<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.449> only<00:00:27.539> about<00:00:27.779> two<00:00:28.080> nanometers

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
imagine DNA is only about two nanometers

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.470 
imagine DNA is only about two nanometers
wide<00:00:28.859> but<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> chromosome<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.849> centimeters

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
wide but a chromosome is centimeters

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.020 
wide but a chromosome is centimeters
long<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.500> would<00:00:31.800> think<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.399> would<00:00:32.759> get

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
long so you would think that would get

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.360 
long so you would think that would get
tangled<00:00:33.600> worse<00:00:33.870> than<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> headphones<00:00:35.070> in

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
tangled worse than the headphones in

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.060 
tangled worse than the headphones in
your<00:00:35.399> bag<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> DNA<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.410> actually<00:00:37.770> wrapped

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
your bag so the DNA is actually wrapped

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.549 
your bag so the DNA is actually wrapped
around<00:00:38.340> proteins<00:00:38.700> called<00:00:39.600> histones

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
around proteins called histones

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.799 
around proteins called histones
now<00:00:41.040> those<00:00:41.190> histones<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.910> Wiggly<00:00:42.480> tails

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
now those histones have Wiggly tails

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.139 
now those histones have Wiggly tails
which<00:00:43.170> will<00:00:43.350> come<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.680> handy<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:44.160> we'll<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:44.940> in

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
which will come in handy as we'll see in

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.139 
which will come in handy as we'll see in
a<00:00:45.329> moment<00:00:45.770> your<00:00:46.770> unique<00:00:47.160> set<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.399> DNA<00:00:47.850> first

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
a moment your unique set of DNA first

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.299 
a moment your unique set of DNA first
formed<00:00:48.570> when<00:00:48.750> 23<00:00:49.289> chromosomes<00:00:49.770> from<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.129> mom

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
formed when 23 chromosomes from your mom

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.020 
formed when 23 chromosomes from your mom
mixed<00:00:50.910> with<00:00:51.059> 23<00:00:51.660> from<00:00:51.870> your<00:00:52.050> dad<00:00:52.289> now<00:00:52.920> 22<00:00:53.699> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
mixed with 23 from your dad now 22 of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.729 
mixed with 23 from your dad now 22 of
those<00:00:54.210> chromosomes<00:00:54.539> from<00:00:54.780> each<00:00:54.989> parent<00:00:55.350> form

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
those chromosomes from each parent form

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.549 
those chromosomes from each parent form
matching<00:00:56.250> pairs<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> 23rd<00:00:57.780> set<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
matching pairs but the 23rd set is the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.010 
matching pairs but the 23rd set is the
sex<00:00:58.859> chromosomes<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.030> two<00:01:00.090> x<00:01:00.629> chromosomes

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
sex chromosomes so two x chromosomes

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.709 
sex chromosomes so two x chromosomes
make<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.590> female<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.190> an<00:01:02.550> X<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.059> Y<00:01:03.239> make

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
make you female and an X and a Y make

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.050 
make you female and an X and a Y make
you<00:01:03.930> male<00:01:04.290> now<00:01:04.979> since<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> male<00:01:05.700> sex

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
you male now since the male sex

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.760 
you male now since the male sex
chromosomes<00:01:06.540> are<00:01:06.750> different<00:01:07.200> both<00:01:07.530> can

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
chromosomes are different both can

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.560 
chromosomes are different both can
remain<00:01:08.010> active<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.760> rest<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.000> your<00:01:09.119> life

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
remain active for the rest of your life

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.530 
remain active for the rest of your life
but<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.380> females<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> X<00:01:12.030> chromosomes

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
but for females one of the X chromosomes

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.840 
but for females one of the X chromosomes
needs<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.200> inactivated<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.220> order<00:01:14.640> for

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
proper development to occur this happens

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.429 
proper development to occur this happens
when<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> female<00:01:18.030> embryo<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.960> four<00:01:19.259> days

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
when a female embryo is just four days

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.999 
when a female embryo is just four days
old<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.950> consists<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.580> only<00:01:20.880> 100<00:01:21.659> cells<00:01:22.020> right

old and consists of only 100 cells right

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.070 
old and consists of only 100 cells right
now<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.670> cell<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.180> X<00:01:24.360> chromosome<00:01:24.930> from

dad and the one from mum are both active

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.230 
dad and the one from mum are both active
but<00:01:28.049> through<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> tiny<00:01:28.770> molecular<00:01:29.070> battle<00:01:29.939> one

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
but through a tiny molecular battle one

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240 
but through a tiny molecular battle one
of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> X<00:01:30.570> chromosomes<00:01:31.079> wins<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.890> remains

active while the other is inactivated

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.330 
active while the other is inactivated
this<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.210> done<00:01:36.509> by<00:01:36.780> packing<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.409> DNA<00:01:37.950> closer

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
this is done by packing the DNA closer

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.760 
this is done by packing the DNA closer
together<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.210> making<00:01:39.840> modifications<00:01:39.960> to

this point forward as these cells divide

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.380 
this point forward as these cells divide
they<00:03:06.989> maintain<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:08.070> active<00:03:08.640> X<00:03:08.820> chromosome

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
they maintain the active X chromosome

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.870 
they maintain the active X chromosome
that<00:03:09.600> they<00:03:09.750> had<00:03:10.080> inside<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.860> all<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.610> cells

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
that they had inside so all of the cells

that they had inside so all of the cells
with<00:03:12.120> dads<00:03:12.390> active<00:03:12.930> X<00:03:13.080> chromosome<00:03:13.500> give<00:03:13.770> rise

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
with dads active X chromosome give rise

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.340 
with dads active X chromosome give rise
to<00:03:14.010> further<00:03:14.610> cells<00:03:14.940> with<00:03:15.180> dads<00:03:15.480> active<00:03:16.110> X

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.620 
to further cells with dads active X
chromosome<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.459> continues<00:03:17.970> on<00:03:18.000> into

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
chromosome and this continues on into

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.500 
chromosome and this continues on into
adulthood<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:20.220> if<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.760> could<00:03:21.000> look<00:03:21.269> at<00:03:21.450> a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
adulthood so if you could look at a

has<00:03:24.660> been<00:03:24.810> inactivated<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:26.100> would<00:03:26.250> see<00:03:26.489> a

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
has been inactivated you would see a

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.210 
has been inactivated you would see a
stripy<00:03:27.420> pattern<00:03:27.450> which<00:03:28.440> shows<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.980> growth

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
stripy pattern which shows the growth

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.390 
stripy pattern which shows the growth
and<00:03:29.519> migration<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:30.330> all<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:31.080> these<00:03:31.200> first<00:03:31.620> 100

old

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.280 

now<00:03:43.360> of<00:03:43.510> course<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.780> can't<00:03:43.960> actually<00:03:44.110> see

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
now of course you can't actually see

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.980 
now of course you can't actually see
that<00:03:44.650> in<00:03:44.860> humans<00:03:45.280> but<00:03:45.970> you<00:03:46.120> can<00:03:46.390> see<00:03:46.630> this<00:03:46.780> with

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
that in humans but you can see this with

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.500 
that in humans but you can see this with
calico<00:03:47.440> cats<00:03:47.710> and<00:03:48.040> that's<00:03:48.460> because<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.270> gene

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
calico cats and that's because the gene

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.210 
calico cats and that's because the gene
for<00:03:49.750> coat<00:03:49.960> color<00:03:50.230> is<00:03:50.440> actually<00:03:50.620> on<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.040> X

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
for coat color is actually on the X

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.310 
for coat color is actually on the X
chromosome<00:03:51.670> so<00:03:52.360> just<00:03:52.600> by<00:03:52.720> looking<00:03:53.080> at<00:03:53.170> the

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
chromosome so just by looking at the

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.740 
chromosome so just by looking at the
pattern<00:03:53.740> of<00:03:53.920> her<00:03:54.220> spots<00:03:54.670> here<00:03:55.030> her<00:03:55.300> dark<00:03:55.600> and

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
pattern of her spots here her dark and

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.590 
pattern of her spots here her dark and
light<00:03:55.870> spots<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.710> can<00:03:56.920> see<00:03:57.130> where<00:03:57.700> our<00:03:58.060> mom<00:03:58.390> or

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
light spots you can see where our mom or

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.540 
light spots you can see where our mom or
dad's<00:03:58.840> X<00:03:59.200> chromosome<00:03:59.710> has<00:03:59.860> been<00:04:00.040> inactivated

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
dad's X chromosome has been inactivated

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.300 
dad's X chromosome has been inactivated
and<00:04:00.910> this<00:04:01.360> also<00:04:01.570> shows<00:04:01.900> us<00:04:02.170> that<00:04:02.350> only<00:04:02.920> female

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
and this also shows us that only female

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.790 
and this also shows us that only female
cats<00:04:03.610> can<00:04:03.970> be<00:04:04.000> calculates<00:04:04.990> and<00:04:05.680> that's

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
cats can be calculates and that's

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.950 
cats can be calculates and that's
because<00:04:06.190> well<00:04:06.760> only<00:04:06.910> female<00:04:07.540> cats<00:04:07.780> can

more<00:04:34.930> interesting<00:04:35.140> is<00:04:35.620> that<00:04:35.650> it<00:04:35.980> seems<00:04:36.310> the

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
more interesting is that it seems the

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.970 
more interesting is that it seems the
behaviors<00:04:37.300> you<00:04:37.510> take<00:04:37.780> can<00:04:38.140> actually<00:04:38.530> affect

behaviors you take can actually affect
your<00:04:39.070> epigenetics<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:40.240> even<00:04:41.200> weirder

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
your epigenetics and even weirder

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.770 
your epigenetics and even weirder
perhaps<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.580> things<00:04:42.850> that<00:04:43.090> your<00:04:43.210> parents<00:04:43.240> or

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
perhaps the things that your parents or

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.440 
perhaps the things that your parents or
grandparents<00:04:44.470> did<00:04:44.710> can<00:04:45.400> affect<00:04:45.760> your

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
epigenetics now can affect your DNA so

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.180 
epigenetics now can affect your DNA so
you<00:04:49.060> are<00:04:49.600> not<00:04:49.780> just<00:04:50.140> a<00:04:50.230> product<00:04:50.530> of<00:04:50.770> your
