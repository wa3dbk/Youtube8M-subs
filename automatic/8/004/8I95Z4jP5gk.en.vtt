00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Juan Carlos reds to this 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.350
 student of the national university 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:12.500
 federico villarreal and today I present you 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.500
 this development card with arduino 1 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.000
 this card brings the module without 900 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.210
 brings connection for audio connection for 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.610
 microphone and also has a basis for 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.030
 put a cell chip is clear 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.790
 movistar and others that exist all this 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.489
 system allows me to establish calls 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.860
 with other mobile devices send 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.340
 Text messages 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:47.730
 I can also send data to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.309
 through protocols tcp / ip http 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.890
 this system works in four bands the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:58.630
 what we know are the 850 900 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.920
 1,800 and 1,900 megahertz 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:05.920
 in everything in the world well for 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.550
 handle this card we must know the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.390
 atte commands that are the commands ate 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:16.460
 they are interface instructions 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.140
 between user and modem 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.950
 and also like the phone 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.310
 mobile 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.340
 gsm gprs 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.110
 that this language is adapted 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.620
 well that would be a demonstration 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.110
 with the software first let's open 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.800
 our arduino platform and this data 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.200
 are sent in serial form 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.860
 I'm going to turn on that module I'm going to 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.100
 teach them how 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.100
 here I have to press 2 seconds 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.569
 and send me this verification message 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.030
 that we're right I'm going to 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:58.950
 chase the radi and start 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.330
 here the module on here I did not visualize 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.850
 I had to press here two seconds 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.940
 this element as it is on this 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.460
 and look in response 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.010
 what we see on the screen now for 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.340
 verify the communication the first thing that 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.880
 I must do is send the command ate everything 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.880
 uppercase 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.940
 and they answer me like ok it 's very good 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.600
 Now I'm going to do a demonstration 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.360
 a phone call without usually 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.100
 well here is my cell phone and I'm going to do 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.700
 a demonstration first let's put on 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.500
 the commands 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.680
 to td 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:45.040
 number 9 8 9 7 9 11 37 then a point and 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.870
 eat presses enter me answer ok and 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.110
 here we will see that I will receive the 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.110
 call 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.650
 I'm going to check that it's 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.650
 world this number to miss the number 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.620
 but we are going with the same 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.710
 we see that the community essence of success 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.710
 if we want to get the call 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.629
 let's send another command is the th 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:23.500
 we buy it here with the command a of h 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.800
 to cut the communication 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.760
 and well-functioning now what I'm going to 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.580
 demonstrate is my cellphone here he is going to 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.110
 call him he's going to call him to 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.860
 that I'm going to open the last call 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.860
 lost call 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.460
 and we're going to call right now I'm 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.780
 calling this cell phone is calling 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.300
 1900 module 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.500
 verify that with the audio 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.800
 that is sounding 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.170
 but I can also find out here in 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.170
 the terminal serial ring ring ring 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.519
 good we see that communication is a 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.120
 success could also make message 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.800
 the texts in sending me today sends 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.959
 vice versa so far we are seeing that 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.780
 the commands works well for us because 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.130
 so it will be called and I will make another 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.130
 commandos we have the command 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.120
 if I want command up was for 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.120
 answer the call 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.310
 I have another command th that looks for 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.310
 end the call 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.800
 I have another command that is what gives me 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.800
 Product Information 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:51.189
 and we're going to write an integer and what I 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:53.499
 da is the 1900 revision 11.0 very well or 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:55.100
 I write another command I have the command 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:57.740
 ate 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.460
 we always have this command has you 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.889
 taken from a manual 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:07.840
 and this internet we will see the data 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:12.270
 manufacturer to cmg themes and enter me 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.270
 answer error something I will have done wrong 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.860
 well gm 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.860
 before more 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.640
 m 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.220
 you answer me cisco ltd well now the 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.700
 operator manufacturer information 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.250
 operator 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.250
 I write more 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.889
 of bs 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.470
 and without the interrogation 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:50.170
 does not assign intervention 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.360
 he replies that it is clear and very well is 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.430
 Clear 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.980
 my provider now for the last one that yes 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.529
 I want to know 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:01.240
 because speed we are 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:03.289
 not first see the email 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.189
 to topics 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.189
 anyone 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:15.390
 sn let s / n 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.490
 and very well I think the email number 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.560
 now to know at what speed is 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:25.050
 the communication would be from arduino and my 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:28.490
 boss module gsm model let's write 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.490
 the command ate 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.650
 ypr 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.430
 I missed the same ate more and pr 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.000
 and in equal 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:58.510
 the other time I was wrong 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.510
 yp r 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:07.170
 and question sign was 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.910
 and they answer me 19,200 then here 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.720
 verified that the most basic commands 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.720
 It has worked very well 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.990
 and finally we must turn off the 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.000
 module in this way 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:23.520
 we light here 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.380
 two seconds and it went off we named it here 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:30.350
 we observe we see what 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:34.990
 it has been paid so thank you very much 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.990
 I hope you learn greetings
