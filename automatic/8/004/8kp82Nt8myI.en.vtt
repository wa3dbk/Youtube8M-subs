00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.269
 hi girls so today I 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.160
 wanted to talk to you about a miracle thing 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.290
 that I bought on an express then 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.500
 with a few years I looked at a 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.930
 stuff on the TV shopping there and it got me 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.480
 a lot more than a huge thing 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.130
 frankly it was something that I 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.539
 loved my problems with TV shopping 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.420
 it's not easy to buy it because 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.730
 that it costs sister and after good I was 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.550
 not so married 1 so I do not know 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.320
 too much of that stuff and wants to marry 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 as I have the mentality to Arabic as 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.829
 a mother my grandma and here I like 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.200
 to have everything you need 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.850
 house be dishes or whatever 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.440
 especially especially when it comes to or c1 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.710
 blankets duvets sheets and so 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.809
 after 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.250
 like that if I get home from home 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.550
 there is no problem I have everything he 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.920
 must 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.039
 but the problem is that I will have so much 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.809
 buy that I do not know where to store then 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.960
 this is really a problem 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.090
 and as I love expressing 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.600
 realized that the solution lies 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.200
 on the buttocks so I bought my 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.450
 back to back and teal bag where it 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.720
 can suck all the air that to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.280
 inside and I do not regret it at all 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.070
 so I bought a single sample 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.930
 will provide what is that since that 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.090
 really gives a good quality 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.610
 pop and I do not regret it I'm going 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.200
 surely order a dozen or so 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.450
 twenty because that's a 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.080
 two-seater courier plus store 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.630
 easily no game 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.330
 at home then genders are good 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.230
 quality they are not proven I do not have 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.370
 received proulx and something that I like 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.810
 because I have seen some 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.790
 comments there was someone to whom 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.440
 received the bags a little bit found but 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.620
 I find that the quality of the satellite 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:56.070
 pretty well then the csdc a double zip 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:02:00.220
 in fact then it closes like this 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.980
 so we close with this little step 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.530
 that if you can see it like that 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:10.270
 so just in the but inside in 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:14.860
 firm and also there is a little hole there one 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.260
 can put without a vacuum cleaner 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.540
 or vacuum cleaner and in fact we're going 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.250
 suck up all the air that's in there then 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.660
 I do not know if I'm going for that 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.360
 and you will go back with a small cushion 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:31.260
 to greet each other I will do right now 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.910
 so I'm going to open the bag 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.500
 I do not know if you can see how 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:44.460
 that's it when I open auzac already 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:49.110
 it starts to take weert edition 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:55.620
 it gives that you see I had ordered 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:58.410
 quilt there and then place me at the party 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.880
 from the air you learn a little more 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.880
 it's fooling the arms 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.599
 I really like myself 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.220
 with the push to move atp 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:25.440
 so here it was this time being the 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:30.840
 madness in and I'm going to put a cushion 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:46.819
 so that's all I 'm going to put in 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:46.819
 inside I had closed with 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.870
 and we lose here is a guy 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:06.409
 pascal easily 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.860
 alas like jay laprete here that's my 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.480
 dada is my beast that I love then I 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.639
 I'm just going to take the trick off with 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:27.320
 that they have both sides and 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:33.110
 took him to the turn this is something that 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:38.270
 this rate here I remove like this and there I 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:40.789
 put there I'll put my idol that goes 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.630
 absorb all the air then you go 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:47.110
 just put the goal lan like that and you 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.110
 let suck 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:16.509
 when you finish it gives that and it's worth 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.909
 better butcher good does not learn from 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:24.159
 air in you stop the the vacuum cleaner and 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:26.579
 there is better to butcher then there I 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.579
 closed 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.129
 That's what happens 

00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:33.999
 so just like that it became like 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:35.469
 I should have used both my hands 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:39.189
 to flatten it out because that's it 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:41.199
 gives a full portrait I think that 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:43.359
 store a dozen concerts like this 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.129
 in my closet it will be easier than 

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:45.909
 to store them as he was with 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:47.829
 the air inside 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:50.409
 here are the movies I hope you have 

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:53.079
 loved you loved today and that 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:55.689
 and it'll it'll it'll help you to 

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:56.559
 find ideas tips especially 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.929
 for storage 

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:01.989
 when you do not have enough space or 

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:05.399
 at home and so here I am doing well 

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:05.399
 of kisses and I tell you to check
