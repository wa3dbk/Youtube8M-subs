00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
happen and when that does happen we go

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.339 
happen and when that does happen we go
well<00:03:37.099> that<00:03:37.370> wasn't<00:03:37.549> our<00:03:37.759> intention<00:03:38.180> well<00:03:39.049> a

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
well that wasn't our intention well a

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.439 
well that wasn't our intention well a
good<00:03:39.620> way<00:03:39.739> of<00:03:39.769> looking<00:03:39.919> at<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.639> it<00:03:41.000> was<00:03:41.239> your

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
good way of looking at it is it was your

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.240 
good way of looking at it is it was your
intention<00:03:41.750> because<00:03:42.079> you<00:03:42.379> did<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.919> thing<00:03:43.129> in

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
intention because you did the thing in

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.189 
intention because you did the thing in
the<00:03:43.340> first<00:03:43.549> place<00:03:43.729> and<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.329> should<00:03:44.540> start

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
the first place and you should start

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.899 
the first place and you should start
thinking<00:03:45.319> about<00:03:45.709> what<00:03:45.919> the<00:03:46.040> consequences<00:03:46.759> are

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
thinking about what the consequences are

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.339 
thinking about what the consequences are
before<00:03:47.329> you<00:03:47.419> do<00:03:47.540> something<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.930> think<00:03:47.989> that's<00:03:48.259> a

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
before you do something I think that's a

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.219 
before you do something I think that's a
good<00:03:48.470> point<00:03:48.680> because<00:03:48.919> we<00:03:49.729> do<00:03:49.909> get<00:03:50.150> wrapped<00:03:50.479> we

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
good point because we do get wrapped we

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.800 
good point because we do get wrapped we
get<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:51.739> wrapped<00:03:51.769> up<00:03:52.280> in<00:03:52.489> living<00:03:53.359> in<00:03:53.479> the<00:03:53.599> now

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
get so wrapped up in living in the now

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.129 
get so wrapped up in living in the now
and<00:03:53.840> doing<00:03:54.799> stuff<00:03:55.250> because<00:03:56.150> we<00:03:56.269> feel<00:03:56.629> like<00:03:56.659> it

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
and doing stuff because we feel like it

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.709 
and doing stuff because we feel like it
and<00:03:57.379> we<00:03:57.620> kind<00:03:57.889> of<00:03:57.949> forget<00:03:58.400> that<00:03:58.729> everything<00:03:59.629> we

00:03:59.709 --> 00:03:59.719 
and we kind of forget that everything we

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.469 
and we kind of forget that everything we
do<00:03:59.900> has<00:04:00.109> consequences<00:04:01.329> positive<00:04:02.329> and

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:02.479 
do has consequences positive and

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.469 
do has consequences positive and
negative<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.169> even<00:04:04.099> though<00:04:04.340> we<00:04:05.150> might<00:04:05.329> be

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:05.479 
negative and even though we might be

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:10.509 
negative and even though we might be

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
all up and you put in the oven and when

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.749 
all up and you put in the oven and when
it<00:04:51.789> comes<00:04:51.969> out<00:04:52.590> you<00:04:53.590> have<00:04:53.770> a<00:04:53.800> cake<00:04:54.129> and<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:54.580> go

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
it comes out you have a cake and you go

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.140 
it comes out you have a cake and you go
I<00:04:55.000> didn't<00:04:55.659> want<00:04:55.810> a<00:04:55.840> cake<00:04:56.110> well<00:04:56.979> you<00:04:57.340> did<00:04:57.879> all

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
I didn't want a cake well you did all

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.330 
I didn't want a cake well you did all
the<00:04:58.360> things<00:04:58.780> that<00:04:59.289> are<00:04:59.650> going<00:04:59.830> to<00:04:59.979> end<00:05:00.219> up

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
the things that are going to end up

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.850 
the things that are going to end up
producing<00:05:00.729> that<00:05:01.120> cake<00:05:01.509> so<00:05:02.199> if<00:05:02.349> you<00:05:02.440> don't<00:05:02.620> want

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
producing that cake so if you don't want

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.379 
producing that cake so if you don't want
a<00:05:02.919> cave<00:05:03.190> don't<00:05:03.610> do<00:05:03.789> all<00:05:03.909> those<00:05:04.060> things<00:05:04.120> that

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
a cave don't do all those things that

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:05.969 
a cave don't do all those things that
produce<00:05:04.599> a<00:05:04.840> cake<00:05:05.050> and<00:05:05.199> I<00:05:05.289> think<00:05:05.469> that's<00:05:05.620> a<00:05:05.740> good

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
produce a cake and I think that's a good

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.450 
produce a cake and I think that's a good
way<00:05:06.669> of<00:05:06.699> seeing<00:05:07.150> is<00:05:08.639> to<00:05:09.639> start<00:05:10.000> thinking<00:05:10.719> about

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
way of seeing is to start thinking about

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.089 
way of seeing is to start thinking about
what<00:05:12.460> your<00:05:12.639> consequences<00:05:13.919> what's<00:05:14.919> going<00:05:15.069> to

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
what your consequences what's going to

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.029 
what your consequences what's going to
happen<00:05:15.159> if<00:05:15.879> you<00:05:16.000> do<00:05:16.180> something<00:05:16.719> and<00:05:16.930> I<00:05:17.740> think

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
happen if you do something and I think

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:19.709 
happen if you do something and I think
when<00:05:18.370> we<00:05:18.460> start<00:05:18.729> doing<00:05:18.879> that<00:05:19.180> when<00:05:19.419> we<00:05:19.509> start

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 
when we start doing that when we start

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.540 
when we start doing that when we start
thinking<00:05:19.750> about<00:05:20.199> it<00:05:20.469> more<00:05:20.650> we'll<00:05:21.340> really

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
thinking about it more we'll really

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.740 
thinking about it more we'll really
understand<00:05:22.120> whether<00:05:22.300> or<00:05:22.479> not<00:05:22.569> we<00:05:22.719> actually

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
understand whether or not we actually

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.480 
understand whether or not we actually
even<00:05:23.259> want<00:05:23.409> to<00:05:23.469> do<00:05:23.620> what<00:05:23.919> we're<00:05:24.069> doing<00:05:24.099> in<00:05:24.400> the

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
even want to do what we're doing in the

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.390 
even want to do what we're doing in the
first<00:05:24.669> place<00:05:24.909> so<00:05:25.360> um<00:05:25.629> hopefully<00:05:26.560> that<00:05:26.979> helped

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
first place so um hopefully that helped

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.249 
first place so um hopefully that helped
you<00:05:27.669> guys<00:05:27.819> I<00:05:27.879> know<00:05:28.210> it's<00:05:28.419> really<00:05:28.539> late<00:05:28.659> so<00:05:29.169> I'm

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
you guys I know it's really late so I'm

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.320 
you guys I know it's really late so I'm
probably<00:05:29.500> talking<00:05:30.009> all<00:05:30.400> over<00:05:30.699> the<00:05:30.819> place<00:05:31.029> and

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
probably talking all over the place and

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.089 
probably talking all over the place and
it<00:05:31.719> probably<00:05:31.930> didn't<00:05:32.199> make<00:05:32.319> much<00:05:32.529> sense<00:05:32.590> at

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
it probably didn't make much sense at

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.939 
it probably didn't make much sense at
all<00:05:33.340> but<00:05:34.270> essentially<00:05:35.080> the<00:05:35.229> point<00:05:35.500> I<00:05:35.710> was

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
all but essentially the point I was

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.369 
all but essentially the point I was
trying<00:05:36.129> to<00:05:36.400> get<00:05:36.610> is<00:05:36.840> instead<00:05:37.840> of<00:05:37.990> us<00:05:38.139> doing

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:38.379 
trying to get is instead of us doing

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:43.579 
trying to get is instead of us doing
this<00:05:38.620> whole<00:05:38.830> Yolo<00:05:39.629> vibe<00:05:40.629> and<00:05:41.400> doing<00:05:42.400> stuff

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:43.589 
this whole Yolo vibe and doing stuff

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:46.709 
this whole Yolo vibe and doing stuff
excuse<00:05:44.589> me<00:05:44.800> let's<00:05:45.669> try<00:05:46.029> and<00:05:46.180> do<00:05:46.300> a<00:05:46.330> better<00:05:46.569> job

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
excuse me let's try and do a better job

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:49.320 
excuse me let's try and do a better job
of<00:05:47.069> before<00:05:48.069> we<00:05:48.219> do<00:05:48.400> something<00:05:48.909> think<00:05:49.180> about

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
of before we do something think about

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.480 
of before we do something think about
all<00:05:49.659> the<00:05:49.900> consequences<00:05:50.349> not<00:05:50.860> just<00:05:50.919> the<00:05:51.279> ones

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
all the consequences not just the ones

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.760 
all the consequences not just the ones
that<00:05:51.729> you're<00:05:52.120> going<00:05:52.389> to<00:05:52.539> that's<00:05:53.500> going<00:05:53.710> to
