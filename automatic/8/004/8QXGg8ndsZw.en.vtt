what<00:02:35.310> happened<00:02:35.610> was<00:02:35.700> ammonium<00:02:36.270> nitrate<00:02:36.810> is

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
what happened was ammonium nitrate is

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.680 
what happened was ammonium nitrate is
what's<00:02:37.200> used<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:38.430> cause<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:39.000> charge<00:02:39.300> for<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
what's used to cause the charge for the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.110 
what's used to cause the charge for the
inflator<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.380> deploy<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.100> when<00:02:41.790> moisture

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
inflator to deploy and when moisture

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.210 
inflator to deploy and when moisture
gets<00:02:42.510> into<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.170> ammonium<00:02:43.620> nitrate<00:02:44.040> it

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
gets into the ammonium nitrate it

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.100 
gets into the ammonium nitrate it
changes<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.880> structure<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.630> chemical

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
changes the structure of the chemical

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.020 
changes the structure of the chemical
and<00:02:46.319> therefore<00:02:47.069> when<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.459> ignites<00:02:47.819> it

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
and therefore when and ignites it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.390 
and therefore when and ignites it
ignites<00:02:48.420> quicker<00:02:48.900> than<00:02:49.500> its<00:02:49.709> supposed<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:50.190> and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
ignites quicker than its supposed to and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.880 
ignites quicker than its supposed to and
the<00:02:50.580> frame<00:02:51.000> around<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:52.019> stew<00:02:52.590> on<00:02:52.620> the

side with airbag is retained in is

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.910 
side with airbag is retained in is
actually<00:02:57.390> getting<00:02:57.630> destroyed<00:02:58.290> because<00:02:58.650> it's

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
actually getting destroyed because it's

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.130 
actually getting destroyed because it's
it's<00:02:59.340> deploying<00:02:59.850> at<00:03:00.060> such<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.299> high<00:03:00.630> rate<00:03:00.660> and

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
it's deploying at such a high rate and

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.809 
it's deploying at such a high rate and
much<00:03:01.470> quicker<00:03:01.709> than<00:03:01.860> what<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.310> was<00:03:02.340> planned

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
much quicker than what it was planned

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.449 
much quicker than what it was planned
and<00:03:03.319> this<00:03:04.319> is<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.500> problem<00:03:04.920> because<00:03:05.010> now<00:03:05.310> you've

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
and this is a problem because now you've

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.330 
and this is a problem because now you've
got<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.850> shards<00:03:06.360> from<00:03:06.600> around<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.709> frame<00:03:08.040> of

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
got the shards from around the frame of

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.610 
got the shards from around the frame of
the<00:03:08.370> airbag<00:03:08.819> going<00:03:09.390> at<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.810> passengers<00:03:10.410> or

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
the airbag going at the passengers or

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.759 
the airbag going at the passengers or
the<00:03:10.890> driver<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.330> would<00:03:12.569> sound<00:03:12.870> as<00:03:13.200> if<00:03:13.410> that

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
the driver so it would sound as if that

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.880 
the driver so it would sound as if that
maybe<00:03:14.310> they<00:03:14.489> didn't<00:03:14.730> use<00:03:14.880> improper<00:03:15.890> materials

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
maybe they didn't use improper materials

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.590 
maybe they didn't use improper materials
here<00:03:17.100> but<00:03:17.489> they<00:03:17.610> didn't<00:03:17.850> do<00:03:17.940> enough<00:03:18.060> testing

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
here but they didn't do enough testing

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.059 
here but they didn't do enough testing
in<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.810> first<00:03:19.019> place<00:03:19.140> wouldn't<00:03:19.620> proper

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
in the first place wouldn't proper

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.460 
in the first place wouldn't proper
testing<00:03:20.549> have<00:03:21.000> shown<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.870> be<00:03:22.109> a<00:03:22.140> problem

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
testing have shown this to be a problem

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.080 
testing have shown this to be a problem
and<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:22.859> could<00:03:23.010> have<00:03:23.130> been<00:03:23.160> stopped<00:03:23.549> right

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
and this could have been stopped right

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.430 
and this could have been stopped right
at<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.329> at<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.600> initial<00:03:25.079> point<00:03:25.320> of

at the at the initial point of

at the at the initial point of
manufacture<00:03:26.060> right<00:03:27.060> what<00:03:27.269> happened<00:03:27.630> was<00:03:27.750> they

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
manufacture right what happened was they

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.440 
manufacture right what happened was they
used<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.290> use<00:03:28.320> sodium<00:03:28.769> azide<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.790> if<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.269> go

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
used to use sodium azide and if you go

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.610 
used to use sodium azide and if you go
and<00:03:30.630> look<00:03:30.720> at<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.170> department

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
and look at the department

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.380 
and look at the department
transportation<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:32.430> nitsa<00:03:32.790> reports<00:03:33.239> when

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
transportation the nitsa reports when

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.759 
transportation the nitsa reports when
they<00:03:33.480> started<00:03:33.780> interviewing<00:03:34.019> them<00:03:34.410> that's

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
they started interviewing them that's

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.280 
they started interviewing them that's
the<00:03:35.040> previous<00:03:35.640> product<00:03:36.150> was<00:03:36.600> they<00:03:36.840> used<00:03:37.079> and

were able to manipulate the system and I

think that has got to end and with
rosekind<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:15.330> I'm<00:05:15.450> afraid<00:05:15.720> he<00:05:15.930> might<00:05:16.110> be<00:05:16.230> too

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
rosekind and I'm afraid he might be too

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.350 
rosekind and I'm afraid he might be too
heavy-handed<00:05:16.770> but<00:05:17.070> this<00:05:17.370> is<00:05:17.520> a<00:05:17.550> very<00:05:17.940> smart
