00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
shapes and sizes that's sharp I was a

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.609 
shapes and sizes that's sharp I was a
dead<00:00:55.339> meat<00:00:55.580> anyway<00:00:55.930> we<00:00:56.930> can<00:00:57.019> take<00:00:57.229> this<00:00:57.409> back

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:57.619 
dead meat anyway we can take this back

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:59.229 
dead meat anyway we can take this back
to<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:57.799> office<00:00:57.979> with<00:00:58.280> us<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:58.640> when<00:00:58.760> Ali's<00:00:59.030> bad

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
to the office with us and when Ali's bad

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.859 
to the office with us and when Ali's bad
we<00:00:59.449> can<00:00:59.629> like<00:00:59.809> I<00:01:00.019> don't<00:01:00.260> know<00:01:00.320> hover<00:01:00.650> sit<00:01:00.890> on<00:01:00.979> it

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:01.869 
we can like I don't know hover sit on it

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:04.600 
we can like I don't know hover sit on it
so<00:01:02.869> there's<00:01:03.049> a<00:01:03.080> swell<00:01:03.440> shark<00:01:03.769> you<00:01:04.159> can<00:01:04.309> see<00:01:04.489> his

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
so there's a swell shark you can see his

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.880 
so there's a swell shark you can see his
mouth<00:01:04.760> there<00:01:05.089> it's<00:01:05.750> got<00:01:05.900> nice<00:01:06.080> lots<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:06.740> lots

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
mouth there it's got nice lots and lots

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.240 
mouth there it's got nice lots and lots
of<00:01:07.070> rows<00:01:07.250> of<00:01:07.430> teeth<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:08.740> shark<00:01:09.740> without<00:01:10.010> teeth

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
of rows of teeth and shark without teeth

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.500 
of rows of teeth and shark without teeth
is<00:01:10.460> pretty<00:01:10.670> much<00:01:10.760> a<00:01:10.820> dead<00:01:11.030> shark<00:01:11.299> because<00:01:11.420> I

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
is pretty much a dead shark because I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.969 
is pretty much a dead shark because I
can't<00:01:11.780> hunt<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.200> there<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:12.439> have<00:01:12.500> no<00:01:12.619> bones

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
can't hunt and there you have no bones

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.130 
can't hunt and there you have no bones
at<00:01:13.190> all<00:01:13.310> in<00:01:13.400> their<00:01:13.520> body<00:01:13.700> it's<00:01:14.510> all<00:01:14.750> cartilage

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
at all in their body it's all cartilage

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.920 
at all in their body it's all cartilage
so<00:01:15.560> they<00:01:15.890> lose<00:01:16.130> teeth<00:01:16.370> very<00:01:16.640> easily<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.210> that's

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
so they lose teeth very easily so that's

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.260 
so they lose teeth very easily so that's
why<00:01:18.050> they<00:01:18.230> have<00:01:18.260> this<00:01:18.760> feature<00:01:19.760> that<00:01:20.060> allows

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
why they have this feature that allows

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.870 
why they have this feature that allows
them<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.690> regrow<00:01:21.170> teeth<00:01:21.200> almost<00:01:21.890> up<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.160> 30,000

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
them to regrow teeth almost up to 30,000

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.780 
them to regrow teeth almost up to 30,000
