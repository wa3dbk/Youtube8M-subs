 and here in Brazil around 80% 73% 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.379
 of the Japanese and berthing that 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.580
 what used to be a very interesting strategy because of how 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.389

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:35.599
 the first centers of concentration of the community of the island of okinawa 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:37.689
 in the urge to vomit 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.689
 This is the story of Dora and the culture leaders of the municipality. 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:46.849
 it is she who takes us on a different tour in search of these many sectors 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:53.050
 marks left by this town in itariri and throughout the region arriving in agadez 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.800
 Refund 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.949
 alice so intensify the 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:00.369
 what legal geographic characteristics of aquidauana 

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:05.189
 then they ended up staying in anadia xvi cariri extended valley of the river 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:15.969
 ours was just the Japanese influence only those who are 

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.309
 what day is not what is common tokyo 

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:22.110
 hariri that practically you will be able to confer the immigrants of that are more 

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:24.020
 Brunette who came 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.619
 since on the moon 

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:26.619
 win 

00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:30.499
 then the features that are more modern the more muted the deputies 

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:33.020
 they are brighter at a little higher 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.520
 but the whole recent sequence of ours is therefore that the dialect of what is not 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.939
 different 

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:41.849
 so it does not prevent a dialect other than that of the precisely Japanese dialect to have a 

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:42.599
 different system
