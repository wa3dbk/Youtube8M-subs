00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 Now it gives me a boundary of boundaries of 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.780
 when the donald duck and mickey that 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.900
 would enter the intake if it does not have 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.520
 shirt and shoes lack the confirmation 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:21.300
 well did not provide good politicians there are no 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.529
 people without character and while we record 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.529
 in the nails 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:37.600
 photos of plan number 47 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.250
 please phase 2 is where we destroy 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.170
 of communications station of the 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.539
 cities with a thousand lightning 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.589
 million watts the city will remain 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.899
 defenseless 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.200
 we will invest those naive humans in 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:53.080
 little time 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.010
 Now if it moves you well it's time to 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.080
 move the juve to the attack position 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.300
 predicted to go to a country name in 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.840
 opposition with a hundred odds 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.840
 of people 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.710
 I'm calm, I have permission to do this 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.290
 it seems that 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.290
 children 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.000
 comfortable style 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.550
 but the cloud in the station 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.790
 communications when we destroy all 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.710
 the iron bay objectives will be destroyed 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.290
 and these horrible human children are 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.640
 will be without power until it looks like 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.640
 it's nobody my uncles 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.360
 to convert 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.429
 You should have warned me before using 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.429
 this package you are very good for that 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.470
 it's fine we do not always have to be 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.470
 in agreement 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.760
 and maybe this time is not so bad 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.080
 take them to a safe place 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.629
 welcome although I do the recess 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.849
 we were not having all the meat 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:57.019
 salty but you could not wait to 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.019
 to feel proud 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.620
 if we have the absolute safest power 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.620
 that the cloud is in position 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.870
 dt 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.519
 and because 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.150
 good 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.920
 to win 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.180
 that only very close 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.010
 wrong 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.010
 It is the fault 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.970
 let's go from here 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.959
 I'll let them slide to the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.959
 ground 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.140
 Y 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:20.459
 I'm impressed with us sometimes 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.199
 children in a background in lands 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.410
 they wanted to be able to bottle with Martian 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.419
 and she's not the only one who likes to know that 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.840
 you are so responsible and that there is no 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:35.070
 some madness like the pool 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.530
 gelatin that I can explain this is not 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.840
 Say nothing, I would just stop and clean 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:46.740
 since tonight and all weekend 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:49.880
 if necessary but we will keep it 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.880
 shapely 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.300
 thanks troll 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.030
 I do not want to know anything
