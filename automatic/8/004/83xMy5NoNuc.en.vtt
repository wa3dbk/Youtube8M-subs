iPhone jack into the the iPhone and then

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.610 
iPhone jack into the the iPhone and then
the<00:04:41.030> app<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.510> app<00:04:41.539> will<00:04:41.840> actually<00:04:42.169> display<00:04:42.350> on

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
the app the app will actually display on

the app the app will actually display on
the<00:04:42.710> screen<00:04:43.030> so<00:04:44.030> Toyota<00:04:44.479> does<00:04:44.600> a<00:04:44.660> different

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
approach for this they actually have a

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.689 
approach for this they actually have a
special<00:04:46.729> Entune<00:04:47.600> app<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:48.340> you<00:04:49.340> have<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:49.580> open

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
special Entune app and you have to open

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.879 
special Entune app and you have to open
that<00:04:49.970> app<00:04:50.150> up<00:04:50.330> first<00:04:50.660> and<00:04:51.020> then<00:04:51.410> all<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.740> other

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
that app up first and then all the other

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.040 
that app up first and then all the other
things<00:04:52.130> like<00:04:52.280> Pandora<00:04:52.789> work<00:04:53.330> through<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.930> app

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
things like Pandora work through the app

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.070 
things like Pandora work through the app
through<00:04:54.530> that<00:04:54.650> app<00:04:54.830> so<00:04:55.820> just<00:04:56.479> different

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
through that app so just different

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.420 
through that app so just different
strokes<00:04:57.440> for<00:04:57.530> different<00:04:57.620> folks<00:04:57.889> I<00:04:58.190> suppose

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
strokes for different folks I suppose

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.920 
strokes for different folks I suppose
different<00:04:58.789> ways<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:59.240> do<00:04:59.389> different<00:04:59.780> to

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
different ways to do different to

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.390 
different ways to do different to
accomplish<00:05:00.320> the<00:05:00.470> same<00:05:00.620> thing<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.810> then<00:05:03.560> so<00:05:03.919> if

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
accomplish the same thing and then so if

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.100 
accomplish the same thing and then so if
I'm<00:05:04.580> going<00:05:04.789> if<00:05:05.000> I'm<00:05:05.120> looking<00:05:05.270> at<00:05:05.570> stitcher

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
I'm going if I'm looking at stitcher

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.600 
I'm going if I'm looking at stitcher
that<00:05:06.289> will<00:05:06.440> actually<00:05:06.620> work<00:05:06.800> very<00:05:06.979> similarly

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
that will actually work very similarly

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.370 
that will actually work very similarly
to<00:05:07.789> the<00:05:07.970> way<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.510> pandora<00:05:09.080> works<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:11.380> the

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
to the way that pandora works and the

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.520 
to the way that pandora works and the
other<00:05:12.500> thing<00:05:12.680> I<00:05:12.770> wanted<00:05:12.979> to<00:05:13.039> show<00:05:13.220> you<00:05:13.250> was<00:05:14.530> was

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
other thing I wanted to show you was was

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.900 
other thing I wanted to show you was was
the<00:05:15.740> pairing<00:05:16.070> of<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.220> phone<00:05:16.460> because<00:05:16.729> it's

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
the pairing of the phone because it's

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.150 
the pairing of the phone because it's
much<00:05:17.060> simpler<00:05:17.510> in<00:05:17.630> this<00:05:17.780> particular<00:05:18.260> car<00:05:18.919> than

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
much simpler in this particular car than

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.469 
much simpler in this particular car than
it<00:05:19.280> is<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:19.580> other<00:05:19.700> any<00:05:19.880> other<00:05:19.970> car<00:05:20.270> that<00:05:20.300> I've
