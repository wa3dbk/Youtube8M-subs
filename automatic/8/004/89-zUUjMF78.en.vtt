when they again completely owned so next

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.910

is<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.520> Orgrimmar<00:01:29.520> arena<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:31.820> and

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
is the Orgrimmar arena I think it is and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.310 
is the Orgrimmar arena I think it is and
you<00:01:34.920> basically<00:01:35.369> start<00:01:36.299> right<00:01:36.630> close<00:01:36.930> next<00:01:37.290> to

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you basically start right close next to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.490 
you basically start right close next to
each<00:01:37.500> other<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.860> these<00:01:38.009> two<00:01:38.189> lifts<00:01:39.500> it's

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
each other and these two lifts it's

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.100 
each other and these two lifts it's
really<00:01:40.920> good<00:01:41.070> idea<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.670> spread<00:01:42.030> out<00:01:42.240> if<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
really good idea to spread out if the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.219 
really good idea to spread out if the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.670 
like really close bowel and no one's
close<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.510> diam<00:03:00.730> here<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:02.200> go<00:03:03.200> after<00:03:03.349> their

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680

priest<00:03:04.099> in<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.459> minute

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
priest in a minute

I<00:03:04.940> am<00:03:05.630> mind-controlling<00:03:06.319> off<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.829> edge<00:03:07.010> which

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
I am mind-controlling off the edge which

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.289 
I am mind-controlling off the edge which
pretty<00:03:08.150> much<00:03:08.239> means<00:03:08.720> they<00:03:09.110> can't<00:03:10.299> heal

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
pretty much means they can't heal

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.350 
pretty much means they can't heal
because<00:03:11.690> they're<00:03:11.959> outside<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:13.220> go<00:03:13.819> check<00:03:14.120> them

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
because they're outside so go check them

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.620 
because they're outside so go check them
off<00:03:14.450> here<00:03:14.750> make<00:03:15.380> like<00:03:16.099> that<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:17.120> now<00:03:17.299> hopefully

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
off here make like that so now hopefully

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.559 
off here make like that so now hopefully
where<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.889> heal<00:03:19.160> is<00:03:19.190> gone<00:03:19.819> we<00:03:20.150> have<00:03:20.299> enough

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
where the heal is gone we have enough

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.379 
where the heal is gone we have enough
burst<00:03:20.870> damage<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.650> take<00:03:21.829> down<00:03:22.239> someone<00:03:23.239> else

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
burst damage to take down someone else

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.599 
burst damage to take down someone else

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
before the Hitler gets back

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.360 
before the Hitler gets back
as<00:03:26.569> you<00:03:26.720> can<00:03:26.810> see<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.170> warrior<00:03:27.500> just<00:03:28.160> got
