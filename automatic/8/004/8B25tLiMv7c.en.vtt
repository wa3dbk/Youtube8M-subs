septum<00:00:24.990> piercings<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:26.130> slip<00:00:26.670> them<00:00:26.820> up

septum piercings is you can slip them up

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.060 
septum piercings is you can slip them up
into<00:00:27.420> your<00:00:27.779> nose<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:28.320> they<00:00:28.410> become<00:00:28.500> pretty

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
into your nose and if they become pretty

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.189 
into your nose and if they become pretty
much<00:00:29.130> invisible<00:00:29.630> unless<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.779> would<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
much invisible unless you would like to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.600 
much invisible unless you would like to
look<00:00:31.320> straight<00:00:31.650> up<00:00:31.710> my<00:00:31.830> nose<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.250> which<00:00:32.369> case

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
look straight up my nose in which case

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.310 
look straight up my nose in which case
that<00:00:32.910> ting<00:00:33.420> metal<00:00:33.780> up<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.050> would<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that ting metal up there would be the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.120 
that ting metal up there would be the
least<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.710> my<00:00:34.739> worries

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
least of my worries

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.060 
least of my worries
um<00:00:36.680> so<00:00:37.680> yeah<00:00:38.219> um<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:39.989> standard<00:00:40.590> septum

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
um so yeah um I think standard septum

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.740 
um so yeah um I think standard septum
ring<00:00:41.969> size<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.450> actually<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:44.360> 14-gauge<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:45.629> you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
ring size is actually a 14-gauge if you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.720 
ring size is actually a 14-gauge if you
go<00:00:45.840> into<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.140> shop<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.469> you're<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> girl<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.430> lot

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
little thing here I guess um I'd really

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.299 
little thing here I guess um I'd really
don't<00:00:58.320> notice<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.770> big<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> difference

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
don't notice that big of a difference

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.750 
don't notice that big of a difference
but<00:00:59.940> mine<00:01:00.840> has<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> 16<00:01:01.500> gauge<00:01:02.090> I<00:01:04.549> could<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
but mine has a 16 gauge I could do it

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.760 
but mine has a 16 gauge I could do it
myself

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
myself

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.010 
myself
disclaimer<00:01:07.770> um<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> video<00:01:09.659> up

disclaimer um I get to have a video up
of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.799> actual<00:01:11.220> piercing<00:01:11.750> but<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> took<00:01:12.869> it

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
of the actual piercing but I took it

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.179 
of the actual piercing but I took it
down<00:01:13.260> because<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.710> don't<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:13.979> want<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
down because I don't really want to

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.520 
down because I don't really want to
encourage<00:01:14.490> people<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.240> pierce<00:01:15.810> themselves

encourage people to pierce themselves

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.609 
encourage people to pierce themselves
because<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> terrible<00:01:17.970> idea

I wear ringing it like this which is

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.570 
I wear ringing it like this which is
just<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:41.010> retainer<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.290> that<00:01:43.290> flips<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:44.070> lot

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
just a retainer and that flips up a lot

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.650 
just a retainer and that flips up a lot
more<00:01:44.700> comfortably<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.300> that<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.450> wear

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
more comfortably the one that I wear

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.390 
more comfortably the one that I wear
when<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.080> down<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.710> little<00:01:47.009> guy<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
when it's down is this little guy and

when it's down is this little guy and
it's<00:01:47.520> actually<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:49.619> balls<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.250> or

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
two are too close together for me to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.510 
two are too close together for me to
flip<00:01:55.110> up<00:01:55.290> because<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.590> won't<00:01:55.710> fit<00:01:56.070> past<00:01:56.400> my

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.980 
flip up because it won't fit past my
nose<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:57.450> yeah<00:01:57.900> um<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.500> did<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.030> myself<00:02:00.030> last

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
there's like softer cartilage and if you

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.670 
there's like softer cartilage and if you
go<00:02:12.660> up<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> little<00:02:12.870> bit<00:02:13.019> higher<00:02:13.200> there's<00:02:13.530> like

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
go up a little bit higher there's like

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.920 
go up a little bit higher there's like
harder<00:02:14.040> cartilage<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.640> there's<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.880> soft<00:02:15.690> site

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
harder cartilage and there's a soft site

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.199 
harder cartilage and there's a soft site
in<00:02:16.050> between<00:02:16.320> that's<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.590> skin<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.310> that's

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
in between that's just skin and that's

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.740 
in between that's just skin and that's
where<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:18.600> supposed<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.900> go<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:19.370> put<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.489> there

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
where it's supposed to go I put it there

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.240 
where it's supposed to go I put it there
when<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.780> did<00:02:21.870> mine<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.470> had<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
when I did mine like I had it in the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.040 
when I did mine like I had it in the
right<00:02:23.430> spot<00:02:23.730> as<00:02:24.000> far<00:02:24.030> as<00:02:24.480> what's<00:02:24.720> called<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
right spot as far as what's called the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.500 
right spot as far as what's called the
sweet<00:02:25.260> spot<00:02:25.500> that's<00:02:25.800> part<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.160> skin<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.239> had

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
sweet spot that's part of skin but I had

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.090 
sweet spot that's part of skin but I had
it<00:02:27.630> too<00:02:27.780> far<00:02:27.959> back<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.560> didn't<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:28.920> how

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
it too far back and I didn't like how

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.620 
it too far back and I didn't like how
far<00:02:29.280> back<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.610> was<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:30.180> supposed<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.510> be<00:02:30.600> a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
far back it was it's supposed to be a

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.940 
far back it was it's supposed to be a
little<00:02:30.810> bit<00:02:30.900> closer<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.470> tip<00:02:31.769> of<00:02:31.860> your

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
little bit closer to the tip of your

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.550 
little bit closer to the tip of your
nose<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.970> um<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.660> took<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.019> out<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.500> figured

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
nose so um I took it out and I figured

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.789 
nose so um I took it out and I figured
I'll<00:02:35.400> just<00:02:35.640> get<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.880> done<00:02:36.000> at<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.239> shop<00:02:36.769> so<00:02:37.769> I

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
I'll just get it done at a shop so I

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.440 
I'll just get it done at a shop so I
went<00:02:38.070> into<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.310> shop<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.640> get<00:02:38.730> done<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.860> they

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
went into the shop to get done and they

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.380 
went into the shop to get done and they
clamped<00:02:42.450> me<00:02:43.220> with<00:02:44.220> septum<00:02:44.640> forceps<00:02:45.150> like

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
clamped me with septum forceps like

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.160 
clamped me with septum forceps like
these

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
these

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.970 
these
and<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:50.270> clamp<00:02:50.510> felt<00:02:50.750> really<00:02:50.960> low<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:51.800> mark

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
and the clamp felt really low so mark

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.110 
and the clamp felt really low so mark
was<00:02:52.100> in<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.250> right<00:02:52.340> spot<00:02:52.400> when<00:02:52.760> they<00:02:52.880> marked

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
was in the right spot when they marked

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.970 
was in the right spot when they marked
it<00:02:53.240> but<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.450> clamps<00:02:53.780> felt<00:02:54.020> really<00:02:54.440> really<00:02:54.830> low

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
it but the clamps felt really really low

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.460 
it but the clamps felt really really low
so<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:56.270> said<00:02:56.570> something<00:02:56.690> about<00:02:57.020> it<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.380> they're

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
so I said something about it and they're

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.720 
so I said something about it and they're
like<00:02:57.620> well<00:02:57.800> we'll<00:02:57.920> move<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.160> up<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.370> little<00:02:58.550> bit

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
like well we'll move it up a little bit

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.230 
like well we'll move it up a little bit
what<00:02:59.540> they<00:02:59.720> did<00:02:59.960> is<00:03:00.260> they<00:03:00.500> pierced<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.240> right

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
what they did is they pierced it right

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.360 
what they did is they pierced it right
through<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:04.400> skin<00:03:04.820> below<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:06.830> soft<00:03:07.070> part<00:03:07.310> of

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
through the skin below the soft part of

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.860 
through the skin below the soft part of
the<00:03:07.430> cartilage<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.210> was<00:03:08.330> crooked<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.660> it

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
the cartilage and it was crooked and it

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.480 
the cartilage and it was crooked and it
looked<00:03:09.080> absolutely<00:03:09.260> terrible<00:03:09.890> I<00:03:10.160> took<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.430> out

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
looked absolutely terrible I took it out

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.290 
looked absolutely terrible I took it out
in<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.700> car<00:03:10.910> on<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.240> way<00:03:11.330> home<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:14.090> called

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
in the car on the way home and I called

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.910 
in the car on the way home and I called
the<00:03:14.510> place<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.720> little<00:03:14.990> while<00:03:15.230> later<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.830> I

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
the place a little while later and I

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.530 
the place a little while later and I
asked<00:03:16.280> them<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.760> know<00:03:17.030> if<00:03:17.090> they<00:03:17.209> would<00:03:17.300> redo

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
asked them you know if they would redo

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.730 
asked them you know if they would redo
it<00:03:17.660> because<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:17.900> was<00:03:17.990> crooked<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.410> it<00:03:18.500> wasn't

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
it because it was crooked and it wasn't

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.280 
it because it was crooked and it wasn't
in<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:18.890> right<00:03:18.980> spot<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:20.450> I<00:03:20.990> should<00:03:21.140> have<00:03:21.230> been

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
in the right spot and I should have been

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.050 
in the right spot and I should have been
a<00:03:21.380> little<00:03:21.590> wary<00:03:21.920> when<00:03:22.130> I<00:03:22.190> called<00:03:22.550> because<00:03:22.760> the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
a little wary when I called because the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.449 
a little wary when I called because the
owner<00:03:23.240> and<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:23.690> talked<00:03:23.990> to<00:03:24.110> him<00:03:24.350> said<00:03:24.709> well

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
owner and I talked to him said well

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:26.770 
owner and I talked to him said well
stuff<00:03:25.670> interestings<00:03:26.239> are<00:03:26.360> hard<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.630> get

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
stuff interestings are hard to get

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.770 
stuff interestings are hard to get
straight<00:03:27.080> because<00:03:27.920> it's<00:03:28.700> hard<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.450> pierce

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
straight because it's hard to pierce

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.160 
straight because it's hard to pierce
through<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.140> cartilage<00:03:31.750> not<00:03:32.750> supposed<00:03:33.020> to<00:03:33.050> be

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
through the cartilage not supposed to be

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.240 
through the cartilage not supposed to be
through<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.350> cartilage<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:33.980> I<00:03:34.010> probably

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
through the cartilage so I probably

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.160 
through the cartilage so I probably
should<00:03:34.430> have<00:03:34.459> known<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:35.239> know<00:03:35.330> in<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.989> first

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
should have known you know in the first

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.840 
should have known you know in the first
place<00:03:36.350> but<00:03:36.860> I<00:03:36.890> went<00:03:37.130> back<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:37.430> because<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:37.730> how

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
place but I went back in because I how

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.760 
place but I went back in because I how
they<00:03:37.970> do<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.180> for<00:03:38.300> free<00:03:38.450> so<00:03:39.110> um<00:03:39.440> they<00:03:39.590> did<00:03:39.709> it

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
they do it for free so um they did it

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.210 
they do it for free so um they did it
again<00:03:40.330> exact<00:03:41.330> same<00:03:41.510> thing<00:03:41.780> so<00:03:42.110> I<00:03:42.470> was<00:03:42.590> sick<00:03:43.130> of

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
again exact same thing so I was sick of

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.070 
again exact same thing so I was sick of
it<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.790> I<00:03:43.970> wasn't<00:03:44.239> gonna<00:03:44.330> pay<00:03:44.540> do<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:44.900> again

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
it and I wasn't gonna pay do it again

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.510 
it and I wasn't gonna pay do it again
when<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:45.320> had<00:03:45.500> all<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.800> stuff<00:03:46.010> at<00:03:46.130> my<00:03:46.190> house<00:03:46.340> to

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
when I had all the stuff at my house to

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.960 
when I had all the stuff at my house to
do<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:47.000> just<00:03:47.060> did<00:03:47.540> it<00:03:47.660> myself<00:03:48.970> slowly

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
do it so I just did it myself slowly

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.860 
do it so I just did it myself slowly
painfully<00:03:50.480> I<00:03:51.310> used<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.730> 14<00:03:53.239> gauge<00:03:53.390> needle<00:03:53.420> like

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
painfully I used a 14 gauge needle like

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.280 
painfully I used a 14 gauge needle like
this<00:03:53.930> which<00:03:54.709> is<00:03:55.030> prepackaged<00:03:56.140> sterile

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.070 

I<00:04:00.819> used<00:04:01.819> a<00:04:01.939> 14-gauge<00:04:02.480> needle<00:04:02.510> because<00:04:02.930> the

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
I used a 14-gauge needle because the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.500 
I used a 14-gauge needle because the
needle<00:04:03.319> should<00:04:03.799> be<00:04:03.920> bigger<00:04:04.730> than<00:04:05.329> the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
needle should be bigger than the

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.289 
needle should be bigger than the
piercing<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.379> you<00:04:06.560> can<00:04:06.860> fit<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.909> end<00:04:08.090> of

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
piercing so that you can fit the end of

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:09.670 
piercing so that you can fit the end of
the<00:04:08.420> ring<00:04:08.599> right<00:04:09.049> into<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.409> end<00:04:09.560> of<00:04:09.620> the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
the ring right into the end of the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.050 
the ring right into the end of the
needle<00:04:09.769> and<00:04:10.010> just<00:04:10.220> follow<00:04:10.489> it<00:04:10.670> all<00:04:10.760> through

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
needle and just follow it all through

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.839 
needle and just follow it all through
like<00:04:11.510> in<00:04:11.689> one<00:04:11.840> swift<00:04:12.170> motion<00:04:12.349> because<00:04:13.159> chances

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
like in one swift motion because chances

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.910 
like in one swift motion because chances
are<00:04:13.970> you're<00:04:14.360> going<00:04:14.599> to<00:04:14.689> lose<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.079> pole<00:04:15.290> if<00:04:15.560> you

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
are you're going to lose the pole if you

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.740 
are you're going to lose the pole if you
do<00:04:16.040> do<00:04:16.160> it<00:04:16.250> yourself<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:17.030> it's<00:04:17.299> going<00:04:17.539> to<00:04:17.600> be

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
do do it yourself and it's going to be

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.750 
do do it yourself and it's going to be
really<00:04:18.440> sucky<00:04:18.799> if<00:04:18.979> you<00:04:19.100> take<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.400> needle<00:04:19.549> out

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
really sucky if you take the needle out

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.000 
really sucky if you take the needle out
and<00:04:20.030> then<00:04:20.419> try<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:20.690> put<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.019> earring<00:04:21.289> in<00:04:21.410> so

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
and then try and put the earring in so

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.260 
and then try and put the earring in so
it's<00:04:22.190> best<00:04:22.400> if<00:04:22.550> you<00:04:22.580> just<00:04:22.669> do<00:04:22.970> it<00:04:23.030> all<00:04:23.150> in<00:04:23.240> one

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
it's best if you just do it all in one

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.000 
it's best if you just do it all in one
but<00:04:23.930> I'm<00:04:24.020> not<00:04:24.139> encouraging<00:04:24.410> you<00:04:24.680> to<00:04:24.740> do<00:04:24.919> it

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
but I'm not encouraging you to do it

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.960 
but I'm not encouraging you to do it
yourself<00:04:25.070> because<00:04:25.610> your<00:04:25.910> nose<00:04:26.030> will<00:04:26.210> fall<00:04:26.360> off

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
yourself because your nose will fall off

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.159 
yourself because your nose will fall off
when<00:04:28.970> they<00:04:29.060> first<00:04:29.240> do<00:04:29.539> it<00:04:29.690> they'll<00:04:29.900> put

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
when they first do it they'll put

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.260 
when they first do it they'll put
something<00:04:30.620> larger<00:04:31.370> in<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.580> like<00:04:31.729> this<00:04:31.940> which

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
something larger in it like this which

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.330 
something larger in it like this which
is<00:04:32.389> pretty<00:04:32.539> much<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.750> same<00:04:33.080> kind<00:04:33.860> of<00:04:34.039> ring<00:04:34.220> as

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
is pretty much the same kind of ring as

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.400 
is pretty much the same kind of ring as
if<00:04:34.490> they<00:04:34.610> spend<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.120> out<00:04:35.240> a<00:04:35.270> little<00:04:35.449> bit<00:04:35.690> this

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
if they spend it out a little bit this

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.260 
if they spend it out a little bit this
you<00:04:36.620> can<00:04:36.800> flip<00:04:36.949> up<00:04:37.130> or<00:04:37.460> way<00:04:37.639> down<00:04:37.880> it<00:04:38.090> looks<00:04:38.210> a

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
you can flip up or way down it looks a

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.400 
you can flip up or way down it looks a
little<00:04:38.330> ridiculous<00:04:38.720> when<00:04:39.020> you<00:04:39.110> wear<00:04:39.229> it<00:04:39.260> down
