00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.070
 the film is called love is in the 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.869
 pre is a play on words a little bit 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.070
 difficult but at the same time that is 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.960
 very revealing of the question 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.359
 principal that is carried by the film to 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.400
 know what should we think of a system 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.850
 agricultural that kills its main 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.850
 users 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.040
 in all the regions of France 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.149
 farmers who are victims of pesticides 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.239
 suffer and die silently 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.920
 I discovered it with horror 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.489
 to say that a huge epidemic that is in 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.000
 train to arrive 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.940
 the farmers were poisoned to 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.550
 small dose for decades of 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.030
 people at the level of the manufacturers know 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.610
 very well that products sold to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.379
 farmers endanger 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.329
 the farmer see his family 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.719
 how come people who are 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.129
 dying of his practices 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.930
 continue in these same practices 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.489
 how is a farmer who 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.410
 dies at the wheel of his 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.420
 tractor continue to spread 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.590
 pesticides everywhere why that was 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.350
 a real question it's a real 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.660
 plot is actually trying to there 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.070
 answer I discovered what I 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.450
 want to call the chemical trap 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.880
 me my future I do not know what will 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.409
 to be come I'm nothing hello the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.850
 day 2 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.810
 all our products carry 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.810
 pesticides worry about it 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.000
 what I want is that the 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.490
 writers that the agricultural world is surrendering 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.079
 how much is it 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.180
 change all these practices it takes 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.180
 change this mode that suits us more 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:58.429
 let's get things back on track for 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:02:00.530
 to master I woke up I was 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.090
 paraplegic 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.130
 we wonder what happens 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.110
 ask if it's not a bad dream 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.940
 we certainly live a nightmare and 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.920
 we're going to wake up body bah yes and 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.209
 so this very consistent system is done 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.040
 so that nothing changes 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:21.830
 there is a kind of set of 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.330
 collusion between all these actors who 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.880
 arranges for the practices 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.860
 do not evolve in the middle of that there are the 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.130
 farmers who are being held hostage to 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.780
 this system that usually do not have the 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.730
 choice because they are held by the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.470
 credits because they have forgotten the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.390
 practices that is to say that in 50 years we have 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.910
 managed to erase thousands of years 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.459
 of transmission of agricultural practices 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.840
 and today we find ourselves in with 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.790
 a communication that explains us to 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.709
 only one possible model that is the one 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.760
 of chemical agriculture and 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.590
 intensive agriculture 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.630
 farmers are themselves to 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.970
 most convinced and they have beautiful in 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.530
 to burst they are unable to get out 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.250
 that's what it's all about 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.250
 denounces the film 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.860
 Oh
