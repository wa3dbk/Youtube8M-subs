00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 or the one that more to mind how to set 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.740
 Welcome back to my channel in 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.069
 this short video I'm going to do a boxing 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.320
 of this fly shadow helicopter is a 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.870
 easy-to-fly helicopter says here the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.269
 box with three infrared control 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.310
 Body channels and material structure 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.529
 abc non-toxic and stabilizer 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.869
 gyroscopic that allows auto of 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.289
 stabilize also says here the box 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.019
 which is charged with USB allows light of 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.619
 search I do not know what is rechargeable matter 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.910
 lifting control and for internal use 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.579
 basically according to the box is to give 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.290
 older than 14 years old then we go 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.469
 to show them that what comes in this 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.469
 box 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.020
 It is a portable box very easy to carry 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.110
 everywhere it comes with three little things 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.080
 to open one below and two above 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.470
 in the following video of tests of 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.720
 flight and I will show you how you see initialize 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.949
 pse on the flight with these 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.050
 dispositives 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.020
 as you will see it easily opens the box 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.690
 we can see the helicopter control 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:10.410
 let's see how easy it comes out I'm 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.979
 here very easy that really comes with 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.990
 a manual I recommend you first read the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.390
 manual before doing any any 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.450
 flight test and USB charger 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.980
 Carmen comes with a small rotor cited 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.040
 spare but that the rotor back 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.020
 to get the helicopter out of here there 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.540
 you want to tie it 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.900
 as you will see it is tied behind 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.600
 two parts and here and here above and the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.600
 control if it's not tied basically 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.480
 that's it for this video in the next 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.220
 video I'll do some flight tests for 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.860
 that you learn to handle this 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.350
 helicopter and ideally before 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.600
 go to crash read the manual miren 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.490
 the test videos and there yes since 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.130
 make the decision to buy it and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.900
 obviously enjoy the product that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.670
