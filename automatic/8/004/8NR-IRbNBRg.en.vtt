00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.980
 the human being destined to fail as 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.510
 human race is not pessimism reason of 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.430
 opposite weight to this is the action 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.950
 human inherent in ending everything 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.599
 what represents or supposes a 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.580
 threatens ourselves as beings 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.680
 humans but let's see why is 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.660
 destined to failure as an example 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.570
 I will put as quick and easy sample 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.279
 this same conversation because because of 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.680
 fact may be commented on perhaps as 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.270
 something wrong for many of you and 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.550
 in fact from there where the factor 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.680
 minimum of large-scale failure of 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.690
 man failure based on which all 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.700
 the best intellectuals in the world yet 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.040
 they still think that we can improve as 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.380
 human race in which all of them have 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.750
 overlooked the great factor of that 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.900
 human impropriety the factor of 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.900
 imperfection in this 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.460
 the human being can never be of 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.310
 according to the ideals of another being 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.770
 human what the right thing means what 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.050
 wrong for one is wrong for 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.420
 another one especially when it's 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.210
 propagates collectively in a group 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.330
 active of human beings at that time 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.640
 this becomes a threat that 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.070
 must be eradicated is an ideal 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.590
 become a threat that in hands 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.560
 of the strongest the weakest is the 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.020
 main engine of hate of racism the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.630
 nationalism of many feelings that 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.210
 in the end it is almost without realizing us 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.010
 attract the war with the most medium 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.260
 effective to end the threat more 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.660
 great in human history being 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.930
 human of ourselves and that's something 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.600
 that we can never avoid so I leave 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.340
 the question comments and participates how much 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.350
 you think it would be the best solution before 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.970
 this dilemma or it commands that you analyze and 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.650
 meditate on the documentation that I am going to 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.990
 leave next in the part 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.880
 bottom of the video has nothing to do 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.760
 with affiliate ads or things that 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.450
 they are precisely that being the tannery 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.490
 the jeans that I'm going to put on are 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.890
 information about real events that 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.180
 overcome the addiction facts that exceed 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.220
 the fiction because the results 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.170
 assumptions and expected in tests of 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.450
 cases human beings who were looking for 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.510
 demonstrate idealist theories were 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.280
 totally failed in these I will highlight 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.290
 first of all a movie that is 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.200
 based on real events of a 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.450
 experiment carried out in 1971 the 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.600
 stanford jail maybe some of 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.850
 you already saw it is something totally 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.190
 frightening similar to another experiment 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.920
 which is the milgram the experiment of 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.920
 milgram the second is a movie that 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.960
 shows another reality the intention of the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.480
 government of the most powerful by 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.880
 control the weakest based on 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.680
 projects like mk-ultra and emeka search 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.800
 our links will take you to others 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.570
 experiments that aims to observe 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.000
 what is the behavior plus oppression 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.830
 of the human being is precisely with the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.819
 order to find a better method of 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.560
 control the same human being 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.900
 Well, if you liked the video dale 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.299
 click on I like it if I do not like it 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.489
 It is also valid comments and we invite you 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.150
 to participate in other videos until 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.150
 the next
