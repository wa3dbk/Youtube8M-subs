00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:12.360
 super happy with you then the subject of 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.830
 my video 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.910
 today we are proud of this name when 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.189
 not penniless it was the period between two 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.070
 fuselages during which blow 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.010
 your natural hair at the base where are going 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.949
 to coexist with your relaxed hair that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.469
 are on the length is often it's 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.000
 a breakage period for the hair 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.820
 because so there are two textures so 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.390
 two types of hair with needs 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.090
 different and it's going to be complicated in 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.640
 general to be able to maintain 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.879
 hair during this period 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.170
 so that's why I 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.940
 want to make a video on the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.960
 stretching and give you some 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.989
 tips that I use to avoid the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.439
 breaks during this period so first 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.770
 thing this is the household and that's 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.680
 often the most offered area the asylum to 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.900
 the riskiest moment is when 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.150
 see we are going to untangle her hair 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.440
 during this stretching period because 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.690
 at the base you have known that 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.050
 natural people who are often very taken away 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.410
 very very hard a little bit harder and 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.970
 a thick to unravel and you have them 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.770
 relaxed hair that is on the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.100
 length below what will happen 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.070
 is that we tend to put the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.010
 pen is attracted to the hair 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.320
 natural that came to auch hair 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.810
 straightened high- level zone that 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.630
 I called from the exchange zone of 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.720
 demarcation where you have hair 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.280
 natural plus hair of seizures and 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.100
 it is a very sensitive point and often 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.220
 the case comes from this area because 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.530
 we tend to time out and so 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.430
 the hair that is friezes and that is 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.560
 more thin and fragile trend will have to have 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.990
 at low or even tend to rank at this 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.290
 level there so it leads to falls 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.390
 and breakage 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.000
 hair so what I advise you 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.670
 households is first of all 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.780
 to use products that are going 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:29.310
 facilitate demolding facilitate the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.970
 the country stage makes the passage of the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.120
 peg so I want me what I'm doing 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.620
 it's that I use of him serving in 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.459
 small amount does not need you in 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.549
 part is a liter in the hair 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.709
 just at the level of my natural hair 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.989
 because that's where your hair is 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.310
 a little harder to unravel really to 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:56.519
 try to 2.2 to apply it beyond that 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.750
 level there then I use my cream 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.659
 of daily expectations I also try to 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.030
 favor sprays we do not know 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.069
 because it also helps and 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.459
 hydration and also to the household 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:15.389
 at the natural hair level of you 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:19.379
 regrowth and after that then I use 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:21.299
 a father with big afro teeth only 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.680
 really ben ali it's during this 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.840
 period ti comb end 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.940
 not in this movie to untangle your 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.299
 unused hair only wholesale 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.599
 afro comb here is I select my 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:40.440
 hair often in 4 4 sections and game 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.840
 mails quietly in turn 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.379
 each of the sections that I did and 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.250
 that's it's easier and that's 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:54.659
 avoid breakage it avoids passing the pen 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:58.250
 treated him and shoot and that's a 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:02.579
 traction that often causes breakage 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.650
 that's the second thing as I said 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.870
 natural hair does not have the same 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.699
 needs that your hair straightened so 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.990
 during this period you have to arrive at 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:13.170
 manager 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.270
 the type of hair and their needs so 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.970
 natural hair is dry 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.250
 it must be emphasized the hydration 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.860
 level of your regrowing insisted on 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.670
 hydration moisturizing care etc. 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.200
 etc. 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:31.080
 so that your natural hair can 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.090
 to stay in good condition and especially that 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.000
 really prevents them from getting tangled 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.950
 too much your hair straightened at the park we 're going 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.520
 to be fragile weakened during this 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.760
 period 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.780
 so you 're it will have to insist on 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.240
 the sums are protected from care 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.610
 keratin for the purpose of repairing your 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.780
 hair straightened and prepare them for 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:59.250
 straightening 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:05:02.900
 no dog here are three echelons the 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.970
 protective style or licks the hairstyles 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.620
 protective during this period are going 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.860
 play a big role they are going to be very 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:15.020
 important because they are going 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.310
 decrease hastily 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.840
 handling the manipulation of your 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.880
 hair and that's very important because 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.350
 that as I said it's hard to 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:28.230
 to be able to disentangle them from them 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.730
 care etc which handle them to a minimum 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.350
 that's what you really need 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.820
 this period of protective stretching 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.050
 style what do you have the 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.310
 good mud often bun them he 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.160
 there is that to some girls who make 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.520
 braids too during this period you 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.520
 have 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:56.820
 the weavings what else the worst for 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.630
 those who therefore really prefer the 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.400
 mats 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:03.780
 all that will help repair and 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.630
 the rest of your hair during these 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.430
 periods when they are a little weakened 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.150
 manhandled waiting for the straightening 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.070
 so I'm going out of a stretching there so 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.850
 as you can see a game I'm going out 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:23.130
 I come out of a frenchy that lasted six months 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:25.980
 even a little over six months so that was 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.810
 really hard especially on the end but what 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.330
 that I can advise you 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.620
 it's just for medina for really 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.260
 those who are not used to 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.630
 lose and stretching along the 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.630
 treatment done step by step started 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.550
 by small stretching down 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.830
 three months so scoundrel in general 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.020
 minimum between straightening then 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.310
 go to four months five months and as 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.900
 and as you learn how to 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:53.970
 know your hair you're going 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:56.190
 learn to know how to manage 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.330
 both textures and then everyone 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.890
 does not have the same 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.200
 the same type in all this market that 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:04.950
 honey is regrowing but I want natural to 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.640
 base are pretty thin and not slip very 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:10.950
 kinky efficient and curly so that makes 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.670
 things a little easier by cons 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.800
 I know there are girls who have 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.970
 failed so very kinky so and regrowth are 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.520
 really very hard to handle 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:20.670
 and that's with the time you go 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.890
 be able to manage both 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.950
 textures and to be able to avoid at the moment 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:28.980
 this case here I hope my video 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:31.590
 you liked it was useful to you if 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.390
 you also have tips from cto 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.750
 below in the comments as 

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.840
 I usually have everything to you
