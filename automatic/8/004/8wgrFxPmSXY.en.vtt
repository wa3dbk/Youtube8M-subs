00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.510 
using this side not so much the pointed
side<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.509> sometimes<00:01:19.470> use<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> pointed<00:01:20.250> side<00:01:20.280> to

blend out the concealer around my

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.320 
blend out the concealer around my
eyebrows<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.619> if<00:01:23.009> I'm<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.189> doing<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:24.030> I

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
eyebrows but if I'm just doing this I

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.429 
eyebrows but if I'm just doing this I
just<00:01:24.689> kind<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.100> bounce<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:27.270> wipe<00:01:28.229> it

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
just kind of bounce it and like wipe it

a little bit to blend out the concealer

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.690 
a little bit to blend out the concealer
line<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.740> find<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.460> works

it and it just leaves such a nice like a
finish<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:56.360> know<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.509> always<00:01:57.990> look<00:01:58.259> like<00:01:58.290> crazy

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
finish I know I always look like crazy

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.240 
finish I know I always look like crazy
because<00:01:59.310> I<00:02:00.290> obviously<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
because I obviously have to do that the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.280 
because I obviously have to do that the
rest<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.579> my<00:02:02.700> makeup<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.810> blend<00:02:04.079> you

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
rest of my makeup for this to blend you

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.089 
rest of my makeup for this to blend you
know<00:02:04.409> put<00:02:04.619> my<00:02:04.740> powder<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.369> stuff<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:07.099> but

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
know put my powder on and stuff but but

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.520 
know put my powder on and stuff but but
like<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.369> said<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.789> have<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.090> say<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.569> think<00:02:10.259> it

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
like I said it I have to say I think it

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.170 
like I said it I have to say I think it
works<00:02:10.709> really<00:02:10.979> well<00:02:11.099> as<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.760> saw<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
works really well as you just saw in the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.360 
works really well as you just saw in the
demo

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
demo

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.620 
demo
and<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.670> saw<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.850> lot<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.060> people<00:02:16.270> just<00:02:16.300> saying

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
and I saw a lot of people just saying

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.600 
and I saw a lot of people just saying
that<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:16.900> was<00:02:17.050> too<00:02:17.230> small<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:18.190> do<00:02:18.370> anything

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
that this was too small to do anything

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.570 
that this was too small to do anything
but<00:02:19.000> not<00:02:19.690> for<00:02:19.930> me<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.200> mean<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.770> doesn't<00:02:21.400> take<00:02:21.550> a

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
but not for me I mean it doesn't take a

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.030 
but not for me I mean it doesn't take a
long<00:02:21.820> time<00:02:22.030> obviously<00:02:22.360> as<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.900> can<00:02:23.080> see<00:02:23.320> this
