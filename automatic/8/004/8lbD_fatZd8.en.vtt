00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.380
 Hello, how are I going to teach you? 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.060
 Some resolve this error after 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.150
 appear in this way in this case is 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.160
 an image that I found is from the heat and 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.639
 waterworld but in this case let's see 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.480
 call of duty 2 to another after 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:23.009
 appear like this on the console should appear 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.009
 error script com for the error 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.130
 when you make a server and you do not have 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.130
 no problem appears in this way 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.900
 I was reading a bit and apparently it's 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.900
 a file that is not compatible with the 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.690
 call of duty version and that's why it takes 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.770
 this error 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.710
 then what we have to do 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.860
 I'm going to close this 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:57.500
 windows what we have to do is 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.390
 find the file that is causing 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.220
 that mistake 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:07.400
 in this case I compare the two 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.800
 computers where I could see what the 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.930
 error what was the file there that was 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.780
 the rest 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:21.320
 and I found that it was this one here 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.320
 zzz yw fix point yw 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.680
 that file they will find in the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.640
 The call of duty folder 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.450
 ustec scares 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.450
 here 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.770
 we enter the call of duty folder and 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.409
 we go to the main folder 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.409
 it is this that is here maine 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.580
 and there we will find the file 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.330
 is this 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.290
 we are going to eliminate it 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.080
 or not 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.080
 got injured and let me have a little 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.190
 although we are going to eliminate 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.140
 and that's it, they can play 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.140
 let's open carlos 2 2 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.180
 we make a new server 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.550
 of max guagua 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.510
 we restart 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.440
 and it's already loading in the archives and 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.450
 everything and the error no longer appears 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.960
 then we will reopen the 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.960
 padlock ti 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.710
 in my case the version I have is the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.400
 1.3 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.400
 is not the original is this cracked 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:15.390
 and there a server appears and we can already 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.010
 enter I will enter with the other 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.019
 computer 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.019
 the server that I had done here 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.050
 and we will find it here 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.360
 so I think that's how it says that 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.360
 let's go to either of the two 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.390
 same here I have to appear 2 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.390
 I'm going to find out 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.220
 if we can play 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.270
 especially three hours 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.420
 well that's it until later I hope that 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.420
 serve them
