a<00:00:00.230> short<00:00:01.230> video<00:00:01.439> demonstrating<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.700> Honda<00:00:03.300> GL

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
a short video demonstrating the Honda GL

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.960 
a short video demonstrating the Honda GL
1000<00:00:04.560> going<00:00:05.009> just<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.310> show<00:00:05.549> that<00:00:05.580> it<00:00:05.819> does

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
1000 going just to show that it does

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.909 
1000 going just to show that it does
start<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.540> it<00:00:06.629> runs<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.410> that's<00:00:07.710> what<00:00:07.890> I

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
start and it runs and that's what I

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.169 
start and it runs and that's what I
think<00:00:08.130> just<00:00:08.340> working<00:00:08.460> with<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.760> brakes<00:00:09.030> and

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
think just working with the brakes and

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.240 
think just working with the brakes and
the<00:00:09.269> gear<00:00:09.420> so<00:00:09.660> first<00:00:10.500> thing<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.769> do<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.040> let's

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
the gear so first thing I do is let's

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.209 
the gear so first thing I do is let's
climb<00:00:11.519> under<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.849> black<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.210> stand<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.570> up

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
climb under the black and stand it up

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:21.769 
climb under the black and stand it up
it's<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:16.369> stand<00:00:17.369> up<00:00:19.130> and<00:00:20.130> ignition<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.270> see

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
it's a stand up and ignition on and see

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.880 
it's a stand up and ignition on and see
there<00:00:21.960> we've<00:00:22.080> got<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.289> O<00:00:22.320> light<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
there we've got the O light in the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.769 
there we've got the O light in the
Nutrilite<00:00:26.150> battery<00:00:27.150> seems<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> be<00:00:27.599> quite<00:00:27.750> good

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
Nutrilite battery seems to be quite good

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.439 
Nutrilite battery seems to be quite good
so<00:00:28.699> first<00:00:29.699> thing<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.119> up<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
so first thing we do is up to the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.440 
so first thing we do is up to the
junction<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.820> check<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> rear<00:00:33.090> brake<00:00:33.390> sign

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
junction and check the rear brake sign

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.029 
junction and check the rear brake sign
for<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.510> traffic<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.930> clear

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.740 

so<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.850> apply<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> little<00:00:42.269> bit<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.480> rear<00:00:42.719> brake

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
so just apply a little bit of rear brake

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.650 
so just apply a little bit of rear brake
which<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.440> can<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.679> there

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
which I can do there

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.919 
which I can do there
none<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.899> more<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:47.480> I'm<00:00:48.480> proofing<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
none of it more like I'm proofing that

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.689 
none of it more like I'm proofing that
the<00:00:49.109> rear<00:00:49.289> brake<00:00:49.620> disc<00:00:49.859> goes<00:00:50.010> nice<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.280> flat

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
the rear brake disc goes nice and flat

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.020 
the rear brake disc goes nice and flat
the<00:00:51.440> brake<00:00:52.440> doesn't<00:00:52.890> feel<00:00:52.979> as<00:00:53.190> powerful<00:00:53.940> as

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the brake doesn't feel as powerful as

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.520 
the brake doesn't feel as powerful as
some<00:00:54.239> modern<00:00:54.570> bike<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.109> guess<00:00:55.320> that's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
some modern bike but I guess that's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.200 
some modern bike but I guess that's
probably<00:00:55.769> how<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.039> supposed<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.119> I'm

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
probably how it supposed to be and I'm

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.279 
probably how it supposed to be and I'm
pretty<00:00:57.360> sure<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.659> Front's<00:00:57.899> gonna<00:00:58.049> be<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
pretty sure the Front's gonna be the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.439 
pretty sure the Front's gonna be the
same<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.610> bit<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.789> front<00:00:59.940> brake<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
same so a little bit of front brake a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.500 
same so a little bit of front brake a
little<00:01:00.690> bit<00:01:00.809> more<00:01:01.969> yeah<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.180> does<00:01:03.360> feel

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
little bit more yeah that does feel

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.810 
little bit more yeah that does feel
quite<00:01:03.659> Aldi<00:01:04.110> world<00:01:04.320> II<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.159> probably

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
quite Aldi world II but it's probably

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.200 
quite Aldi world II but it's probably
how<00:01:05.940> it's<00:01:06.119> supposed<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.509> I<00:01:06.600> should<00:01:06.810> think

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
how it's supposed to be I should think

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.370 
how it's supposed to be I should think
I'm<00:01:09.210> sure<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.509> could<00:01:09.659> improve<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.020> with

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
I'm sure you could improve that with

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.889 
I'm sure you could improve that with
some<00:01:10.670> scented<00:01:11.670> pads<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.149> something<00:01:12.509> I<00:01:12.630> bet<00:01:12.810> if

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
some scented pads or something I bet if

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.139 
some scented pads or something I bet if
you<00:01:12.960> didn't<00:01:13.200> mind<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.649> bit<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.920> disc<00:01:14.220> where<00:01:14.490> hey

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
you didn't mind a bit of disc where hey

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.460 
you didn't mind a bit of disc where hey
welcome<00:01:15.569> right<00:01:15.780> through<00:01:15.929> the<00:01:16.020> gears<00:01:16.259> our

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
welcome right through the gears our

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.350 
welcome right through the gears our
first<00:01:16.740> gear<00:01:16.950> now<00:01:17.840> second

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.360 

fourth<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:25.490> fifth<00:01:26.770> transmission<00:01:27.770> feels<00:01:28.040> nice

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
fourth the fifth transmission feels nice

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.540 
fourth the fifth transmission feels nice
and<00:01:28.400> smooth<00:01:28.970> it's<00:01:29.390> quiet<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.930> clutch<00:01:30.140> feels

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
and smooth it's quiet the clutch feels

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.190 
and smooth it's quiet the clutch feels
pretty<00:01:31.550> much<00:01:31.790> as<00:01:32.000> it<00:01:32.120> should<00:01:32.150> do<00:01:32.540> feel

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
pretty much as it should do feel

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.110 
pretty much as it should do feel
slightly<00:01:33.710> stiff<00:01:34.130> on<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.340> cable<00:01:34.670> I<00:01:34.700> suppose

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
slightly stiff on the cable I suppose

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.750 
slightly stiff on the cable I suppose
that<00:01:35.450> it's<00:01:36.200> fine<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.420> horn<00:01:39.520> there<00:01:40.520> we<00:01:40.610> go

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
that it's fine and the horn there we go

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.100 
that it's fine and the horn there we go
I<00:01:41.030> just<00:01:41.210> take<00:01:41.479> my<00:01:41.600> hands<00:01:41.810> off<00:01:41.900> the<00:01:41.990> handlebars

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
I just take my hands off the handlebars

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.490 
I just take my hands off the handlebars
easy<00:01:42.770> going<00:01:43.010> on<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:43.340> straight<00:01:45.070> there<00:01:46.070> we<00:01:46.160> go

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
easy going on so straight there we go

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.740 
easy going on so straight there we go
then<00:01:48.500> yeah<00:01:49.370> the<00:01:49.640> by<00:01:49.850> it's<00:01:50.000> got<00:01:50.120> a<00:01:50.150> nice<00:01:50.390> sort<00:01:50.660> of

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
then yeah the by it's got a nice sort of

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.120 
then yeah the by it's got a nice sort of
big<00:01:51.110> gutsy<00:01:51.650> meaty<00:01:51.860> filter<00:01:52.340> little<00:01:52.729> smooth<00:01:53.030> I

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
big gutsy meaty filter little smooth I

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.320 
big gutsy meaty filter little smooth I
should<00:01:55.130> think<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.369> fuel<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:55.850> bike<00:01:56.090> is

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
should think the fuel in the bike is

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.990 
should think the fuel in the bike is
fairly<00:01:56.600> old<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:56.990> noticed<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.440> tick<00:01:57.650> over<00:01:58.000> when

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
fairly old I noticed the tick over when

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.820 
fairly old I noticed the tick over when
I<00:01:59.030> first<00:01:59.360> started<00:01:59.869> it<00:02:00.020> up<00:02:00.170> was<00:02:00.410> a<00:02:00.440> little<00:02:00.560> bit

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
I first started it up was a little bit

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.140 
I first started it up was a little bit
erratic<00:02:01.100> that's<00:02:01.430> kind<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.640> smoothed<00:02:01.910> out<00:02:02.090> a

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
erratic that's kind of smoothed out a

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.150 
erratic that's kind of smoothed out a
bit<00:02:02.330> now

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
bit now

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.400 
bit now
there<00:02:04.160> we<00:02:04.250> go
