30 V blade start off with deployment
even<00:00:26.810> though<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.400> really<00:00:29.400> fast<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:35.550> walk-up

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
even though it's really fast the walk-up

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.090 
even though it's really fast the walk-up
is<00:00:37.710> really<00:00:38.489> tight<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.059> mean<00:00:39.649> even<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.860> come

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
up to the tip like most people check it

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.750 
up to the tip like most people check it
they<00:00:43.559> go<00:00:43.680> down<00:00:43.860> here<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.340> talk<00:00:44.460> about<00:00:44.640> the

right<00:01:17.840> here<00:01:18.020> we<00:01:18.170> got<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:19.720> zero<00:01:20.720> tolerance

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
right here we got the zero tolerance

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.900 

well<00:01:48.800> I<00:01:48.830> moved<00:01:49.159> it<00:01:49.310> from<00:01:49.369> up<00:01:49.550> here<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.880> down

well I moved it from up here to down

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.609 
well I moved it from up here to down
here<00:01:50.090> because<00:01:50.750> that's<00:01:51.020> how<00:01:51.140> most<00:01:51.259> people

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
here because that's how most people

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.130 
here because that's how most people
carry<00:01:51.830> their<00:01:51.890> knives<00:01:52.220> in<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:53.300> right<00:01:53.479> pocket

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
carry their knives in the right pocket

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.940

if<00:01:54.410> they're<00:01:54.560> right-handed<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:56.950> you

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
if they're right-handed and that you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.389 
if they're right-handed and that you
could<00:01:58.070> reach<00:01:58.250> in<00:01:58.399> your<00:01:58.460> pocket<00:02:00.190> clump<00:02:01.190> it<00:02:01.280> down

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.160 

it's<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.880> big<00:02:26.090> feature<00:02:26.329> of<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.510> knife<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:26.750> just

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
it's a big feature of the knife so just

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.110 
it's a big feature of the knife so just
use<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.320> Tang<00:02:27.680> it's<00:02:28.130> easier<00:02:30.489> it's<00:02:31.489> easier<00:02:31.700> on

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
use a Tang it's easier it's easier on

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:43.770 
use a Tang it's easier it's easier on
the<00:02:32.329> bushings<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.320> mean<00:02:33.500> on<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.829> washers<00:02:39.310> yeah

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.900 

the<00:02:44.829> thing<00:02:45.829> that<00:02:45.980> stops<00:02:46.220> are<00:02:46.489> right<00:02:46.640> here

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
the thing that stops are right here

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.430 
the thing that stops are right here
because<00:02:47.239> this<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.570> collaboration<00:02:48.110> with

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
because this is a collaboration with

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.640 
because this is a collaboration with
strider<00:02:49.340> knives<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.870> thing<00:02:54.140> that<00:02:54.320> stops

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
strider knives the the thing that stops

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.490 
strider knives the the thing that stops
the<00:02:54.980> blade<00:02:55.299> instead<00:02:56.299> of<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.540> being<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.900> stop<00:02:57.260> bar

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
the blade instead of it being a stop bar

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.800 
the blade instead of it being a stop bar
is<00:02:58.220> actually<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.790> thumb<00:02:59.030> studs<00:02:59.390> hitting<00:02:59.720> the

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
is actually the thumb studs hitting the

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:09.000 
is actually the thumb studs hitting the
liners<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:05.019> it<00:03:06.019> just<00:03:06.200> makes<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.590> stronger

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
liners and it just makes it stronger

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.550 
liners and it just makes it stronger
pretty<00:03:10.010> cool<00:03:10.190> feature<00:03:11.410> strategy<00:03:12.410> really

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
pretty cool feature strategy really

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.820 
pretty cool feature strategy really
expensive

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.680 

has<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:17.550> reverse<00:03:18.060> grip<00:03:19.100> jumping<00:03:20.100> right<00:03:20.220> here<00:03:20.690> if

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
has a reverse grip jumping right here if

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.600 
has a reverse grip jumping right here if
