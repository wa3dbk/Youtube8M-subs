by peasants either have a jailbreak it's

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.449 
by peasants either have a jailbreak it's
pretty<00:02:55.000> much<00:02:55.150> like<00:02:55.769> you'd<00:02:56.769> see<00:02:56.860> on<00:02:56.980> bypass

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
pretty much like you'd see on bypass

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.030 
pretty much like you'd see on bypass

on<00:03:04.870> here<00:03:05.080> with<00:03:05.170> this<00:03:05.260> download<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:06.430> have<00:03:06.579> to

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
on here with this download you have to

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.479 
on here with this download you have to
get<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:06.910> CFG<00:03:07.560> infection<00:03:08.560> for<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.070> activate

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
get a CFG infection for it to activate

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.830 
get a CFG infection for it to activate
and<00:03:09.640> it's<00:03:09.730> an<00:03:09.850> infection<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.570> have<00:03:10.660> to<00:03:10.720> get

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
and it's an infection so you have to get

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.900 
and it's an infection so you have to get
it<00:03:10.930> every<00:03:11.230> time<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:12.130> want<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.400> use<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:12.579> again

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
it every time you want to use it again

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.780 
it every time you want to use it again
