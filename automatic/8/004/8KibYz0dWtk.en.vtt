00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
end I'll show you my design for this and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:01:41.130 
end I'll show you my design for this and
some<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> molds<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.420> made

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.350 

so<00:01:42.140> yeah<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:42.590> didn't<00:01:43.070> use<00:01:43.250> all<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.789> pastries<00:01:44.030> I

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
so yeah I didn't use all the pastries I

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.450 
so yeah I didn't use all the pastries I
need<00:01:44.570> but<00:01:44.869> I<00:01:45.020> tried<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.500> fill<00:01:45.710> on<00:01:45.830> as<00:01:46.009> many<00:01:46.189> as<00:01:46.369> I

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
need but I tried to fill on as many as I

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.560 
need but I tried to fill on as many as I
possibly<00:01:46.670> could<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:47.630> here's<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.020> design<00:01:48.380> um<00:01:48.679> I

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
possibly could so here's the design um I

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.020 
possibly could so here's the design um I
was<00:01:50.570> originally<00:01:50.810> going<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.409> paint<00:01:51.740> on<00:01:52.030> this

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
was originally going to paint on this

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.800 
was originally going to paint on this
design<00:01:53.539> onto<00:01:54.520> possibly<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.670> saucer<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.360> then

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
design onto possibly the saucer and then

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.770 
design onto possibly the saucer and then
round<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.320> rim<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:58.189> teacup<00:01:58.610> but<00:01:59.539> I

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
round the rim of the teacup but I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.809 
round the rim of the teacup but I
thought<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.799> it<00:02:01.130> would<00:02:01.220> look<00:02:01.369> a<00:02:01.490> bit<00:02:01.610> better

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
thought that it would look a bit better

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.230 
thought that it would look a bit better
if<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.479> put<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.869> cloth<00:02:03.170> on<00:02:03.409> instead<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.159> I<00:02:05.119> was

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
if I put the cloth on instead and I was

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.889 
if I put the cloth on instead and I was
also<00:02:05.569> originally<00:02:05.780> going<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.770> put<00:02:07.100> on<00:02:07.899> these

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
also originally going to put on these

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.590 
also originally going to put on these
but<00:02:09.350> these<00:02:09.649> fruit<00:02:10.130> bits<00:02:10.519> of<00:02:10.700> fruit<00:02:10.880> on<00:02:11.269> the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
but these fruit bits of fruit on the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.100 
but these fruit bits of fruit on the
side<00:02:11.630> of<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:12.200> on<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.680> side<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.100> salsa<00:02:13.519> and

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
side of it on the side of the salsa and

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.380 
side of it on the side of the salsa and
but<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.319> decided<00:02:15.830> not<00:02:16.069> to<00:02:16.310> because<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.970> don't

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
but I decided not to because I don't

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.090 
but I decided not to because I don't
think<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:17.690> look<00:02:17.870> as<00:02:18.019> good<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:18.560> now<00:02:18.590> here<00:02:18.980> are

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
think it look as good so now here are

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.880 
think it look as good so now here are
some<00:02:19.130> of<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.489> molds<00:02:19.940> here's<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.989> mold<00:02:21.410> for

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
some of the molds here's the mold for

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.420 
some of the molds here's the mold for
the<00:02:22.390> spin<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:24.340> basically<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.870> just<00:02:27.280> goes<00:02:28.280> like

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
the spin and basically it just goes like

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.570 
the spin and basically it just goes like
that<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:30.019> just<00:02:30.080> made<00:02:30.440> this<00:02:30.830> with<00:02:31.099> scrap

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
that and I just made this with scrap

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.610 
that and I just made this with scrap
clay<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:33.709> then<00:02:33.980> here's<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.609> mold<00:02:34.940> for<00:02:35.180> the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
clay and then here's a mold for the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.979 
clay and then here's a mold for the
saucer<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.160> if<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.459> liked<00:02:37.670> my<00:02:37.880> entry<00:02:38.450> then<00:02:38.840> I'd
