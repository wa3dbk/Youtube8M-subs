is the server and in this case for
example<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.539> screen<00:00:48.840> now<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.590> server<00:00:49.980> is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
example it's on screen now the server is

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.630 
example it's on screen now the server is
smoothie<00:00:50.460> calm<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.320> then<00:00:52.320> depending<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.430> how

yours<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.090> configured<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.320> will<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.590> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
yours is configured you will have a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.729 
yours is configured you will have a
username<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.489> mine<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.210> case<00:00:57.449> was<00:00:57.739> ftp

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
username and mine in this case was ftp

username and mine in this case was ftp
smoothie<00:00:59.219> calm<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.760> then<00:01:00.750> there's<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
smoothie calm and then there's a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.779 
smoothie calm and then there's a

so<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.300> can't<00:01:03.539> go<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.750> upload<00:01:04.080> stuff<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
so that you can't go and upload stuff to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.770 
so that you can't go and upload stuff to
my<00:01:04.650> site<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.189> there's<00:01:05.909> different<00:01:06.240> pathways

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
my site and there's different pathways
