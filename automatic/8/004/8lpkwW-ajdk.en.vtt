00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
not normal and back i start the weakling

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
you gare back right now because I don't

want<00:05:24.290> to<00:05:24.440> waste<00:05:24.470> the<00:05:24.740> duration<00:05:25.310> on<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.640> boost

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
want to waste the duration on the boost

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.580 
want to waste the duration on the boost
so<00:05:26.180> that<00:05:26.980> if<00:05:27.980> someone<00:05:28.550> is<00:05:28.880> uh<00:05:28.910> on<00:05:29.510> the<00:05:30.140> backup

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
so that if someone is uh on the backup

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.890 
so that if someone is uh on the backup
position<00:05:30.770> their<00:05:31.730> duration<00:05:32.360> goes<00:05:32.510> down<00:05:32.750> which

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
position their duration goes down which

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.110 
position their duration goes down which
sucks<00:05:33.230> so<00:05:33.440> if<00:05:33.500> you're<00:05:33.620> not<00:05:33.710> using<00:05:34.010> them<00:05:34.280> what's

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
sucks so if you're not using them what's

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.420 
sucks so if you're not using them what's
