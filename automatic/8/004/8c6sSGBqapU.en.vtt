00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
steering servo somewhere as well under

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.679

this<00:01:27.640> part<00:01:28.180> in<00:01:29.549> here<00:01:30.549> is<00:01:30.700> simply<00:01:31.180> turn<00:01:31.570> it

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
this part in here is simply turn it

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.460 
this part in here is simply turn it
round<00:01:31.840> now<00:01:32.400> here<00:01:33.400> we<00:01:33.580> have<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:34.229> engine<00:01:35.229> I

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
round now here we have the engine I

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.310 
round now here we have the engine I
believe<00:01:36.280> it's<00:01:36.400> a<00:01:36.490> 15<00:01:36.939> or<00:01:37.119> 18<00:01:37.330> engine<00:01:37.869> iconic

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
believe it's a 15 or 18 engine iconic

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.499 
believe it's a 15 or 18 engine iconic
scene<00:01:38.470> remember<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:39.130> this<00:01:39.700> is<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:40.119> chain

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
scene remember and this is a chain

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.530 
scene remember and this is a chain
driven<00:01:40.990> engine<00:01:41.799> ok<00:01:42.430> well<00:01:42.880> it's<00:01:43.180> kind<00:01:43.450> of

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
driven engine ok well it's kind of

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.820 
driven engine ok well it's kind of
changing<00:01:43.990> them<00:01:44.110> because<00:01:44.350> you<00:01:44.439> actually<00:01:44.710> have

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
changing them because you actually have

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
changing them because you actually have
the<00:01:44.920> spur<00:01:45.280> gear<00:01:45.310> which<00:01:46.060> then<00:01:46.619> OC

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the spur gear which then OC

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.880 
the spur gear which then OC
powers<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.180> moves<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.229> belgae<00:01:52.439> these<00:01:53.439> big

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
powers and moves the belgae these big

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.520 
powers and moves the belgae these big
will<00:01:54.369> see<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:54.820> nice<00:01:55.090> careful<00:01:55.689> detail<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.380> of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
will see a nice careful detail and of

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.810 
will see a nice careful detail and of
course<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:56.890> have<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:58.229> big<00:01:59.229> scale<00:01:59.820> details

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
course you have the big scale details

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.120 
course you have the big scale details
put<00:02:01.090> in<00:02:01.240> like<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.570> disc<00:02:01.900> brakes<00:02:02.259> insides<00:02:02.890> here

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
put in like the disc brakes insides here

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.780 
put in like the disc brakes insides here
as<00:02:03.280> well<00:02:03.549> and<00:02:03.820> all<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.360> forks<00:02:04.810> etc<00:02:05.470> and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
as well and all the forks etc and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.259 
as well and all the forks etc and
finally<00:02:06.790> under<00:02:07.450> here<00:02:07.659> we<00:02:08.019> have<00:02:08.259> got<00:02:09.269> very

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
finally under here we have got very

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.759 
finally under here we have got very
small<00:02:10.690> it's<00:02:11.470> looking<00:02:12.269> fuel<00:02:13.269> tank<00:02:13.600> ok<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.560> need

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
small it's looking fuel tank ok I need

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.340 
small it's looking fuel tank ok I need
to<00:02:14.829> look<00:02:15.010> up<00:02:15.190> how<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.489> fill<00:02:16.329> this<00:02:16.630> one<00:02:16.900> up<00:02:16.959> I

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
to look up how to fill this one up I

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.610 
to look up how to fill this one up I
guess<00:02:18.060> through<00:02:19.060> some<00:02:19.570> special<00:02:20.110> tube

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
guess through some special tube

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.979 
guess through some special tube
somewhere<00:02:20.950> but<00:02:21.790> it's<00:02:22.090> actually<00:02:22.480> looking<00:02:22.810> very

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
somewhere but it's actually looking very

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.650 
somewhere but it's actually looking very
very<00:02:23.320> nice<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.769> I<00:02:24.489> just<00:02:24.640> need<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.150> find<00:02:25.420> out

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
very nice and I just need to find out

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.810 
very nice and I just need to find out
where<00:02:25.989> does<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.530> receiver<00:02:26.980> go<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.459> where<00:02:27.610> do

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
where does the receiver go and where do

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.339 
where does the receiver go and where do
you<00:02:28.000> actually<00:02:28.239> install<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.319> batteries<00:02:31.200> or<00:02:32.200> do

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
you actually install the batteries or do

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.040 
you actually install the batteries or do
they

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
they

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.590
