is<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.820> tongue<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:42.070> this<00:04:42.190> guy's<00:04:42.430> got<00:04:42.760> a<00:04:43.110> very

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
is the tongue that this guy's got a very

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.030 
is the tongue that this guy's got a very
flexible<00:04:44.500> tongue<00:04:46.260> you<00:04:47.260> can<00:04:47.380> see<00:04:47.620> there<00:04:47.919> is

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
flexible tongue you can see there is

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.850 
flexible tongue you can see there is
quite<00:04:48.160> some<00:04:48.460> movement<00:04:49.180> here<00:04:49.480> ok<00:04:50.050> and<00:04:50.320> it's

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
quite some movement here ok and it's

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.780 
quite some movement here ok and it's
developed<00:04:51.370> fully<00:04:51.640> in<00:04:52.000> softimage<00:04:52.690> xsi<00:04:52.810> and<00:04:53.790> of

to share this Chung rig with you it will

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:21.390 
to share this Chung rig with you it will
find<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:15.419> tunnel<00:05:16.419> rig<00:05:16.840> and<00:05:19.919> let<00:05:20.919> me<00:05:21.070> open<00:05:21.160> up

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
find the tunnel rig and let me open up

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.980 
find the tunnel rig and let me open up
the<00:05:21.760> ice<00:05:22.620> tray<00:05:23.620> ok<00:05:24.160> this<00:05:24.580> is<00:05:24.760> the<00:05:24.790> Tungri<00:05:25.210> ok

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
the ice tray ok this is the Tungri ok

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.620 
the ice tray ok this is the Tungri ok
you<00:05:26.050> can<00:05:26.260> adjust<00:05:26.380> adjust<00:05:27.070> all<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:28.720> know

and all the curls and all here inside of

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.790 
and all the curls and all here inside of
this<00:05:38.420> is<00:05:38.780> the<00:05:39.550> calculation<00:05:40.660> okay<00:05:41.660> I'd<00:05:42.440> not

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
this is the calculation okay I'd not

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.410 
this is the calculation okay I'd not
recommend<00:05:43.280> you<00:05:43.490> to<00:05:43.790> mess<00:05:44.660> with<00:05:45.470> it<00:05:45.500> if<00:05:46.310> you<00:05:47.030> are

recommend you to mess with it if you are
not<00:05:48.230> you<00:05:49.100> know<00:05:49.130> introduced<00:05:49.820> to<00:05:51.370> the<00:05:52.370> ice

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
not you know introduced to the ice

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.180 
not you know introduced to the ice
kinematics<00:05:53.420> part<00:05:53.750> in<00:05:54.080> softimage<00:05:54.590> xsi<00:05:54.620> but

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
kinematics part in softimage xsi but

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.170 
kinematics part in softimage xsi but
still<00:05:55.430> you<00:05:55.880> can<00:05:56.150> you<00:05:56.420> can<00:05:56.630> have<00:05:57.280> you<00:05:58.280> can<00:05:58.520> use
