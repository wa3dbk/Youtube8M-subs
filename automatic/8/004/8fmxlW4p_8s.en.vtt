look like so what does it do it's got
GPS<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.800> internet<00:00:56.370> connectivity<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
GPS in it internet connectivity to it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.290 
GPS in it internet connectivity to it
and<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.690> interface<00:00:58.260> for<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.340> talk<00:00:59.820> to

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and the interface for it is you talk to

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.650 
and the interface for it is you talk to
it<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:01.050> say<00:01:01.230> Google<00:01:02.129> glass<00:01:02.370> take<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> photo

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
it you can say Google glass take a photo

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.350 
it you can say Google glass take a photo
and<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:05.040> takes<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.460> photo<00:01:05.790> using<00:01:06.090> that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and it takes that photo using that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.090 
and it takes that photo using that
camera<00:01:06.780> which<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.080> exactly<00:01:07.260> what<00:01:07.890> you're

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
camera which is exactly what you're

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.370 
camera which is exactly what you're
seeing<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.970> seems<00:01:09.299> pretty<00:01:09.420> neat<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> idea

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
seeing this seems pretty neat the idea

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.170

seems<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.049> little<00:01:49.259> too<00:01:49.979> much<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.670> a

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
seems a little too much like it's a

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.179 
seems a little too much like it's a
little<00:01:50.970> too<00:01:51.180> invasive<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> whole<00:01:52.680> human

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
little too invasive to the whole human

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.490 
little too invasive to the whole human
experience<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.240> guys<00:01:54.390> agree<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.020> i

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
experience do you guys agree with that i

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.289 
experience do you guys agree with that i
feel<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> phone<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.030> kind<00:01:57.240> of

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
feel like with a phone you can kind of

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.120 
feel like with a phone you can kind of
put<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.689> away<00:01:57.840> whenever<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.530> want<00:01:58.799> whenever

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
put it away whenever you want whenever

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.249 
put it away whenever you want whenever
you<00:01:59.340> want<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.909> information<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.719> can<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:01.079> it

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
you want the information you can get it

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.810 
you want the information you can get it
out<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.619> figure<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.040> out<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.790> next

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
out and figure it out so the next

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.539 
out and figure it out so the next
evolution<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.840> computing<00:02:04.710> from<00:02:05.159> what<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.399> can

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
evolution of computing from what I can

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.580 
evolution of computing from what I can
gather<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:06.840> going<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.990> be<00:02:07.140> wearable

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
gather is that it's going to be wearable

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.650 
gather is that it's going to be wearable
technology<00:02:08.489> right<00:02:08.940> now<00:02:08.970> we<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.300> our<00:02:09.330> phones

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
technology right now we have our phones

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.249 
technology right now we have our phones
and<00:02:10.020> we

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and we

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.170 
and we
in<00:02:10.470> our<00:02:10.590> pocket<00:02:11.039> we<00:02:11.159> don't<00:02:11.310> really<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.970> them

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
in our pocket we don't really have them

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.869 
in our pocket we don't really have them
on<00:02:12.420> our<00:02:12.450> bodies<00:02:13.230> per<00:02:13.590> se<00:02:13.920> being<00:02:14.519> kind<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.790> a

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
on our bodies per se being kind of a

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.789 
on our bodies per se being kind of a
techy<00:02:15.239> guy<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.659> am<00:02:15.840> I've<00:02:16.049> heard<00:02:16.260> rumors<00:02:16.530> of

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
techy guy that I am I've heard rumors of

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.039 
techy guy that I am I've heard rumors of
apple<00:02:17.189> working<00:02:17.819> on<00:02:17.939> something<00:02:18.239> some<00:02:18.720> kind<00:02:18.959> of

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
apple working on something some kind of

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.780 
apple working on something some kind of
watch<00:02:19.379> thing<00:02:19.799> it<00:02:20.010> basically<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:20.670> an

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
watch thing it basically it's an

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.130 
watch thing it basically it's an
interface<00:02:21.269> that<00:02:21.299> you<00:02:21.569> wear<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:21.840> your<00:02:21.989> wrist

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
interface that you wear on your wrist

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.170 
interface that you wear on your wrist
it's<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.709> watch<00:02:22.950> my<00:02:23.430> guess<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.090> be

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
it's a watch my guess is that it be

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.170 
it's a watch my guess is that it be
probably<00:02:24.480> similar<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.439> an<00:02:25.709> ipod<00:02:26.250> nano<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
probably similar to an ipod nano the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.789 
probably similar to an ipod nano the
old-school<00:02:27.720> kind<00:02:27.900> where<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.440> for<00:02:28.680> little

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
old-school kind where of just for little

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.530 
old-school kind where of just for little
buttons<00:02:29.159> and<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.489> has<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> little<00:02:29.970> touch<00:02:30.120> screen

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
buttons and it has a little touch screen

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.050 
buttons and it has a little touch screen
on<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.930> except<00:02:31.709> instead<00:02:31.980> if<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.640> get<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:32.849> text

on it except instead if you get a text

on it except instead if you get a text
message<00:02:33.180> on<00:02:33.599> your<00:02:33.690> phone<00:02:33.750> it'll<00:02:34.530> be<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.769> your

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
message on your phone it'll be on your

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.949 
message on your phone it'll be on your
watch<00:02:35.129> and<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.549> be<00:02:35.610> like<00:02:35.730> oh<00:02:35.879> i<00:02:36.420> see<00:02:36.930> that

watch and you can be like oh i see that

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.720 
watch and you can be like oh i see that
may<00:02:37.650> be<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.920> may<00:02:37.950> have<00:02:38.190> some<00:02:38.430> kind<00:02:38.670> of

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
may be it may have some kind of

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.280 
may be it may have some kind of
interface<00:02:39.150> where<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.450> can<00:02:39.540> communicate

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
interface where you can communicate

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.960 
interface where you can communicate
through<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.650> although<00:02:41.069> their<00:02:41.280> whole<00:02:41.489> series

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
through it although their whole series

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.759 
through it although their whole series
functionality<00:02:42.659> you<00:02:42.900> really<00:02:43.260> needs<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.620> be

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
functionality you really needs to be

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.649 
functionality you really needs to be
improved<00:02:44.129> before<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.849> goes<00:02:45.150> any<00:02:45.359> step

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
improved before that goes any step

guys would be interested in would you
guys<00:02:49.139> be<00:02:49.409> interested<00:02:49.590> in<00:02:50.040> something<00:02:50.250> more

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
guys be interested in something more

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.050 
guys be interested in something more
like<00:02:50.639> google<00:02:50.970> glass<00:02:51.269> or<00:02:51.950> Apple's<00:02:52.950> iWatch<00:02:53.340> will

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
like google glass or Apple's iWatch will

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.030 
like google glass or Apple's iWatch will
call<00:02:54.269> it<00:02:54.480> let<00:02:54.989> me<00:02:55.019> know<00:02:55.139> down<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.739> comments

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
call it let me know down in the comments

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.009 
they sky douve all wearing Google glass
and<00:03:07.799> live<00:03:08.010> streaming<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.879> to<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.599> google

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
and live streaming it to a google

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.930 
and live streaming it to a google
hangout<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.680> they<00:03:10.829> had<00:03:11.069> on<00:03:11.220> screen<00:03:11.670> she's

with her to a certain extent because of
the<00:04:47.120> Google<00:04:47.930> glass<00:04:48.200> thing<00:04:48.500> just<00:04:48.710> being<00:04:48.980> there

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
the Google glass thing just being there

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.790 
the Google glass thing just being there
the<00:04:49.760> baby<00:04:50.030> is<00:04:50.240> more<00:04:50.480> focused<00:04:50.720> here<00:04:51.350> and<00:04:51.500> not<00:04:51.650> on

the baby is more focused here and not on

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.560 
the baby is more focused here and not on
a<00:04:51.830> big<00:04:52.130> thing<00:04:52.460> right<00:04:52.670> in<00:04:52.820> front<00:04:53.030> of<00:04:53.090> their<00:04:53.240> face

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.600 
a big thing right in front of their face

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
and so you can capture some of those

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.640 
and so you can capture some of those
moments<00:04:55.910> of<00:04:56.270> like<00:04:56.480> a<00:04:56.510> smile<00:04:57.080> or<00:04:57.110> something

almost like there was this robotic
barrier<00:05:05.840> in<00:05:06.200> between<00:05:06.230> the<00:05:06.830> two<00:05:07.070> does<00:05:07.670> that

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
barrier in between the two does that

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.600 
barrier in between the two does that
make<00:05:08.030> sense<00:05:08.060> I<00:05:08.660> guess<00:05:08.990> because<00:05:09.260> it's<00:05:10.190> such<00:05:10.580> a

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
make sense I guess because it's such a

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.700 
make sense I guess because it's such a
new<00:05:10.880> technology<00:05:11.570> and<00:05:11.750> we<00:05:11.870> haven't<00:05:12.350> seen<00:05:12.530> this

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
new technology and we haven't seen this

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.310 
new technology and we haven't seen this
before<00:05:12.920> except<00:05:13.550> in<00:05:13.730> movies<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:14.480> sci-fi<00:05:14.690> films

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
before except in movies and sci-fi films

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.040 
before except in movies and sci-fi films
we<00:05:15.650> really<00:05:15.980> don't<00:05:16.160> have<00:05:16.490> this<00:05:16.820> perception<00:05:17.240> yet

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
we really don't have this perception yet

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.290 
we really don't have this perception yet
of<00:05:18.260> people<00:05:18.800> wearing<00:05:19.100> these<00:05:19.400> all<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.730> time<00:05:19.760> I'm

totally right in front of y'all time you

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.580 
totally right in front of y'all time you
can<00:05:38.090> put<00:05:38.300> it<00:05:38.419> away<00:05:38.540> and<00:05:38.840> bring<00:05:38.960> it<00:05:39.110> down<00:05:39.140> I
