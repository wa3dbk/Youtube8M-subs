00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.039 
content that you see when you first log
in<00:02:48.890> whereas<00:02:49.819> like<00:02:50.060> when<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:50.360> download<00:02:50.780> stuff

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
in whereas like when you download stuff

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.690 
in whereas like when you download stuff
there<00:02:51.319> in<00:02:51.410> these<00:02:51.560> little<00:02:51.799> square<00:02:52.160> tiles

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
there in these little square tiles

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.120 
there in these little square tiles
you'll<00:02:53.690> be<00:02:53.840> able<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.079> organize<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:54.860> much

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
you'll be able to organize that much

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.860 
you'll be able to organize that much
better<00:02:55.400> than<00:02:55.549> what<00:02:56.000> we<00:02:56.150> are<00:02:56.180> now<00:02:56.329> which<00:02:56.720> I

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
better than what we are now which I

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.390 
better than what we are now which I
don't<00:02:56.930> think<00:02:57.140> there's<00:02:57.500> any<00:02:57.799> feature<00:02:58.160> of

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
don't think there's any feature of

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.880 
don't think there's any feature of
organizing<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.209> just<00:02:59.390> think<00:02:59.569> that<00:02:59.860> when<00:03:00.860> you

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
organizing it I just think that when you

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.250 
organizing it I just think that when you
download<00:03:01.519> it<00:03:01.549> just<00:03:01.940> jumps<00:03:02.269> into<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.600> spot<00:03:02.959> there

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
download it just jumps into a spot there

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.590 
download it just jumps into a spot there
and<00:03:03.530> it's<00:03:04.130> really<00:03:04.640> messed<00:03:04.850> up<00:03:05.030> right<00:03:05.209> now<00:03:05.269> so

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
and it's really messed up right now so

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.000 
and it's really messed up right now so
they're<00:03:05.750> fixing<00:03:06.109> that<00:03:06.230> where<00:03:06.440> you'll<00:03:06.680> be<00:03:06.739> able

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
they're fixing that where you'll be able

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.280 
they're fixing that where you'll be able
to<00:03:07.190> sort<00:03:07.549> that<00:03:07.760> maybe<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.660> want<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.959> sort<00:03:09.170> it

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
to sort that maybe you want to sort it

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.949 
to sort that maybe you want to sort it
based<00:03:09.500> on<00:03:09.739> when<00:03:10.069> you<00:03:10.190> downloaded<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:11.030> or<00:03:11.269> the

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
based on when you downloaded it or the
