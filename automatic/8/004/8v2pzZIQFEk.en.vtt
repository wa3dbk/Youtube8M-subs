00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.520
 feelings the emotion of being here in 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.170
 the tunnel here had not been since 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.840
 then he had not come back and be 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.800
 exciting we give satisfaction and I 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.390
 full of pride 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.900
 of good in some way represented 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.900
 from Valencian 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.600
 the emotions the sensations the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.180
 memories are only are alive the same and 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.380
 now appear to climb the field 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.329
 the valence will always be 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.120
 these are 10 years of my life 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.860
 both personal and professional 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.620
 the team that gave me the opportunity to 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.410
 be a player to grow as a game like 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.649
 person as it arrives logically looks at a 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.260
 player when I let another go but but 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.610
 the valence has given me everything is already 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.960
 been a very important part of the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.340
 career trajectory of my career 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.020
 it has also been physical and generally the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.380
 game number 12 in many moments and that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.380
 noticeable 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.840
 I think it's important that this guy 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.010
 so that the players know where 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.500
 the 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.850
 in the state of import that has this 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.729
 shield have 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.110
 and photo hanging on the wall and that's a 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.060
 shows that really good then 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.390
 we did well and we got great 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.390
 Titles 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.030
 paco alcÃ¡cer present and future sure of 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.320
 this club that will give many successes I think 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.360
 that as central the real left 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.280
 but that for him is important too 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.990
 see with the bracelet is in that sense 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.549
 important 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.200
 and it has also given a lot of character and 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.519
 personality to the defense 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.819
 ah 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:15.270
 especially the cup of '99 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.140
 after the first title 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.450
 it's too long to move forward without winning 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.430
 and then the rest, well, with a certain 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.730
 envy in some way also 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.190
 happy that the club 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.530
 will continue to grow and win titles 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.540
 it's a difficult time to explain with 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.239
 words what represents this era 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.710
 above all we had them the way 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.000
 they take it to whoever could be beaten 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.120
 I do not follow any complex of 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.200
 inferiority 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.200
 and knowing that it could hurt him 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.140
 this super dessert of nothing on the facade 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.730
 of mestalla 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:04.930
 to be part of sharing a couple in 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.510
 this case with these legends is like 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.430
 As a player 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.500
 apart from the titles and the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.390
 the recognition parties of the 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.500
 people are what most fill you with the 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.000
 teams that need this is a 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.560
 trigger that makes them believe that 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.260
 can effectively the article for 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.790
 we was undoubtedly that cup to give a 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.099
 cup made the team breyer that the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.739
 titles were possible and from that 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.480
 I also work the club in a dynamic 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.910
 in a philosophy and an idea since the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.250
 club 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.680
 find your own identity and 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.330
 the writers came by logically 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.020
 the work of 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.020
 of all
