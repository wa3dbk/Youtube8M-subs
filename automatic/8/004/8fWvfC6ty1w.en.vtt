review today and we have the dynamic

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.580 
review today and we have the dynamic
this<00:00:11.400> judge<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.930> classic<00:00:13.290> soft

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
this judge this is the classic soft

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.350 
this judge this is the classic soft
plastic<00:00:14.070> it's<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.280> little<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.580> little<00:00:15.060> bend

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
plastic it's a little a little bend

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.570 
plastic it's a little a little bend
eager<00:00:15.540> little<00:00:15.990> flexible<00:00:16.380> and<00:00:17.010> then<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.400> is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
eager little flexible and then this is

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.650 
eager little flexible and then this is
the<00:00:17.760> firm<00:00:18.480> plastic<00:00:19.349> facing<00:00:20.310> art<00:00:20.520> I've<00:00:21.510> been

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the firm plastic facing art I've been

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.150 
the firm plastic facing art I've been
using<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.900> one<00:00:22.079> I<00:00:22.320> kind<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.680> refer<00:00:22.860> to<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
using this one I kind of refer to the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.190 
using this one I kind of refer to the
stiffer<00:00:23.820> plastic<00:00:24.270> gives<00:00:24.419> a<00:00:24.480> more<00:00:24.630> consistent

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
stiffer plastic gives a more consistent

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.400 
stiffer plastic gives a more consistent
release<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.800> feel<00:00:25.980> like<00:00:26.599> yeah<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.630> really<00:00:27.720> fits

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
release I feel like yeah I really fits

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.229 
release I feel like yeah I really fits
my<00:00:28.500> hands<00:00:28.710> really<00:00:29.070> really<00:00:29.279> well<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.610> have<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
my hands really really well I have a

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.089 
my hands really really well I have a
don't<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.869> giant<00:00:31.050> hands<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.860> I<00:00:31.890> was

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
don't have giant hands so I was

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.310 
don't have giant hands so I was
comparing<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.550> my<00:00:32.759> pro<00:00:33.360> AVR<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.899> my<00:00:34.020> eye<00:00:34.050> on

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
comparing it to my pro AVR and my eye on

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.979 
comparing it to my pro AVR and my eye on
a<00:00:34.350> stoop<00:00:34.590> OS<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.130> definitely<00:00:36.060> shorter

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
a stoop OS and it's definitely shorter

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.569 
a stoop OS and it's definitely shorter
than<00:00:37.170> both<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.380> those<00:00:37.500> get<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.039> nice<00:00:38.250> easy<00:00:38.460> grip

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
than both of those get a nice easy grip

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.240 
than both of those get a nice easy grip
a<00:00:39.090> little<00:00:39.809> beat<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.079> there<00:00:40.289> feels<00:00:40.680> really<00:00:40.890> nice

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.220 

yeah<00:00:44.280> overall<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> great<00:00:45.120> disc<00:00:45.359> let's<00:00:45.989> check

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
yeah overall a great disc let's check

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.110 
yeah overall a great disc let's check
out<00:00:46.350> some<00:00:46.379> shots<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.160> got<00:00:47.190> some<00:00:47.399> putts<00:00:47.609> and<00:00:47.940> this

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
out some shots I got some putts and this

give you a look from behind and I was

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.000 
give you a look from behind and I was
like<00:00:53.699> maybe<00:00:53.879> 20<00:00:54.149> footer<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.800> those<00:00:55.890> that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
like maybe 20 footer and for those that

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.860 
like maybe 20 footer and for those that
just<00:00:56.070> run<00:00:56.579> straight<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.999> basket<00:00:57.359> it's<00:00:57.480> super

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
just run straight the basket it's super

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.739 
just run straight the basket it's super
straight<00:00:58.170> when<00:00:58.350> you're<00:00:58.410> putting<00:00:59.749> those

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
straight when you're putting those

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:11.410 
straight when you're putting those
exactly<00:01:01.170> repointed

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.300 

it<00:01:12.420> comes<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> same<00:01:12.840> every<00:01:13.170> time<00:01:13.310> for

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
it comes with the same every time for

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.400 
it comes with the same every time for
longer<00:01:15.180> putts<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.660> this<00:01:15.870> is<00:01:16.020> probably<00:01:16.320> about

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
longer putts like this is probably about

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.020 
longer putts like this is probably about
a<00:01:16.910> 40-footer<00:01:17.910> maybe<00:01:18.480> 45<00:01:18.900> uphill<00:01:19.970> running<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
a 40-footer maybe 45 uphill running a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.520 
a 40-footer maybe 45 uphill running a
little<00:01:21.180> bit<00:01:21.300> of<00:01:21.390> an<00:01:21.450> ante<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.290> having

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
little bit of an ante on it and having

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.200 
little bit of an ante on it and having
it<00:01:22.620> fade<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.550> pen<00:01:23.760> I<00:01:25.580> just<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:27.120> got

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
it fade in right the pen I just it's got

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.520 
it fade in right the pen I just it's got
a<00:01:27.240> lot<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.420> glide<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.930> got<00:01:28.050> more<00:01:28.290> glad

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
a lot of glide it's it's got more glad

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.710 
a lot of glide it's it's got more glad
that<00:01:28.680> my<00:01:28.770> ABR<00:01:29.160> is<00:01:29.280> probably<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:30.120> maybe

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that my ABR is probably not as maybe

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.950 
that my ABR is probably not as maybe
just<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:31.020> Oh<00:01:31.350> touch<00:01:32.100> less<00:01:32.400> than<00:01:32.550> my<00:01:32.640> ions<00:01:32.960> but

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
just like Oh touch less than my ions but

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:46.300 
just like Oh touch less than my ions but
I<00:01:34.200> really<00:01:34.830> like<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.100> lot

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.460 

I<00:01:46.540> was<00:01:47.540> like<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.720> hundred<00:01:47.930> degrees<00:01:48.200> around

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
I was like a hundred degrees around

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:59.530 
I was like a hundred degrees around
recording<00:01:48.950> out<00:01:49.070> here<00:01:57.940> then<00:01:58.940> here's<00:01:59.119> a<00:01:59.210> profile

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
recording out here then here's a profile

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.960 
recording out here then here's a profile
shot<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.560> see<00:02:00.770> how<00:02:00.830> much<00:02:00.950> loft<00:02:01.400> I'm<00:02:01.580> giving<00:02:01.880> it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
shot and see how much loft I'm giving it

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.090 
shot and see how much loft I'm giving it
with<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.210> much<00:02:02.330> speed

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
with that much speed

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.960 
with that much speed
it<00:02:04.100> glides<00:02:04.250> pretty<00:02:04.550> nice<00:02:04.909> I<00:02:09.160> grab<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.190> classic

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
it glides pretty nice I grab the classic

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.130 
it glides pretty nice I grab the classic
soft<00:02:11.180> right<00:02:11.390> there<00:02:11.540> on<00:02:11.630> accident

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
soft right there on accident

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.910 
soft right there on accident
it<00:02:12.290> kind<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.500> threw<00:02:12.650> me<00:02:12.680> off<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.860> little<00:02:12.980> bit<00:02:14.920> and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
it kind of threw me off a little bit and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.460 
it kind of threw me off a little bit and
here's<00:02:16.430> my<00:02:16.520> buddy<00:02:16.610> Jesse<00:02:17.110> ripping<00:02:18.110> out<00:02:18.260> the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
here's my buddy Jesse ripping out the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.330

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
much parks it the big fly straight and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.800 
much parks it the big fly straight and
holds<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:26.900> line<00:02:27.170> beautifully<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:29.540> hole<00:02:29.720> is

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
holds that line beautifully this hole is
