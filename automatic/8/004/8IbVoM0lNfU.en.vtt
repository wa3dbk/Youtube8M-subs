00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.719
 well let's see how to make 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.400
 change the combination of the lock 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.400
 of gol power 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.980
 this suffered a shock was broken and what 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.679
 we want to do is change the drum 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.070
 this one to a new lock that we have 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.070
 bought 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.160
 ah 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.500
 Here you can see the new lock 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.220
 comes with a totally different key 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.490
 to the original of the car 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.480
 this would be the original and this would be the 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.480
 what have we got 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.780
 as you will see the handle is exactly 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.000
 equal to the one that goes to the car but if 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.390
 we want to change the combination of 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.390
 drum 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.880
 well let's see how we disarm them 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.049
 A) Yes 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.049
 see how it is done 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:26.280
 you will not disarm the photo drum 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.640
 for this we are going to introduce first the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.640
 key 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.990
 we introduce the original key of love 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.840
 broken and this has already been 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:43.170
 almost almost completely disarmed 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.170
 we remove this part is all crooked 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.040
 and we push it back and they come out 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.980
 why 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.210
 because we put the key first 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.930
 we do not do this, we disarm it and 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.930
 to the whole drum 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.790
 to remove the key back 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.670
 you can see that they are released 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.440
 combination platelets of the key 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.120
 if you just jump these little ones 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.280
 disarm the entire combination of 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.290
 key 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.940
 and it would skip a corresponding one of its 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.550
 army that carries inside also 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.710
 that's why we do it first we introduce 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.020
 the key and then we remove are for 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.810
 that everything is in order and not only 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.670
 disarm 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.740
 the little drum with the combination of 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.590
 key 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.790
 well we have the drum removed 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.790
 from the old part 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.920
 let's take apart the new locks 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.180
 what we have bought 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.180
 here is everything complete 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:03:00.239
 and we are going to remove the drum from here 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.239
 good what first is to release the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:09.010
 the bolt there are people who have to yes 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.010
 we push this spring back 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.140
 the turn a bit 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.140
 yes 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.310
 It costs a little bit to get it out but with 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.560
 patience we remove the bread 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.560
 then we take out this other part if it's 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.360
 let's put the key here too for 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.360
 Do not disarm him 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:40.280
 and push back a big party 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.280
 released the other 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.769
 now let's do is change the putting 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.769
 the original drum inside him 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.830
 of the new lady 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.830
 the next one is the same as the other 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.900
 leads to an addict 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.900
 a rubber earring inside 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.650
 has been placed by the color gives me to 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.459
 that does not penetrate into moisture what 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.459
 we introduce 6 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.430
 let's put the little part 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.430
 until we get new 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.330
 we introduce here 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.750
 there is 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.080
 we can only put the shaft again 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.080
 return 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:45.009
 this would be the balance to the work 

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:45.009
 inside the door 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.330
 we hooked it just like the other one 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.770
 a little too to withdraw that 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.729
 luck 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.729
 and they will reintroduce 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.920
 there is 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:03.240
 how do we give that luck and ready 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.240
 changed to unity 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:12.830
 easy we have our drum with 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.830
 our original car key 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.219
 ah 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.550
 and we already see what organic functions 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.550
 perfectly 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:34.009
 and our keys also work 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:35.750
 perfectly as it should be 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.810
 ah 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.700
 it's like that 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.449
 this friends to see that it's easy 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.060
 of is 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.340
 we replaced the old drum 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.960
 the new unit 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.960
