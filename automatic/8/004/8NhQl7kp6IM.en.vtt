00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
instead of going in side to side and I

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.609 
instead of going in side to side and I
think<00:01:26.580> that's<00:01:26.790> what's<00:01:27.000> gonna<00:01:27.409> facially<00:01:28.409> get

them<00:01:28.740> i<00:01:28.799> think<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.220> maybe<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.700> first<00:01:29.729> 4<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> 6

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
them i think for maybe the first 4 to 6

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.350 
them i think for maybe the first 4 to 6
may<00:01:31.829> four<00:01:31.860> six<00:01:32.579> rounds<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.329> a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
may four six rounds it's going to be a

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.170 
may four six rounds it's going to be a
good<00:01:33.570> fight<00:01:33.950> Carl<00:01:34.950> Froch<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.549> last<00:01:35.759> two<00:01:35.939> times

can<00:01:50.189> see<00:01:50.460> by<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.670> six-round<00:01:51.240> he<00:01:52.140> really

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
can see by the six-round he really

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.960 
can see by the six-round he really
started<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.860> catch<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.369> Taylor<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
started to catch up to Taylor and

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.730 
started to catch up to Taylor and
actually<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.930> look<00:01:54.960> at<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.290> fight<00:01:55.530> before

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
actually if you look at the fight before

actually if you look at the fight before
it<00:01:56.130> Froch<00:01:56.909> didn't<00:01:57.240> really<00:01:57.420> get<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.570> chance<00:01:57.600> to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it Froch didn't really get a chance to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.630 
it Froch didn't really get a chance to
give<00:01:58.140> sweat<00:01:58.469> going<00:01:58.710> because<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.280> was<00:01:59.369> quick

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
give sweat going because it was quick

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.640 
give sweat going because it was quick

and<00:02:00.800> he<00:02:00.920> looked<00:02:01.160> like<00:02:01.280> crap<00:02:01.550> for<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.850> force

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090

and he looked like crap for the force

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
first three or four rounds but once he

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.280 
first three or four rounds but once he
got<00:02:04.190> his<00:02:04.340> group<00:02:04.640> going<00:02:04.910> once<00:02:05.600> he<00:02:05.690> got<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.870> sweat

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
got his group going once he got a sweat

going<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:07.070> i'm<00:02:07.160> not<00:02:07.250> talking<00:02:07.370> about<00:02:07.640> late

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090

rounds<00:02:08.509> against<00:02:08.720> Taylor<00:02:09.050> I'm<00:02:09.170> talking<00:02:09.410> about

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
rounds against Taylor I'm talking about

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.850

62<00:02:10.220> maybe<00:02:10.460> 10<00:02:11.050> somewhere<00:02:12.050> in<00:02:12.170> there<00:02:12.380> he<00:02:12.410> really

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
62 maybe 10 somewhere in there he really

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.260 
62 maybe 10 somewhere in there he really
started<00:02:13.160> getting<00:02:13.280> his<00:02:13.490> groove<00:02:13.670> yola<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.240> I

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
started getting his groove yola so I

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.670 
started getting his groove yola so I
think<00:02:14.420> he's<00:02:14.690> going<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.870> take<00:02:15.050> his<00:02:15.110> punches

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
think he's going to take his punches

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.670 
think he's going to take his punches
Carl<00:02:16.220> Froch<00:02:16.460> is<00:02:16.670> always<00:02:17.150> in<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.420> great<00:02:17.660> fight<00:02:18.050> so

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
Carl Froch is always in a great fight so

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.200 
Carl Froch is always in a great fight so
it's<00:02:18.980> not<00:02:19.250> like<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.790> know<00:02:19.910> he's<00:02:20.060> going<00:02:20.150> to

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
it's not like you know he's going to

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.540 
it's not like you know he's going to
walk<00:02:20.390> over<00:02:20.450> him<00:02:20.900> but<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.650> really<00:02:22.190> think<00:02:22.220> that

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
walk over him but I really think that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.120 
walk over him but I really think that
Froch<00:02:22.880> is<00:02:23.090> experienced<00:02:23.720> his<00:02:24.380> toughness<00:02:24.740> in

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
Froch is experienced his toughness in

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.240 
Froch is experienced his toughness in
his<00:02:25.370> power<00:02:25.670> is<00:02:26.060> going<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.080> do<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.890> realize

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
his power is going to do it to realize

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.930 
his power is going to do it to realize
it<00:02:28.430> faced<00:02:28.790> anybody<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.990> his<00:02:30.140> caliber<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:31.760> is

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
it faced anybody of his caliber this is

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.730 
it faced anybody of his caliber this is
this<00:02:32.090> big<00:02:32.270> shot<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:32.870> it's<00:02:33.050> not<00:02:33.170> like<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.470> can't

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
this big shot so it's not like it can't

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.460 
this big shot so it's not like it can't
happen<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.580> this<00:02:34.700> fight<00:02:35.030> will<00:02:35.270> be<00:02:35.510> nottingham

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470

happen but this fight will be nottingham
england<00:02:36.830> so<00:02:37.760> i<00:02:37.790> think<00:02:37.880> its<00:02:38.150> home<00:02:38.390> crowd<00:02:38.780> it's

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
england so i think its home crowd it's

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.410 
england so i think its home crowd it's
the<00:02:39.890> first<00:02:40.070> round<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.520> tournament<00:02:41.030> really

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
the first round the tournament really

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.460 
the first round the tournament really
I'm<00:02:42.200> thinking<00:02:42.530> Froch<00:02:42.890> will<00:02:44.170> will<00:02:45.170> beat<00:02:45.350> him

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
I'm thinking Froch will will beat him

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.990 
I'm thinking Froch will will beat him
and<00:02:45.680> I'm<00:02:46.190> not<00:02:46.340> going<00:02:46.490> to<00:02:46.550> say<00:02:46.670> he's<00:02:46.820> going<00:02:46.910> to

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
and I'm not going to say he's going to

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.490 
and I'm not going to say he's going to
knock<00:02:47.180> about<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.690> fact<00:02:47.930> i<00:02:48.050> don't<00:02:48.110> know<00:02:48.290> how

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
many knockouts it'll be maybe a clean

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
possibly a cut that stops the fight mid

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.270 
possibly a cut that stops the fight mid
to<00:02:59.660> late<00:02:59.870> rounds<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:00.440> don't<00:03:00.620> see<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:00.860> son<00:03:01.190> of

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
to late rounds I don't see it son of

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.920 
to late rounds I don't see it son of
knockouts<00:03:01.700> in<00:03:01.910> this<00:03:02.270> tournament<00:03:02.570> because

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
knockouts in this tournament because

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.440 
knockouts in this tournament because
they're<00:03:03.230> all<00:03:03.410> pretty<00:03:04.040> evenly<00:03:04.490> matched<00:03:04.610> but<00:03:05.420> I

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
they're all pretty evenly matched but I

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.240 
they're all pretty evenly matched but I
think<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:05.750> will<00:03:05.840> be<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:05.989> great<00:03:06.260> fight<00:03:06.709> we<00:03:06.950> sprout

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250

think it will be a great fight we sprout
