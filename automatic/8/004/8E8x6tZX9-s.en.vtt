00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
insurance that I'm applying all over the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.769 
insurance that I'm applying all over the
lid<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.220> then<00:00:26.820> I'm<00:00:26.910> gonna<00:00:27.000> top<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.300> off<00:00:27.480> with

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
my NYX jumbo eye shadow pencil in milk I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.209 
my NYX jumbo eye shadow pencil in milk I
really<00:00:30.929> think<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.529> important<00:00:32.040> for

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
really think that this is important for

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.190 
really think that this is important for
this<00:00:32.309> particular<00:00:32.460> palette<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.690> colors<00:00:33.989> can

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
this particular palette the colors can

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.959 
this particular palette the colors can
look<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.500> little<00:00:34.680> bit<00:00:34.920> chalky<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.550> if<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.760> use

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
look a little bit chalky but if you use

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.209 
look a little bit chalky but if you use
a<00:00:36.000> white<00:00:36.390> base<00:00:36.420> that's<00:00:36.960> really<00:00:37.260> creamy<00:00:37.620> they

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
a white base that's really creamy they

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.220 
a white base that's really creamy they
apply<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.450> nice<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.870> they<00:00:39.989> blend

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
apply so so nice and they blend

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.080 
apply so so nice and they blend
amazingly<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.399> that's<00:00:41.579> something<00:00:41.879> really

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
amazingly so that's something really

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.940 
amazingly so that's something really
important<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.719> keep<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:42.989> mind<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.710> first

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
important to keep in mind the first

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.190 
important to keep in mind the first

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.579 
to the middle and outer part of the lid
and<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.359> could<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.660> I'm<00:01:03.780> using<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.260> stiff

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
and you could see I'm using a stiff

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.200 
and you could see I'm using a stiff
brush<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.369> kind<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.580> pressing<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
brush and I'm just kind of pressing the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
brush and I'm just kind of pressing the
shadow<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.900> make<00:01:07.049> sure<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.619> vibrant

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
shadow on to make sure it's as vibrant

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.760 
shadow on to make sure it's as vibrant
as<00:01:08.189> possible<00:01:08.760> I'm<00:01:09.090> also<00:01:09.720> placing<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.500> color

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
as possible I'm also placing this color

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.370 
as possible I'm also placing this color
a<00:01:10.890> little<00:01:11.280> bit<00:01:11.670> into<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.570> crease<00:01:12.600> here

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
a little bit into the crease here

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.140 
a little bit into the crease here
because<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.340> blend<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.790> next

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
because I'm going to blend to the next

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.050 
because I'm going to blend to the next
color<00:01:15.420> which<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> red<00:01:16.500> berry<00:01:16.740> rose<00:01:17.070> into<00:01:17.520> it

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
color which is a red berry rose into it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.640 
color which is a red berry rose into it
so<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.270> using<00:01:18.420> kind<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.810> fluffy<00:01:18.990> brush<00:01:19.259> here

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
so I'm using kind of a fluffy brush here

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.170 
so I'm using kind of a fluffy brush here
and<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.640> kind<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.000> makes

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
and you can see it just kind of makes

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.210 
and you can see it just kind of makes
like<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.450> really<00:01:21.840> vibrant<00:01:22.170> purpley<00:01:22.979> pink

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
like this really vibrant purpley pink

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.520 
like this really vibrant purpley pink
color<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.210> kind<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.570> acts<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.320> my

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
color and that kind of acts as my

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.399 
color and that kind of acts as my
gradient<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.880> blue<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.900> pink<00:01:28.110> so

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
gradient for the blue and the pink so

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.050 
gradient for the blue and the pink so
I'm<00:01:28.500> also<00:01:28.650> placing<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> pink<00:01:29.369> above<00:01:29.820> where

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
I'm also placing the pink above where

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.730 
I'm also placing the pink above where
the<00:01:30.180> blue<00:01:30.329> was<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.290> see<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> kind<00:01:31.710> of

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the blue was so you can see it kind of

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.870 
the blue was so you can see it kind of
just<00:01:31.890> makes<00:01:32.070> everything<00:01:32.340> blend<00:01:32.700> nicely

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
just makes everything blend nicely

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.469 
just makes everything blend nicely
together

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
together

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.660 
together
