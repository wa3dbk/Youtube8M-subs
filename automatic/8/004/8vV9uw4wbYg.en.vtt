00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 Um, it 's personal, it's okay, we're here to 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.849
 one more online ranchinho your channel of 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.650
 direct video with jvc 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.150
 today we have again several 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.519
 matters to tell you what it is 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.049
 JVC and such happening here 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.600
 I really want to start with two 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.609
 more complicated issues that are of 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.570
 china and super 11 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.400
 we could not launch this month the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.990
 two have different reasons for the delay 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.699
 A girl, you 're realizing too. 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.050
 that he is practically leaving 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.120
 bimonthly 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.130
 What happens is that a girl like 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.020
 I explained in my talk at the fest 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.480
 comix is a more difficult manga than 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.070
 People gotta do us sometimes. 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.600
 it takes twice as much or more than 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.969
 time to make than other sleeves 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.620
 normal because a girl is he has 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.930
 a lot of text we're having 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.879
 practically reproduce everything thiago 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.949
 You see the work, we have a lot of work. 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.289
 work of art retouching but having 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.760
 to respond to all images then 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.890
 a villa in our life we have already changed the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.120
 style of production more than once and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.949
 yet we are not getting 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.690
 decrease time 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.820
 So you're seeing that you're leaving. 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.400
 half every two months 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.780
 we will try to reduce to 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.159
 that he leaves monthly from the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.500
 next editions 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.110
 but unfortunately once again it has been 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.759
 a delay is the number 9 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.369
 're already going to the graphic then it should 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.409
 leave until the first half of June 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.570
 but then there was a delay is because 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.979
 production is very 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.530
 complicated for us is what gives more 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.450
 We work hard to stay the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.790
 nice edition that you end up seeing already 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.740
 exceeded 11 in fact the problem was 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.229
 sending stuff is not sure if you guys 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.900
 know it is at the end of April or beginning of 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.369
 May have golden week in Japan one week 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.020
 of holidays 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.540
 and then all the talk you had with Japanese 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.460
 before and after that delayed a lot of 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.020
 things they take so long to answer 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.500
 So we just got the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.000
 material from the super 1116 forward and 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.600
 that we failed the 16 of this 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.759
 month 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.810
 so stayed for the next month we overcame 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.729
 16km rina ended up slipping from May 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.409
 getting to June as we have 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.969

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.420

 vlt and what are we going to be able to 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.730
 cast 42 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.739
 we are running to be able to launch 43 already 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.829
 Left out of Japan recently 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.470
 even and we'll try to run to launch 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.810
 the 43 in the monthly periodicity 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.169
 it is from there to wait for it to leave in the 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.169
 japan exactly and blue exorcist too 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:48.479
 12 was the last one that left I'm here in the 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.409
 Brazil and in Japan, and if it will take a 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:53.519
 little more 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.829
 both freeze and the fale tale they have 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.239
 a bimonthly periodicity in Japan 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:01.139
 so they are much faster 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.269
 either the exorcist is stopped or 12 is 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.760
 half-yearly well remembered and although you 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.729
 have repeated what I told her to 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.560
 house if she does it every six months then 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:13.440
 glove the blue 3 and it will take a while 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.720
 more because the next one is planned to 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.799
 July then there will be mandates that will 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.650
 give a stop 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.180
 but I still trust others 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.910
 mandates 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.620
