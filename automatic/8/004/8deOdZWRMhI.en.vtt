00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
trying to complain but there were a

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.030 
trying to complain but there were a
couple<00:01:05.299> things<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:05.810> looking<00:01:06.229> back<00:01:06.409> we<00:01:06.860> would

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
couple things that looking back we would

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.960 
couple things that looking back we would
have<00:01:07.159> done<00:01:07.340> differently

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
have done differently

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.210 
have done differently
first<00:01:08.270> we<00:01:08.720> strip<00:01:09.110> tilled<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.500> field<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:10.040> was<00:01:10.160> a

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
first we strip tilled a field that was a

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.520 
first we strip tilled a field that was a
real<00:01:10.640> battle<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.300> tops<00:01:11.630> of<00:01:11.870> the<00:01:11.930> corn<00:01:12.170> plants

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
real battle the tops of the corn plants

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.680 
real battle the tops of the corn plants
above<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.950> ear<00:01:13.130> all<00:01:13.400> fell<00:01:13.880> off<00:01:14.120> prior<00:01:14.510> to

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
above the ear all fell off prior to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.420 
above the ear all fell off prior to
harvest<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:15.500> part<00:01:15.800> of<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:15.950> corn<00:01:16.190> plant

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
harvest so that part of the corn plant

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.130 
harvest so that part of the corn plant
never<00:01:16.730> ran<00:01:17.060> through<00:01:17.360> our<00:01:17.540> chopping<00:01:17.810> corn

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
never ran through our chopping corn

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.690 
never ran through our chopping corn
heads<00:01:18.350> when<00:01:18.710> we<00:01:18.740> stripped<00:01:19.130> tilled<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.430> field

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
heads when we stripped tilled the field

heads when we stripped tilled the field
the<00:01:20.030> stalks<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.659> ground<00:01:20.930> were<00:01:21.140> wet<00:01:21.440> and

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
the stalks and the ground were wet and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.830 
the stalks and the ground were wet and
tough<00:01:22.010> to<00:01:22.159> cut<00:01:22.370> through<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:22.940> after<00:01:23.450> stripping

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
tough to cut through so after stripping

tough to cut through so after stripping
the<00:01:24.020> fields<00:01:24.409> we<00:01:24.530> ran<00:01:24.830> through<00:01:25.040> with<00:01:25.250> the

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
the fields we ran through with the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.790 
the fields we ran through with the

of the stalks in hindsight we obviously

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.060 
of the stalks in hindsight we obviously
should<00:01:32.810> have<00:01:32.900> done<00:01:33.110> that<00:01:33.260> first<00:01:33.530> before<00:01:33.830> we

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
should have done that first before we

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.530 
should have done that first before we
stripped<00:01:34.460> hill<00:01:34.610> because<00:01:34.909> we<00:01:35.030> kind<00:01:35.210> of<00:01:35.270> messed

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
stripped hill because we kind of messed

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.120 
stripped hill because we kind of messed
up<00:01:35.780> our<00:01:35.990> strips<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.470> little<00:01:36.680> bit<00:01:36.830> and<00:01:37.070> just

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
up our strips a little bit and just

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.800 
up our strips a little bit and just
driving<00:01:37.700> back<00:01:37.940> through<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:38.330> field<00:01:38.570> it

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
driving back through that field it

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.660 
driving back through that field it
wasn't<00:01:39.200> ideal<00:01:39.680> lesson<00:01:40.280> learned

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
wasn't ideal lesson learned

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.270 
wasn't ideal lesson learned
our<00:01:40.790> second<00:01:41.540> I'll<00:01:41.750> call<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.350> mistake<00:01:42.710> was<00:01:43.040> one

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
our second I'll call it mistake was one

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.430 
our second I'll call it mistake was one
of<00:01:43.400> rushing<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:44.210> was<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.479> last<00:01:44.750> decent<00:01:45.110> day

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
of rushing it was the last decent day

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.200 
of rushing it was the last decent day
and<00:01:45.650> snow<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.159> cold<00:01:46.400> was<00:01:46.610> in<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.790> forecast

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
and snow and cold was in the forecast

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.090 
and snow and cold was in the forecast
for<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.479> very<00:01:47.690> next<00:01:47.870> day<00:01:48.049> so<00:01:48.470> we<00:01:48.620> hurried<00:01:48.979> to

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
for the very next day so we hurried to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.190 
for the very next day so we hurried to
strip<00:01:49.370> til<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.790> last<00:01:50.000> field<00:01:50.420> we<00:01:50.659> had<00:01:50.870> however

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
strip til the last field we had however

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.500 
strip til the last field we had however
we<00:01:51.680> needed<00:01:51.979> a<00:01:52.040> broadcast<00:01:52.640> spread<00:01:53.000> some<00:01:53.270> dry

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
we needed a broadcast spread some dry

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.690 
we needed a broadcast spread some dry
zinc<00:01:53.840> sulfate<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.590> deal<00:01:54.799> with<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.130> severe

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
zinc sulfate to deal with the severe

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.430 
zinc sulfate to deal with the severe
deficiency<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:56.570> showed<00:01:56.780> up<00:01:56.960> in<00:01:57.049> our<00:01:57.170> grid

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
deficiency that showed up in our grid

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.990 
deficiency that showed up in our grid
soil<00:01:57.710> samples<00:01:58.220> that<00:01:58.310> we<00:01:58.430> pulled<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:58.760> fall

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
soil samples that we pulled this fall

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.640 
soil samples that we pulled this fall
since<00:01:59.450> we've<00:01:59.600> already<00:01:59.780> stripped<00:02:00.200> tilled<00:02:00.440> that

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
since we've already stripped tilled that

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.350 
since we've already stripped tilled that
field<00:02:00.950> we<00:02:01.280> didn't<00:02:01.520> want<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.729> run<00:02:02.000> out<00:02:02.150> there

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
field we didn't want to run out there

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.270 
field we didn't want to run out there
and<00:02:02.570> risk<00:02:02.750> packing<00:02:03.320> down<00:02:03.440> an<00:02:03.650> ice<00:02:03.799> seed<00:02:04.070> bed

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
and risk packing down an ice seed bed

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.039 
and risk packing down an ice seed bed
that<00:02:04.460> we<00:02:04.549> had<00:02:04.640> just<00:02:04.790> built<00:02:05.030> our<00:02:05.299> solution

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
that we had just built our solution

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.169 
that we had just built our solution
which<00:02:06.440> hasn't<00:02:06.680> been<00:02:06.860> done<00:02:07.190> yet<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.970> wait

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
which hasn't been done yet is to wait

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.509 
which hasn't been done yet is to wait
until<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.569> ground<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:08.959> frozen<00:02:09.080> hard<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.039> run

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
until the ground is frozen hard and run

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.039 
until the ground is frozen hard and run
back<00:02:10.700> out<00:02:11.000> there<00:02:11.209> we're<00:02:11.420> gonna<00:02:11.510> try<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.840> do

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
back out there we're gonna try to do

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.449 
back out there we're gonna try to do
this<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:12.379> the<00:02:12.469> spring<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.010> ground<00:02:13.310> is

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
this in the spring so the ground is

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.250 
this in the spring so the ground is
frozen<00:02:13.609> in<00:02:13.909> the<00:02:13.999> morning<00:02:14.359> but<00:02:14.599> thawing<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:15.139> the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
frozen in the morning but thawing in the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.590 
frozen in the morning but thawing in the
afternoon<00:02:15.739> if<00:02:15.950> we<00:02:16.159> do<00:02:16.279> it<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.639> way<00:02:16.849> we<00:02:17.060> can<00:02:17.420> go

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
afternoon if we do it that way we can go

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.510 
afternoon if we do it that way we can go
back<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.930> dry<00:02:18.230> spread<00:02:18.680> across<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.130> field

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
back and dry spread across the field

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.490 
back and dry spread across the field
without<00:02:19.820> messing<00:02:20.300> up<00:02:20.540> our<00:02:20.750> strips<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
without messing up our strips the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.750 
without messing up our strips the
important<00:02:21.860> thing<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.130> not<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:22.340> we<00:02:22.610> did

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
important thing is not that we did

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.130 
important thing is not that we did
everything<00:02:23.000> right<00:02:23.360> in<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.540> first<00:02:23.750> place<00:02:23.960> this

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
mistakes so you make better decisions

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.440
