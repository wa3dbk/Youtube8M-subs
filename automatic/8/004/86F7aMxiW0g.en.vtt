00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
be all about my piercings I was

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.910 
be all about my piercings I was
considering<00:00:14.940> doing<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.719> video<00:00:16.139> about<00:00:16.289> all<00:00:16.710> of

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
considering doing a video about all of

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.370 
considering doing a video about all of
them<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.310> one<00:00:17.490> by<00:00:17.760> thought<00:00:18.090> that'd<00:00:18.270> be<00:00:18.380> pretty

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
them and one by thought that'd be pretty

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.759 
them and one by thought that'd be pretty
long-winded<00:00:19.859> seeing<00:00:20.699> as<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:20.970> seven<00:00:21.510> now

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
long-winded seeing as I have seven now

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.740 
long-winded seeing as I have seven now
so<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.189> thought<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.850> would<00:00:24.000> do<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.420> short

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
so I thought I would do it in short

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.290 
so I thought I would do it in short
installments<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.279> video<00:00:26.580> about<00:00:26.910> each

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
installments and do a video about each

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.050 
installments and do a video about each
piercing<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.960> I've<00:00:28.050> had<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:29.519> them<00:00:29.760> more

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the best of ideas because obviously when

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.889 
the best of ideas because obviously when
you<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.559> your<00:00:49.800> Medusa<00:00:50.309> pierced<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you have your Medusa pierced you have to

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.779 
you have your Medusa pierced you have to
have<00:00:51.989> much<00:00:52.260> longer<00:00:52.559> bar<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.250> account<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
have much longer bar to account for the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.930 
have much longer bar to account for the
swelling<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:55.649> walking<00:00:56.250> around<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
swelling so I was walking around the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.270 
swelling so I was walking around the
salon<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> massive<00:00:57.809> would<00:00:58.590> usurp<00:00:58.980> bar

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
salon with a massive would usurp bar

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.630 
salon with a massive would usurp bar
hanging<00:00:59.699> out<00:00:59.910> with<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.469> not<00:01:01.469> good<00:01:01.710> look<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.430> I

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
hanging out with a not good look so I

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.160 
hanging out with a not good look so I
wouldn't<00:01:02.879> recommend<00:01:03.030> getting<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.989> your

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170

wouldn't recommend getting it on your
work<00:01:04.379> break<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:05.040> wouldn't<00:01:05.489> say<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.700> Medusa

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
