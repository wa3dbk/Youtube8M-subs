00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.690
 last successful my tips well here we should talk so much there 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.539
 they are many ideas also depends a little on the 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:13.269
 public some who address what kind of company you are if you are a 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:14.349
 1 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.599
 maybe you are a group 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.189
 if you do it for strictly commercial purposes then they have 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.669
 in short, what advice can you give all these various interests together? 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.589
 first thing is to try to avoid at all costs 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.390
 to redo the pieve TV out there in all respects 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.269
 doing low cost with the camera 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.719
 using the first man louis ahahah 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.499
 having the portable battery there is track and bayonets king 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:48.339
 the fact that you can reproduce exactly what they did 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.170
 the RAI Canale 5 Rete 4 with their means to do it with the hole nothing cost 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.559
 this this let's say this now 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.520
 this country has already been given rambo has gone go to hell forgiveness is 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.960
 put us some new ideas what they don't do on traditional TV don't 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.520
 often hear 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.380
 hungary any and often people like i'm ah maybe in di formed 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.790
 ways that you can't get excited about when the ordinary people 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.260
 are they themselves talking they tell their stories they get angry they fight 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.350
 then I express joy are interesting if they are people who are involved 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.250
 perhaps of the theme reeder of the interest of the in the square tv 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.299
 it started out even better so you got to talk 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.220
 so much more people 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.260
 and to work on 9 TV formats involving as much as possible 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.299
 obviously the word hp 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.240
 order today to involve the public and therefore 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.979
 for making send of 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.600
 and videos of the xd clip of the compilescion already made by doing 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.530
 to intervene 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.510
 I undress people to ... outside in the day by going your father I would give you a 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.049
 day night of the new 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.229
 and we even broadcast 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.269
 his workplace ooooh from his office from his shop whatever it is 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:09.919
 these 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.979
 may be at some points and therefore 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.509
 don't imitate classic tv 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.380
 and think above all of innovative ideas 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.239
 where people can talk 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.520
 and contribute 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.150
 how you live it
