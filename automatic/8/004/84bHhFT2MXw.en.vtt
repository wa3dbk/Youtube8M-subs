00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.550
 Hi, people today to show you with 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.320
 hot head steak from lazy on 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.049
 reality is a pudding recipe of 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.420
 cheese but they could of cheese in the end not 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.880
 I want to eat but the taste and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.340
 texture are exactly the same 1 x kei 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.590
 come on four ingredients that people 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.840
 will give condensed milk 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.789
 same tip of whole milk or 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.460
 if the condensed milk was put in flame 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.390
 Curl the whole milk three 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.360
 games 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.610
 and here is that standard minas cheese in the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.340
 blender or mix all 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.840
 ingredients are commented milk is 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.079
 Nice to start with the ingredients 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.500
 liquids under the blender 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.420
 because it helps to beat milk without 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.039
 that you're going to use an egg never breaks in 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.860
 direct in their revenues 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.750
 if you get bad luck like I once had you 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.879
 will break the rotten egg to recognize 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.399
 who will lose entire revenue then 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.659
 break it out do not cross and go 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.549

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.560
 mine mines I cut cast bill 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.020

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.020
