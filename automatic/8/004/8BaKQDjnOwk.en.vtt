to me

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.249 
to me
proportions<00:00:27.270> should<00:00:27.450> be<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> first

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
proportions should be one of the first

things you learn proportions is about

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.320 
things you learn proportions is about
the<00:00:31.289> measurements<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> body<00:00:32.400> the<00:00:33.030> length

since the time of the cave painters
proportions<00:00:53.549> have<00:00:53.760> been<00:00:53.909> a<00:00:53.940> concern<00:00:54.440> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
proportions have been a concern the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.439 
proportions have been a concern the
first<00:00:55.799> thing<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.250> developing<00:00:56.790> a<00:00:56.909> system<00:00:57.119> of

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
first thing in developing a system of

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.810 
first thing in developing a system of
measurements<00:00:58.019> was<00:00:58.229> to<00:00:58.379> establish<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:59.129> unit<00:00:59.699> of

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
measurements was to establish a unit of

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.570 
measurements was to establish a unit of
measure<00:01:00.350> similar<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> units<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.010> measure<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.549> a

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
measure similar to units of measure on a

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.539 
measure similar to units of measure on a
ruler<00:01:03.229> the<00:01:04.229> Egyptians<00:01:04.799> use<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.309> middle

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
ruler the Egyptians use the middle

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.030 
ruler the Egyptians use the middle
finger<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> unit<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.720> measure<00:01:07.040> they

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
finger as a unit of measure they

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.160 
finger as a unit of measure they
determined<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> average<00:01:09.210> Egyptian<00:01:09.960> was

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
determined that the average Egyptian was

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.690 
determined that the average Egyptian was
about<00:01:10.560> 19<00:01:11.280> fingers<00:01:11.760> tall<00:01:13.070> later<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.430> Greeks

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
about 19 fingers tall later the Greeks

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.030 
about 19 fingers tall later the Greeks
used<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.180> head<00:01:15.479> as<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> unit<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.229> measure<00:01:16.290> which

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
used the head as a unit of measure which

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.240 
used the head as a unit of measure which
is<00:01:17.100> still<00:01:17.640> common<00:01:18.090> today<00:01:18.530> for<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.649> Greeks<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
is still common today for the Greeks the

is still common today for the Greeks the
perfect<00:01:20.820> form<00:01:21.090> was<00:01:21.359> nine<00:01:21.659> heads<00:01:22.020> tall<00:01:22.490> the

Greeks<00:01:23.820> were<00:01:24.030> very<00:01:24.329> concerned<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:25.079> ideals

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590

Greeks were very concerned with ideals
of<00:01:25.740> beauty<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.310> developed<00:01:27.179> rules<00:01:27.539> of

of beauty and developed rules of

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.429 
of beauty and developed rules of
measurement<00:01:28.380> called<00:01:28.829> canons<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.729> proportion

are no hard and fast rules when it comes

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.650 
are no hard and fast rules when it comes
to<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> measurements<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.800> human<00:02:11.100> body

to the measurements of the human body
ultimately<00:02:12.660> we<00:02:12.990> all<00:02:13.020> develop<00:02:13.470> our<00:02:13.890> own<00:02:14.010> sense

these are just averages and every figure

these are just averages and every figure

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
will vary here and there but knowing

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.589 
will vary here and there but knowing
proportions<00:05:24.159> you<00:05:24.370> at<00:05:24.520> least<00:05:24.819> have<00:05:25.030> a<00:05:25.060> sense<00:05:25.150> of

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
proportions you at least have a sense of

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.600 
proportions you at least have a sense of
how<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.810> body<00:05:26.139> is<00:05:26.319> supposed<00:05:26.620> to<00:05:26.770> look<00:05:27.069> and<00:05:27.340> fit

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
how the body is supposed to look and fit

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.629 
how the body is supposed to look and fit
together<00:05:28.000> the<00:05:28.409> truth<00:05:29.409> is<00:05:29.680> that<00:05:29.710> every<00:05:30.310> artist

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
together the truth is that every artist

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.420 
together the truth is that every artist
has<00:05:30.729> their<00:05:31.060> own<00:05:31.180> sense<00:05:31.810> of<00:05:31.930> proportion<00:05:32.530> your

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
has their own sense of proportion your

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.219 
has their own sense of proportion your
sense<00:05:33.699> of<00:05:33.819> proportion<00:05:33.940> may<00:05:34.599> not<00:05:34.810> vary<00:05:35.110> much

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
sense of proportion may not vary much

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.559 
sense of proportion may not vary much
from<00:05:35.650> what<00:05:35.830> I've<00:05:35.979> presented<00:05:36.219> here<00:05:36.610> but<00:05:37.419> it's

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:37.569 
from what I've presented here but it's

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.709 
from what I've presented here but it's
still<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.930> very<00:05:38.199> personal<00:05:38.949> ideal<00:05:39.460> and<00:05:39.789> one<00:05:40.539> that

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:40.719 
still a very personal ideal and one that

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.600 
still a very personal ideal and one that
will<00:05:40.900> reveal<00:05:41.259> itself<00:05:41.620> in<00:05:41.860> your<00:05:42.039> own<00:05:42.219> drawing

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
will reveal itself in your own drawing

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.360 
will reveal itself in your own drawing
