00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.540 

so<00:03:14.660> now<00:03:14.840> I<00:03:14.870> want<00:03:15.379> to<00:03:15.440> talk<00:03:15.590> about<00:03:15.620> what<00:03:16.040> exactly

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
that how he is so shocked is the chicken

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.070 
that how he is so shocked is the chicken
and<00:03:19.849> Cosby<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:21.459> marinated<00:03:22.459> ribs<00:03:22.780> now<00:03:23.780> normally

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
and Cosby is marinated ribs now normally

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.110 
and Cosby is marinated ribs now normally
there's<00:03:24.349> fish<00:03:24.680> called<00:03:24.920> galbi<00:03:25.459> which<00:03:25.819> is<00:03:25.970> like

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
there's fish called galbi which is like

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.839 
there's fish called galbi which is like
a<00:03:26.150> beef<00:03:26.510> ribs<00:03:27.110> but<00:03:27.860> in<00:03:27.950> this<00:03:28.069> case<00:03:28.310> is<00:03:28.580> stuck

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
a beef ribs but in this case is stuck

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.800 
a beef ribs but in this case is stuck
I'll<00:03:29.060> be<00:03:29.300> so<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.540> wonder<00:03:30.940> chicken<00:03:31.940> ribs<00:03:32.150> but

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
I'll be so I wonder chicken ribs but

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.780 
I'll be so I wonder chicken ribs but
there<00:03:33.349> are<00:03:33.500> no<00:03:33.650> bones<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.250> I'm<00:03:34.340> guessing<00:03:34.519> it's

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
there are no bones so I'm guessing it's

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.309 
there are no bones so I'm guessing it's
just<00:03:34.940> a<00:03:35.030> meat<00:03:35.209> from<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.480> ribs<00:03:35.750> of<00:03:35.900> chicken

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
just a meat from the ribs of chicken

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.520 
just a meat from the ribs of chicken

the substance has bones in it and it's
just<00:03:42.110> much<00:03:42.260> better<00:03:42.290> if<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:42.739> ask<00:03:42.950> without
