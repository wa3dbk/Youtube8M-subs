the reason it's named the concept it's

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.960 
the reason it's named the concept it's
it's<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:27.000> very<00:00:27.449> modern<00:00:28.789> interpretation<00:00:29.789> of

same time this has always been this is a
fourth<00:00:49.980> generation<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.180> concept<00:00:51.629> watch

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
fourth generation of the concept watch

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.560 
fourth generation of the concept watch
and<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.100> has<00:00:53.250> always<00:00:53.489> been<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> complicated

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and it has always been a complicated

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.500 
and it has always been a complicated
watch<00:00:54.750> -<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.739> are<00:00:57.079> GMT<00:00:58.399> the<00:00:59.399> construction<00:01:00.239> is

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
watch - we are GMT the construction is

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.299 
watch - we are GMT the construction is
very<00:01:00.949> avant-garde

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
very avant-garde

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.820 
very avant-garde
the<00:01:03.180> finishes<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> surfaces<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.589> very

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the finishes of the surfaces is very

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.820 
the finishes of the surfaces is very
avant-garde<00:01:05.280> obviously<00:01:06.060> very<00:01:06.270> limited

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
avant-garde obviously very limited

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.910 
avant-garde obviously very limited
quantity<00:01:08.000> 10<00:01:09.000> days<00:01:09.240> power<00:01:09.600> with

we<00:01:11.220> combined<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.270> word<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.990> lot<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
we combined in this word a lot of

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.630 
we combined in this word a lot of
challenges<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.310> watch

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
challenges so this is what this watch

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.120 
challenges so this is what this watch
represents<00:01:18.480> for<00:01:18.690> me<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.020> obviously<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
represents for me and obviously this the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.270 
represents for me and obviously this the
tics<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.670> watch<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:21.030> very<00:01:21.360> strong<00:01:21.720> very

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
tics of the watch are very strong very

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.670 
tics of the watch are very strong very
avant-garde<00:01:23.280> themselves<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.780> way<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.200> do<00:01:25.470> it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
avant-garde themselves the way we do it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.350 
avant-garde themselves the way we do it
we<00:01:26.280> are<00:01:26.460> using<00:01:26.720> super<00:01:27.720> ceramics<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:29.360> that

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
we are using super ceramics and that

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.690 
we are using super ceramics and that
material<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.930> 9<00:01:31.170> times<00:01:31.530> harder<00:01:32.130> than<00:01:32.340> steel

classifier from the back it shows the

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.730 
classifier from the back it shows the
caliber<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.310> that's<00:02:52.760> that's<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:54.050> think<00:02:54.560> I

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
caliber and that's that's I think I

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.670 
caliber and that's that's I think I
think<00:02:55.100> our<00:02:55.280> our<00:02:56.150> passionate<00:02:57.110> clients<00:02:57.500> will

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
think our our passionate clients will

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.770 
think our our passionate clients will
will<00:02:57.980> actually<00:02:58.340> appreciate<00:02:58.580> them<00:02:58.970> as<00:02:59.150> when

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
will actually appreciate them as when

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.809 
will actually appreciate them as when
watchmaking<00:03:00.440> appears<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.160> was<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.400> very

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
watchmaking appears it was a very

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.320 
watchmaking appears it was a very
technical<00:03:03.190> activity<00:03:04.190> at<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.430> time<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.300> a

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
technical activity at the time it is a

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.080 
technical activity at the time it is a
very<00:03:05.870> technical<00:03:06.140> activity<00:03:07.100> today<00:03:07.340> I'm<00:03:07.910> gonna

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
very technical activity today I'm gonna

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.690 
very technical activity today I'm gonna
give<00:03:08.330> you<00:03:08.480> an<00:03:08.600> example<00:03:09.910> we<00:03:11.020> use<00:03:12.020> a<00:03:12.700> new

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
give you an example we use a new

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.270 
give you an example we use a new
escapement<00:03:14.510> we<00:03:14.750> call<00:03:14.959> it<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.200> APS<00:03:15.830> caveman

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
escapement we call it the APS caveman

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.570 
escapement we call it the APS caveman
and<00:03:16.819> we<00:03:17.390> want<00:03:17.569> to<00:03:17.750> use<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.410> right<00:03:18.650> now<00:03:19.100> in<00:03:19.310> very

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
and we want to use it right now in very

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.520 
and we want to use it right now in very
exclusive<00:03:19.970> watches<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:20.900> in<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.230> future

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
exclusive watches and in the future

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.430 
exclusive watches and in the future
maybe<00:03:21.739> in<00:03:21.860> other<00:03:22.100> watches<00:03:22.700> because<00:03:23.269> it<00:03:24.140> has<00:03:24.410> a

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
maybe in other watches because it has a

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.400 
maybe in other watches because it has a
great<00:03:25.130> precision<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:26.150> is<00:03:26.540> traditional<00:03:27.230> watch

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
great precision it is traditional watch

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.100 
great precision it is traditional watch
making<00:03:27.800> but<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.010> design<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.330> system<00:03:29.780> of

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
making but the design of the system of

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.800 
making but the design of the system of
the<00:03:30.260> escapement<00:03:30.620> system<00:03:31.250> makes<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.120> very

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
the escapement system makes it very

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.530 
the escapement system makes it very
precise<00:03:33.530> but<00:03:34.160> in<00:03:34.310> fact<00:03:34.489> that<00:03:34.790> escapement<00:03:35.330> was

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
precise but in fact that escapement was

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.250 
precise but in fact that escapement was
invented<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:36.850> principle<00:03:37.850> in<00:03:38.060> Seoul<00:03:38.390> many

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
invented in principle in Seoul many

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.759 
invented in principle in Seoul many
decades<00:03:39.709> ago<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.900> think<00:03:42.290> it's<00:03:42.380> a<00:03:42.470> hundred

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
decades ago and I think it's a hundred

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.790 
decades ago and I think it's a hundred
years<00:03:43.069> ago<00:03:43.190> but<00:03:43.459> I'm<00:03:43.550> not<00:03:43.700> sure<00:03:44.230> but<00:03:45.230> they

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
years ago but I'm not sure but they

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.920 
years ago but I'm not sure but they
couldn't<00:03:46.280> make<00:03:46.880> it<00:03:46.940> they<00:03:47.450> couldn't<00:03:47.750> make<00:03:47.870> it

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
couldn't make it they couldn't make it

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.350 
couldn't make it they couldn't make it
work<00:03:48.380> because<00:03:48.890> at<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.280> time<00:03:49.489> they<00:03:50.060> didn't

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
work because at the time they didn't

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.680 
work because at the time they didn't
have<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.750> tools<00:03:51.110> to<00:03:51.560> make<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.670> parts<00:03:53.120> precise

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
have the tools to make the parts precise

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.319 
have the tools to make the parts precise
enough<00:03:54.019> so<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.410> will<00:03:54.620> work<00:03:54.860> and<00:03:56.140> AP<00:03:57.850> using<00:03:58.850> the

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
enough so it will work and AP using the

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.560 
enough so it will work and AP using the
current<00:04:00.079> state<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.920> art<00:04:01.030> technology<00:04:02.030> is

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
current state of the art technology is

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.930 
current state of the art technology is
able<00:04:02.810> to<00:04:03.170> make<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.530> parts<00:04:03.890> necessary<00:04:04.100> with

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
able to make the parts necessary with

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.310 
able to make the parts necessary with
the<00:04:05.690> precision<00:04:06.470> necessary<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:07.910> it<00:04:08.180> works<00:04:08.450> so

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
the precision necessary and it works so

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.310 
the precision necessary and it works so
it's<00:04:09.590> it's<00:04:09.860> one<00:04:10.040> example<00:04:10.400> of<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.840> reason<00:04:12.110> why

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
it's it's one example of the reason why

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.579 
it's it's one example of the reason why
we<00:04:12.620> use<00:04:12.650> technology
