because<00:03:24.659> he's<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.810> special<00:03:25.140> wall<00:03:25.349> that<00:03:26.220> does<00:03:26.370> a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
because he's a special wall that does a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.130

fair amount and he ancient powers and I

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.780 
fair amount and he ancient powers and I
mean<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.680> doesn't<00:03:31.920> do<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.010> lot<00:03:32.099> because<00:03:32.489> this<00:03:32.670> is

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
mean it doesn't do a lot because this is

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.080 
mean it doesn't do a lot because this is
a<00:03:32.819> bulky<00:03:33.420> yet<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.500> fast<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.220> bulky<00:03:35.640> banana

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
a bulky yet is a fast and bulky banana

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.850 
a bulky yet is a fast and bulky banana
doesn't<00:03:36.510> really<00:03:36.659> have<00:03:36.840> any<00:03:36.989> attacking<00:03:37.349> movies

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.449 
doesn't really have any attacking movies
and<00:03:38.099> so<00:03:38.519> my<00:03:38.610> bug<00:03:38.849> bite<00:03:39.090> didn't<00:03:39.690> do<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.870> lot<00:03:40.459> but

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
and so my bug bite didn't do a lot but

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.260 
and so my bug bite didn't do a lot but
don't<00:03:42.200> know<00:03:43.200> if<00:03:43.319> I<00:03:43.379> predicted<00:03:43.920> this
