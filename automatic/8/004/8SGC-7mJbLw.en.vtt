00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.200
 Y 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.210
 yes 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.460
 Well, the first thing I'm going to do to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.350
 this work will be stamps for 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.110
 Then print on the fabric of the 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.330
 T-shirt or T-shirt in this 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.670
 case to give it rigidity I will need 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.640
 a piece of cardboard and to print I'll 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.070
 to need foamy this first seal what 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.960
 I do with a sequence of lines but 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.239
 I have done others in the same way 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.220
 just as simple with triangles can 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.320
 perform squares can perform a 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.400
 line with curves you can do what you 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.400
 imagination allow you 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.220
 let's prepare now the shirt 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.049
 place an object in the center of a cardboard 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.840
 so that the painting does not transfer 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.880
 hold it with tape or with zeal what 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.970
 first thing that I will do will be a separation is 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.070
 using masking or paper tape and 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.729
 I'm going to apply the paint taps with 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.729
 a sponge 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.530
 do not 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 all right 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.539
 Now we apply the paint with a 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.179
 brush to each of the figures I'm 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.609
 using acrylic paint or can you 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.859
 use textile paint actually the 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:07.920
 It works fine acrylic does not fall not 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:10.530
 it gets stuck does not go with the washes it 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.420
 Adheres perfect to the fabric especially if 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.660
 it is a cotton fabric although 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.730
 clear if you use textile paint will be 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.769
 much better and I guess it will last longer 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.810
