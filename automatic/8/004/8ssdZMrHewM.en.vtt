screenshot of the page know where we're
going<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.600> guess<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.990> helps<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.439> little<00:01:25.650> bit

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.710 
going so I guess it helps a little bit
but<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.520> doesn't<00:01:26.820> seem<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.450> something

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
but it just doesn't seem like something

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.020 
but it just doesn't seem like something
that's<00:01:28.110> worth<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.619> dollar<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.159> fifty<00:01:29.490> cents<00:01:29.850> I

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that's worth a dollar and fifty cents I
