 the roads are always there and always 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.210

 desert mountains cities and so on to 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.170
 Sometimes it is a danger to drive over 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.880
 roads since they are not finished or 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 there are many cracks and even missing 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.500
 signals which cause accidents not 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.930
 It's always a highway fault 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.150
 It's also the driver's fault because his 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.609
 negligence or his impatience makes the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.680
 accelerate at full speed and cause a 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.929
 fatal accident as the car overturned or 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.820

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.730
 I will show you the 10 more roads 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.980

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.170
 this road connects the capital of the country the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.480
 peace with coroico in the Andean region of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.520
 the yungas combines the most curves 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.680
 Closed imaginable with circulation 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.809
 in both directions as it could not be 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.969
 another way having only 3 meters of 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.739
 wide in some sections and the presence 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.809
 of a precipice that is rolled very 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.539
 next and without any protection 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.180
 its poorly paved surface 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.949
 It is especially slippery 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.060
 fog and rain appear with 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.070
 frequency 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.409
 although in Bolivia one drives by the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.390
 right this road demands to do it by 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.579
 the left so that the trucks 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.280
 Always circulate through the most solid part 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.619
 the one based on rocks otherwise 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.759
 the ground would look to its weight and fall

 canton of hunan the risks of this 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.920
 road were already evident from their 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.720
 construction during which they died 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.940

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.610
 tourist attraction but the Chinese do not 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.640
 They hesitate to call it the path that 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.099

 points where it becomes very narrow 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:40.459
 the good thing is that at least there is hardly

 officers who certify that 40 soldiers 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.090
 they died during the construction of 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.340
 this road but other data point 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.190
 to a figure closer to 400 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.290
 dead were also used more than 6 thousand 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.210
 tons of explosives to be able 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.430
 install between the mountains a great

 variety of curved hairpins in that 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.810
 so between October and June usually 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.420
 be closed because the snow does it

 next to this road to travel 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.050
 you'll have to go in summer because 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.139
 the snow forces to close it during the 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.419

 one of the 40 border crossings

 existing between Chile and Argentina is in 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.790
 its Chilean side where we find all 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.620
 this series of curves without protections and 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.389
 most of the year covered 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.430
 snow while on the Argentine side 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.580
 there we see the tunnel of the redeeming Christ 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.800
 of 3 km another of those sections that have 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.260
 to be closed in winter because it 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.210
 make their volume of 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.190
 traffic is such that they are preparing 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.720
 two new tunnels to improve the

 of the montecarlo rally during which 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.060
 the cars reach speeds

 nothing less than 34 hairpins has a

 of altitude number 2 Lisburn motorway 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.480
 norway just enter this 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.810
 road you will see yourself submerged in a tunnel 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.850
 of 11 kilometers in the shape of a snail with 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.980
 a slope of 11 percent and without

 no type of lighting 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.450
 then you will have to negotiate 24 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.270
 closed curves in just 4 kilometers 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.520
 however on the contrary that in many

 other roads of this all 10 its

 Asphalt is careful its route 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.140

 concludes in the fjord of sector number 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.470
 Hindu highway Tibet India the 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.030
 construction of this road was 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.730
 ordered by whoever was governor 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:22.390
 general of the British Indian Lord 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.139

 Tibetan lands as part of the 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.860
 circuits of the silk route in the 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:33.370
 currently it is known as the national 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.139
 and hua and 22 and it has 459 kilometers of 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.509
 length but the last 100 kilometers 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:40.689
 they are the most dangerous because of their bad state 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:43.029
 of conservation on more than one occasion 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:45.039
 Indian government has considered closing it 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:48.599
 and today only the locals of the 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:48.599
 area dare to use it
