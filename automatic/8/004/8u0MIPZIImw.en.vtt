00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.850

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.949
 mouse so as to spend little not really 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.810
 since I have so much that when not a 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.029
 new and useful computer dropped to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.000
 spend 40 euros for a gaming mouse 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.739
 which you spend little is at least that of lo 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.870
 I keep for when I have to do editing 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.540

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.149
 only on my sister's hit him well 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.989
 to the side actually spent little 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.590
 but I hoped not so little here 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.969
 let's say he went to buy it from the Chinese 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:58.199
 and spent 2 euros and 99 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:02.210
 this mouse here optical mouse sensor 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.650
 new generation 2 euro 99 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.070
 let's go to perform what will be a 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.049
 unboxing little poor I think and then we test 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.520
 one to two euros 99 I'm curious to see 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:19.770
 as you can already open the box with 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:24.470
 which plastic you are here to announce 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:30.750
 dvd in peer rows it stinks it sucks 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:34.320
 then this is the little mouse here 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.490
 three normal buttons there but nice then 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.750
 here weight is illuminated everything and we go to 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.210
 see what those are 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.399
 characteristics of this mouse nofri 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.220
 little what is written here stallation 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.899
 turn on the pc or notebook connecting the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.579
 malodor installation took place 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.479
 automatically without any need for 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:58.380
 driver specifications compact some 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.700
 in 98 m and 2000 xp view 7 then already all 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.549
 8 polka 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.130
 I had no USB cable or dictated 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.540
 Characteristic mouse combinations 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.540
 here it is yes 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.939
 finally makes me understand that a mozart a 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:23.060
 2 euros and 99 among the almost written buttons 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:26.989
 six to three suva optical precision buttons 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:31.579
 of surfaces and remember this appears 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.540
 cison optics on surface paintings but ad 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:45.190
 it suits you 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:53.870
 dizzy design new design gives it more 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:56.799
 comfort from more without boundary 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.389
 scroll for easy navigation 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:04.250
 on the internet and documents on the inter is 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:08.510
 was written by a sabba alpha beta on 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.489
 his body but the beautiful the genius 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.489
 and this is the last point the last point 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:18.549
 the brilliant mind without the mouse ball 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.549
 don't need the police 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.859
 so little dandy cappato mental wrote 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.060
 a stuff like that google translate sab 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:37.549
 I don't know how these are the premises 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.480
 let's test this mouse on the 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.819
 portable 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:50.500
 ok guys now i will stick the mouse 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:50.500
 on the PC for a while you wait 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:02.760
 does not act does not act ok if it is lit. 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.010
 make that cool that is actually 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.620
 all red now we wait for it 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.200
 install ok then this is the mouse 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.819
 use the writing but I repeat the PC is not 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.879
 my 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.040
 then the mouse to see dates a lot 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:21.530
 sounds cool 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:27.840
 the problem is here if I see it 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:30.810
 look at the sky mouse pointer 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.550
 stand still and I 'm not fair my one hand 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:39.600
 is holding the phone another and here 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:42.660
 I do n't know if you see this at the parkinson 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.410
 not standing for the pursuit itself is 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:57.500
 kept the same as the game of 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:05:01.289
 zerba to find out is standing madonna 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:05.280
 let him play like this 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:09.450
 nothing is not apparently does not open the 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.340
 jokes moore Cangeri not me 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.130
 impossible 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:18.810
 I try not to change surface 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:21.470
 here now I put in the dictionary is a 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.470
 little where it ended up 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:29.280
 ok put on the dictionary on the surface 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.550
 the rougher remains firm indeed 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:36.300
 no, but there is written vaffa maio su 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.520
 all surfaces if I put it here where 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.300
 I kept all the other mice but that the 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:49.460
 my old way does not stand still 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:49.460
 still and disgusting mom that sucks 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.510
 nothing not yielded did hold the 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.620
 dictionary book of French here because 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.620
 we are not working 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:07.019
 well guys this unboxing and finished a 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:11.339
 little details to tell you that it's okay 

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:14.369
 spend little but not so little does not cost 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:17.339
 little and above all to buy things from 

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:20.039
 Chinese also goes well for god's sake 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:24.589
 I'm not against some things are good 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:27.479
 but on technology it does not suit you 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:31.169
 you should focus on technology 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:35.729
 on quality a little higher is fine 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:38.069
 spend 10 euros no more because at 299 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:41.189
 the risk is anyway 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:43.110
 bought at least one mat went to 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:45.179
 spend more or less the same money with 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.719
 the defense that that other works 

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:48.389
 everywhere 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:50.659
 this one if there is no pad or one 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:55.679
 I also did a rough surface 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:58.589
 on my pc and that is a wooden background e 

00:06:55.679 --> 00:07:00.989
 it doesn't work anyway it must own 

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:03.089
 be super rumi from the surface 

00:07:00.989 --> 00:07:05.549
 because otherwise it doesn't work they don't work 

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:08.129
 impossible cannot be used the less it remains 

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:11.789
 absolutely stop then guys 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:13.829
 spend little yes not for the time that 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.899
 ming and unfortunately those are clear 

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:20.279
 it takes at the end that it costs like a 

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:22.409
 joypad of the playstation, however, little to 

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:24.539
 about ten euros 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:25.979
 below I honestly wouldn't go to the 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:28.049
 cagliari sco is precisely that of 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:30.839
 be with the soldiers I a mouse 

00:07:28.049 --> 00:07:32.699
 practically unusable with this vi 

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:34.949
 greeting then make sense if there is 

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:37.049
