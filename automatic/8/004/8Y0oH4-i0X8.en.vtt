00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659 

we're<00:00:00.539> up<00:00:00.690> all<00:00:00.930> night<00:00:00.960> to<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.380> Sun<00:00:01.530> we're<00:00:02.520> up

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
we're up all night to the Sun we're up

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.910 
we're up all night to the Sun we're up
all<00:00:02.909> night<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.360> get<00:00:03.510> some<00:00:03.570> we're<00:00:04.500> up<00:00:04.560> all<00:00:04.859> night

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
all night to get some we're up all night

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:28.650 
all night to get some we're up all night
for<00:00:05.190> good<00:00:05.400> fun

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.600 

so<00:00:29.660> let's<00:00:30.200> start<00:00:30.410> with<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.710> cords<00:00:30.980> they're

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
so let's start with the cords they're

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.880 
so let's start with the cords they're
actually<00:00:31.970> quite<00:00:32.119> simple<00:00:32.450> as<00:00:32.810> their<00:00:33.350> only<00:00:33.530> four

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
actually quite simple as their only four

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.670 
actually quite simple as their only four
and<00:00:34.450> they're<00:00:35.450> very<00:00:35.750> similar<00:00:35.990> to<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.410> power

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
and they're very similar to the power

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.280 
and they're very similar to the power
cords<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.060> the<00:00:38.239> first<00:00:38.450> one<00:00:38.600> is<00:00:38.660> a<00:00:38.810> B<00:00:39.050> minus

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
cords so the first one is a B minus

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:50.510 
cords so the first one is a B minus
seven<00:00:39.770> and<00:00:40.010> it<00:00:40.370> sounds<00:00:40.670> like<00:00:40.730> this

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.410 

the<00:00:51.520> second<00:00:51.850> one<00:00:52.000> is<00:00:52.530> d6

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.549 

you

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:11.090 

third<00:01:03.559> one<00:01:03.770> is<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:03.950> F<00:01:04.430> sharp

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:25.760 

and<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:12.030> last<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.479> an<00:01:12.810> e6

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.260 

so<00:01:26.770> for<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.100> rhythm<00:01:27.400> part<00:01:27.670> your<00:01:28.030> right<00:01:28.240> hand

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
so for the rhythm part your right hand

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.900 
so for the rhythm part your right hand
is<00:01:28.720> actually<00:01:29.170> going<00:01:30.040> to<00:01:30.100> do<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.370> same<00:01:30.580> over

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
is actually going to do the same over

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.880 
is actually going to do the same over
and<00:01:30.940> over<00:01:31.210> again<00:01:31.420> which<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.810> basically<00:01:32.410> up<00:01:32.650> and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
and over again which is basically up and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.260 
and over again which is basically up and
down<00:01:37.979> your<00:01:38.979> left<00:01:39.610> hand<00:01:39.820> is<00:01:39.940> going<00:01:39.970> to<00:01:40.150> be

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
down your left hand is going to be

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.930 
down your left hand is going to be
playing<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:41.710> notes<00:01:41.920> on<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.310> right<00:01:42.670> times

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
playing the notes on the right times

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.540 
playing the notes on the right times
obviously<00:01:43.930> but<00:01:44.350> also<00:01:44.680> you<00:01:44.920> need<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.160> remember

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
obviously but also you need to remember

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.480 
obviously but also you need to remember
to<00:01:45.729> keep<00:01:46.090> your<00:01:46.300> hand<00:01:46.540> on<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.960> cord<00:01:47.350> on<00:01:47.590> the

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
to keep your hand on the cord on the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.850 
to keep your hand on the cord on the
string<00:01:48.940> so<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.510> get<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:49.720> muted<00:01:50.680> sound

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
string so that you get the muted sound

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.470 
string so that you get the muted sound
that<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.580> in<00:01:51.970> between<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.360> notes

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
that is in between the notes

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.850 
that is in between the notes

so that's pretty much it there are some
costs<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.290> are<00:03:19.319> they<00:03:20.129> don't<00:03:21.000> change<00:03:21.709> through

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
costs that are they don't change through

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.320 
costs that are they don't change through

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.349 
song basically so i'm going to show you
the<00:03:28.860> code

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.319 

so<00:03:33.359> now<00:03:33.810> about<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.230> code<00:03:34.499> so<00:03:34.890> basically<00:03:35.700> the

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
so now about the code so basically the

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.059 
so now about the code so basically the
chord<00:03:36.659> progression<00:03:37.230> for<00:03:37.409> those<00:03:37.590> who<00:03:37.709> know<00:03:37.859> the

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
chord progression for those who know the

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.059 
chord progression for those who know the
denotes<00:03:38.790> well<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:39.840> bm7<00:03:40.670> D<00:03:41.670> F<00:03:42.329> sharp<00:03:42.749> minor<00:03:43.069> 7

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
denotes well it's bm7 D F sharp minor 7

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.020 
denotes well it's bm7 D F sharp minor 7
&amp;<00:03:44.370> E<00:03:44.609> so<00:03:45.329> obviously<00:03:46.319> i'm<00:03:46.469> going<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.769> show<00:03:46.950> you

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
&amp; E so obviously i'm going to show you

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.770 
&amp; E so obviously i'm going to show you
what<00:03:48.030> as<00:03:48.150> discord<00:03:49.069> made<00:03:50.329> how<00:03:51.329> they<00:03:51.629> are<00:03:51.750> made

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
what as discord made how they are made

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.940 
what as discord made how they are made
so<00:03:52.260> first<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.189> all<00:03:53.280> for<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.609> first<00:03:53.849> girl<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.389> be

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
so first of all for the first girl to be

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.080 
so first of all for the first girl to be
minus<00:03:55.950> 7<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:57.780> wanna<00:03:58.019> with<00:03:58.439> the<00:03:58.590> left<00:03:59.129> and<00:03:59.370> you

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
minus 7 you wanna with the left and you

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.970 
minus 7 you wanna with the left and you
want<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.019> play<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.260> be<00:04:02.060> ok<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.409> for<00:04:04.409> the<00:04:04.590> main

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
want to play a be ok and for the main

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.110 
want to play a be ok and for the main
cord<00:04:05.689> you<00:04:06.689> play<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:07.879> G<00:04:08.879> and<00:04:09.739> F<00:04:10.739> sharp<00:04:11.069> so<00:04:11.579> this<00:04:11.969> is

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
cord you play a G and F sharp so this is

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.229 
cord you play a G and F sharp so this is
the<00:04:12.239> cop

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.400 

ok<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:17.590> for<00:04:17.920> the<00:04:18.040> second<00:04:18.400> code<00:04:18.640> so<00:04:19.000> addy<00:04:19.810> you
