thought I would share mine
I<00:00:06.440> was<00:00:07.440> quite<00:00:07.620> unusual<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.250> that<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.460> went<00:00:08.760> from

having long red hair to a pixie cut very

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.020 
having long red hair to a pixie cut very
suddenly<00:00:12.389> whereas<00:00:13.320> most<00:00:13.530> girls<00:00:13.860> go<00:00:14.370> gradually

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
suddenly whereas most girls go gradually

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.540 
suddenly whereas most girls go gradually
from<00:00:15.330> long<00:00:16.109> hair<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.619> shoulder<00:00:16.949> length<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.490> a

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
from long hair to shoulder length to a

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.840 
from long hair to shoulder length to a
bob<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.000> then<00:00:18.510> finally<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> pixie<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.850> actually

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
bob and then finally a pixie I actually

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.170 
bob and then finally a pixie I actually
dyed<00:00:21.000> my<00:00:21.210> hair<00:00:21.240> red<00:00:21.689> when<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.230> was<00:00:22.470> 16<00:00:22.920> which<00:00:23.880> was

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
dyed my hair red when I was 16 which was

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.839 
dyed my hair red when I was 16 which was
a<00:00:24.330> real<00:00:24.900> confidence<00:00:25.289> boost<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.070> really

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
a real confidence boost that I really

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.099 
a real confidence boost that I really
needed<00:00:27.000> at<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.240> time<00:00:27.269> because<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> was<00:00:27.810> really

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
needed at the time because I was really

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.970 
needed at the time because I was really
insecure<00:00:28.320> about<00:00:28.619> how<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> looked<00:00:29.900> but<00:00:30.920> by<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
insecure about how I looked but by the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.319 
insecure about how I looked but by the
time<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.250> got<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.460> uni<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> lot<00:00:33.300> more

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
time I got to uni I was a lot more

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.170 
time I got to uni I was a lot more
comfortable<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.290> my<00:00:34.320> own<00:00:34.410> skin<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.160> then<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
comfortable in my own skin and then I

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.569 
comfortable in my own skin and then I
realized<00:00:36.719> just<00:00:36.899> how<00:00:37.110> unmanageable<00:00:37.980> having

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
realized just how unmanageable having

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.360 
realized just how unmanageable having
red<00:00:38.850> hair<00:00:38.879> was<00:00:39.680> because<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.770> had<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.980> read<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.309> it

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
red hair was because I had to read I it

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.779 
red hair was because I had to read I it
every<00:00:41.790> five<00:00:41.969> weeks<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:43.100> you<00:00:44.100> know<00:00:44.219> away<00:00:44.640> at

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
uni I just didn't have the time or the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.389 
uni I just didn't have the time or the
money<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:49.170> lot<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.559> girls<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:50.010> long<00:00:50.190> hair

will know having long hair is so much
work<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.090> would<00:00:54.809> spend<00:00:55.110> over<00:00:55.739> an<00:00:55.829> hour<00:00:56.070> just

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
work I would spend over an hour just

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.590 
work I would spend over an hour just
styling<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.320> go<00:00:58.440> out<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> evening<00:00:59.399> and

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
styling it to go out in the evening and

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.709 
styling it to go out in the evening and
that<00:01:00.600> was<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.140> feasible<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.000> I<00:01:03.000> decided<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
that was not feasible so I decided that

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.120 
that was not feasible so I decided that
I<00:01:03.870> wanted<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.409> pixie<00:01:04.799> cut<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:06.350> that<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.530> wanted

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
I wanted a pixie cut and that I wanted

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.940 
I wanted a pixie cut and that I wanted
this<00:01:08.310> more<00:01:08.970> than<00:01:09.240> anything<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:10.830> I've

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
this more than anything I think I've

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.550 
this more than anything I think I've
ever<00:01:10.979> wanted<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.820> my<00:01:12.270> life<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.900> fantasized

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
ever wanted in my life I fantasized

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.320 
ever wanted in my life I fantasized
about<00:01:13.890> having<00:01:14.720> short<00:01:15.720> hair<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.939> when<00:01:18.299> I

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
about having short hair and so when I

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.740 
about having short hair and so when I
got<00:01:18.509> home<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:18.960> Easter<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:20.030> just<00:01:21.030> chopped<00:01:21.659> it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
got home for Easter I just chopped it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.730 
got home for Easter I just chopped it
off<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.110> went<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> salon<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:24.509> said<00:01:24.900> just

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
off I went to the salon and I said just

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.480 
off I went to the salon and I said just
just<00:01:26.159> cut<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.400> off<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:28.829> still<00:01:29.009> red<00:01:29.220> at

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
just cut it off and it was still red at

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.020 
just cut it off and it was still red at
that<00:01:29.729> point<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.110> wasn't<00:01:31.500> too<00:01:32.369> much<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.970> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
that point so it wasn't too much of a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.370 
that point so it wasn't too much of a
change<00:01:33.860> but<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.009> felt<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.110> liberated<00:01:37.110> so

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
change but I felt so liberated so

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.429 
change but I felt so liberated so
empowered<00:01:38.180> honestly<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.540> new<00:01:39.810> person<00:01:40.290> I

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
empowered honestly like a new person I

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.950 
empowered honestly like a new person I
felt<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.520> anything<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.329> could

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
felt like I can do anything I could

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.219 
felt like I can do anything I could
conquer<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.680> world<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.340> wanted<00:01:44.700> to

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
conquer the world if I wanted to

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.130 
conquer the world if I wanted to
so<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:47.040> next<00:01:47.250> step<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:47.579> me<00:01:47.880> was<00:01:48.149> then<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.960> go

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
so the next step for me was then to go

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.389 
so the next step for me was then to go
blonde<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> went<00:01:52.500> back<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.829> salon<00:01:53.189> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
blonde and so I went back to the salon a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.010 
blonde and so I went back to the salon a
few<00:01:53.820> weeks<00:01:54.000> later<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:55.070> I<00:01:56.299> started<00:01:57.299> having<00:01:57.509> the
