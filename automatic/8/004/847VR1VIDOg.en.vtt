00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.819
 over a day of research before 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.370
 the lifeless body of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.200
 natali ciccone was found several 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.480
 meters from the accident site in the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.490
 cold waters of the river ofanto to a few 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.109
 kilometers from his conza house 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.970
 Campania in the province of Avellino 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.710
 the nineteen year old on Easter night 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.010
 has lost control of his car 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.750
 which ended up in the river ofanto on the spot 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.580
 together with the red helmets of avellino it was 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.400
 a team from the nucleus also intervened 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.859
 salerno divers just one of the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.800
 components antonio modugno tells the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.710
 dramatic phases of the finding of the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.450
 body of the nineteen year old situation 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.960
 especially accident happened in 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.730
 adverse weather conditions 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.879
 and unfortunately the drama of this girl 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.850
 that one passes yet for over a day 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.980
 you have worked and hoped to the end 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.129
 to be able to positively resolve the case 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.649
 no yes unfortunately the problem was 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.880
 the river that was was fundamental 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.360
 true cause of the bad weather was swollen 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.770
 there was a strong current near where 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.860
 that car we found in the car 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.840
 there was a waterfall on the way 14 15 meters 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.180
 so it was first of all 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.159
 difficult to recover the car then one 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.500
 once recovered after seeing that of the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.750
 the girl's body was not there 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.180
 we started research there 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:35.100
 in areas close to the place 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:39.360
 of the salerno incident and trained 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.579
 for interventions of this and we have courses 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.259
 very hard as to face any 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:49.020
 kind of situation arises from this 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.579
 genus both in river environments such as 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.060
 this case especially loving or others e 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.490
 those who give shoulder to those who will surrender and certainly 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.159
 we also use the help of others 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.320
 specialized courses that are part of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.149
 firefighters such as sunn or otherwise 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.340
 also the other g of the generic fire a 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.440
 who was there and will give us a hand 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.440
 with their minds
