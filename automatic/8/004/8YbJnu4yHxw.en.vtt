00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello everyone in this video I want to tell 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.850
 about the restoration of the wiring in the door vaz 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.540
 2110 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:16.009
 this car does not work 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.009
 power windows and central locking 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.060
 cut out in the year of the wire of course you can 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.720
 do it with nippers but i will cut 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.720
 scissors 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.380
 we pull out a harness from 3 absolutely all wires 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.380
 damaged 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:46.760
 we clean the wires from the center of the drive 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.410
 lock we clean only two because 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.800
 the wires that go to the switch we do not 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.800
 are needed 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.390
 take out the connector from the window 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.110
 connector I soldered new terminals mother and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.479
 put them in their place 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.880
 central castle i right yes just 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.520
 solder and go to shrink 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.580
 You can change the phone completely. 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.570
 too, will normally sit down 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.570
 heat shrink tube 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.930
 see how the wires go as needed 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.930
 cut off how much to leave 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.239
 measure a piece thicker 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:23.770
 shrink tubing to 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:26.640
 shove her all the harness and push in 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.640
 wiring harness 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.720
 wrapping the ends of the wires look at the ends 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:16.530
 wires with tape so that it is good 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:20.420
 I went through the fire and miss 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.420
 wires through the corrugation in the salon 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.370
 put on the wires in the cabin 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:54.480
 shrink tube and pro by its them 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.370
 window earned immediately 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.909
 central locking only worked on 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.189
 driver's door there was a problem with 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.799
 connectors elsewhere and generally on 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.349
 This car wiring to this collective farm there 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.260
 the miracle is all cut 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:14.269
 insulated tape and wire in 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.269
 top ten very much even from the factory
