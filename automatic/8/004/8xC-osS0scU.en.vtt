V D is a moose Caen a gigabyte RAM stick
now<00:00:38.670> currently<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.450> has<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> good<00:00:40.140> bites<00:00:40.290> on

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
now currently it has to to good bites on

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.860 
now currently it has to to good bites on
board<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.399> 2<00:00:41.460> gig<00:00:41.940> RAM<00:00:42.180> stick<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.629> there

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
board and a 2 gig RAM stick in there

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.720 
board and a 2 gig RAM stick in there
we're<00:00:43.260> gonna<00:00:43.320> take<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.920> out<00:00:44.160> put<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.520> 8

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
we're gonna take that out put this 8

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.520 
we're gonna take that out put this 8
gigs<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.270> bump<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.539> up<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.750> 10<00:00:46.020> gigabytes<00:00:46.410> of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
gigs and bump it up to 10 gigabytes of

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.279 
gigs and bump it up to 10 gigabytes of
RAM<00:00:46.829> might<00:00:47.550> seem<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.820> overkill<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.989> don't

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
RAM might seem like overkill but I don't

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.860 
RAM might seem like overkill but I don't
think<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.649> now<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.430> thing<00:00:50.969> about<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.629> has

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
think so now the thing about this is has

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.189 
think so now the thing about this is has
a<00:00:51.899> cast<00:00:52.530> latency<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.340> 11<00:00:54.120> which<00:00:54.539> matches<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
a cast latency of 11 which matches the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.500 
a cast latency of 11 which matches the
latency<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.520> onboard<00:00:56.969> memory<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
latency of the onboard memory so it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.750 
latency of the onboard memory so it
should<00:00:57.690> run<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.899> little<00:00:58.109> more<00:00:58.260> smoothly<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
should run a little more smoothly you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.849 
should run a little more smoothly you
can<00:01:00.000> go<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.329> faster<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.899> go<00:01:01.020> with<00:01:01.170> 10<00:01:01.530> or<00:01:01.710> 9

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
can go with faster you go with 10 or 9

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.460 
can go with faster you go with 10 or 9
but<00:01:02.219> I'm<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.670> gonna<00:01:02.789> stick<00:01:03.030> with<00:01:03.090> 11<00:01:03.629> also<00:01:04.019> it

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
but I'm just gonna stick with 11 also it

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.380 
but I'm just gonna stick with 11 also it
runs<00:01:04.710> at<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> lower<00:01:05.100> voltage<00:01:05.339> instead<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.119> 1.5

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
runs at a lower voltage instead of 1.5

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.710 
runs at a lower voltage instead of 1.5
it<00:01:07.290> runs<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:07.860> 1.30<00:01:08.400> 5<00:01:08.670> volts<00:01:09.150> not<00:01:09.330> sure<00:01:09.600> if

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
it runs at 1.30 5 volts not sure if

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.990 
it runs at 1.30 5 volts not sure if
that's<00:01:09.900> really<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.710> probably<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.000> negligible

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that's really it's probably a negligible

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.719 
that's really it's probably a negligible
difference<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.740> nice<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.700> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
difference but it's nice to know that I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.870 
difference but it's nice to know that I
could<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.420> serving<00:01:15.780> some<00:01:16.229> power<00:01:16.700> so<00:01:17.700> yeah

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
could be serving some power so yeah

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.910 
could be serving some power so yeah
that's<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.630> will<00:01:18.810> run<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.080> about<00:01:19.200> 40

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that's that this will run you about 40

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.219 
that's that this will run you about 40

Isuzu x32 VD this is the only model of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.060 
Isuzu x32 VD this is the only model of
the<00:01:48.360> UX<00:01:48.659> line<00:01:48.930> that's<00:01:49.170> basically<00:01:49.470> upgradable

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the UX line that's basically upgradable

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.499 
the UX line that's basically upgradable
so<00:01:50.340> with<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.790> upgrade<00:01:51.090> you're<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.450> to

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
there so now that we're into the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.340 
there so now that we're into the
computer<00:02:32.570> you're<00:02:32.720> going<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.900> see<00:02:33.020> all<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.170> the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
computer you're going to see all of the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.260 
computer you're going to see all of the
components<00:02:33.500> here<00:02:34.160> what<00:02:34.430> we're<00:02:34.580> upgrading<00:02:34.790> is

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
components here what we're upgrading is

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.270 
components here what we're upgrading is
the<00:02:35.480> RAM<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.530> hard<00:02:36.800> drive<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.100> don't

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
the RAM and the hard drive you don't

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.380 
the RAM and the hard drive you don't
have<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.490> worry<00:02:37.640> about<00:02:37.820> anything<00:02:38.090> else

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
have to worry about anything else

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.690 
have to worry about anything else
alright<00:02:38.990> so<00:02:39.200> moving<00:02:39.380> on<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.130> RAM<00:02:40.400> stick

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
alright so moving on to the RAM stick

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.310 
alright so moving on to the RAM stick
you're<00:02:40.880> going<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.060> see<00:02:41.270> that<00:02:41.510> in<00:02:41.750> place

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
you're going to see that in place

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.860 
you're going to see that in place
already<00:02:42.590> is<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.220> 2gig<00:02:43.820> RAM<00:02:44.060> stick<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.540> comes

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
already is the 2gig RAM stick that comes

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.630 
already is the 2gig RAM stick that comes
with<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.290> card<00:02:45.560> all<00:02:46.100> you're<00:02:46.340> going<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.520> need

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
with the card all you're going to need

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.370 
with the card all you're going to need
to<00:02:46.730> do<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:46.970> take<00:02:47.120> this<00:02:47.270> out<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.600> pop<00:02:47.840> these<00:02:48.050> two

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
to do to take this out is pop these two

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.440 
to do to take this out is pop these two
prongs<00:02:48.650> on<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:48.980> side<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.459> simply<00:02:49.760> remove<00:02:50.180> the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
prongs on the side and simply remove the

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.210 
prongs on the side and simply remove the
RAM<00:02:50.660> stick<00:02:50.989> I<00:02:51.200> think<00:02:51.560> this<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.920> easiest

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
RAM stick I think this is the easiest

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.800 
RAM stick I think this is the easiest
upgrade<00:02:52.580> so<00:02:52.790> here<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.060> can<00:02:53.180> see<00:02:53.270> we<00:02:53.390> have<00:02:53.570> our

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.750 
upgrade so here you can see we have our
eight<00:02:54.050> gigs<00:02:54.320> of<00:02:54.470> RAM<00:02:54.680> what<00:02:55.370> I'm<00:02:55.489> doing<00:02:55.670> right

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
eight gigs of RAM what I'm doing right

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.070 
eight gigs of RAM what I'm doing right
here<00:02:55.940> is<00:02:56.000> optional<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.630> don't<00:02:56.660> really<00:02:56.870> have
