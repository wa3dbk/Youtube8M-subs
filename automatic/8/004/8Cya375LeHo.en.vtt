00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.519
 we arrived aboard Eduardo's car and 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.920
 the game of this super prime that if 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.400
 you are the width of the track is well 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.400
 narrow 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.900
 see the amount of public that does not 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.070
 appeared on the rallies also accord 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.170
 the reality world championship the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.150
 number of people that are watching the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.770
 competition 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.770
 there is great nation of one thousand euros 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.770
 at the level two years ago of your 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.470
 participation 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.440
 the real integration with this has been 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.980
 an evolution and it has improved immensely 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.510
 finish with eduardo has a small 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.310
 problem with the mud that the car does not 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.680
 comes to turn around this curve 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.120
 which is very closed and that's why it's turned off 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.220
 and he has to put backward here he lost 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.440
 enough positions for your order of 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.629
 departure 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.420
 the level in Ecuador has been greatly improved 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.000
 and that's why an error like that 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.210
 to buy eduardo he did lose 45 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.740
 positions that would not have been like that before 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.009
 had not only suddenly lost a 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.009
 position 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:19.289
 12 cars in this category is a good 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:23.530
 number that we are with 78 carlos maximum 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:25.299
 but let's barreiro now 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.760
 those going to try to go the most 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.730
 fast possible but without committing 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.950
 I knew it was easy to take a trope 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.110
 get out as we saw last 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.689
 it paid off because it can win the first 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.030
 and has ranked the first one for 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.380
 part 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.140
 this first day 23 specials I'm at 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.180
 curve 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.340
 we'll see 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.120
 and there is applying the power in the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.120
 moment of life 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.060
 its acceleration to which is progressive clear 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.470
 with the mud it has to be a little 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.930
 Progressive wax so you do not leave 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.300
 both the charge 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.120
 try not to be very spectacular to 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.520
 go front and measure both sideways not 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.440
 on land the mud loses much more 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.720
 because what you have to try to do 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.850
 is that the car as they turn the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.800
 tires this let's say pulling on the 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.600
 floor if you're not wasting seconds and the 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.690
 car does not advance while skidding the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.490
 Curve skids plus the tires if the car 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.870
 does not advance not what you want is that the 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.330
 forward moving car you want that 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.040
 sacrifice a bit the speed by 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.680
 have a better acceleration coming out in 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.890
 the curve roberto 'tito' rabat 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.040
 on this first day he would already be in fifth 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.040
 place 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.620
 let's see what Tito does 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.620
 brown now 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.690
 quiet 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.380
 It went away 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.950
 it almost goes out there there was a gap that is 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.560
 which came on that site you could 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.220
 to stay there could get you out of 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.930
 acceleration 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.460
 we are seeing the same as we see in the 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.560
 4x4 extraction not 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.780
 stops accelerating fell on people 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.239
 good maneuver for a little risky 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.150
 but very well saved inside the car 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.580
 we are seeing it from the car look 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.740
 with all the tranquility with the jousts 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.240
 With the joust 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.190
 we have seen that the tail had already 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.190
 won but it has come to climb 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.170
 and this made him lose time has also 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.520
 cited brown but did not remove the foot as 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.440
 we say 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.680
 seems to be entering a bit too 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.740
 fast on the no clue how are you no 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.520
 slips and goes away let's see this 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.520
 pilot serrano uy 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.670
 I did not read did not the team see the 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.950
 repetition 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.510
 he could not get it out of the 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.510
 track and it has a rollover 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.990
 no consequences live in the water not 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.990
 they are almost in perfect condition
