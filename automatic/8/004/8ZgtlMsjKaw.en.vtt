balanced our engines and they are ready

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:27.269 
balanced our engines and they are ready
to<00:00:21.009> be<00:00:21.669> mounted<00:00:21.880> on<00:00:22.449> the<00:00:22.919> dunes<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:25.859> for<00:00:26.859> this

to be mounted on the dunes and for this
job<00:00:27.730> we<00:00:28.150> will<00:00:28.390> need<00:00:30.089> the<00:00:31.089> taller<00:00:31.419> screws<00:00:33.149> as<00:00:34.149> i

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
job we will need the taller screws as i

exactly<00:00:44.890> what<00:00:45.250> will<00:00:45.490> happen<00:00:45.520> here<00:00:46.270> but<00:00:47.820> it's

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
exactly what will happen here but it's

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:59.160 
exactly what will happen here but it's
just<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:54.670> we're<00:00:55.000> gonna<00:00:55.180> do<00:00:55.480> is<00:00:57.960> mount<00:00:58.960> the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
just so what we're gonna do is mount the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:10.470 
just so what we're gonna do is mount the
engines<00:00:59.620> and<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:01.090> want<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:04.329> output<00:01:04.839> cables<00:01:09.480> the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
engines and I want the output cables the

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.770 
engines and I want the output cables the
front<00:01:10.810> and<00:01:11.260> we<00:01:11.380> need<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.590> see<00:01:11.980> that<00:01:12.010> we<00:01:12.430> have

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
front and we need to see that we have

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.970 
front and we need to see that we have
long<00:01:13.780> distance<00:01:14.020> holes<00:01:15.630> are<00:01:16.630> here<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.409> small

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
long distance holes are here and small

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.710 
long distance holes are here and small
distance<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:20.170> green<00:01:20.560> so<00:01:21.180> i'll<00:01:22.180> check<00:01:22.240> the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
distance for green so i'll check the

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:35.370 
distance for green so i'll check the
engine<00:01:22.900> just<00:01:25.200> put<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.320> screw<00:01:26.620> in<00:01:28.890> yes<00:01:34.380> passed

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380

what<00:02:22.820> about<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.330> same<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:26.830> when<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:28.130> have<00:02:28.370> all

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
what about the same so when I have all

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.500 
what about the same so when I have all
the<00:02:29.830> four<00:02:30.830> engines<00:02:31.310> pre-mounted<00:02:31.910> i<00:02:32.420> will<00:02:32.810> just

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
the four engines pre-mounted i will just

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:43.480 
the four engines pre-mounted i will just
flip<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:37.250> whole<00:02:37.400> package<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:42.190> line<00:02:43.190> the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
flip the whole package and line the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:03:08.970 
flip the whole package and line the
engines<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.980> nest<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.310> pin<00:02:52.000> four<00:02:53.000> screws

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:20.949 

titan<00:03:09.980> yes<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:11.270> know<00:03:16.660> four<00:03:17.660> screws<00:03:19.450> so<00:03:20.450> this

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
titan yes you know four screws so this

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:29.500 
titan yes you know four screws so this
is<00:03:20.990> how<00:03:25.060> it's<00:03:26.060> going<00:03:26.240> to<00:03:26.330> look<00:03:26.390> when<00:03:26.840> it's<00:03:28.510> just

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
is how it's going to look when it's just

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.010 
is how it's going to look when it's just
s<00:03:29.930> controllers<00:03:30.850> atoms<00:03:31.850> are<00:03:32.150> attached<00:03:32.540> the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
s controllers atoms are attached the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.040 
s controllers atoms are attached the
engines<00:03:33.440> are<00:03:34.220> attached<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:35.090> we<00:03:35.390> have<00:03:35.570> balance

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
engines are attached and we have balance

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.850 
engines are attached and we have balance
engine<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:37.690> this<00:03:38.690> is<00:03:39.610> one<00:03:40.610> step<00:03:40.940> in<00:03:41.860> the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
engine so this is one step in the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.020 
engine so this is one step in the
successful<00:03:43.640> so<00:03:44.150> that<00:03:44.480> when<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:46.220> engines<00:03:46.640> are

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.260 

heightened<00:03:51.220> I'm<00:03:52.220> going<00:03:52.459> to<00:03:52.580> use<00:03:52.790> some<00:03:55.270> stripes

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
heightened I'm going to use some stripes

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:06.539 
heightened I'm going to use some stripes
to<00:03:59.200> fremont<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:01.610> s<00:04:01.760> controllers<00:04:03.910> because<00:04:04.910> i

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
to fremont the s controllers because i

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:14.949 
to fremont the s controllers because i
just<00:04:09.640> don't<00:04:10.640> want<00:04:10.940> them<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:13.000> be<00:04:14.000> all<00:04:14.299> over<00:04:14.750> the

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
just don't want them to be all over the

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:23.350 
just don't want them to be all over the

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.419 
way down because at the final stage i
will<00:05:10.649> need<00:05:11.489> to<00:05:11.959> secure<00:05:12.959> them<00:05:13.259> a<00:05:13.499> lot<00:05:14.159> better

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:14.429 
will need to secure them a lot better

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:20.719 
will need to secure them a lot better
and<00:05:16.069> any<00:05:17.069> cables<00:05:17.849> we<00:05:18.300> are<00:05:19.399> going<00:05:20.399> to<00:05:20.519> check

connected<00:05:39.990> to<00:05:40.139> the<00:05:40.259> controller<00:05:40.909> at<00:05:41.909> the<00:05:42.089> later

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:42.329 
connected to the controller at the later

00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:53.499 
connected to the controller at the later
stage<00:05:47.749> this<00:05:48.749> way<00:05:49.050> we<00:05:49.349> get<00:05:49.559> a<00:05:50.869> quite<00:05:51.869> neat

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:53.509 
stage this way we get a quite neat

00:05:53.509 --> 00:06:02.750 
stage this way we get a quite neat
installation<00:05:54.509> looking<00:05:55.199> good

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:10.610

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.290 
receiver rear our current sensor needs
to<00:06:32.430> be<00:06:32.610> placed<00:06:32.910> somewhere<00:06:33.240> and<00:06:34.220> our<00:06:35.220> GPS<00:06:35.850> needs

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
to be placed somewhere and our GPS needs

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.560 
to be placed somewhere and our GPS needs
to<00:06:36.570> be<00:06:36.720> placed<00:06:36.990> somewhere<00:06:37.520> and<00:06:39.590> I<00:06:40.970> also<00:06:41.970> got<00:06:42.360> a

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
to be placed somewhere and I also got a

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:49.490 
to be placed somewhere and I also got a
5.8<00:06:43.500> Emerson<00:06:45.590> digit<00:06:46.590> transmitter<00:06:48.140> so<00:06:49.140> I<00:06:49.170> guess

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
5.8 Emerson digit transmitter so I guess

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.520 
5.8 Emerson digit transmitter so I guess
it<00:06:49.710> will<00:06:49.890> be<00:06:49.950> placed<00:06:50.400> somewhere<00:06:50.930> in<00:06:51.930> the

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
it will be placed somewhere in the

00:06:52.530 --> 00:07:00.560 
it will be placed somewhere in the
middle<00:06:54.620> so<00:06:57.320> that's<00:06:58.320> about<00:06:59.150> engine<00:07:00.150> mounting

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570 
middle so that's about engine mounting

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.320 
middle so that's about engine mounting
and<00:07:00.810> balancing
