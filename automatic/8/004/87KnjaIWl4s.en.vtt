make sure the end is capitalized you can

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.070

hit attack M&amp;E make sure you enter this

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.699 
hit attack M&amp;E make sure you enter this
in<00:03:48.240> twice<00:03:48.930> because<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.530> takes<00:03:49.800> two<00:03:50.340> times<00:03:51.709> make

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
in twice because it takes two times make

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.949 
in twice because it takes two times make

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
sure you ain't drink white because it

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:04.070 
sure you ain't drink white because it
it's<00:03:55.500> two<00:03:55.890> times<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.370> kill<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.700> enemy<00:03:56.970> not<00:03:57.209> one

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.230 

and<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:05.280> should<00:04:05.580> attack<00:04:06.000> threaten<00:04:06.630> me<00:04:08.240> now

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
and that should attack threaten me now

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.840 
and that should attack threaten me now
let<00:04:09.540> me<00:04:09.570> explain<00:04:09.690> what<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:10.320> code<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.740> doing

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.229 

it's<00:04:14.850> a<00:04:15.150> find<00:04:16.250> nearest<00:04:17.250> enemy<00:04:17.459> so<00:04:17.730> basically

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
it's a find nearest enemy so basically

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.150 
it's a find nearest enemy so basically
it's<00:04:18.570> finding<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.170> Earth's<00:04:19.380> immune<00:04:20.070> the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
it's finding the Earth's immune the

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.820 
it's finding the Earth's immune the
nearest<00:04:20.459> M&amp;E<00:04:20.820> was<00:04:21.030> this<00:04:21.239> guy<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.810> then<00:04:22.320> what<00:04:22.680> I

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
nearest M&amp;E was this guy and then what I

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.190 
nearest M&amp;E was this guy and then what I
like<00:04:23.040> they<00:04:23.340> attack<00:04:23.700> him<00:04:23.730> twice<00:04:24.420> which<00:04:24.900> two

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
like they attack him twice which two

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.770 
like they attack him twice which two
attacks<00:04:25.590> will<00:04:25.860> kill<00:04:26.100> him<00:04:26.220> then<00:04:27.120> if<00:04:27.360> we<00:04:27.570> enter

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
attacks will kill him then if we enter

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.800 
attacks will kill him then if we enter
this<00:04:28.110> code<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.710> again<00:04:29.220> it<00:04:29.820> would<00:04:30.120> go<00:04:30.270> for<00:04:30.600> this

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
this code and again it would go for this

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.470 
this code and again it would go for this
guy<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.320> kill<00:04:31.530> him<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:31.800> basically<00:04:32.400> beat<00:04:33.240> this

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
guy and kill him so basically beat this

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.310 
guy and kill him so basically beat this
level<00:04:33.840> all<00:04:34.410> you<00:04:34.920> need<00:04:35.100> to<00:04:35.190> do<00:04:35.400> is<00:04:35.550> into<00:04:35.970> this

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
level all you need to do is into this

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.320 
level all you need to do is into this
this<00:04:37.320> code<00:04:37.710> right<00:04:37.980> here<00:04:38.570> three<00:04:39.570> times<00:04:41.330> all

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
this code right here three times all

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:52.820 
this code right here three times all
right<00:04:47.960> fine<00:04:48.960> this<00:04:50.570> time<00:04:51.570> I'm<00:04:51.930> gonna<00:04:52.110> i<00:04:52.500> like

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
right fine this time I'm gonna i like

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.980 
right fine this time I'm gonna i like
typing<00:04:53.190> in<00:04:53.400> because<00:04:53.790> you<00:04:54.360> learned<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.780> code

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
typing in because you learned the code

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:02.360 
typing in because you learned the code
better<00:04:56.270> years<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.940> make<00:05:00.570> sure<00:05:00.750> M&amp;E<00:05:01.230> is<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:02.010> kind

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
better years and make sure M&amp;E is a kind

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.990 
better years and make sure M&amp;E is a kind
of<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.610> E&amp;M<00:05:03.060> knee<00:05:03.420> is<00:05:03.570> capitalized<00:05:07.790> like<00:05:08.790> it

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
of the E&amp;M knee is capitalized like it

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:24.050 
of the E&amp;M knee is capitalized like it
showed<00:05:09.180> you<00:05:09.360> before<00:05:09.680> attack<00:05:14.150> M<00:05:15.150> me<00:05:20.150> back<00:05:23.060> so

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
showed you before attack M me back so

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.240 
showed you before attack M me back so
basically<00:05:24.600> what<00:05:24.870> this<00:05:25.080> code<00:05:25.320> do<00:05:25.740> is<00:05:26.010> now

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
basically what this code do is now

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.830 
basically what this code do is now
attacked<00:05:26.790> this<00:05:27.090> in<00:05:27.360> me<00:05:28.430> and<00:05:29.430> then<00:05:30.330> that<00:05:30.540> attack

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
attacked this in me and then that attack

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.020 
attacked this in me and then that attack
the<00:05:30.870> last<00:05:31.290> enemy<00:05:31.620> we<00:05:31.980> type<00:05:32.220> in<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.460> same<00:05:32.760> thing

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
the last enemy we type in the same thing

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.210 
the last enemy we type in the same thing
I'm<00:05:33.540> gonna<00:05:33.810> show<00:05:33.990> you<00:05:34.050> a<00:05:34.169> shortcut<00:05:34.590> instead

type if you don't feel like typing the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.990 
type if you don't feel like typing the
codes<00:05:37.560> like<00:05:37.770> if<00:05:37.919> you<00:05:38.010> got<00:05:38.190> long<00:05:38.460> strips<00:05:38.820> of

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
codes like if you got long strips of

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.230 
codes like if you got long strips of
code<00:05:39.210> you<00:05:40.050> can<00:05:40.200> usually<00:05:40.620> hit<00:05:40.830> this<00:05:42.230> you<00:05:43.230> know

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
code you can usually hit this you know

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.670 
code you can usually hit this you know
hit<00:05:45.240> copy<00:05:45.950> go<00:05:46.950> down<00:05:47.160> to<00:05:47.340> you<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:47.700> Lovins<00:05:48.680> hit

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
hit copy go down to you to Lovins hit

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.980 
hit copy go down to you to Lovins hit
paste<00:05:50.070> and<00:05:50.550> then<00:05:50.820> yeah<00:05:51.060> so<00:05:51.419> if<00:05:51.510> you<00:05:51.570> have<00:05:51.720> to

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
paste and then yeah so if you have to

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.500 
paste and then yeah so if you have to
like<00:05:52.140> for<00:05:53.010> example<00:05:53.460> when<00:05:53.580> you<00:05:53.700> get<00:05:53.910> to<00:05:54.120> the

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
like for example when you get to the
