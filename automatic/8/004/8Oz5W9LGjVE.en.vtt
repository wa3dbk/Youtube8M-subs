 break records of productivity develops 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.780
 equipment based on clean energy is 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.400
 close to agricultural producers 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.770
 from all over the world those are some of the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.960
 reasons that explain why new holland 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.470
 is today the world leader in machinery 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.470
 agricultural 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.580
 it was at the end of the 19th century precisely in 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.550
 the city of new holland pennsylvania 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.890
 where abraham senerman decided to open his 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.460
 small smithy and where it would reveal 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.050
 as a true genius of mechanics 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.059
 first he drew attention with his design 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.129
 of a portable mole d'or of grains and 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.170
 then noting that many engines are 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.540
 they broke by the expansion of their liquids 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.640
 when freezing he invented a motor to test 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.920
 of freezing the development is 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.080
 became a true event and gave 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.809
 place at the birth of the brand new 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.600
 holland very soon others would arrive 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.370
 successes like the forage machinery that 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.370
 I would make it world famous 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.780
 it was just the beginning the embryo of a 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.520
 much larger inheritance than 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.800
 would complete with the incorporation of 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.930
 other great brands that would revolutionize 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.340
 the mechanization of agricultural work to 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.340
 throughout the 20th century 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.900
 Henry Ford was already a famous manufacturer 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.790
 of cars when he presented the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.220
 prototype of a gasoline tractor 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.980
 commercially launched ten years later 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.140
 under the fort mark are the equipment caused 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.940
 feeling for its low price to be 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.220
 produced in series and with a 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.160
 organization of work based on their 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.080
 automotive plants in parallel 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.780
 another side of the Atlantic the mechanic 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.420
 Belgian Leon Clyde began to manufacture 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.100
 threshing machines and then to build 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.940
 a plant in the city ​​of Seattle in 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.400
 belgium in italy fiat was launched to 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.620
 industrially produce model 700 2 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.600
 that he would debut with all the honors at 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.750
 win an international plowing contest 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.630

 1930 the senator giovanni acne the 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.920
 founder of the company is proposed 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.690
 modernize Italian agriculture and 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.850
 establishes a program of alliances with 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.070
 cooperatives that give a great boost to 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.320
 the production of both grains and 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.390
 tractors two decades later 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.160
 fiat is installed industrially in the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.440
 Argentina in which would be the first 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.000
 tractor plant in the country and where 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.590
 develop successful models 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.680
 that can still be found today 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.650
 working in many argentinian fields 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.469
 up to here the pioneers the brands and their 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.109
 bequests from then on begins 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:48.939
 a new era of integration of 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:51.310
 knowledge in 1964 new holland 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.930
 acquires majority stake is declared 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.730
 that was already one of the largest 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.439
 grain harvester factories 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.450
 Europe becoming a 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:01.480
 world specialist in harvest 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.250
 grains and fodder a few years later the 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.750
 brand ratifies its prestige with the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.840
 introduction of axial harvesters 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.519
 double rotor an exclusive concept that 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.260
 it lasts in your machines until the 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.920
 present 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.470
 in the 1980s fiat concretes the

 acquisition of brawn the French brand 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.879
 that a few years before had amazed the 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.010
 world of viticulture with the 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.200
 harvester a team that demonstrated 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.230
 that it was possible to mechanize the harvest of 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.049
 grape the machinery sector was still 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.599
 evolving at a dizzying pace and 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.659
 in that frame ford tractors joins new 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.060
 holland giving birth to ford new

 holland then the company would be 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.790
 acquired by fiat that shortly after 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:47.560
 would also incorporate keys and h

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.579
 in this way new holland happened to form 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.379
 part of the group's agricultural arm
