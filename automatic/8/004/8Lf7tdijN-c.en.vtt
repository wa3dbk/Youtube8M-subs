00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:10.309
 today is September 23 in the street plus 9 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:15.139
 degrees and i'm part of the bees 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:17.730
 here here here outside the sword with white paint 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:23.730
 in each spoon tried to mark 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:27.689
 several bees and see how fast 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:33.890
 but they will go deep that is how often they 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:37.360
 are changing now 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.360
 11 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.230
 about girls, I'll tag 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.860
 but it turns out that way 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:07.860
 Tears remain good for now 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:13.680
 the sword, and have a little stir 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:17.909
 more active than bees and before that sat 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.909
 practically without movement 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.009
 I would like to mark more bees 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:32.700
 extreme streets since they are the hardest 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.700
 go to the center 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:41.350
 it's not easy they started moving 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:50.350
 and even some kind of thick paint 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:54.100
 sticks ok ok enough 16 hours 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:58.390
 of the day I see in this street 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:02.970
 bee sword and on sits in the koran streets 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.970
 the bees are somehow quite active such 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.970
 thicken 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.819
 touching the bees they are so cute 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:27.340
 from where did the holy paint shift 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.730
 Here at this street I look bees so easily 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.550
 moves 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.750
 head creeps out from deep inside 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.340
 here forward that is not so tight 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.660
 sit but chela 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.660
 labeled with white here I have not seen it now 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.130
 that is, this and this 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.670
 pay attention see how they sit 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:09.890
 abdomen bees 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.890
 here outward head inward 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:31.680
 quite interesting in all the streets is 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.660
 location yet talked saw still 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.440
 one village 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:42.300
 here we have a white tag sitting here too 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.510
 on the edge here is some amount of bees so 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.640
 and 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:51.120
 hanging from the edge of the 7:00 pm weather 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:59.900
 so it was non-flying well, that's a bee like 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:59.900
 sat like that here and sits but this is white 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.620
 shut down and here she is 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.450
 here 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.959
 white dot too this remains here 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:23.980
 sit so I would say what's wrong and 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:25.160
 they change quickly but these are like 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.380
 were sitting 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:33.970
 friends outside and sit like this 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.970
 observation turned out
