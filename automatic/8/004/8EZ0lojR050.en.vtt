00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 for that 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:16.610
 if nobody answers great, it 's the 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.740
 second time I record this that's great 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.600
 but today it is asked that my name is called 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.340
 own style as you can see down there that is 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.080
 called by hand of a mission 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.570
 alex fashion you want I removed a weight to 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.429
 his enormous love and also a channel 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.740
 logically apply it is called my 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.689
 channel that I leave the link in the box 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.150
 of information and we started that I 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.130
 I roll up a lot and we do not have my three 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.490
 essentials are therefore I believe that 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.440
 some tights some black tights so well 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.980
 chubby because I hate that it looks to the ass 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.710
 You already know that they do not see each other later 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.170
 pants both jeans or very dark 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.040
 very clear is a cowboy so you can 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.410
 all life died 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.730
 and finally I would say that in me it is 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.730
 Dr. Martin is logically 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.940
 Well, I would say he 's a doctor, Martin 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.070
 so as not to repeat again 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.140
 black cardigan that uses a lot this 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.180
 this winter that is diamond and so the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.010
 cited and prepared great because 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.600
 example guayabos a blouse or a 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.550
 shirt or shirt that you want is 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.140
 teach because you do not think it's pretty and in 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.810
 Rather than wear a sweater because the tape 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.000
 the cardigan because you teach and it shelters 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.979
 not a barbarity but it 's fine 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.570
 gold or silver that I think I'm staying 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.390
 with silver I have come to the 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.690
 satiety so as not to repeat things 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.820
 earlier I will say that a jacket 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.259
 a mythical winter jacket of 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.660
 you are fat when you are 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.130
 well of cold of corner and that that like 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.320
 here in winter I die of cold 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.630
 Well, I need something that holds a lot 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.810
 I would never ever think not 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.930
 I would put a midi skirt but no matter what 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.020
 of these tight glued nor in shape 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.229
 triangle or zac a flight that is straight 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.770
 no, I will not wear it long, yes, but 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.210
 I gave myself so my icons are the truth 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.060
 is that I do not have any icon like that 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.690
 fashion and such that I noticed and who I 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.700
 basis because I do not have but there 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.540
 a model because as we are talking 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.049
 so fashionable 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.640
 I'm going to tell the face model that those who 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.500
 base is not that I notice her and the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.239
 have an icon for the way they dress 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.950
 I also like it a lot, it's cool 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.989
 I have a better icon because I 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.580
 It seems a very funny model I like 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.599
 his way of being because he is very 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.579
 extroverted and so crazy and is 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.110
 different from the mythical stereotype of 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.849
 model that we have I will not say 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.739
 higher because I have no idea how 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.010
 the truth is pronounced color that more me 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.709
 like to dress is black then the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.690
 black not equal everything black black 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.370
 set with the white for example but 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.260
 not to say the black that almost all the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.330
 Everyone says I'll say the dark blue 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.910
 dark or clarito I have 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.010
 a blue sweater that when I put it on 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.930
 I quite like how I feel 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.910
 favored and that I like that color 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.160
 color that I like the least to wear is 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.980
 Well, more than I do not like it if the color 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.690
 but I do not have anything of this color and 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.600
 I do not think I would wear it 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.920
 calls attention and is the orange and the 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.920
 always done I think it's that I do not 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.900
 favors much less is more or more is more 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.240
 because in this I am going to copy to maitana and 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.490
 I will say that less is more because a 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.130
 look or a more ornate absent with 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.010
 too many things too many accessories or 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.380
 Pollerias I think it ends up being vulgar and 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.000
 ugly and I think that an outfit like that pretty 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.920
 simple basic with some action 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.310
 what will give the touch 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.560
 Well, I think it looks very pretty 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.290
 very cool so you least expect to continue 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.150
 yes or no trends seems to me that 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.760
 all in all we follow trends 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.800
 or more or less we all follow something that is 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.510
 whether we want all the stores or not 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.340
 They have exactly the same or what 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.780
 is trending then something yes that 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.980
 we chop 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.090
 many times phone 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.090
 is last 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.290
 if nobody answers 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.070
 persist in the good mobile I would define 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.870
 my style as well whenever I 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.090
 ask this question or whenever 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.769
 they tell me this I say the same and that is that I 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.860
 I would not define my style in any way 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.570
 because more than anything I can not or I am 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.280
 I put whatever I want as I want and when 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.640
 want so I do not have a style 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.650
 defined I can put a very day of 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.290
 one way and another very day of the other 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.720
 I know if you understand me so I do not say and 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.340
 last question, dream you all know 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.620
 that my dreams go to thailand and travel 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.390
 by many places I know that it has not 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.040
 a lot to do with this is but it's my 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.020
 ballet dream is to leave me with my 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.060
 dreams and well this has been the tag 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.400
 I hope you liked that we have 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.590
 entertained a little bit and see you in the 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.590
