he's going to look at that which very

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.970 
he's going to look at that which very
simple<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.239> back<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.630> case<00:02:14.810> if<00:02:15.049> I<00:02:15.260> sure

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
simple so the back of the case if I sure

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.410

the bomb here we have one hundred forty
millimeter<00:03:39.079> fan<00:03:39.319> that<00:03:39.500> i've<00:03:39.620> installed<00:03:40.010> let

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
millimeter fan that i've installed let

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.550 
millimeter fan that i've installed let
you<00:03:40.700> just<00:03:40.849> clip<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.090> in<00:03:41.329> now<00:03:41.870> this<00:03:41.989> is<00:03:42.049> exhaust

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
you just clip it in now this is exhaust

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.240 
you just clip it in now this is exhaust
or<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:43.160> intake<00:03:43.880> for<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.150> case<00:03:44.959> some<00:03:45.680> here<00:03:46.099> we

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
or a intake for the case some here we

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.520 
or a intake for the case some here we
have<00:03:46.370> all<00:03:46.489> our<00:03:46.519> hard<00:03:47.180> drive<00:03:47.359> cages<00:03:47.599> picture

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
have all our hard drive cages picture

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.770 
have all our hard drive cages picture
nice<00:03:48.829> and<00:03:49.010> white<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:50.090> it's<00:03:50.209> like<00:03:50.299> why<00:03:50.329> black

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
nice and white so it's like why black

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.990 
nice and white so it's like why black
contrast<00:03:51.109> so<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:51.650> have<00:03:51.739> one<00:03:51.980> two<00:03:52.010> three<00:03:52.280> four

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
contrast so you have one two three four

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.569

bear in mind that squeeze a few cons out
of<00:05:20.290> the<00:05:20.350> case<00:05:20.470> because<00:05:20.680> I<00:05:20.770> couldn't<00:05:20.980> have<00:05:21.040> it

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
of the case because I couldn't have it

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.940 
of the case because I couldn't have it
all<00:05:21.310> bro<00:05:21.580> so<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.960> side<00:05:23.170> panels<00:05:23.500> are<00:05:23.590> extremely

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
all bro so the side panels are extremely

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.010 
all bro so the side panels are extremely
hard<00:05:24.070> to<00:05:24.190> actually<00:05:24.370> put<00:05:24.700> on<00:05:24.850> as<00:05:25.060> they<00:05:25.630> are<00:05:25.750> so

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
hard to actually put on as they are so

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.330 
hard to actually put on as they are so
many<00:05:26.260> parts<00:05:26.620> actually<00:05:26.770> a<00:05:26.920> line<00:05:27.070> up<00:05:27.190> with<00:05:27.310> each

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
many parts actually a line up with each

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.210 
many parts actually a line up with each
other<00:05:27.610> and<00:05:27.910> fit<00:05:28.900> all<00:05:29.050> together<00:05:29.230> it's<00:05:29.710> really

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
other and fit all together it's really

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.550 
other and fit all together it's really
hard<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.550> line<00:05:30.790> up<00:05:31.060> you<00:05:31.360> get<00:05:31.870> them<00:05:32.020> all<00:05:32.110> in<00:05:32.140> bar
