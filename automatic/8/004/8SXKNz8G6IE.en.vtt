i'm currently running crysis one as you
can<00:00:09.120> see<00:00:09.269> here<00:00:09.420> i'll<00:00:09.540> take<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> quick<00:00:09.960> look<00:00:10.110> at

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
can see here i'll take a quick look at

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.080 
can see here i'll take a quick look at
the<00:00:10.290> settings<00:00:10.650> i'm<00:00:11.250> planning<00:00:11.639> on<00:00:11.700> getting<00:00:11.880> a

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
the settings i'm planning on getting a

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.330 
the settings i'm planning on getting a
1080p<00:00:12.599> monitor<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.469> i<00:00:13.500> kind<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.920> wanted<00:00:14.160> to

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
1080p monitor so i kind of wanted to

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.740 
1080p monitor so i kind of wanted to
gauge<00:00:14.580> my<00:00:14.610> performance<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.330> little<00:00:15.480> bit<00:00:15.599> better

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
gauge my performance a little bit better

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.720 
gauge my performance a little bit better
and<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.650> figured<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.980> might<00:00:17.100> as<00:00:17.160> well<00:00:17.279> do<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> video

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
and I figured I might as well do a video

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.700 
and I figured I might as well do a video
for<00:00:18.000> anyone<00:00:18.330> else<00:00:18.480> who<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.900> looking<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.500> get<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
for anyone else who is looking to get a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.800 
for anyone else who is looking to get a
68<00:00:20.100> 70<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.430> know<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> kind<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.150> old<00:00:21.300> card<00:00:21.570> but

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
68 70 I know it's a kind of old card but

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.370 
68 70 I know it's a kind of old card but
hey<00:00:22.410> who<00:00:22.590> knows<00:00:23.330> so<00:00:24.330> without<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.810> card<00:00:25.050> i

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
hey who knows so without the card i

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.189 
hey who knows so without the card i
think<00:00:25.680> i<00:00:25.740> was<00:00:25.859> getting<00:00:26.130> mostly<00:00:27.000> around<00:00:27.300> 50<00:00:27.779> 60

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
think i was getting mostly around 50 60

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.769 
think i was getting mostly around 50 60
FPS<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.890> mean<00:00:29.189> without<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.640> without<00:00:30.300> recording

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
FPS I mean without the without recording

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.770 
FPS I mean without the without recording
and<00:00:31.019> getting<00:00:31.230> around<00:00:31.410> 50<00:00:31.710> 60<00:00:32.040> FPS<00:00:32.510> in<00:00:33.510> some

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
and getting around 50 60 FPS in some

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.569 
and getting around 50 60 FPS in some
intense<00:00:34.079> firefights<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:35.370> down<00:00:35.520> to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
intense firefights it can go down to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.040 
intense firefights it can go down to
high<00:00:36.149> 30s<00:00:36.590> 3938<00:00:37.590> around<00:00:37.920> there<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.100> think

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
high 30s 3938 around there I think

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.130 
high 30s 3938 around there I think
reporting<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.260> mostly<00:00:40.649> hover<00:00:41.070> around<00:00:41.420> 40s<00:00:42.420> 50s

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
reporting I mostly hover around 40s 50s

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.369 
reporting I mostly hover around 40s 50s
so<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.340> also<00:00:44.520> dropped<00:00:44.940> around<00:00:45.120> 30<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
so I can also dropped around 30 in the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.850 
so I can also dropped around 30 in the
time<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.590> was<00:00:46.800> playing<00:00:47.070> with<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:48.680> testing<00:00:49.680> on

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
time I was playing with this testing on

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.729 
time I was playing with this testing on
crisis<00:00:50.250> one<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.730> didn't<00:00:51.629> drop<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> low<00:00:52.140> 30<00:00:52.410> even

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
crisis one I didn't drop a low 30 even

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.410 
crisis one I didn't drop a low 30 even
while<00:00:52.920> recording<00:00:53.190> no<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.789> think<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.120> was<00:00:54.210> always

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
while recording no I think I was always

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.229 
while recording no I think I was always
about<00:00:54.750> 35<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:56.100> may<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.280> been<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.520> instance

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
about 35 there may have been a instance

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.299 
about 35 there may have been a instance
or<00:00:57.360> two<00:00:57.390> where<00:00:57.719> i<00:00:57.750> dropped<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.440> 30<00:00:59.070> while

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
or two where i dropped you with 30 while

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.680 
or two where i dropped you with 30 while
recording<00:00:59.609> but<00:00:59.850> it's<00:00:59.969> always<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.570> always

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
recording but it's always it's always

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.770 
recording but it's always it's always
been<00:01:00.930> playable<00:01:01.280> i'm<00:01:02.280> only<00:01:02.430> running<00:01:02.609> 2<00:01:02.879> x<00:01:03.059> AAA<00:01:03.570> I

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
been playable i'm only running 2 x AAA I

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.649 
been playable i'm only running 2 x AAA I
think<00:01:04.580> definitely<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:06.030> don't<00:01:06.330> really<00:01:06.510> notice

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
think definitely I don't really notice

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.940 
think definitely I don't really notice
it<00:01:06.930> when<00:01:07.439> I'm<00:01:07.590> playing<00:01:07.770> games<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:09.950> don't

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
it when I'm playing games so don't

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.950 
it when I'm playing games so don't
really<00:01:11.189> care<00:01:11.369> about<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.610> otherwise<00:01:12.600> it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
really care about that otherwise it

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.660 
really care about that otherwise it
looks<00:01:13.200> pretty<00:01:13.710> good<00:01:13.860> i<00:01:14.040> know<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
looks pretty good i know this is now a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.870 
looks pretty good i know this is now a
pretty<00:01:14.970> old<00:01:15.150> game<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:15.979> just<00:01:16.979> figured<00:01:17.610> someone

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
pretty old game but just figured someone

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.820 
pretty old game but just figured someone
else<00:01:18.090> might<00:01:18.210> find<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.570> useful<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.259> I've

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
else might find this useful this I've

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.990 
else might find this useful this I've
been<00:01:20.009> looking<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.430> something<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000

much<00:01:49.550> footage<00:01:50.270> from<00:01:50.510> my<00:01:50.630> hard<00:01:50.810> drive<00:01:50.990> to

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
think the file size is coming out to

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.770 
think the file size is coming out to
