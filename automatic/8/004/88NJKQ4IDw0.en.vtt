 Brazil then neither put Brazil 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.710
 Brazilians do not need to, I guess. 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.659
 that is only put the light bill if it was 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.490

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.289

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.119
 someone may answer because 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.740
 many in October I only have mailbox 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.020
 then they should not have this 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.369
 experience how to do it 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.800
 I was thinking of opening some 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.810
 some little letters which for us you 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.360

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.980

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.780
 commented that consider whether you think 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.810
 that cool this kind of thing I 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.750
 wait join because I think as 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.720
 I 'm the girl now and it's not going to be the one. 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.510
 So much, then, to put it together. 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.120
 leave the time and I wonder if you 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.340
 want to vote for videos I open in 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.010
 books that you send but I think 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.870
 the parts that are too long I go 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.700
 Let me read it alone because I think it's 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.460
 one thing but what's worth is yours to 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.330
 me what to do for a video that is 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.560
 you show and that's it I think I 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.720
 warning is given 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.540
 You're in katniss for honda's mother. 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.860
 prey address that will reach me and 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.610
 I think I have nothing to 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.050
 complements 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.600
 but then I hope you liked it 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:00.400
 of the good time result as well as 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.940
 stable without finding what went well until the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.940
 next
