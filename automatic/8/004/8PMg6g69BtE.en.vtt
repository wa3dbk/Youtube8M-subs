I'm<00:00:17.340> hot<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.949> yeah<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.070> that's<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.279> large<00:00:20.490> one

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
I'm hot and yeah so that's a large one

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.980 
I'm hot and yeah so that's a large one
so<00:00:20.939> actually<00:00:21.150> if<00:00:21.449> you're<00:00:21.570> making<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.810> for<00:00:21.900> a

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
so actually if you're making it for a

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.179 
so actually if you're making it for a
smaller<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.470> could<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.920> for<00:00:23.070> two

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
smaller one you could do this for two

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.210 
smaller one you could do this for two
pounds<00:00:23.390> so<00:00:24.500> you<00:00:25.500> can<00:00:25.619> see<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.010> what<00:00:26.130> it

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
pounds so you can see this is what it

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.040 
pounds so you can see this is what it
looks<00:00:26.400> like<00:00:26.490> when<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:26.939> all<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.480> I'll

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
looks like when it's all on and I'll

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.080 
looks like when it's all on and I'll
just<00:00:28.230> show<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.380> quickly<00:00:28.500> how<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.920> made<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.340> so

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
just show you quickly how I made this so

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.540 
just show you quickly how I made this so
it's<00:00:30.810> made<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.320> two<00:00:31.710> three<00:00:31.890> pollens<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.399> can

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
it's made with two three pollens you can

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.569 
it's made with two three pollens you can
see<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.540> they've<00:00:33.690> been<00:00:33.870> connected<00:00:34.579> so

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
see here that they've been connected so

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.690 
see here that they've been connected so
they<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.090> these<00:00:36.300> eyelets<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.140> them<00:00:37.320> already

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
they have these eyelets on them already

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:46.400 
they have these eyelets on them already
there's<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:40.820> two<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:43.079> then<00:00:45.170> because<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.289> was

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
there's one two and then because it was

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.369 
there's one two and then because it was
kind<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.710> goofy<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:48.210> could<00:00:48.989> probably<00:00:49.170> put

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
kind of goofy and I could probably put

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.979 
kind of goofy and I could probably put
another<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.280> am<00:00:51.090> attached<00:00:51.660> some<00:00:51.840> more

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
another one here I am attached some more

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.459 
another one here I am attached some more
cable<00:00:52.320> ties<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:53.059> all<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.629> eyelets<00:00:55.320> are

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
cable ties so it all the eyelets are

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.930 
cable ties so it all the eyelets are
attached<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.399> cable<00:00:56.760> ties

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
attached you can see with cable ties

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.869 
attached you can see with cable ties
cable<00:00:57.480> ties<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.129> I<00:00:59.129> suppose<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.609> should<00:00:59.760> add

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
cable ties and I suppose I should add

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.660 
cable ties and I suppose I should add
that<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:03.530> lot<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.589> people<00:01:04.890> would<00:01:05.100> maybe<00:01:05.430> you

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
that a lot of people would maybe you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.950 
that a lot of people would maybe you
don't<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.119> also<00:01:06.240> get<00:01:06.450> these<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> pen

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
don't you can also get these in the pen

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.050 
don't you can also get these in the pen
shop<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:08.130> would<00:01:08.280> make<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> whole<00:01:08.790> touch

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
shop so that would make the whole touch

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.730 
shop so that would make the whole touch
four<00:01:09.299> pound<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.290> kilo<00:01:10.530> tear

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
four pound so this is just one kilo tear

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.920 
four pound so this is just one kilo tear
looks<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.490> them<00:01:11.790> or<00:01:12.150> zip<00:01:12.689> ties

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
looks like you can get them or zip ties

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.420 
looks like you can get them or zip ties
whatever<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.350> would<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.650> call<00:01:13.799> them<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
whatever you would like to call them and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.429 
whatever you would like to call them and
get<00:01:14.580> them<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.880> most<00:01:15.090> cheap<00:01:15.390> shops<00:01:15.689> or<00:01:16.020> an

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
get them in most cheap shops or an

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.980 
get them in most cheap shops or an
electrical<00:01:17.070> stores<00:01:17.369> home<00:01:17.820> home<00:01:18.600> kind<00:01:18.840> of

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
electrical stores home home kind of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.910 
electrical stores home home kind of
stores<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.610> that's<00:01:21.030> why<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> did<00:01:21.360> there<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
stores so that's why I did there and the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.289 
stores so that's why I did there and the
thing<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.400> need<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.150> you're

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
thing you need to know is if you're

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.570 
thing you need to know is if you're
putting<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.750> extra<00:01:25.380> ones<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.130> did<00:01:26.369> whether

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
putting on extra ones like I did whether

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.340 
putting on extra ones like I did whether
it's<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:26.820> an<00:01:26.939> eyelet<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.990> put<00:01:28.170> them<00:01:28.320> through

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
it's not an eyelet to put them through

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.590 
it's not an eyelet to put them through
make<00:01:29.340> sure<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.820> make<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.210> slit<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
make sure that you make the slit in the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.080 
make sure that you make the slit in the
tarpaulin<00:01:31.049> horizontally<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.820> when<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
tarpaulin horizontally so that when you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.760 
tarpaulin horizontally so that when you
put<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.360> through<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:34.020> tight<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.560> it's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
put it through and then tight in it it's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
put it through and then tight in it it's
not<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.100> make<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.250> hole<00:01:35.400> any<00:01:35.549> bigger

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
not going to make the hole any bigger

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.789 
not going to make the hole any bigger
because<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.329> imagine<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.200> put<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.500> in

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
because if you imagine if you put it in

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.569 
because if you imagine if you put it in
length<00:01:38.579> ways<00:01:38.850> that's<00:01:39.360> ways<00:01:42.500> vertically<00:01:43.579> then

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
length ways that's ways vertically then

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.249 
length ways that's ways vertically then
the<00:01:44.970> hole<00:01:45.149> would<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:45.899> stretched

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the hole would just be like stretched

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.780 
the hole would just be like stretched
and<00:01:46.500> made<00:01:46.590> bigger<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.310> that's<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.579> first

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and made bigger so that's the first

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.810 
and made bigger so that's the first
thing<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.119> did<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.530> then<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.610> just<00:01:50.610> pulled

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
thing that I did and then I just pulled

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.160 
thing that I did and then I just pulled
it<00:01:50.939> down<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.240> lengths<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.720> make<00:01:51.869> sure<00:01:52.020> it's

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
it down to lengths you make sure it's

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.560 
it down to lengths you make sure it's
down<00:01:52.409> as<00:01:52.979> long<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.460> want<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.119> want

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
down as long as you want it I just want

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.950 
down as long as you want it I just want
it<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.020> bottom<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> doors<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.960> this

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it to the bottom of the doors and this

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.120 
it to the bottom of the doors and this
is<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> cover<00:01:58.530> I've<00:01:58.649> got<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> bottom

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
is just a cover I've got on the bottom

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.130 
is just a cover I've got on the bottom
to<00:01:59.369> catch<00:01:59.520> any<00:02:00.270> sawdust<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:00.960> take<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
to catch any sawdust I just take that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.539 
to catch any sawdust I just take that
onto<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.619> bottom<00:02:01.890> I'll<00:02:02.040> show<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.340> when<00:02:02.460> I'm

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
onto the bottom I'll show you when I'm

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.940 
onto the bottom I'll show you when I'm
finished<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:04.140> then<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.469> next<00:02:04.740> thing<00:02:04.890> you

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
finished and then the next thing you

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.639 
finished and then the next thing you
need<00:02:05.219> or<00:02:05.490> bungee<00:02:06.299> ties<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.110> these<00:02:07.229> bungee

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
need or bungee ties so these bungee

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.650 
need or bungee ties so these bungee
ropes<00:02:08.009> are<00:02:08.220> also<00:02:08.399> again<00:02:08.940> just<00:02:09.149> from<00:02:09.450> pound

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
ropes are also again just from pound

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.010 
ropes are also again just from pound
world<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:11.280> they<00:02:11.730> come<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.090> pack<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.300> six

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
world and they come in a pack of six

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.180 
world and they come in a pack of six
so<00:02:13.110> these<00:02:13.230> are<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.470> blue<00:02:13.650> ones<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.920> get<00:02:13.980> to

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
so these are the blue ones you get to

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.760 
so these are the blue ones you get to
blue<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.760> red<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.420> yellow<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.960> those<00:02:16.680> are

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
blue to red and to yellow and those are

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.260 
blue to red and to yellow and those are
the<00:02:16.830> blue<00:02:16.980> ones<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.400> here<00:02:17.940> are<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.120> yellow

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
the blue ones and here are the yellow

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.090 
the blue ones and here are the yellow
ones<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.840> blue<00:02:19.080> ones<00:02:19.230> are<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.410> longest<00:02:19.830> ones

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
ones the blue ones are the longest ones

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.610 
ones the blue ones are the longest ones
then<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> yellow<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:21.000> then<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:22.230> red<00:02:22.380> ones

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
then the yellow and then the red ones

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.320 
then the yellow and then the red ones
are<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.830> shortest<00:02:23.130> ones<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:23.970> up<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.120> you

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
are the shortest ones so it's up to you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.180 
are the shortest ones so it's up to you
what<00:02:24.600> size<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> hutch<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.410> have<00:02:25.710> which<00:02:25.980> ones

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
what size a hutch you have which ones

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.700 
what size a hutch you have which ones
you<00:02:26.340> would<00:02:26.520> prefer<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.940> use<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.810> as<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.620> can

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
you would prefer to use so as you can

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.170 
you would prefer to use so as you can
see<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.070> put<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.340> through<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.580> Iowa<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.090> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
see I put it through the Iowa and the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.550 
see I put it through the Iowa and the
hutch<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.480> about<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.930> hutch<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.140> cover<00:02:31.440> is

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
hutch is about the hutch the cover is

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.980 
hutch is about the hutch the cover is
about<00:02:31.620> halfway<00:02:31.890> down<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.340> hutch<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.990> that's

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
about halfway down the hutch and that's

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.080 
about halfway down the hutch and that's
basically<00:02:34.410> as<00:02:34.680> long<00:02:34.980> as<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.400> need<00:02:35.670> halfway

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
basically as long as you need halfway

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.210 
basically as long as you need halfway
down<00:02:36.390> or<00:02:36.720> not<00:02:37.020> even<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.380> far<00:02:37.560> down<00:02:37.740> because<00:02:38.100> I

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
down or not even that far down because I

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.070 
down or not even that far down because I
think<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:39.060> me<00:02:39.330> most<00:02:39.510> people<00:02:39.840> would<00:02:39.960> have

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
think like me most people would have

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.330 
think like me most people would have
their<00:02:40.200> hutch<00:02:40.350> against<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.710> wall<00:02:40.920> because<00:02:41.160> it

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
their hutch against a wall because it

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.130 
their hutch against a wall because it
seems<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.180> bit<00:02:42.300> pointless<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.750> have<00:02:42.840> nothing

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
seems a bit pointless to have nothing

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.540 
seems a bit pointless to have nothing
behind<00:02:43.260> your<00:02:43.500> hutch<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.920> might<00:02:44.100> do<00:02:44.250> so

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
behind your hutch but you might do so

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.730 
behind your hutch but you might do so
that<00:02:44.970> makes<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.270> more<00:02:45.360> secure<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.560> then<00:02:46.680> as

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
that makes it more secure and then as

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.930 
that makes it more secure and then as
you<00:02:46.800> can<00:02:46.890> see<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.130> comes<00:02:47.310> all<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.550> way<00:02:47.580> down<00:02:47.790> to

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
you can see it comes all the way down to

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.720 
you can see it comes all the way down to
the<00:02:48.030> bottom<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.860> you<00:02:49.860> put<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.190> underneath<00:02:50.550> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
the bottom and you put it underneath the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.930 
the bottom and you put it underneath the
leg<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.080> secures<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.560> down<00:02:52.710> so<00:02:53.400> I've<00:02:53.790> done

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
leg so that secures it down so I've done

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.720 
leg so that secures it down so I've done
that<00:02:54.000> at<00:02:54.270> both<00:02:54.420> sides<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.770> then<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.460> kind

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
that at both sides and and then I kind

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.340 
that at both sides and and then I kind
of<00:02:56.790> realized<00:02:56.940> because<00:02:57.600> it's<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.840> windy<00:02:58.140> day<00:02:58.170> you

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
of realized because it's a windy day you

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.840 
of realized because it's a windy day you
can<00:02:58.530> see<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.860> tarpaulin<00:02:59.220> was<00:02:59.550> blowing

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
can see that the tarpaulin was blowing

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.340 
can see that the tarpaulin was blowing
up<00:02:59.940> a<00:03:00.090> little<00:03:00.240> bit<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:01.050> again<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.620> went<00:03:02.070> along

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
up a little bit so again I went along

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.030 
up a little bit so again I went along
and<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:05.670> secured<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.510> bottom<00:03:06.840> here<00:03:07.110> with<00:03:07.860> some

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
and I secured the bottom here with some

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.070 
and I secured the bottom here with some
shimmer<00:03:08.220> curtain<00:03:08.640> hooks<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.060> these<00:03:09.780> are<00:03:09.930> just

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
shimmer curtain hooks and these are just

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.740 
shimmer curtain hooks and these are just
put<00:03:10.350> through<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.120> there<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.390> then<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.630> can

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
put through and there and then you can

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.210 
put through and there and then you can
just<00:03:12.840> gauge<00:03:13.590> obviously<00:03:15.530> there<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:17.190> just

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
just gauge obviously there it just

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.330 
just gauge obviously there it just
easily<00:03:17.610> flips<00:03:17.970> on<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.710> then<00:03:19.710> that'll<00:03:20.010> stop<00:03:20.220> it

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
easily flips on and then that'll stop it

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.270 
easily flips on and then that'll stop it
blowing<00:03:20.520> up<00:03:21.410> again<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.650> might<00:03:22.740> not<00:03:22.800> even<00:03:22.950> want

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
blowing up again you might not even want

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.550 
blowing up again you might not even want
to<00:03:23.340> cover<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.730> bottom<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.180> run<00:03:24.410> it's<00:03:25.410> up

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
to cover the bottom of the run it's up
