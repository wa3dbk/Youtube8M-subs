suffering from a b12 deficiency it's
something<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.920> when<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.070> was<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.369> medical

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
something that when I was in medical

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.609 
something that when I was in medical
school<00:00:17.760> we<00:00:18.180> were<00:00:18.300> taught<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.810> biochemistry

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
school we were taught and biochemistry

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.769 
school we were taught and biochemistry
about<00:00:19.920> b12<00:00:20.310> deficiency<00:00:20.970> being<00:00:21.240> an<00:00:21.359> issue<00:00:21.539> with

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
about b12 deficiency being an issue with

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.109 
about b12 deficiency being an issue with
intrinsic<00:00:22.320> factor<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:23.279> affecting<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.910> gut

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
intrinsic factor just affecting the gut

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.240 
intrinsic factor just affecting the gut
just<00:00:24.390> affecting<00:00:24.960> your<00:00:25.170> red<00:00:25.529> blood<00:00:25.710> cells<00:00:26.070> so

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
just affecting your red blood cells so

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.150 
just affecting your red blood cells so
you<00:00:26.279> would<00:00:26.460> have<00:00:26.609> pernicious<00:00:27.180> anemia<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:28.560> is

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
you would have pernicious anemia it is

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160 
you would have pernicious anemia it is
so<00:00:29.609> much<00:00:29.789> more<00:00:30.060> important<00:00:30.420> than<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.900> so

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
so much more important than that and so

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.780 
so much more important than that and so
much<00:00:31.320> bigger<00:00:31.619> than<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.160> didn't<00:00:32.489> realize

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
much bigger than that I didn't realize

was<00:00:56.070> looking<00:00:56.370> fairly<00:00:56.579> hopeless<00:00:57.829> just<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
was looking fairly hopeless just on a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310 
was looking fairly hopeless just on a
whim<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.789> thought<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.600> let's<00:01:00.899> look<00:01:01.079> for

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
whim I thought you know let's look for

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.840 
whim I thought you know let's look for
nutritional<00:01:01.829> deficiency<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
nutritional deficiency and we have a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.789 
nutritional deficiency and we have a
test<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.719> when<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.409> look<00:01:04.559> at<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
test we can do when we look at the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.740 
test we can do when we look at the
actual<00:01:05.129> nutrients<00:01:05.729> inside<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.420> white<00:01:06.570> blood

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
actual nutrients inside the white blood

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.990 
actual nutrients inside the white blood
cells<00:01:07.220> it's<00:01:08.220> done<00:01:08.400> by<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> company<00:01:08.820> called

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
cells it's done by a company called

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.990 
cells it's done by a company called
spectra<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.860> came<00:01:10.860> back<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.310> virtually<00:01:11.790> no

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
spectra so came back with virtually no

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.750 
spectra so came back with virtually no
b12<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:13.049> put<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.409> little<00:01:13.560> baby<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.979> b12<00:01:14.490> shots

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
b12 we put that little baby on b12 shots

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.940 
b12 we put that little baby on b12 shots
and<00:01:14.970> within<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.270> week<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.960> eyes<00:01:16.170> were<00:01:16.409> focusing

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and within a week the eyes were focusing

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.760 
and within a week the eyes were focusing
the<00:01:17.549> tone<00:01:17.850> was<00:01:18.030> returning<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.110> seizures<00:01:19.530> had

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the tone was returning the seizures had

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.100 
the tone was returning the seizures had
stopped<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.340> basically<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.299> had<00:01:21.509> development

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
stopped and basically we had development

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.100 
stopped and basically we had development

unfortunately<00:02:28.650> what<00:02:28.800> I'm<00:02:28.920> finding<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.459> is

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
unfortunately what I'm finding this is

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.490 
unfortunately what I'm finding this is
true<00:02:29.819> of<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.180> many<00:02:30.300> labs<00:02:30.599> it's<00:02:30.870> very<00:02:31.140> true<00:02:31.380> of

borderline you're probably way

folks you're not methylating you're not

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.900 
folks you're not methylating you're not
making<00:03:22.310> neurotransmitters<00:03:23.310> properly<00:03:23.760> you're

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
making neurotransmitters properly you're

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.490 
making neurotransmitters properly you're
not<00:03:23.940> making<00:03:24.389> proteins<00:03:24.900> properly<00:03:25.350> you're<00:03:25.470> not

not making proteins properly you're not

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.530 
not making proteins properly you're not
reading<00:03:25.859> your<00:03:26.069> genetic<00:03:26.489> code<00:03:26.519> properly<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.389> is

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
reading your genetic code properly it is

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.410 
reading your genetic code properly it is
that<00:03:27.810> important<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.459> is<00:03:29.639> a<00:03:29.670> very<00:03:30.120> key

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
that important so this is a very key

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.599 
that important so this is a very key
nutrient<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.709> might<00:03:31.920> say<00:03:32.190> well<00:03:32.310> where<00:03:32.489> do

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
nutrient and you might say well where do

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.319 
nutrient and you might say well where do
we<00:03:32.730> get<00:03:33.060> b12<00:03:33.989> anyway<00:03:34.609> some<00:03:35.609> of<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.940> good

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
we get b12 anyway some of the good

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.660 
we get b12 anyway some of the good
bacteria<00:03:36.600> in<00:03:36.959> your<00:03:37.109> gut<00:03:37.170> can<00:03:37.650> make<00:03:37.829> some<00:03:38.069> b12

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
bacteria in your gut can make some b12

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.670 
bacteria in your gut can make some b12
so<00:03:38.790> taking<00:03:39.090> probiotics<00:03:39.299> is<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.810> good<00:03:40.019> thing<00:03:40.260> but

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
so taking probiotics is a good thing but

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.470 
so taking probiotics is a good thing but
this<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:41.190> basically<00:03:41.549> one<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.060> those<00:03:42.209> vitamins

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
this is basically one of those vitamins

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.440 
this is basically one of those vitamins
plants<00:03:43.200> don't<00:03:43.440> make<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.829> they<00:03:44.549> don't<00:03:44.760> need<00:03:45.060> it

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
plants don't make it they don't need it

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.410 
plants don't make it they don't need it
only<00:03:46.019> animals<00:03:46.470> do<00:03:46.650> so<00:03:47.310> if<00:03:47.430> you're<00:03:47.579> vegetarian

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
only animals do so if you're vegetarian

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.470 
only animals do so if you're vegetarian
you<00:03:48.780> are<00:03:48.930> probably<00:03:49.319> b12<00:03:50.040> deficient<00:03:50.639> you<00:03:50.790> need

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
you are probably b12 deficient you need

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.599 
you are probably b12 deficient you need
to<00:03:51.690> get<00:03:51.900> your<00:03:52.079> b12<00:03:52.410> typically<00:03:53.069> from<00:03:53.280> fish

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
to get your b12 typically from fish
