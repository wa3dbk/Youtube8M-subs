uncover<00:03:16.549> this<00:03:16.880> we've<00:03:17.390> had<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.690> do<00:03:17.870> this

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
uncover this we've had to do this

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.410 
uncover this we've had to do this
there's<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.299> nut<00:03:21.260> on<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.769> knob<00:03:22.130> itself<00:03:22.610> see

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
there's a nut on this knob itself see

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.590 
there's a nut on this knob itself see
that<00:03:24.400> that's<00:03:25.400> just<00:03:25.519> easily<00:03:25.910> coming<00:03:26.269> off<00:03:26.390> like

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
that that's just easily coming off like

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.600 
that that's just easily coming off like
that<00:03:26.840> what's<00:03:27.200> people<00:03:29.560> basically<00:03:30.560> this<00:03:31.040> never

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
that what's people basically this never

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.860 
that what's people basically this never

I<00:03:38.280> say<00:03:39.280> this<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:40.690> right<00:03:40.930> there<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:43.239> we<00:03:43.390> got<00:03:43.510> to

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
I say this that right there so we got to

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:49.530 
I say this that right there so we got to
expose<00:03:46.560> because<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.709> magnet<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.849> speaker
