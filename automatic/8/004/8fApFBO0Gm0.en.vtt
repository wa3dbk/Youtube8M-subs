couldn't find anything that I liked so I

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.010 
couldn't find anything that I liked so I
used<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:35.100> one<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:36.000> part<00:00:36.360> because<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
used this one in part because the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.200 
used this one in part because the
lighting<00:00:37.170> well<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.010> liked<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.610> writing<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
lighting well I liked the writing of it

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.900 
lighting well I liked the writing of it
and<00:00:39.600> also<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.590> minimalistic<00:00:41.219> look<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
and also the minimalistic look of the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.680 
and also the minimalistic look of the
background<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:43.290> ended<00:00:43.530> up<00:00:43.649> using<00:00:43.829> this

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
background and I ended up using this

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.020 
background and I ended up using this
background<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:45.989> as<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.260> say<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> don't<00:00:46.559> really

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
background but as I say I don't really

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.560 
background but as I say I don't really
like<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:49.050> don't<00:00:49.230> really<00:00:49.350> match

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
like this they don't really match

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.090 
like this they don't really match

really simple masking and in fact it's a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.710 
really simple masking and in fact it's a
technique<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.430> used<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.880> other<00:01:06.000> tutorials

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
contests and well let's go back to

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.420 
contests and well let's go back to
photoshop<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.870> start<00:03:05.170> with<00:03:05.350> this<00:03:05.560> well

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
photoshop and start with this well

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.890 
photoshop and start with this well
actually<00:03:06.580> I<00:03:06.820> have<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.090> go<00:03:07.209> back<00:03:07.420> here<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:07.720> open

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
actually I have to go back here and open

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.560 
actually I have to go back here and open
the<00:03:08.440> background<00:03:08.830> image<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:10.090> will<00:03:10.239> lose<00:03:10.390> all

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
the background image you will lose all

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.039 
the background image you will lose all
the<00:03:10.720> texture<00:03:11.110> when<00:03:11.320> you<00:03:11.470> start<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:12.010> paint

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
the texture when you start to paint

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.720 
the texture when you start to paint
several<00:03:14.049> times<00:03:14.260> over<00:03:14.440> over<00:03:14.920> this<00:03:15.100> over<00:03:15.519> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
several times over over this over the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.979 
several times over over this over the
area<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.209> this<00:03:16.420> is<00:03:18.360> this<00:03:19.360> is<00:03:19.480> how<00:03:19.630> our

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
area so this is this is how our

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.390 
area so this is this is how our
background<00:03:20.530> looks<00:03:20.769> after<00:03:21.690> deleting<00:03:22.690> that

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
background looks after deleting that

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.479 
background looks after deleting that
cable<00:03:24.400> there<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:24.790> let's<00:03:25.290> move<00:03:26.290> on<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.709> add<00:03:27.100> our

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
cable there so let's move on and add our

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.900 
cable there so let's move on and add our
model<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:29.080> let's<00:03:29.320> go<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.530> our<00:03:29.920> stock<00:03:30.459> folder

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
model so let's go to our stock folder

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.470 
model so let's go to our stock folder
and<00:03:31.120> open<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:33.040> image<00:03:33.310> of<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.850> model<00:03:34.180> in<00:03:34.299> fact

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
and open the image of the model in fact

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.949 
and open the image of the model in fact
I'll<00:03:34.630> open<00:03:34.900> both<00:03:35.230> images<00:03:35.769> I<00:03:35.980> have<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:37.660> woman

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
I'll open both images I have the woman

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.870 
I'll open both images I have the woman
already<00:03:38.290> extracted<00:03:39.040> from<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.459> background

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
already extracted from the background

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.580 
already extracted from the background
this<00:03:40.239> is<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.450> extracted<00:03:40.989> version<00:03:41.320> and<00:03:41.470> this

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
this is the extracted version and this

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.820 
this is the extracted version and this
is<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.799> original<00:03:42.750> well<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:43.930> use<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.350> pen<00:03:44.560> tool

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
is the original well I use the pen tool

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.090 
is the original well I use the pen tool
as<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.220> always<00:03:45.370> do<00:03:46.320> but<00:03:47.320> you<00:03:47.410> can<00:03:47.560> use<00:03:47.680> other

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
as I always do but you can use other

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.550 
as I always do but you can use other
techniques<00:03:48.600> this<00:03:49.600> was<00:03:49.840> shot<00:03:50.049> over<00:03:50.380> white

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
techniques this was shot over white

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.759 
techniques this was shot over white
background<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:52.269> can<00:03:52.750> use<00:03:52.959> several<00:03:53.440> other

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
background so you can use several other

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.509 
background so you can use several other
techniques<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:55.150> can<00:03:55.299> use<00:03:56.100> selective<00:03:57.100> colors

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
techniques you can use selective colors

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.729 
techniques you can use selective colors
I<00:03:57.959> don't<00:03:58.959> really<00:03:59.140> like<00:03:59.320> to<00:03:59.440> use<00:03:59.560> this

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
I don't really like to use this

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.590 
I don't really like to use this
techniques<00:04:00.220> can<00:04:00.940> also<00:04:01.030> use<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.450> quick

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
techniques can also use the quick

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.160 
techniques can also use the quick
selection<00:04:02.350> tool<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.769> then<00:04:02.980> use<00:04:03.430> other<00:04:04.170> ways

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
selection tool and then use other ways

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.699 
selection tool and then use other ways
of<00:04:05.380> adjusting<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.980> selection<00:04:06.640> you<00:04:06.940> can<00:04:07.090> use

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
of adjusting the selection you can use

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.259 
of adjusting the selection you can use
calculations<00:04:08.709> let<00:04:09.370> me<00:04:09.519> show<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:09.760> a<00:04:09.850> quick<00:04:10.060> way

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
calculations let me show you a quick way

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.880 
calculations let me show you a quick way
of<00:04:10.390> using<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.750> calculation<00:04:11.350> so<00:04:11.530> what<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.739> do

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
of using the calculation so what you do

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.340 
of using the calculation so what you do
is<00:04:12.070> go<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.520> channels<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:13.870> can<00:04:14.080> instantly

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
is go to the channels you can instantly

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.539 
is go to the channels you can instantly
separate<00:04:17.350> her<00:04:17.560> from<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.919> background<00:04:18.100> if<00:04:18.400> I

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
separate her from the background if I

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.789 
separate her from the background if I
uncheck<00:04:19.180> invert<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:19.989> can<00:04:20.109> see<00:04:20.229> what<00:04:20.380> happens

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
uncheck invert you can see what happens

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.600 
uncheck invert you can see what happens
or<00:04:21.009> you<00:04:21.130> can<00:04:21.310> I<00:04:21.430> can<00:04:21.639> invert<00:04:22.949> the<00:04:23.949> channel<00:04:24.310> here

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
or you can I can invert the channel here

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.670 
or you can I can invert the channel here
and<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:24.910> get<00:04:25.150> this<00:04:25.780> effect<00:04:26.139> but<00:04:26.320> I<00:04:26.350> think<00:04:26.590> this

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
and I get this effect but I think this

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.790 
and I get this effect but I think this
one<00:04:26.889> was<00:04:27.039> even<00:04:27.190> better<00:04:28.229> this<00:04:29.229> part<00:04:29.530> here<00:04:29.770> of

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
one was even better this part here of

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.230 
one was even better this part here of
the<00:04:29.919> boots<00:04:30.190> but<00:04:30.430> anyways<00:04:30.759> and<00:04:30.970> once<00:04:31.120> you're

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
the boots but anyways and once you're

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.640

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
like this press ctrl command I to invert

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.279 
like this press ctrl command I to invert
it<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:35.110> then<00:04:35.860> press<00:04:36.099> ctrl<00:04:36.580> or<00:04:36.789> command<00:04:37.229> on<00:04:38.229> a

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
can see how it changes and you will

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.730 
can see how it changes and you will
select<00:04:42.729> the<00:04:42.940> contours<00:04:43.539> of<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.810> everything

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
select the contours of the everything

select the contours of the everything
that<00:04:44.889> is<00:04:45.099> black<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:45.520> white<00:04:47.340> you<00:04:48.340> can<00:04:48.460> use<00:04:48.580> any

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
that is black and white you can use any

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:49.950 
that is black and white you can use any
technique<00:04:49.030> that<00:04:49.180> you<00:04:49.270> want<00:04:49.509> but<00:04:49.660> leave<00:04:49.930> some

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
technique that you want but leave some

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.740 
technique that you want but leave some
space<00:04:50.770> like<00:04:51.009> that<00:04:51.039> around<00:04:51.789> here<00:04:52.150> and<00:04:52.389> you<00:04:52.599> can

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
space like that around here and you can

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.779 
space like that around here and you can
get<00:04:52.990> rid<00:04:53.169> of<00:04:53.199> that<00:04:53.380> part<00:04:53.590> there<00:04:53.830> but<00:04:54.009> leave<00:04:54.639> the

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
get rid of that part there but leave the

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.999 
get rid of that part there but leave the
hair<00:04:55.000> like<00:04:55.300> this<00:04:55.509> because<00:04:56.440> we<00:04:56.560> will<00:04:56.680> use<00:04:56.800> a<00:04:56.830> lot

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
hair like this because we will use a lot

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.140 
hair like this because we will use a lot
of<00:04:57.039> technique<00:04:57.340> that<00:04:57.370> works<00:04:57.639> a<00:04:57.789> lot<00:04:57.880> better

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
of technique that works a lot better

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.230 
of technique that works a lot better
than<00:04:58.330> any<00:04:58.539> mask<00:04:58.889> that<00:04:59.889> you<00:05:00.009> could<00:05:00.160> use<00:05:00.400> when<00:05:01.150> I

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
than any mask that you could use when I

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.150 
than any mask that you could use when I
press<00:05:01.479> command<00:05:01.840> a<00:05:02.169> ctrl<00:05:02.560> command<00:05:02.680> L<00:05:02.949> you<00:05:03.099> have

press command a ctrl command L you have

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.670 
press command a ctrl command L you have
to<00:05:03.280> add<00:05:03.460> an<00:05:04.449> adjustment<00:05:04.539> layer<00:05:04.930> instead<00:05:05.259> as<00:05:05.650> a

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
to add an adjustment layer instead as a

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.730 
to add an adjustment layer instead as a
clipping<00:05:06.070> mask<00:05:06.099> but<00:05:07.030> I<00:05:07.150> will<00:05:07.479> use<00:05:07.930> this<00:05:08.410> and

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
clipping mask but I will use this and

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.339 
clipping mask but I will use this and
I'll<00:05:09.220> use<00:05:09.699> the<00:05:09.940> highlights<00:05:10.419> slider<00:05:10.720> to<00:05:11.169> move

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
I'll use the highlights slider to move

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.629 
I'll use the highlights slider to move
this<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:12.090> bit<00:05:13.090> towards<00:05:13.720> the<00:05:13.960> left<00:05:14.410> and<00:05:14.830> also<00:05:15.340> the

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
this a bit towards the left and also the

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.939 
this a bit towards the left and also the
mid-tones<00:05:16.120> but<00:05:16.570> not<00:05:16.750> too<00:05:17.110> much<00:05:17.289> the<00:05:17.560> mid-tones

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
mid-tones but not too much the mid-tones

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.670 
mid-tones but not too much the mid-tones
controls<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:19.690> way<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:19.900> changed<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.590> opacity

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
controls the way I changed the opacity

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.279 
controls the way I changed the opacity
and<00:05:21.159> flow<00:05:21.310> here<00:05:21.580> without<00:05:21.840> typing<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:22.990> number

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
and flow here without typing the number

and flow here without typing the number
without<00:05:23.440> selecting<00:05:24.130> it<00:05:24.250> or<00:05:24.400> without<00:05:24.550> using

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
without selecting it or without using

without selecting it or without using
the<00:05:25.060> sliders<00:05:25.449> is<00:05:26.099> when<00:05:27.099> you<00:05:27.159> select<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.520> brush

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
the sliders is when you select the brush

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.480 
the sliders is when you select the brush
if<00:05:28.120> you<00:05:28.360> type<00:05:28.659> straight<00:05:29.560> on<00:05:29.710> your<00:05:29.889> keyboard

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
if you type straight on your keyboard

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.240 
if you type straight on your keyboard
for<00:05:30.699> example<00:05:31.419> 5<00:05:31.570> type<00:05:31.870> 15<00:05:32.409> you<00:05:32.710> can<00:05:32.860> see<00:05:33.039> it

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
for example 5 type 15 you can see it

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.460 
for example 5 type 15 you can see it
changes<00:05:33.610> the<00:05:33.820> opacity<00:05:34.120> and<00:05:34.750> if<00:05:35.199> you<00:05:35.289> want<00:05:35.409> to

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
changes the opacity and if you want to

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.839 
changes the opacity and if you want to
change<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.800> flow<00:05:36.070> you<00:05:36.130> have<00:05:36.250> to<00:05:36.490> press<00:05:36.729> the

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
change the flow you have to press the

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:39.240 
change the flow you have to press the
shift<00:05:37.060> key<00:05:37.270> first<00:05:37.630> and<00:05:37.960> I<00:05:38.500> then<00:05:38.860> type<00:05:39.099> the

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
shift key first and I then type the

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.219 
shift key first and I then type the
number<00:05:39.610> for<00:05:39.909> example<00:05:39.970> 12<00:05:40.449> you<00:05:40.930> can<00:05:41.080> see

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
number for example 12 you can see

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.960 
number for example 12 you can see
changes<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:41.740> flow<00:05:41.919> instead<00:05:42.340> of<00:05:42.460> the<00:05:42.610> the

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
changes the flow instead of the the

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.300 
changes the flow instead of the the
opacity<00:05:43.650> that's<00:05:44.650> how<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:44.800> do<00:05:44.919> it<00:05:44.979> it's<00:05:45.190> a<00:05:45.220> lot

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
opacity that's how I do it it's a lot

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.390 
opacity that's how I do it it's a lot
quicker<00:05:45.490> so<00:05:46.470> you<00:05:47.470> can<00:05:47.620> see<00:05:47.800> even<00:05:47.949> with<00:05:48.220> this

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
quicker so you can see even with this

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.760 
quicker so you can see even with this
opacity<00:05:49.360> and<00:05:49.479> flow<00:05:49.570> is<00:05:49.750> too<00:05:49.960> high<00:05:50.139> so<00:05:50.169> I'll<00:05:50.500> set

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
opacity and flow is too high so I'll set

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.110 
opacity and flow is too high so I'll set
them<00:05:51.479> 10%<00:05:52.479> all<00:05:52.539> over<00:05:52.780> both<00:05:53.080> of<00:05:53.289> them<00:05:53.940> ok<00:05:54.940> and

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
them 10% all over both of them ok and

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.060 
them 10% all over both of them ok and
now<00:05:55.570> what<00:05:55.750> I<00:05:55.780> will<00:05:55.930> do<00:05:56.050> is<00:05:56.199> probably<00:05:56.680> decrease

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
now what I will do is probably decrease

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.560 
now what I will do is probably decrease
the<00:05:57.250> opacity<00:05:57.340> of<00:05:57.759> this<00:05:58.030> to<00:05:58.509> about<00:05:58.870> 50%<00:06:00.419> ok

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
the opacity of this to about 50% ok

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.620 
the opacity of this to about 50% ok
just<00:06:01.810> well<00:06:02.620> maybe<00:06:03.130> that's<00:06:03.490> too<00:06:03.849> too<00:06:04.389> little

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
just well maybe that's too too little

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.510 
just well maybe that's too too little
and<00:06:05.349> set<00:06:05.530> it<00:06:05.620> to<00:06:05.650> 70%<00:06:06.360> ok<00:06:07.360> so<00:06:07.870> we<00:06:07.990> have<00:06:08.139> this

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
and set it to 70% ok so we have this

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.249 
and set it to 70% ok so we have this
soft<00:06:09.520> shadow<00:06:09.849> there<00:06:10.180> which<00:06:10.389> makes<00:06:10.930> things

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
soft shadow there which makes things

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.740 
soft shadow there which makes things
look<00:06:12.159> a<00:06:12.280> bit<00:06:12.430> more<00:06:12.639> realistic<00:06:12.940> in<00:06:13.270> my<00:06:13.389> opinion

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
look a bit more realistic in my opinion

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.610 
look a bit more realistic in my opinion
and<00:06:14.969> I<00:06:15.969> use<00:06:16.240> this<00:06:16.419> filter<00:06:16.690> quite<00:06:17.050> a<00:06:17.080> lot<00:06:17.320> and

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
and I use this filter quite a lot and

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.540 
and I use this filter quite a lot and
for<00:06:17.800> this<00:06:17.979> I<00:06:18.310> think<00:06:18.639> this<00:06:18.789> one's<00:06:19.090> the<00:06:19.870> last

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
for this I think this one's the last

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.100 
for this I think this one's the last
these<00:06:21.550> are<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:21.820> settings<00:06:22.270> for<00:06:22.419> the<00:06:22.690> last<00:06:22.870> time

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
these are the settings for the last time

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.129 
these are the settings for the last time
I<00:06:23.169> used<00:06:23.469> it<00:06:24.300> but<00:06:25.300> you<00:06:25.419> need<00:06:25.570> to<00:06:25.659> make<00:06:25.840> sure<00:06:25.900> that

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
I used it but you need to make sure that

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.469 
I used it but you need to make sure that
you<00:06:26.469> don't<00:06:26.650> you're<00:06:27.070> not<00:06:27.250> burning<00:06:27.490> the<00:06:28.180> image

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
you don't you're not burning the image

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:29.670 
you don't you're not burning the image
here<00:06:28.659> the<00:06:28.750> highlights

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
here the highlights

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.520 
here the highlights
so<00:06:30.370> what<00:06:31.120> do<00:06:31.210> you<00:06:31.270> while<00:06:31.810> you<00:06:32.020> can<00:06:32.170> do<00:06:32.350> is

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
so what do you while you can do is

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.840 
so what do you while you can do is
decrease<00:06:32.830> the<00:06:32.920> intensity<00:06:33.460> and<00:06:33.640> maybe

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
decrease the intensity and maybe

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.550 
decrease the intensity and maybe
increase<00:06:34.210> the<00:06:34.360> ambient<00:06:34.840> slide<00:06:35.020> a<00:06:35.050> bit<00:06:35.320> but

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
increase the ambient slide a bit but

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.940 
increase the ambient slide a bit but
then<00:06:36.520> the<00:06:36.670> exposure<00:06:37.260> yes<00:06:38.260> the<00:06:38.650> exposure

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
then the exposure yes the exposure

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.220 
then the exposure yes the exposure
affects<00:06:39.310> more<00:06:39.580> the<00:06:39.700> highlights<00:06:40.210> and<00:06:40.450> the

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
affects more the highlights and the

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.680 
affects more the highlights and the
intensity<00:06:41.710> as<00:06:41.950> well<00:06:42.190> while<00:06:43.000> the<00:06:43.240> ambience

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
intensity as well while the ambience

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.160 
intensity as well while the ambience
increases<00:06:44.230> the<00:06:44.350> overall<00:06:45.420> light<00:06:46.420> on<00:06:46.660> the<00:06:46.870> image

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.170 
increases the overall light on the image

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.710 
increases the overall light on the image
so<00:06:47.520> if<00:06:48.520> you<00:06:48.640> see<00:06:48.820> the<00:06:48.940> highlights<00:06:49.390> are<00:06:49.540> too

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
so if you see the highlights are too

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.960 
so if you see the highlights are too
strong<00:06:50.230> what<00:06:50.560> you<00:06:50.650> can<00:06:50.800> do<00:06:50.950> is<00:06:51.220> decrease<00:06:51.820> a<00:06:51.850> bit

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
strong what you can do is decrease a bit

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.260 
strong what you can do is decrease a bit
the<00:06:52.180> exposure<00:06:52.600> maybe<00:06:53.730> like<00:06:54.730> that<00:06:54.910> and<00:06:54.970> then

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
the exposure maybe like that and then

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.410 
the exposure maybe like that and then
increase<00:06:55.660> the<00:06:55.690> ambience<00:06:56.170> and<00:06:56.640> the<00:06:57.640> glass<00:06:57.910> what

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
increase the ambience and the glass what

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.540 
increase the ambience and the glass what
it<00:06:58.600> also<00:06:58.780> like<00:06:59.380> also<00:06:59.770> affects<00:07:00.010> the<00:07:00.130> highlights

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
it also like also affects the highlights

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.660 
it also like also affects the highlights
a<00:07:00.670> bit<00:07:00.820> more<00:07:01.000> so<00:07:01.810> maybe<00:07:02.260> only<00:07:02.440> crease<00:07:03.430> well

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:03.670 
a bit more so maybe only crease well

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.980 
a bit more so maybe only crease well
increase<00:07:04.180> hotspot<00:07:04.780> here<00:07:06.240> decrease<00:07:07.240> intensity

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
increase hotspot here decrease intensity

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.030 
increase hotspot here decrease intensity
increase<00:07:08.410> the<00:07:08.500> exposure<00:07:09.630> so<00:07:10.630> try<00:07:11.410> to<00:07:11.440> get<00:07:11.740> a

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040 
increase the exposure so try to get a

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.720 
increase the exposure so try to get a
similar<00:07:12.400> effect<00:07:13.830> so<00:07:14.830> let's<00:07:15.130> choose<00:07:15.520> the

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:15.730 
similar effect so let's choose the

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:21.990 
similar effect so let's choose the
vibrance<00:07:17.010> and<00:07:18.010> set<00:07:19.110> across<00:07:20.520> setting<00:07:21.520> here<00:07:21.850> I

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 
vibrance and set across setting here I

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.130 
vibrance and set across setting here I
decreased<00:07:22.590> the<00:07:23.590> vibrance
