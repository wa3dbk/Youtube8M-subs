00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:04.130
 At the beginning of the game, guestskeeper Malte will not be the first 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.460
 Free throw of Thomas Morus is then due to new in goal 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.460
 Undinger had to show what Mr. k 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.179
 Fabian Gerster is like her the first points of the game after a nice attack 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.449
 from Budapest 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.300
 With much fighting spirit as here Müller sees the CDU in the comfortable 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.859
 three-door advantage 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.180
 The young team from Franconia work never gives up and as such many play as 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.880
 Boris is ice cold and comes to 18 9 percent 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.430
 as Dan Licher Alzey the after this action for two minutes from the square 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.030
 had to 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.750
 Victory playful 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.310
 into the top of the world sees here a seven-meter and the wind she wants the 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.820
 Red into skidding 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.710
 not much is going forward 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.429
 and freedom is for the guests with picture 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.429
 to the 50th 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.810
 yes, if you yourself test in Sweden for the time being only witnesses with victims in the attack 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.580
 Promotions second elevator not found 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.970
 how changed the red came out of the cabin and with the first action 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.240
 the catch-up hunt they belonged to is about 15 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.829
 Audimax holds back the danger that we will have a free profession 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.580
 Michael Sidibe Inter guys back here with one of six hits 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.040
 and in addition there is a large Weilstetter outnumber the guide is for 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.400
 Hevener 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.020
 the Fed Ten Brinke guests just go upwind as time goes on 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.590
 Out 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.070
 around 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.770
 on 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.340
 Großwallstadt always has two substitutes that the main reason 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.020
 that she did not run out of air in any way 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.640
 what happened in the main round but who still won the gas with two paces 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.460
 Switching back our strength found and I am the people 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.600
 are angry 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.579
 start like this 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.220
 Rodinger must also be around at Lett 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.380
 for the Großwallstädter almost into despair 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.870
 With a lot of luck the guests are exciting once again and arrive at 24 2 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.799
 25 zoom in on the top of everything 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.040
 the fans celebrated a deserved 28 to 25 looks over the offspring of the 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.619
 German handball 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.789
 with three players and coaches all three games won the same 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:21.419
 where nothing is going on 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.109
 that can only think about a USB 2 0 thrust and one in ten injured 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.269
 motivated and 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.909
 currently the two players' coaches Wind and ETI start the replacement 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.069
 enclosed the third game in a row 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.109
 I think the Basic Law is ours and that is what they are now 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.069
 maybe it should always be assumed and you see that he has to 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.209
 if it is true and that we will have until Wednesday 9th 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.419
 What has changed now? 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:47.309
 finds itself with a lot of flair and wants to have a good team and will 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:49.889
 of it needed to play again to the opera 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.489
 with this victory stands the holding 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.290
 With a game less in fourth place of the table one has no reason to 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.390
 looking forward
