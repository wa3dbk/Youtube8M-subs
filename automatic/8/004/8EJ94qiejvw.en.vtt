the<00:00:58.390> Rattler<00:00:58.750> with<00:00:58.990> the<00:00:59.170> Cobra<00:00:59.590> is<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:01.590> take<00:01:02.590> a

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
the Rattler with the Cobra is to take a

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.730 
the Rattler with the Cobra is to take a
TNA<00:01:03.040> strap<00:01:03.340> which<00:01:03.550> is<00:01:03.579> about<00:01:03.850> five<00:01:04.150> feet<00:01:04.390> long

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:04.740 
TNA strap which is about five feet long

select that on the back of the ski that

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.510 
select that on the back of the ski that
you're<00:01:07.509> going<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.689> be<00:01:07.750> pulling<00:01:07.960> on<00:01:08.249> to<00:01:09.249> pull<00:01:09.429> it

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
you're going to be pulling on to pull it

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.149 
you're going to be pulling on to pull it
up<00:01:09.609> nice<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:10.450> snug<00:01:10.689> against<00:01:11.049> the<00:01:11.200> spindle<00:01:11.409> so

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
up nice and snug against the spindle so

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.440 
up nice and snug against the spindle so
we're<00:01:12.310> putting<00:01:12.520> all<00:01:12.759> our<00:01:12.789> pulling<00:01:13.210> force

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
we're putting all our pulling force

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.749 
we're putting all our pulling force
right<00:01:13.659> here<00:01:13.840> on<00:01:13.929> the<00:01:14.020> spindle<00:01:14.289> where<00:01:14.590> this<00:01:15.520> is

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
right here on the spindle where this is

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:16.889 
right here on the spindle where this is
strongest<00:01:16.149> part<00:01:16.299> of<00:01:16.329> the<00:01:16.420> ski<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:16.630> that's

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
strongest part of the ski and that's

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.450 
strongest part of the ski and that's
where<00:01:17.049> we<00:01:17.140> poke<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.649> bird<00:01:17.890> should<00:01:18.130> be<00:01:18.249> pulling

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
where we poke a bird should be pulling

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.300 
where we poke a bird should be pulling
from<00:01:18.759> now<00:01:19.630> I've<00:01:19.719> got<00:01:19.899> all<00:01:20.079> this<00:01:20.229> distance<00:01:20.799> that

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
from now I've got all this distance that

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.120 
from now I've got all this distance that
gives<00:01:21.609> me<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.909> slack<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:23.439> get<00:01:23.619> my<00:01:23.770> pulling

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
gives me the slack to get my pulling

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.800 
gives me the slack to get my pulling

here<00:01:33.899> if<00:01:34.899> I<00:01:35.079> get<00:01:35.289> nothing<00:01:35.499> but<00:01:36.689> up

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.230

we<00:01:54.799> have<00:01:54.920> Cobra<00:01:55.460> polling<00:01:55.820> for<00:01:56.000> 300<00:01:56.450> pounds

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
we have Cobra polling for 300 pounds

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.929 
we have Cobra polling for 300 pounds
essentially<00:01:57.649> we've<00:01:57.770> taken<00:01:58.009> 300<00:01:58.310> pounds<00:01:58.820> off

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
essentially we've taken 300 pounds off

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.270 
essentially we've taken 300 pounds off
that<00:01:59.149> stuck<00:01:59.479> sled<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.470> I<00:02:00.649> hit<00:02:00.860> that<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.070> little

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
that stuck sled and I hit that a little

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.029 
that stuck sled and I hit that a little
bit<00:02:01.399> harder<00:02:01.850> when<00:02:02.509> Cobra<00:02:02.960> stopped<00:02:03.289> stretching

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
bit harder when Cobra stopped stretching

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.639 
bit harder when Cobra stopped stretching
turned<00:02:04.789> into<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.119> rope<00:02:05.360> essentially<00:02:06.049> I<00:02:06.229> would

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
turned into a rope essentially I would

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.650 
turned into a rope essentially I would
have<00:02:06.950> jerked<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.429> sled<00:02:07.729> forward<00:02:08.060> about<00:02:08.390> two

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
have jerked that sled forward about two

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.960 
have jerked that sled forward about two
feet<00:02:08.929> with<00:02:09.170> all<00:02:09.349> of<00:02:09.560> this<00:02:09.679> mootness<00:02:10.009> catching

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
feet with all of this mootness catching

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.360 
feet with all of this mootness catching
all<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:11.239> weight<00:02:11.630> at<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.500> end<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.739> that<00:02:12.860> and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
all this weight at the end of that and

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.059 
all this weight at the end of that and
it<00:02:13.459> was<00:02:13.550> jerk<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:14.000> sled<00:02:14.239> forward<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:15.019> would<00:02:15.800> have

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
it was jerk to sled forward I would have

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.240 
it was jerk to sled forward I would have
300<00:02:16.670> pounds<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.209> rubber<00:02:17.750> pulling<00:02:18.230> for<00:02:18.440> me<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:19.160> I

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
300 pounds of rubber pulling for me so I

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.979 
300 pounds of rubber pulling for me so I
hear<00:02:19.430> this<00:02:19.610> tension<00:02:20.090> still<00:02:20.299> pulling<00:02:20.720> at<00:02:20.840> that

sled out
that's<00:03:26.180> basis<00:03:26.630> of<00:03:26.780> our<00:03:26.900> bungee<00:03:27.440> cord<00:03:27.769> polling

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
that's basis of our bungee cord polling

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.140 
that's basis of our bungee cord polling
tools<00:03:28.310> is

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
tools is

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.270 
tools is
we're<00:03:29.690> taking<00:03:30.019> weight<00:03:30.170> off<00:03:30.200> that<00:03:30.440> step<00:03:31.010> sled

we're taking weight off that step sled

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.880 
we're taking weight off that step sled
so<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.700> track<00:03:31.910> can<00:03:32.150> move<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.420> sled<00:03:32.629> again<00:03:32.890> if

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
so the track can move the sled again if

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.770 
so the track can move the sled again if
