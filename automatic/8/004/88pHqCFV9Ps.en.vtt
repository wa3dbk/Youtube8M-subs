00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
it has all the right parts so we'll see

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.880 
it has all the right parts so we'll see
how<00:00:30.150> drive<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.260> face<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.769> you

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
how drive it's on the face of it you

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.620 
how drive it's on the face of it you
hear<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.189> back<00:00:32.430> two<00:00:32.730> liter<00:00:33.090> turbo

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.030 
hear this back two liter turbo
four-cylinder<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.469> think<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.860> kind<00:00:35.010> of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
four-cylinder and think it's kind of

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.319 
four-cylinder and think it's kind of
badge<00:00:35.219> engineering<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:35.969> they've<00:00:36.120> really

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
badge engineering but they've really

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.729 
badge engineering but they've really
gone<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.600> town<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.200> there's<00:00:37.380> no<00:00:37.469> v8

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
gone to town on this and there's no v8

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.930 
gone to town on this and there's no v8
there's<00:00:37.950> no<00:00:38.070> rear<00:00:38.250> wheel<00:00:38.399> drive<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
there's no rear wheel drive but it's a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.420 
there's no rear wheel drive but it's a
proper<00:00:39.239> AMG<00:00:39.600> oh<00:00:39.780> yeah<00:00:40.200> they<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.860> completely

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
proper AMG oh yeah they have completely

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.830 
proper AMG oh yeah they have completely
gone<00:00:41.700> through<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> suspension<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.719> it's

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
gone through the suspension and it's

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.119 
gone through the suspension and it's
quite<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> bit<00:00:43.320> different<00:00:43.350> than<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> standard

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
quite a bit different than the standard

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.729 
quite a bit different than the standard
CLA<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.910> its<00:00:45.570> standard<00:00:46.020> all-wheel<00:00:46.110> drive<00:00:46.559> as

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
CLA and its standard all-wheel drive as

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.200 
CLA and its standard all-wheel drive as
well<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.309> that's<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.789> put<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.030> power

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
well so that's going to put the power

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.290 
well so that's going to put the power
down<00:00:48.739> perfectly<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.610> know<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> has<00:00:51.270> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
down perfectly and you know it has a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.600 
down perfectly and you know it has a
seven<00:00:51.960> speed<00:00:52.110> speed<00:00:52.590> shift<00:00:52.800> transmission<00:00:53.160> so

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
seven speed speed shift transmission so

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.799 
seven speed speed shift transmission so
I<00:00:53.640> mean<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> really<00:00:54.239> does<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> great<00:00:54.690> job

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
I mean that really does a great job

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.779 
I mean that really does a great job
making<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.500> most<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.860> all<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.160> power<00:00:56.399> so

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
making the most of all that power so

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.970 
making the most of all that power so
it's<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.300> nice<00:00:57.480> package<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:58.109> sure<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:58.890> of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
it's a nice package for sure and some of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.139 
it's a nice package for sure and some of
the<00:00:59.070> figures<00:00:59.219> coming<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.910> mean<00:01:00.000> they're

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.750 
the figures coming out of I mean they're

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
claiming 0 to 60 in 4.6 seconds of a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.640 
claiming 0 to 60 in 4.6 seconds of a
serious<00:01:03.270> performance<00:01:03.420> yeah<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.229> mean<00:01:04.530> they
