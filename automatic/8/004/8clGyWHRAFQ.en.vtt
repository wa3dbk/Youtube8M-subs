which<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.069> this<00:01:24.130> game<00:01:24.340> I'm<00:01:24.490> not<00:01:24.909> joking<00:01:27.149> so<00:01:28.709> the

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:29.709 
which in this game I'm not joking so the

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:31.919 
which in this game I'm not joking so the
scale<00:01:30.039> is<00:01:30.219> a<00:01:30.249> little<00:01:30.459> bit<00:01:30.549> off<00:01:30.729> if<00:01:31.090> you<00:01:31.509> look<00:01:31.689> at

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
scale is a little bit off if you look at

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.230 
scale is a little bit off if you look at
it<00:01:31.959> from<00:01:32.109> the<00:01:32.740> bird's<00:01:32.979> eye<00:01:33.159> view<00:01:33.189> and<00:01:33.639> then

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
it from the bird's eye view and then

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.469 
it from the bird's eye view and then

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.649 
five but I don't have the three and I I
noticed<00:01:51.369> that<00:01:51.459> after<00:01:51.759> i<00:01:52.029> put<00:01:52.209> the<00:01:52.299> roof<00:01:52.479> on<00:01:52.599> it

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
noticed that after i put the roof on it

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.179 
noticed that after i put the roof on it
now<00:01:52.840> if<00:01:53.079> you<00:01:53.139> look<00:01:53.259> at<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.499> roof<00:01:53.649> all<00:01:53.859> of<00:01:54.099> this

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
now if you look at the roof all of this

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.319 
now if you look at the roof all of this
is<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.819> blue<00:01:55.689> bowl<00:01:55.929> in<00:01:56.139> light<00:01:56.950> blue<00:01:57.099> wall<00:01:57.309> and<00:01:57.549> it

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
is a blue bowl in light blue wall and it

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.080 
is a blue bowl in light blue wall and it
took<00:01:58.539> me<00:01:58.569> forever<00:01:59.079> to<00:01:59.950> get<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.549> roof<00:02:00.729> correct

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
took me forever to get the roof correct

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.729 
took me forever to get the roof correct
it's<00:02:01.359> I<00:02:01.659> like<00:02:01.840> I<00:02:01.959> had<00:02:02.049> to<00:02:02.139> get<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.319> dimension

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:02.739 
it's I like I had to get the dimension

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.260 
it's I like I had to get the dimension
to<00:02:02.859> get<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.099> designs<00:02:03.429> are<00:02:03.639> correctly<00:02:03.999> because

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
to get the designs are correctly because

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.919 
to get the designs are correctly because
I'm<00:02:04.959> OCD<00:02:05.109> and<00:02:05.999> minecraft<00:02:06.999> is<00:02:07.329> terrible<00:02:07.779> for

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
I'm OCD and minecraft is terrible for

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.270 
I'm OCD and minecraft is terrible for
OCD<00:02:08.140> people<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.170> basically<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.799> just<00:02:12.040> kept

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
OCD people so I basically I just kept

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.050 
OCD people so I basically I just kept
that<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:12.849> just<00:02:13.060> said<00:02:13.180> screw<00:02:13.329> it

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
that and I just said screw it

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.420 
that and I just said screw it
and<00:02:14.150> then<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.020> last<00:02:15.170> part<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.980> library

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
and then the last part is the library

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.190 
and then the last part is the library
I'm<00:02:16.880> not<00:02:17.030> sure<00:02:17.090> why<00:02:17.360> does<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:18.050> know<00:02:18.170> I

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.000 
either building up this way or I'm
building<00:02:57.140> up<00:02:57.260> through<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.560> front<00:02:57.709> i'll

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
building up through the front i'll

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.339 
building up through the front i'll
probably<00:02:58.220> do<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.580> front<00:02:58.849> and<00:02:59.000> then<00:02:59.299> do<00:03:00.170> like

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
probably do the front and then do like

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.350 
probably do the front and then do like
the<00:03:00.530> right<00:03:00.739> side<00:03:01.040> dorman<00:03:01.580> district<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.180> then

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
the right side dorman district and then

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.120 
the right side dorman district and then
loop<00:03:02.540> around<00:03:02.720> because<00:03:03.260> there's<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.709> giant

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
loop around because there's that giant

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.920 
loop around because there's that giant

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.259 
sure it took me literally an hour and a
half<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:42.140> make<00:03:42.260> sure<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.769> it<00:03:43.549> was<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.819> perfect

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
half to make sure that it was a perfect

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.220 
half to make sure that it was a perfect
circle<00:03:44.299> in<00:03:45.049> terms<00:03:45.350> of<00:03:45.500> Minecraft<00:03:45.920> circles<00:03:46.250> and

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
circle in terms of Minecraft circles and

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.220 
circle in terms of Minecraft circles and
yeah<00:03:48.230> wasn't<00:03:49.010> fun<00:03:49.280> at<00:03:49.310> all<00:03:53.079> awkward<00:03:54.079> now

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
yeah wasn't fun at all awkward now

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.259 
yeah wasn't fun at all awkward now
because<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.590> webcams<00:03:54.950> on<00:03:55.190> this<00:03:55.609> it's

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
because the webcams on this it's

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:03.390 
because the webcams on this it's
slightly<00:03:56.810> awkward<00:03:57.109> for<00:03:57.440> me<00:03:57.560> but<00:03:58.600> yeah<00:03:59.859> anyways

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.000

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
progress like every two or three days it

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.970 
progress like every two or three days it
more<00:04:10.130> depends<00:04:10.700> on<00:04:11.079> how<00:04:12.079> much<00:04:12.230> i<00:04:12.380> have<00:04:12.500> done<00:04:12.709> and
