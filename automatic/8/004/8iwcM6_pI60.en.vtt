this one is this to show lamination I

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.260 
this one is this to show lamination I
just<00:00:55.949> stuck<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.550> glued<00:00:56.579> down<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.149> I'm<00:00:57.239> a

just stuck and glued down because I'm a

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.849 
just stuck and glued down because I'm a
little<00:00:57.360> dehydrated<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:58.199> training<00:00:58.770> really

services<00:01:02.010> aren't<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.840> an

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
services aren't going to is this an

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.509 
services aren't going to is this an
issue<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.229> some<00:01:04.470> kind<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.769> shoot<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.250> trigger

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
issue of some kind of shoot and trigger

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.789 
issue of some kind of shoot and trigger
point<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> muscle<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.320> muscle<00:01:07.530> isn't

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
point in the muscle but the muscle isn't

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.440 
point in the muscle but the muscle isn't
just<00:01:08.100> created<00:01:08.430> equal<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.880> scar<00:01:09.210> tissue

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
just created equal have scar tissue

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.700 
just created equal have scar tissue
that's<00:01:09.750> bands<00:01:10.049> they're<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> little<00:01:10.470> thicker

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
that's bands they're a little thicker

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.100 
that's bands they're a little thicker
and<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.400> maybe<00:01:11.549> my<00:01:11.790> rubbin<00:01:12.210> kind<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.600> role<00:01:12.990> in

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and so maybe my rubbin kind of role in

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.149 
and so maybe my rubbin kind of role in
those<00:01:13.290> those<00:01:14.010> pieces<00:01:14.340> out<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.540> better

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
those those pieces out you can do better

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.830 
those those pieces out you can do better
you<00:01:17.159> know<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> interface<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.000> muscle<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
you know the interface of muscle and

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.090 
you know the interface of muscle and
tissue<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.229> doesn't<00:01:19.439> really<00:01:19.530> matter<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.920> can

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
tissue it doesn't really matter you can

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100 
tissue it doesn't really matter you can
still<00:01:20.280> contract<00:01:20.729> relax<00:01:21.119> over<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> paintball

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
still contract relax over the paintball

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.230 
still contract relax over the paintball
and<00:01:22.590> create<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> micro<00:01:23.189> stretch<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.640> think

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and create a micro stretch so think

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.999 
and create a micro stretch so think
about<00:01:24.330> big<00:01:24.600> bloke<00:01:24.869> rolling<00:01:25.439> think<00:01:25.650> about<00:01:25.799> kind

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
about big bloke rolling think about kind

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.100 
about big bloke rolling think about kind
of<00:01:26.070> micro<00:01:26.369> pressure<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.150> got<00:01:27.270> 15<00:01:27.689> minutes<00:01:27.810> do

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
of micro pressure you got 15 minutes do

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.179 
of micro pressure you got 15 minutes do
so<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> give<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.740> some<00:01:28.860> ideas

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
soft tissue of the chest but I can also

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.199 
soft tissue of the chest but I can also
get<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.500> ribs<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.890> move<00:03:06.069> and<00:03:06.280> we<00:03:06.790> think<00:03:06.970> a<00:03:07.090> lot

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
get the ribs to move and we think a lot

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.879 
get the ribs to move and we think a lot
about<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.480> ribs<00:03:07.630> move<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:07.900> in<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.019> back<00:03:08.200> but

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
about the ribs move it in the back but

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.770 
about the ribs move it in the back but
oftentimes<00:03:09.250> those<00:03:09.730> ribs<00:03:10.030> are<00:03:10.209> stiff<00:03:10.540> in<00:03:10.690> the

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
oftentimes those ribs are stiff in the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.330 
oftentimes those ribs are stiff in the
front<00:03:11.049> and<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.230> whole<00:03:11.470> thing<00:03:11.500> does<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.010> flex

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
front and the whole thing does it flex
