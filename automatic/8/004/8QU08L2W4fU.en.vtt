coop inator this adds three new types of
block<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.250> game<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.969> special<00:00:12.269> they're

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
block to the game and a special they're

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.250 
block to the game and a special they're
sort<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.769> my<00:00:14.009> mob<00:00:14.490> I'd<00:00:14.670> say<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.780> adds<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
sort of my mob I'd say so it adds the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.500 
sort of my mob I'd say so it adds the
sweet<00:00:16.859> blocks<00:00:17.130> redstone<00:00:17.940> blocks<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.359> coal

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
sweet blocks redstone blocks and coal

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.240 
sweet blocks redstone blocks and coal
blocks<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.140> we'll<00:00:19.289> go<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> Redstone<00:00:19.949> cool

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
blocks so we'll go to the Redstone cool

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.179 
blocks so we'll go to the Redstone cool
first<00:00:20.810> no<00:00:21.810> Redskin<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.470> be<00:00:22.590> lit<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:23.039> like<00:00:23.160> a

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
first no Redskin can be lit just like a

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.580 
first no Redskin can be lit just like a
redstone<00:00:23.490> lamp<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.170> can<00:00:25.170> be<00:00:25.260> stored<00:00:25.410> like

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
redstone lamp and can be stored like

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.320 
redstone lamp and can be stored like
this<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.980> broken<00:00:26.369> by<00:00:26.490> hand<00:00:26.699> fairly<00:00:27.119> quickly

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
this and broken by hand fairly quickly

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.589 
this and broken by hand fairly quickly
to<00:00:28.199> give<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:29.099> redstone<00:00:29.340> block<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:30.449> made

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to give you one redstone block it's made

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.870 
to give you one redstone block it's made
with<00:00:30.630> nine<00:00:30.960> redstone<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:32.489> get<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.700> coal

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
with nine redstone and you get the coal

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.580 
with nine redstone and you get the coal
block<00:00:33.120> which<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.719> be<00:00:33.780> placed<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.170> exact<00:00:34.380> same

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
block which can be placed the exact same

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.920 
block which can be placed the exact same
way<00:00:34.739> only<00:00:34.980> needs<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.730> broken<00:00:36.090> well<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.660> think

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
way only needs to be broken well I think

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.270 
way only needs to be broken well I think
it<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.230> broken<00:00:37.320> by<00:00:37.590> hand<00:00:37.800> we'll<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.129> find

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
it can be broken by hand we'll just find

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.889 
it can be broken by hand we'll just find
out<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:39.059> I'm<00:00:39.149> pretty<00:00:39.300> sure<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.600> needs<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.809> be

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
out but I'm pretty sure it needs to be

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.150 
out but I'm pretty sure it needs to be
broken<00:00:40.020> by<00:00:40.320> our<00:00:40.590> pickaxe<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:42.350> oh<00:00:43.350> no<00:00:44.040> it

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
broken by our pickaxe and oh no it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.470 
broken by our pickaxe and oh no it
doesn't<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.000> break<00:00:45.300> these

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
doesn't so you can just break these

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.660 
doesn't so you can just break these
either<00:00:46.200> way<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.559> want<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.070> does<00:00:47.280> work

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
either way you want this does work

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.529 
either way you want this does work
faster<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.539> pickaxe<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:50.460> recipe<00:00:51.390> for

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
faster with the pickaxe the recipe for

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.869 
faster with the pickaxe the recipe for
this<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.870> just<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:53.070> call<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.430> every<00:00:53.550> section

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
this is just one call in every section

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.810 
this is just one call in every section
to<00:00:54.420> make<00:00:54.539> one<00:00:54.719> call<00:00:54.899> block<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.579> one<00:00:56.579> redstone

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
to make one call block and one redstone

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.990 
to make one call block and one redstone
in<00:00:57.180> every<00:00:57.390> section<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:59.129> make<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.550> redstone

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
in every section to make a redstone

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.049 
in every section to make a redstone
block<00:01:01.039> now<00:01:02.039> they<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.309> prepare<00:01:02.579> by<00:01:02.730> redstone

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
block now they can prepare by redstone

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.700 
block now they can prepare by redstone
as<00:01:03.300> I've<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.480> said<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.379> place<00:01:04.559> this

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
as I've just said so we can place this

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.560 
as I've just said so we can place this
in<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.400> you'll<00:01:05.670> see<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.880> light<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.119> I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
in here and you'll see you light up I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.260 
in here and you'll see you light up I
break<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> deep<00:01:07.950> errors<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.520> pair

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
break this and the deep errors just pair

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.649 
break this and the deep errors just pair
that<00:01:09.450> back<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:11.240> that's<00:01:12.240> all<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.570> these

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that back up and that's all for these

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.899 
that back up and that's all for these
two<00:01:12.900> will<00:01:13.860> move<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.369> bit<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:14.790> this

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
two will move on to this bit now this

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.429 
two will move on to this bit now this
bits<00:01:15.119> where<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.390> gets<00:01:15.450> interesting<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:16.320> now

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
bits where it gets interesting we now

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.070 
bits where it gets interesting we now
have<00:01:16.470> wheat<00:01:16.890> storage<00:01:17.509> in<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> form<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.930> these

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
have wheat storage in the form of these

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.109 
have wheat storage in the form of these
hay<00:01:19.290> bales<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.729> see<00:01:20.759> we're<00:01:20.970> sort

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
hay bales and as you can see we're sort

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
hay bales and as you can see we're sort
of<00:01:21.150> overrun<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:21.630> chickens<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
of overrun with chickens here which is a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.070 
of overrun with chickens here which is a
bit<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> nightmare<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> make<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.869> wheat

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
bit of a nightmare so to make a wheat

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.280 
bit of a nightmare so to make a wheat
block<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.560> need<00:01:25.710> ninth<00:01:25.979> week<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:27.140> I'll<00:01:28.140> just

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
block you need ninth week and I'll just

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.460 
block you need ninth week and I'll just
take<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:28.740> well<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:30.960> take<00:01:31.140> our<00:01:31.259> ninth

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
take this as well so we take our ninth

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.050 
take this as well so we take our ninth
week<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.880> we<00:01:32.880> place<00:01:33.119> them<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.360> each<00:01:33.479> block<00:01:35.060> to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
week and we place them in each block to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.289 
week and we place them in each block to
make<00:01:36.180> our<00:01:36.360> wheat<00:01:36.540> block<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:38.000> again<00:01:39.000> they<00:01:39.150> can

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
make our wheat block and again they can

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.300 
make our wheat block and again they can
replaced<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.020> broken<00:01:40.619> by<00:01:40.740> hand<00:01:40.950> fairly

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
replaced and broken by hand fairly

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.429 
replaced and broken by hand fairly
easily<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.759> nice<00:01:42.119> way<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> store<00:01:42.630> wheat<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.049> I

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
easily a nice way to store wheat and I

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.080 
easily a nice way to store wheat and I
actually<00:01:43.740> really<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> textures<00:01:44.909> to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
actually really like the textures to

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.660 
actually really like the textures to
these<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:46.229> how<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> get<00:01:47.189> rid<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.549> these

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
these know how to get rid of all these

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.210 
these know how to get rid of all these
chickens<00:01:48.090> well<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.740> take<00:01:49.920> our<00:01:50.070> wheat

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
chickens well if we take our wheat

you need to place them down on the floor

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.910 
you need to place them down on the floor
just<00:02:09.040> like<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.220> snowman<00:02:09.550> intent<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:11.470> there

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
just like a snowman intent and you there

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.060 
just like a snowman intent and you there
we<00:02:12.040> go<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.460> we<00:02:12.910> have<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.360> scarecrow<00:02:14.070> which

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.660 
we go and we have a scarecrow which
animal<00:02:15.310> should<00:02:15.520> run<00:02:16.420> away<00:02:16.600> from<00:02:17.130> yep<00:02:18.130> see<00:02:18.490> them

running<00:02:18.850> away<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.300> think<00:02:19.810> it's<00:02:19.900> just<00:02:19.930> because
