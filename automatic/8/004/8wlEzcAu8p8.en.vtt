00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.260
 you know when we have an animal 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:10.360
 it's always something a little 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.500
 stressful for the owner since 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.690
 general anesthesia 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.429
 there is no zero risk whatsoever 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.780
 in the dog the cat who sits at home 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.830
 the human can always be a 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.840
 anesthetic accident 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.310
 so we try to do that at best but 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.510
 we have protocols that are specific 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.280
 for new pets 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.110
 anesthesia is still going on 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.880
 unfold in several stages the first 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.530
 step what are we going these dates and the animal 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.820
 we will calm him down so that he is 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.950
 very calm that they are not stressed 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.320
 and at the same time we will administer him 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.730
 an anti pain molecule today 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.020
 we have painkillers that are pretty 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.400
 powerful who are from the same family 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.690
 that morphine that we will use to 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.140
 surgeries that can be 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.329
 painful 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.280
 in a second time then we will 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.140
 induce what is called the animal is 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.220
 to say we will make him sleep with a 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.110
 anesthetic product 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.290
 so that can be done either with a 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.329
 injection either with a gas so we do 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.160
 breathe the animal in a small mask 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.420
 who will fall asleep gradually and 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.500
 then the third step is this 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.149
 called maintenance and 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.410
 usually it's always done with gas 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.430
 for new pets 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.649
 because it's something that is 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.960
 safer so we have two types of gasques 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.460
 according to iso furan and cvo furan the cvo 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.229
 furan is a molecule which is 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.330
 used for pediatric anesthesia 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.159
 So anesthesia rather risky and 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.900
 which has very little effect on the device 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.700
 cardiovascular so on the lungs and 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.200
 on the heart and during all this 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.729
 year was said we will see different 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.950
 equipment that will allow us to 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.869
 monitor the anesthetic monitor the 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.060
 heart rate of the animal 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.250
 respiratory rate possibly 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.830
 its oxygenation in the blood is 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.000
 expiration in carbon dioxide and so 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.310
 all that will allow us to know 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.030
 if the animal is too light too deep 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.369
 if on the contrary 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.140
 the anesthetized is very good so it's 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.970
 true that today we have not only 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.010
 techniques of the molecules but also 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.420
 all equipment that allows us 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.700
 still to perform anesthesia 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.439
 which are increasingly safe for 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.509
 animals that are quite fragile like 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.409
 so the rabbits the ferrets or 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.409
 even more animals
