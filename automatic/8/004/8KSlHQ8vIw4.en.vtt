 Suddenly you're playing your game. 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.000
 Good morning and your mother in the next room .

 You'll find that you're in the x video. 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.850
 watching the porn video and playing a 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.680
 buoy when in reality you are 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.680
 playing and stopped in a buggy 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.050
 the game also brings several places where 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.050
 the second is simply nothing 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.560
 look if it comes out in the face what is asked 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.429

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.230

 begin to slide out of nowhere 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.670
 the goal 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.190
 I think I 've seen it in one place. 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:21.830
 rest assured that I 've seen somewhere 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.630
 something like that 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.250
 most of the bugs you've seen in the 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.020
 video that showed me was a great game 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.430
 the avoidance of prescribing channel 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.650
 enter here his work is well 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.750
 and now let's leave a little 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.730
 blogs aside and talk about 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.770
 serious thing 'assassin's creed one of the 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.410
 biggest games out there have it for 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.510
 all over the world and from the beginning 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.550
 started talking about the game business 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.900
 every year every game I'm against because 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.120
 I do not think a game of this size 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.020
 be able to be done in a single 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.570
 year or release a title from it every year I 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.620
 I do not think I 'll give examples here gta 55 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.900
 years to be done 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.420
 what docs five years to be done it 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.670
 in the air five years to be done were 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.710
 games that were with a few more problems 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.600
 others less but all of them came with 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.210
 problems and if we take into account 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.820
 that the game took five years to be 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.520
 done and still did not see perfect as that 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.250
 a game the size of these delete will have 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.710
 conditions to make a game out and 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.760
 perfect at the same time it is impossible to have 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.910
 nothing is impossible 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.310
 the game released ubisoft banned 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.840
 reeves were done for 24 hours 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.760
 carlos sul 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.980
 this is because they already knew that the 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.770
 I was in trouble so I 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.110
 I believe they will they will take in 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.700
 consideration that the next title and I 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.910
 I hope they do not do this guys 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.890
 that neither these entries nor the 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.630
 so fast one after another no 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.140
 I think it looks cool, I think it gets 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:51.940
 very sweaty as well as pf coado code 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.060
 I do not even play a game any more than once and never 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.590
 run 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.020
 I really hope they have learned to 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.810
 lesson and do not get to be a game behind 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.860
 on the other side takes away the brightness of the 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.200
 it's magnificent 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.660
 beauty is my opinion and it 's you not 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.980
 is obliged to agree and until the next 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.230
 video share the video if you have 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.340
