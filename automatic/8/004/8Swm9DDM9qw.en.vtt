 [Music] 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.920
 all boys 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.509
 welcome back on those two on the server with a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.389
 nice little game worthy of note 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.190
 noteworthy is a cunt if 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.140
 we really want to start that way 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.910
 review is a fighting game but a 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.970
 all-female fighting game 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.490
 exact we have been strongly 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.840
 impressed by the previews we had 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.970
 seen of this game and when we have it 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.920
 purchased we thought to make one 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.079
 review very similar to those that 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.270
 we do when it comes to talking about 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.680
 a game below the news is not there 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.719
 we recommend going to see you again 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.100
 some game I know we have between her 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.520
 leaving parenthesis closed 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.930
 this is actually made of the line 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.850
 Japanese erotica see girls a lot 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.829
 low-cut panties all the parts 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.460
 let's face it, your hardline is yours 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.530
 strong, however, here the real runs 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.469
 fighting bum there is we are in front 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.780
 to a very well done fighting game e 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.180
 I would also like to see why this game 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.640
 both under the artistic profile and below 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.220
 the technical profile was addressed by 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.950
 a former capcom employee as long as he has 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.110
 then worked on several hard beats and 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.509
 even one of the residents vol 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.229
 so he knows and knows he knows why he 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.090
 made all the art direction 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.880
 created drawings and animations log in and 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.729
 even developed the part of the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.159
 of the game you are already using a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.780
 game engine dedicated to fighting games 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.880
 so probably the programming 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.040
 it won't have been the hardest thing 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.990
 in the making of this vanguard 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.520
 princes but what are the strengths 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.740
 we said of this game 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.210
 graphically if then it is a 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.100
 window so he puts it away full 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.930
 screen you see the pixels or black 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.689
 but if it is a small window 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.060
 so graphically very much impact 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.630
 very beautiful and above all very beautiful 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.670
 rich especially the backgrounds change of 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.460
 so very animated time after time 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.049
 however he was attentive to those little ones 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.000
 details that usually come 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.770
 left in the background we move on to 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.619
 gameplay is a fighting game you beat yourself 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.120
 okay though the dynamics are similar to 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.670
 those we've seen already in play 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.410
 then the exact stands to know effects 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.380
 we can choose our character 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.209
 main we can pair them instead 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.910
 couple them and since I fear neither 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.340
 we can also pair them with a stand 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.860
 woman and are younger girls 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.410
 to therefore smaller than the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.930
 main character doing action 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.150
 support in what sense 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.370
 in what sense others will have it 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.980
 moves and even we could combine them 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.250
 with the main character 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.160
 so let's say that if you play well le 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.230
 your cards you can do combos 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.670
 long enough yes yes yes very nice 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.850
 the game and there is no real one 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.130
 combo system can be chained together 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.130
 more attacks and the true core of the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.200
 fighting actually resides in the 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.750
 time choice because the characters that 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.820
 they have very different times between 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.420
 they have a lot of attack types 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.510
 different from each other but the fixed point in 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.720
 this title and the effectiveness of terri e 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.370
 perry gives you the chance to shoot a 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.530
 blow of the opponent by unbalancing him 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.820
 exact and this helps you a lot 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.579
 especially when you are put 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.590
 on the corner and it happens very often in a 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.870
 such game and so if you know 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.569
 make the most of it 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.920
 the timing of the land to succeed in 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.110
 get out 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.849
 we don't say almost unscathed from yes yes yes yes 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.069
 yes in fact perform a nice 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.860
 correctly means being able to 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.080
 definitely a hit 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.340
 this is one of the many mechanics 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.920
 of this game characters have 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.140
 lots of moves they can perform 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.989
 they have so many variables depending on which 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.700
 move the arrow keys 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.860
 thus combining tacs is a 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.239
 fighting game very similar to what 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:02.180
 could be a mark of the walls a 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.359
 me too the streetfighter of the time here 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.370
 there is the variant of your specials 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.099
 we can also create 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.280
 each character therefore has a move 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.290
 it will have its own species and I am very serious 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.780
 the species we have to say the commands 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.150
 they go a little tried in game 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.840
 because the initial impact is not gods 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.060
 best 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.889
 also because we need to understand different 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.650
 dynamics at the beginning and you will find me a 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:31.280
 slightly lost especially in the search for 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.680
 what are the interactions with the 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.750
 your second often in fact the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.000
 supporting character seemed to be 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.000
 completely useless we actually have to 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.669
 simply understand around the whirlwind 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.860
 of colored fairy lights we have 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.539
 screen must understand what is the 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.520
 function of that particular move 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.410
 this is the hardest thing about the game 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.080
 understand what some moves are but 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.639
 once you understand and even try it 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.500
 you will see in ours what jobs we have 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.300
 realized on the second channel a door 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.599
 it's understood how the moves are 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.039
 all very very effective if you guys 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:06.680
 this is a game we recommend 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.630
 it is cheap and above all it is a 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.180
 an old-school beat'em up then 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.680
 all those who are say a little 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.690
 they would like somehow 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.330
 try the thrill of the emulator of 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.830
 street fighter rather than another 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.930
 beat'em of the era can 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.550
 quietly take this game e 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.500
 try especially if they don't want to 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.500
 see the zani appraisers
