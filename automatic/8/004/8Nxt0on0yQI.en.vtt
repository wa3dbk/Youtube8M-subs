wine<00:00:17.880> aiming<00:00:18.270> directly<00:00:18.390> at<00:00:18.660> see<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.350> reason

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
wine aiming directly at see the reason

instead of World Cups from now on is

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.810 
instead of World Cups from now on is

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
because the look up spots are now

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.700 
because the look up spots are now
patched<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.900> will<00:00:25.080> just<00:00:25.109> come<00:00:25.350> directly

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
sometimes it works and sometimes it

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.900 
sometimes it works and sometimes it
doesn't<00:00:34.230> next<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.579> flag

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
doesn't next one is for the a flag

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.889 
doesn't next one is for the a flag
you're<00:00:36.090> going<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.300> want<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you're going to want to make it so the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.990 
you're going to want to make it so the
right<00:00:37.320> crosshair<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.129> right<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> middle

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
right crosshair is right in the middle

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.260 
right crosshair is right in the middle
of<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.300> tan<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:39.930> tan<00:00:40.500> tube<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.460> whatever<00:00:42.120> it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
of that tan or tan tube or whatever it

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.020 
of that tan or tan tube or whatever it
is<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.690> 10<00:00:42.960> line<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.860> goes<00:00:43.890> across<00:00:44.160> make

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
is it's a 10 line that goes across make

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.940 
is it's a 10 line that goes across make
it<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.200> middle<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
it so it's in the middle of that and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.279 
it so it's in the middle of that and
aiming<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.660> world<00:00:48.870> aim<00:00:49.110> directly

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
aiming up at a in a world aim directly

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.549 
aiming up at a in a world aim directly
on<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.879> probably<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.480> new<00:00:52.079> series

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
on this this is probably the new series

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.630 
on this this is probably the new series
that<00:00:52.590> we're<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.039> doing<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640

that we're going to be doing for the
lineup<00:00:53.940> spots<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:54.449> not<00:00:54.690> really<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> new

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
lineup spots it's not really a new

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.700 
lineup spots it's not really a new
series<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.430> technically<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.260> for<00:00:58.260> lineups

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
series but it technically is for lineups

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.470 
series but it technically is for lineups
instead<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.070> woke<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> makes<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> lot

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
instead of woke up so it makes it a lot

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900 
instead of woke up so it makes it a lot

flag the final domination flag you're
going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> want<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> make<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> bottom

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
going to want to make it so the bottom

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.460 
going to want to make it so the bottom
tip<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.540> barely<00:01:09.810> not<00:01:10.140> touching

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
tip of it is just barely not touching

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.429 
tip of it is just barely not touching
the<00:01:10.590> darker<00:01:10.950> thing<00:01:11.159> aim<00:01:11.400> directly<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:12.390> FB<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the darker thing aim directly up FB and

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.469 
the darker thing aim directly up FB and
shoot<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.820> said<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.180> don't<00:01:15.210> know

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
shoot it like I said if you don't know

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.410 
shoot it like I said if you don't know
pause<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.990> at<00:01:16.110> each<00:01:16.320> flag<00:01:16.860> spot<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:18.240> kind

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
pause it at each flag spot and just kind

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.780 
pause it at each flag spot and just kind
of<00:01:18.479> look<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.200> practice<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.400> before<00:01:20.670> you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
of look at it and practice it before you

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.789 
of look at it and practice it before you
do<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:20.939> because<00:01:21.479> there's<00:01:22.020> no<00:01:22.200> other<00:01:22.350> way<00:01:22.590> we

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
do it because there's no other way we

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.440 
do it because there's no other way we
can<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.030> was<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.330> much

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
can really get this it was so much

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.120 
can really get this it was so much
easier<00:01:24.509> when<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:25.140> could<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.439> say<00:01:25.560> woke<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.950> in

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
easier when we could just say woke up in

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.310 
easier when we could just say woke up in
the<00:01:26.220> air<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.369> shoot<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.020> really

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the air and shoot it but now it's really

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.190

metal<00:02:28.070> crate<00:02:28.490> make<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.450> top<00:02:30.220> crosshair

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
metal crate make it so the top crosshair

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.220 
metal crate make it so the top crosshair
not<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.970> very<00:02:32.300> top<00:02:32.570> but<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.840> one<00:02:32.990> going

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
not the very top but the one going

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.000
