00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.730
 here 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.280
 one 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.140
 hello everyone you russia gerda co we 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.780
 continue gutting the box from the item 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.520
 tea boxing was in this video was so good 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.560
 let's talk about lanterns 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.360
 or Cop principle is two 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.160
 almost identical lantern two 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.010
 almost identical replica pits 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.739
 120 scout light they differ only 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.560
 fastener mi-1 usual mount from another 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.040
 quick take a closer look at two 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.309
 our 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.630
 scout shurika element apparently 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.210
 for fear of customs or something else 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.050
 Iâ€™m writing a fair over here painted over with a marker 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.869
 below this too here so little 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.979
 Vodicka rubbed principle leaves it here 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.200
 match and rub quite well as 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.950
 Recently there was a new year of alcohol in the house 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.310
 left 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.910
 What is remarkable these two lanterns begin 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.160
 from the first they are on you 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:35.610
 they are annotated aluminum then new 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:38.340
 lights on good color optics modules 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.729
 here and Kirov how you see 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.930
 conventional reflector ordinary glass 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:51.299
 here's the telem over there inside summer name 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.780
 the book that's why these lanterns I wouldn't 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.210
 said that the light spot is very good 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.110
 if you compare for example with the same phoenix 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.180
 there on can look here 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.690
 their light spot has bright 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.770
 pronounced 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.940
 my head so to say flare 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.520
 big enough send lights to 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.260
 This is a problem in optics. 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.920
 This is not a serious flashlight lights 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.690
 guys this toy do not forget about it 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.210
 also on the manufacturer's website indicated that 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:27.130
 the power of these lamps is 627 lumens with 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.060
 what's on its 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.760
 the batteries here set 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.550
 two kingdoms 23 each 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.920
 they work half an hour work time i'm not 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.750
 measured because i don't have just 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.510
 fresh kingdoms 23a use 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.750
 the battery will not be entirely honest but not 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.640
 absolutely pure experiment will be but by 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.430
 power luminescence compare with the same 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.370
 for example, phoenix, well, I do not know the maximum 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.920
 250 lumens no more they are not very much and 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.870
 they are so bright in their modes of operation 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.030
 just two on and off they are all hero 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.220
 strobe no signal sauce 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.290
 no other shit there's nothing in 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.390
 immediately replaceable with them 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.900
 zhopki is ordinary crowns 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:17.550
 button but they were immediately installed 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.200
 quick- detach apologize remote buttons 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.660
 remote buttons by the way the so-called 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.470
 the second type of element is new 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:31.209
 plug if you remember reviews and bolts yet 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.650
 It stands a good old button is clicked 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.370
 amenities death in the key already 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.150
 massive now one even started 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.130
 tear me 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.980
 Well, let's charge the batteries now 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.769
 will look yes one more battery moment 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.030
 They dress up only if your head 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:56.200
 circle tyazhov then there will be a ministry and she will not 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.240
 allow you to battery a little bottom 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.310
 bag 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.100
 still pay attention to all 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.700
 battery lanterns trick element and sit down 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.100
 in the ring go on and in the head video too 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.020
 fat ring that should 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.810
 prevent lights from getting inside 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.340
 moisture and so stuck the battery now 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.810
 let about what kind of light not 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:23.280
 pulls down such a white we sew the blue 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:26.190
 now remote buttons work well and 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.850
 good but as always the Chinese pancake without 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.390
 jambs cannot generally one of two 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.720
 assholes that went under the remote button is not 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.420
 It works from the word I completely rearranged 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:44.030
 rearranged rearranged something to science 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:48.360
 I will show the limit for an hour 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:51.440
 experiment like holes got 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.440
 admission wed lights 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:08.610
 yes maybe it's because of the damage of the lace u 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:10.110
 her lace is 0 reaction if desired 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.720
 Of course, you can twist the zhopka here 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.470
 there is 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:18.660
 Swallows everything can be done but I have 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:26.850
 conquered me with me I have a panel 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:31.470
 sell big you too from item to 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:40.830
 fly how it works with a normal button with 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:42.560
 crown cheat ass all just click 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:47.430
 turned off turned off 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.410
 so on now fix them on the drive 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.530
 let's see how they keep there they are 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.140
 to inspect got up from scratch but was 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:59.070
 a little backlash flashlight new lantern it 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:01.830
 not so important because by light 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:05.510
 stream few aim at all 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:09.080
 Equal along the stream will take a look at 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.080
 Thai rail 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.920
 worth well 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:23.580
 how shit in the ice hole now look at 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:31.199
 the classic mount lantern my most 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:36.599
 probably my favorite little backlash we 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:41.789
 then well island there is a small 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:42.090
 certainly not so removable but 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:51.990
 less 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:54.289
 unpleasant so the champagne fell 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.289
 rail 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.900
 monolith 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:09.720
 these flashlights are relatively inexpensive 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.940
 Of course, the one that stands fast fast 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.420
 50 dollars over the hill the one with the fast 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:17.130
 fastening 156 principle not bad even 

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.360
 considering our dollar rate and considering 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:23.220
 characteristics of these lamps 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:25.230
 but immediately I want to fuck this shit 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.870
 lights like all the lights from the elements 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:30.330
 planted batteries if you leave in 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.310
 these batteries don't even pull them out 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.740
 if the lights don't work it has batteries 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:37.820
 sets fire to me pretty quickly sigh 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:40.110
 whether 2 facial cr123 so see for yourself 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.460
 be cool be pops play and 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:44.030
 was the Russian right to have airsoft 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.030
 Gerd Spock 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.039
 at least david
