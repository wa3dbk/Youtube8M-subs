00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.250
 The education should be on everyone 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.920
 case very well on the final exam 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.810

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.880
 that I am after training immediately 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.070
 can start from my education 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.570
 I expect the students to stop, of course 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.300
 to be conveyed that responsibility 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.600
 Also in the hotel can take good care of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:50.309
 be prepared for the job that is clear 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:53.570
 that I would like to train on the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.610
 Giving away that they are good at that 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.989
 working life after training you 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.969
 Well prepared for that 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.820
 can handle the stress then 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.440
 approaching them that they are self-employed 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 then you can work and that is 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.770
 me very important my relationship with the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.390
 Trainee is very close but with 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.899
 the certain distance 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.509
 we've had a lot in recent years 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.720
 many ideas and projects from the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.080
 training circle can integrate and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.209
 that is to 1 that is a benefit for 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.470
 the hotel and the other is that too 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:37.140
 a great experience for the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.090
 trainee susanna by one 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.490
 large part of our good degree 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.929
 which we hope to achieve because they 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.940
 really everything leads into which 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.619
 departments and what we do 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.030
 but also always accessible to us 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.890
 and if we always have problems too 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.599

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.920
 because at the same time a lot of 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.599
 you can learn 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.940
