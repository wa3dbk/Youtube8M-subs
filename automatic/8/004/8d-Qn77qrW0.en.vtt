00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 
tacky layer of gel polish so we're going

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:46.640 
tacky layer of gel polish so we're going
to<00:00:42.989> start<00:00:43.019> off<00:00:43.320> by<00:00:43.530> doing<00:00:43.589> one<00:00:44.040> coat<00:00:45.260> nice<00:00:46.260> thin

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
to start off by doing one coat nice thin

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:57.250 
to start off by doing one coat nice thin
coat<00:00:46.949> avi<00:00:47.820> gel<00:00:48.000> polish

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.500 

that<00:00:58.160> first<00:00:58.460> layer<00:00:58.730> should<00:00:58.910> always<00:00:59.179> be<00:00:59.329> nice

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
that first layer should always be nice

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.270 
that first layer should always be nice
and<00:00:59.780> thin

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.340 

and<00:01:05.150> if<00:01:05.330> you're<00:01:05.449> doing<00:01:05.659> it<00:01:05.750> over<00:01:05.869> natural

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
and if you're doing it over natural

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.350 
and if you're doing it over natural
nails<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:07.310> would<00:01:07.430> have<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.640> base<00:01:07.880> layer<00:01:08.180> on

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
nails you would have a base layer on

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.780 
nails you would have a base layer on
there<00:01:08.510> as<00:01:08.720> well<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:09.799> that<00:01:10.310> wants<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.640> go<00:01:10.760> into

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
there as well and that wants to go into

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.580 
there as well and that wants to go into
your<00:01:11.180> LED<00:01:11.659> lamp<00:01:11.930> for<00:01:12.080> 30<00:01:12.380> seconds

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.020 

so<00:01:17.579> now<00:01:17.729> we're<00:01:17.909> ready<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.240> our<00:01:18.299> second<00:01:18.780> layer

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
so now we're ready for our second layer

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:30.610 
so now we're ready for our second layer
still<00:01:21.030> keeping<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.539> nice<00:01:21.719> and<00:01:22.020> thin

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.590 

and<00:01:31.620> again<00:01:32.190> that<00:01:32.370> wants<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:32.820> into<00:01:33.060> an<00:01:33.180> LED

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
and again that wants to go into an LED

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.250 
and again that wants to go into an LED
lamp<00:01:33.870> for<00:01:34.020> 30<00:01:34.320> seconds

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.180 

so<00:01:38.160> that<00:01:38.310> second<00:01:38.700> layer

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
so that second layer

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.250 
so that second layer
had<00:01:39.280> its<00:01:39.430> full<00:01:39.700> cure<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.690> we're<00:01:40.810> going<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.050> use

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
had its full cure and we're going to use

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.390 
had its full cure and we're going to use
an<00:01:41.530> n<00:01:42.100> SI<00:01:42.430> size<00:01:42.760> 5<00:01:43.120> brush<00:01:43.800> dip<00:01:44.800> it<00:01:44.950> into<00:01:45.130> the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
an n SI size 5 brush dip it into the

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.920 
an n SI size 5 brush dip it into the
pigment<00:01:45.820> you<00:01:45.940> don't<00:01:46.150> need<00:01:46.300> a<00:01:46.360> massive<00:01:46.690> amount

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
pigment you don't need a massive amount

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.250 
pigment you don't need a massive amount
so<00:01:47.350> really<00:01:47.710> small<00:01:48.010> amounts<00:01:48.400> on<00:01:48.520> your<00:01:48.670> brush

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260
