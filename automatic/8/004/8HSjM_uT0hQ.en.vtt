 never 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.259
 I want that done to advance a 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.750
 a little bit of time what is unique 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.820
 it's a merengue we've already declared the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.840
 eggs we have added sugar and we have 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.190
 worked a merengue that now you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.509
 we will give two laps to leave a 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.720
 a little firmer and smarter 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.789
 ok what we do is quickly 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.689
 chocolate melted chocolate what 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.689
 we melted where 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.149
 the microwave thinks so look at the most 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.190
 quick is to do it in the microwave like you 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.570
 you say but there is always someone remakes a 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.719
 little to work with some microwaves 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.219
 I then good there are no problems and if 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.540
 there is someone who does not like it 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.100
 work with microwaves but what 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.640
 You can do the bain-marie like you 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.640
 the old ones 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.610
 ancient 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:02.120
 of heart account better favor of this 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.030
 this company is because that country sucre 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.440
 look after in sucre we are a school 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.840
 exclusively from restaurant poles 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.700
 We founded 13 years ago the first 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.340
 dessert restaurant of the world you can 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.380
 come to eat exclusively menus of 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.119
 desserts and you can do well 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.070
 eat eat just a five-menu 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.500
 desserts to do is add the is clear 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.869
 ok we'll have the most violent and 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.690
 envelopes correct how about that from time to time 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.190
 in when the claritas here good ok 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.190
 pulling I love I love it 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.340
 and so we're going to throw it in a couple of 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.079
 Sometimes if I get it wrong it's your fault because 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.759
 let's do let's stretch a 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.729
 planchita let's make a thin plate 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.259
 fine fine though then when we throw 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.939
 thin plates have to be about 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.270
 strong when we throw your biscuits 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.039
 thick ones have to be some teeth this 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.220
 same recipe mani we now go to 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.220
 do 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.180
 here more or less list we have to paper 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.080
 star that is also here ready 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.940
 this one is already preheated and ready but 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.740
 we can know this same cake 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.120
 in a mold or if it is called from home 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.209
 he wants to do ironing he cooks in a 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.030
 mold and do not throw a mold temperature 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.730
 lowest ok and we have them three minutes 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.410
 to finish already 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.360
 we take the iron and we start this is 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.940
 an interesting step is also a 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.860
 system that professionals use 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.050
 we are that to stretch the iron 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.180
 we expose a role of star we put 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.800
 a paper we put some rules that are 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.690
 some stops that in this case have medium 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.850
 inch thick we throw the dough 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.300
 here and with this system we are going to 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.130
 get a perfect iron from it 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.660
 Thick you see, now what I do is throw 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.489
 the biscuit that on top of the paper 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.980
 star and what the guide does that has 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.150
 this half inch thick in this 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.489
 griddle 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.599
 what do you think and then what will happen to 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.340
 a tray 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.340

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:15.050
 cute and very practical also perfect 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.310
