00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.749 
overpowered so that's why it's on the
left<00:01:40.829> hand<00:01:41.040> side<00:01:41.189> also<00:01:42.920> it's<00:01:43.920> bad<00:01:44.220> defensive

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
left hand side also it's bad defensive

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.149 
left hand side also it's bad defensive
mid<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.420> fixin<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:47.009> how<00:01:47.130> you

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
mid we have fixin I think that's how you

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.580 
mid we have fixin I think that's how you
pronounce<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:47.909> got<00:01:48.030> 83<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:49.380> he's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
pronounce it but it's got 83 know he's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.340 
pronounce it but it's got 83 know he's
got<00:01:49.740> 80<00:01:50.009> pace<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.700> 83<00:01:51.630> strength<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.049> believe

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
got 80 pace and 83 strength I believe

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.010 
got 80 pace and 83 strength I believe
and<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.460> that's<00:01:53.790> why<00:01:53.970> he's<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.390> team<00:01:54.600> he's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and so that's why he's in the team he's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.510 
and so that's why he's in the team he's
the<00:01:55.200> start<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.619> strong<00:01:55.950> players<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.399> this

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the start of the strong players on this

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.450 
the start of the strong players on this
team<00:01:56.729> at<00:01:57.000> centre-back<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.829> quarry<00:01:59.219> or
