00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
see it's only been two pickles that I

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.920 
see it's only been two pickles that I
dare<00:03:18.860> not<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.610> third<00:03:19.910> out<00:03:20.209> of<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:20.480> whole<00:03:20.660> pack

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
dare not the third out of the whole pack

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.500 
dare not the third out of the whole pack
I<00:03:21.580> didn't<00:03:22.580> really<00:03:22.670> think<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.330> third

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
I didn't really think that the third

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.370 
I didn't really think that the third
will<00:03:23.660> be<00:03:23.690> necessary<00:03:24.320> it<00:03:24.890> just<00:03:25.840> say<00:03:26.840> no<00:03:27.050> she<00:03:27.110> run

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
will be necessary it just say no she run

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.290 
will be necessary it just say no she run
out<00:03:27.530> there<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:28.010> green<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.340> green<00:03:28.790> just<00:03:29.150> the

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
out there to green the green just the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.240 
out there to green the green just the
only<00:03:29.510> thing<00:03:29.690> they<00:03:29.780> change<00:03:30.019> was<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.230> also<00:03:30.500> is

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
only thing they change was to also is

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.160 
only thing they change was to also is
throw<00:03:31.550> a<00:03:31.580> little<00:03:31.760> bit<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.000> creativity<00:03:32.720> there

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
throw a little bit of creativity there

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.130 
throw a little bit of creativity there
and<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:34.160> really<00:03:34.459> think<00:03:34.670> these<00:03:35.090> two<00:03:35.420> put<00:03:35.810> all<00:03:35.989> the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
and I really think these two put all the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.620 
and I really think these two put all the
rush<00:03:36.350> it<00:03:36.560> runs<00:03:36.769> in<00:03:36.980> us<00:03:37.100> as<00:03:37.670> a<00:03:37.730> separation

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
rush it runs in us as a separation

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.330 
rush it runs in us as a separation
towards<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.140> other<00:03:39.290> rocha<00:03:39.620> runs<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.190> know

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
towards the other rocha runs you know

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.170 
towards the other rocha runs you know
and<00:03:40.640> these<00:03:41.080> will<00:03:42.080> pretty<00:03:42.620> much<00:03:42.709> it's<00:03:43.459> like<00:03:43.670> you

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
and these will pretty much it's like you
