00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.849 

hmm<00:00:01.490> so<00:00:02.490> I<00:00:02.520> just<00:00:02.879> saw<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.810> H<00:00:04.110> method<00:00:04.589> for

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
hmm so I just saw the H method for

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.440 
hmm so I just saw the H method for
taping<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.490> thought<00:00:05.670> it<00:00:05.759> was<00:00:05.819> really<00:00:06.089> good

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
taping and I thought it was really good

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.830 
taping and I thought it was really good
except<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.109> has<00:00:08.010> one<00:00:08.370> flaw<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:09.330> relying<00:00:09.660> on

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
except that has one flaw to relying on

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.030 
except that has one flaw to relying on
the<00:00:09.929> integrity<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.679> tape<00:00:11.990> to<00:00:12.990> support<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
the integrity of the tape to support the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.010 
the integrity of the tape to support the
tendon<00:00:14.490> no<00:00:15.120> tape<00:00:15.420> as<00:00:15.660> we<00:00:15.780> know<00:00:16.400> stretches<00:00:17.400> and

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
tendon no tape as we know stretches and

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.679 
tendon no tape as we know stretches and
really<00:00:19.020> doesn't<00:00:19.859> have<00:00:20.310> much<00:00:20.699> integrity<00:00:21.359> on

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
really doesn't have much integrity on

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.200 
really doesn't have much integrity on
the<00:00:21.779> outside<00:00:22.170> edges<00:00:22.670> so<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> tend<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.090> to

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the outside edges so I tend to like to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.099 
the outside edges so I tend to like to
use<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.779> tape<00:00:24.990> as<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> cast<00:00:25.640> now<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:27.109> would

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
use the tape as a cast now I would

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.349 
use the tape as a cast now I would
combine<00:00:28.260> using<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> H<00:00:29.070> method<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:29.939> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
combine using the H method with a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.889 
combine using the H method with a
casting<00:00:31.109> method<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.529> i'm<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.830> show

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
casting method that i'm going to show

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.299 
casting method that i'm going to show
let's<00:00:33.899> go<00:00:34.050> over<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> tooth<00:00:34.590> pulley<00:00:34.950> with<00:00:35.160> it

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
let's go over the a tooth pulley with it

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.240 
let's go over the a tooth pulley with it
what<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.660> get<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.860> distal

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
what I do is I like to get to the distal

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.970 
what I do is I like to get to the distal
reaches<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> pulley<00:00:39.590> bring<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.710> tape

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
reaches of the pulley bring on the tape

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.910 
reaches of the pulley bring on the tape
in<00:00:41.600> pretty<00:00:42.600> close<00:00:43.789> to<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.820> joint<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:45.920> I

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
in pretty close to the joint and then I

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.410 
in pretty close to the joint and then I
will<00:00:47.190> wrap<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.820> twice<00:00:48.890> internet<00:00:50.420> around

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
will wrap it twice internet around

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.569 
will wrap it twice internet around
getting<00:00:51.809> really<00:00:52.350> close<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.190> crotch<00:00:53.550> of

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
getting really close to the crotch of

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.479 
getting really close to the crotch of
the<00:00:53.760> finger<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:55.079> half<00:00:55.649> lap<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.160> all<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the finger and then half lap it all the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.180 
the finger and then half lap it all the
way<00:00:56.550> up<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.270> joint<00:00:58.489> and<00:01:00.350> I'll<00:01:01.350> fold<00:01:02.039> my

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
way up to the joint and I'll fold my

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.139 
way up to the joint and I'll fold my
couple<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> don't<00:01:02.609> want<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:02.969> too

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
couple you don't want to do this too

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.320 
couple you don't want to do this too
tight<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.539> keep<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.780> circulation<00:01:04.470> I'll<00:01:05.460> get

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
tight to keep the circulation I'll get

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.130 
tight to keep the circulation I'll get
to<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> knuckle<00:01:08.510> that<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> knuckle<00:01:09.960> right

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to the knuckle that the knuckle right

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.700 
to the knuckle that the knuckle right
where<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> creases<00:01:10.799> are<00:01:11.010> getting<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> camera

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
where the creases are getting the camera

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
where the creases are getting the camera
I'm<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> half<00:01:14.250> rapid<00:01:14.850> again<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> double

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
I'm going to half rapid again a double

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.850 
I'm going to half rapid again a double
wrap<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.200> again<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:21.110> want<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.259> take<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.560> as

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
wrap it again I want to take that as

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.719 
wrap it again I want to take that as
you're<00:01:23.040> pulling<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.640> don't

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you're pulling it like this you don't

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.630 
you're pulling it like this you don't
want<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.119> too<00:01:24.270> tight<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.490> you're<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
want to get too tight so you're going to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.090 
want to get too tight so you're going to
wrap<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.000> double<00:01:27.900> wrap<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.259> there<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:29.009> I'm

wrap it double wrap it there what I'm

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.560 
wrap it double wrap it there what I'm
trying<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.310> do<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.460> support<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:32.150> distal<00:01:33.150> edges

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
trying to do is support the distal edges

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.999 
trying to do is support the distal edges
of<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.869> 10<00:01:34.439> tendon<00:01:35.280> or<00:01:35.430> ligament<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.799> i<00:01:37.799> will

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
of that 10 tendon or ligament and i will

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.660 
of that 10 tendon or ligament and i will
make<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> cast<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.979> i'm<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.220> back<00:01:41.430> I

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
make a cast and i'm going to go back I

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.569 
make a cast and i'm going to go back I
depending<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.720> how<00:01:43.649> lazy<00:01:43.979> i<00:01:44.189> am<00:01:44.369> i<00:01:44.460> will

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
depending on how lazy i am i will

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.060 
depending on how lazy i am i will
through<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.090> three<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.540> four<00:01:45.750> times

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
through this up to three or four times

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.530 
through this up to three or four times
but<00:01:47.070> we're<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.250> going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> go<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.790> two<00:01:48.030> there

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
but we're just going to go the two there

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.899 
but we're just going to go the two there
and<00:01:51.229> so<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:53.130> end<00:01:53.310> up<00:01:53.490> with<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.479> tape<00:01:55.909> covering

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
and so we end up with the tape covering

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.300 
and so we end up with the tape covering
down<00:01:57.750> low<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.110> up<00:01:58.469> high<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.979> then<00:01:59.100> i<00:01:59.130> will

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
down low and up high and then i will

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.980 
down low and up high and then i will
roll<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.700> back<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.390> little<00:02:00.420> bit<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:00.960> I

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
roll it back just a little bit for so I

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.120 
roll it back just a little bit for so I
have<00:02:01.170> some<00:02:01.229> movement<00:02:02.450> in<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> knuckle<00:02:04.130> I'm

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
have some movement in the knuckle I'm

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.790 
have some movement in the knuckle I'm
just<00:02:05.219> going<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.460> roll<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.759> back

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
just going to roll it back

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.060 
just going to roll it back
up<00:02:07.190> here<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.330> have<00:02:08.510> some<00:02:08.540> Roman<00:02:08.930> just<00:02:09.890> the

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
up here so I have some Roman just the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.720 
up here so I have some Roman just the
edges<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.760> little<00:02:10.940> bit<00:02:11.860> now<00:02:12.860> see<00:02:13.520> how<00:02:13.610> it's

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
edges a little bit now see how it's

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.010 
edges a little bit now see how it's
tight<00:02:13.970> on<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.210> top<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.510> knuckle<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.810> want<00:02:14.960> to

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
tight on the top and knuckle I want to

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.190 
tight on the top and knuckle I want to
just<00:02:15.110> roll<00:02:15.470> that<00:02:15.740> back<00:02:16.040> just<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.640> little<00:02:16.670> bit<00:02:17.200> so

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
just roll that back just a little bit so

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.380 
just roll that back just a little bit so
I<00:02:18.230> have<00:02:18.380> movement<00:02:18.560> now<00:02:19.370> if<00:02:19.490> you<00:02:19.610> notice<00:02:22.390> you

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
I have movement now if you notice you

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.920 
I have movement now if you notice you
can't<00:02:23.780> move<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:25.700> crimp<00:02:26.000> hands<00:02:26.300> down<00:02:26.750> is

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
can't move the crimp hands down is

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.080 
can't move the crimp hands down is
acting<00:02:27.230> as<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.350> cast<00:02:27.710> what's<00:02:28.580> happening<00:02:29.000> is

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
acting as a cast what's happening is

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.760 
acting as a cast what's happening is
when<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.330> squeeze<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.930> tissues<00:02:30.380> inside

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
when you squeeze it the tissues inside

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.310 
when you squeeze it the tissues inside
get<00:02:31.100> expanded<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:32.000> actually<00:02:32.690> help<00:02:32.870> support

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
get expanded and actually help support

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.310 
get expanded and actually help support
now<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.190> two<00:02:34.580> major<00:02:34.790> areas<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.690> are<00:02:36.110> being

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
now the two major areas that are being

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.390 
now the two major areas that are being
supported<00:02:36.770> are<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:39.350> lower<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.280> upper

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
supported are the lower and the upper

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.880 
supported are the lower and the upper
part<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.030> tape<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.900> inside<00:02:42.320> is<00:02:42.350> actually

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
part of the tape the inside is actually

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.980 
part of the tape the inside is actually
thinner<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:43.970> we<00:02:44.060> have<00:02:44.180> most<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.540> our<00:02:44.660> support

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
thinner so we have most of our support

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.540 
thinner so we have most of our support
here<00:02:45.170> motors<00:02:45.710> boyer<00:02:45.980> now<00:02:46.100> if<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.250> combine

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
here motors boyer now if you combine

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.200 
here motors boyer now if you combine
this<00:02:46.730> with<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.420> H<00:02:47.600> method<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:49.880> would<00:02:50.000> have

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
this with the H method you would have

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.540 
this with the H method you would have
the<00:02:51.080> tape<00:02:51.290> going<00:02:51.590> up<00:02:51.830> underneath<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.520> then

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
the tape going up underneath and then

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:01.300 
the tape going up underneath and then
into<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:57.670> a4<00:02:58.670> pulley<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.950> different<00:03:00.950> remember

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
into the a4 pulley a different remember

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.210 
into the a4 pulley a different remember
that<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:03.020> think<00:03:03.110> casting<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:03.950> like<00:03:04.070> this

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
that so I think casting it like this

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.240 
that so I think casting it like this
combined<00:03:04.670> with<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.910> method<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:06.010> really<00:03:07.010> good

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
combined with that method is really good

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.070 
combined with that method is really good
and<00:03:07.490> I'm<00:03:07.970> going<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.120> put<00:03:08.240> this<00:03:08.300> up<00:03:08.570> just<00:03:08.810> to

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
and I'm going to put this up just to

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.120 
and I'm going to put this up just to
show<00:03:09.260> people<00:03:09.290> what<00:03:09.620> I<00:03:09.650> was<00:03:09.770> talking<00:03:09.980> about

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
show people what I was talking about

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
show people what I was talking about
when<00:03:10.520> I<00:03:10.580> commented<00:03:12.310> but<00:03:13.310> in<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.640> mobility

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
when I commented but in the mobility

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
when I commented but in the mobility
you'll<00:03:14.810> see<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:16.610> can<00:03:16.760> still<00:03:17.150> open<00:03:17.570> hand<00:03:17.900> crimp

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
you'll see you can still open hand crimp

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.540 
you'll see you can still open hand crimp
which<00:03:18.470> is<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.620> lot<00:03:18.860> healthier<00:03:19.100> for<00:03:19.820> climbing

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
which is a lot healthier for climbing

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.979 
which is a lot healthier for climbing
here's<00:03:22.550> your<00:03:24.310> here's<00:03:25.310> your<00:03:25.430> edge<00:03:25.820> and<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.840> can

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
here's your here's your edge and you can

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.390 
here's your here's your edge and you can
still<00:03:28.120> get<00:03:29.120> an<00:03:29.330> open<00:03:29.570> hand<00:03:29.930> crimp<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:31.160> can't

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
still get an open hand crimp you can't

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.340 
still get an open hand crimp you can't
quite<00:03:31.670> give<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.000> ball<00:03:32.360> crimp<00:03:32.810> because<00:03:33.200> it's

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
quite give a ball crimp because it's

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.590 
quite give a ball crimp because it's
going<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.560> stop<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.489> movement<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:35.060> as<00:03:35.420> you

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
going to stop the movement and as you

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.520 
going to stop the movement and as you
stop<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.020> movement<00:03:36.200> it's<00:03:38.050> going<00:03:39.050> to<00:03:39.110> restrict

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
stop the movement it's going to restrict

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.020 
stop the movement it's going to restrict
the<00:03:39.650> circulation<00:03:40.220> greater<00:03:40.370> squeezing<00:03:40.850> on<00:03:40.940> the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
the circulation greater squeezing on the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.850 
the circulation greater squeezing on the
tape<00:03:41.239> but<00:03:42.080> you're<00:03:42.200> going<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.350> constantly<00:03:42.680> open

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
tape but you're going to constantly open

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.979 
tape but you're going to constantly open
up<00:03:42.950> when<00:03:43.070> you're<00:03:43.220> relaxed<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.180> want<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:44.450> do<00:03:44.540> do

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
up when you're relaxed you want to do do

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.740 
up when you're relaxed you want to do do
a<00:03:45.260> little<00:03:46.040> check<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:47.030> see<00:03:47.209> how<00:03:47.300> much<00:03:47.450> blood

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
a little check to see how much blood

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.020 
a little check to see how much blood
flow<00:03:48.110> and<00:03:48.140> see<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.680> pink<00:03:48.980> comes<00:03:49.310> right<00:03:49.550> back

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
flow and see the pink comes right back

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.360 
flow and see the pink comes right back
pretty<00:03:50.900> quick<00:03:51.170> let's<00:03:51.800> compare<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.310> to

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
pretty quick let's compare that to

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.229 
pretty quick let's compare that to
another<00:03:52.820> finger<00:03:53.450> I<00:03:54.910> don't<00:03:55.910> know<00:03:55.970> if<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:56.150> can

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
another finger I don't know if you can

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.800 
another finger I don't know if you can
see<00:03:56.480> that<00:03:56.510> as<00:03:56.750> well<00:03:56.930> as<00:03:57.080> I<00:03:57.200> can<00:03:57.910> hopefully<00:03:58.910> it

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
see that as well as I can hopefully it

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.670 
see that as well as I can hopefully it
explains<00:04:00.230> what<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.470> was<00:04:00.650> talking<00:04:00.830> about<00:04:01.010> thanks
