00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.450
 when a pet comes to the house 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.140
 there are several that we have to have in 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.300
 account for example is puppy needs 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.880
 your vaccines need a calendar of 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.189
 vaccination so that the puppy does not 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.900
 sick who is in good health is 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.400
 you have to apply vaccines the doctor will 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.710
 he is saying he is programming the 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.660
 following vaccines that usually every 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.050
 doctor leads to your calendar can be 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.300
 5 vaccines can be 4 vaccines and also 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.879
 Deworming is very important 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.839
 the puppies and since they arrive at 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.999
 moment that they are part of a family 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.039
 deworming along with others 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:50.440
 care as they are the food that should 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.780
 of being three times a day when they are 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.960
 puppies its water that is indispensable 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.069
 that it never lacks that is clean and 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:03.300
 also other care as not to leave 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:05.640
 eat garbage do not let them eat papers 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.040
 and not take them out to the street so they do not 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.840
 get sick until they are not 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.810
 completely vaccinated 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.109
 take care of them when you are going to adapt a 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.140
 necklace or when I teach them to walk 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:22.329
 on a leash at home or when they go 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.340
 to get them vaccinated that they 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.050
 teach to ride on a leash as it is very 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.420
 important 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.030
 know how to do it so that the puppy 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.100
 Do not be afraid of the leash or not 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.130
 we are going to be pulling and the project 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.020
 do not want to walk to educate the 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.420
 animals to the puppies when they arrive 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.690
 to the house for example so that they do not 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.910
 from the bathroom anywhere a puppy 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.490
 it's always going to be from the bathroom 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.370
 in many places and many times because no 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.760
 they have control of their sphincter but it's 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.980
 very important to know that always when 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.110
 they finish eating and when they wake up 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.510
 do the bathroom usually then 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.490
 there we can begin to educate them when 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.770
 finish eating take them to the place they 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.470
 we have already chosen so that the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.020
 little animal make the bathroom and it will go 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.540
 slowly getting used a little to the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.790
 brother the recommended age to carry 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.030
 a puppy home it is both 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.910
 months 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.010
 that would be when the dog is supposed to 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.080
 he would already be dewormed and when 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.600
 can start with a calendar of 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.600
 vaccination 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.910
 as the veterinarian will indicate 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.000
 Many people dance from before but 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.180
 they also have to give them more care 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.430
 normal would be two months and up 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.310
 at the moment that we have already 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.740
 acquired a puppy because it will form 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.480
 part of the family 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.320
 the reception that should be given in 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.200
 well then you should download good and 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.800
 well and it has to be a process so that 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.320
 the little animal adapts this was the 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.080
 animalito reality now that is in 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.210
 speak a way if the animal of some 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.340
 place that is very cold then have it 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.100
 be adapted and we will do it to a place 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.950
 that is the warmer we have to have him 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.020
 your water available we have to 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.330
 be in keep with him so that he goes 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.230
 getting used to the noise to people to 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.230
 the people who go 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.810
 the space also very strange because there 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.959
 many people who want to capture great and 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.150
 your house is very small we need 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:35.670
 in advance to know what puppy we are going to 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.129
 acquire according to the space you have and 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.349
 the care we are going to give and for 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.799
 what we want because we can not 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:48.030
 carry a Great Dane to a house 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:50.370
 legal for example we have to carry 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.409
 mourn that years even spatial it be 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.180
 adequate or if we have a very space 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.180
 We can carry a large puppy
