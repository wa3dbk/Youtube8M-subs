00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.070
 only how am I going to show what I did 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:12.070
 a small processor 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.070
 that is, several lots of parts 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.360
 do not use several 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.460
 of these plates 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.119
 and units 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.119
 if we can 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.290
 extra gas are damaged 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.160
 and good 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.160
 since then from here 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:45.510
 so what did they do up here 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.859
 place an engine 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.859
 in this perfection 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:00.749
 I used 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:08.670
 and this one 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.530
 saw tray the truth use three 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.930
 and besides that 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.680
 and says one of the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.470
 of the units to make 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.920
 has a movement only in this 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.540
 replace case here 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.610
 the engine for a 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.180
 for a serbo 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.180
 here 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.520
 then a small engine 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.520
 and good 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.500
 the second part 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.500
 then it is mounted here 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.600
 how can you tell 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:57.350
 until the tray would be 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.630
 and so it would be x 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.970
 I would accept 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.630
 once the engines 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.630
 and down 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.870
 and here 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.890
 although at the moment it only has 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.660
 that the circuit that I did was the 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.140
 following 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.440
 only the two 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.350
 push buttons 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.220
 for left for right 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.470
 one of 292 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.590
 the program well always 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.400
 if they have end then it generates a 0 1 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.670
 if you have 15 2 then generate 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.640
 117 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.650
 okay 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.650
 let's see then how it works 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.710
 we connect the source 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.370
 promoting ok 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.370
 in this case 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.170
 and yet 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.170
 the x axis in a problem 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.329
 but 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.590
 but I have 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.000
 and that would be all 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.920
 it's called interface and good a little 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.470
 simulation 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.690
 It is made here 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.569
 only peak 12 signals what I hope 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.770
 what you liked 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:11.260
 the cnc communities of sidrÃ³n 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:16.530
 and the control part is still missing but 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.530
 and that will be later and see you soon
