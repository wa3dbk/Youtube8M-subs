is the i know how to be aggressive or

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.420 
is the i know how to be aggressive or
defensive<00:02:25.989> coming<00:02:26.769> in<00:02:26.860> from<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.099> campaign

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.190 
defensive coming in from the campaign
map<00:02:27.640> well<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.120> will<00:02:28.180> have<00:02:28.390> certain<00:02:28.630> objectives

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
map well it will have certain objectives

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.470 
map well it will have certain objectives
to<00:02:29.319> complete<00:02:29.349> now<00:02:30.280> those<00:02:30.790> objectives<00:02:31.299> we've

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
to complete now those objectives we've

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.210 
to complete now those objectives we've
loosened<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.989> coupling<00:02:32.410> between<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.890> two<00:02:33.040> so

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
loosened a coupling between the two so

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.190 
loosened a coupling between the two so
that<00:02:33.400> they<00:02:33.790> as<00:02:33.940> now<00:02:34.150> should<00:02:34.630> be<00:02:34.660> more<00:02:34.930> flexible

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
that they as now should be more flexible

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.289 
that they as now should be more flexible
so<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.400> if<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:36.819> completely

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
so that is if it's completely

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.270 
so that is if it's completely

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
outnumbered on the attack it might be a

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.910

by<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.170> whole<00:03:47.470> load<00:03:47.740> of<00:03:47.770> archers<00:03:48.340> who<00:03:48.670> are

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
by a whole load of archers who are

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.310 
by a whole load of archers who are
hidden<00:03:48.940> in<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.210> trees<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.750> they're<00:03:50.020> hitting

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
hidden in the trees and they're hitting

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.020 
hidden in the trees and they're hitting
me<00:03:50.410> with<00:03:50.500> these<00:03:50.620> horrible<00:03:51.040> fire<00:03:51.400> arrows<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.940> do

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
me with these horrible fire arrows to do

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.850 
me with these horrible fire arrows to do
a<00:03:52.060> ton<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.330> damage<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:52.960> have<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.470> decent<00:03:53.710> amount

a ton of damage and have a decent amount

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.040 
a ton of damage and have a decent amount
of<00:03:54.040> range<00:03:54.310> so<00:03:54.550> my<00:03:54.790> entire<00:03:55.030> cavalry<00:03:55.510> charge<00:03:55.810> is

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
of range so my entire cavalry charge is

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.170 
of range so my entire cavalry charge is
decimated<00:03:56.950> before<00:03:57.250> it<00:03:57.340> reaches<00:03:57.610> it's<00:03:57.760> goal<00:03:57.820> is

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
decimated before it reaches it's goal is

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.940 
decimated before it reaches it's goal is
this<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.420> common<00:03:58.630> thing<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.140> see<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.440> AI<00:03:59.530> use

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
this a common thing to see the AI use

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.320 
this a common thing to see the AI use

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
sneak them around the back and see if I

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.560 
sneak them around the back and see if I
can<00:04:36.920> attack<00:04:37.220> using<00:04:37.580> my<00:04:37.670> cavalry<00:04:38.090> from<00:04:38.480> a

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
can attack using my cavalry from a

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.300 
can attack using my cavalry from a
hidden<00:04:38.750> position<00:04:39.320> I'm<00:04:39.590> hoping<00:04:39.920> this<00:04:40.160> is

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
hidden position I'm hoping this is

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.740 
hidden position I'm hoping this is
attacking<00:04:40.730> what<00:04:40.820> will<00:04:40.970> work<00:04:41.120> on<00:04:41.360> some

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
attacking what will work on some

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.750 
attacking what will work on some
occasion<00:04:42.110> if<00:04:42.230> you've<00:04:42.380> got<00:04:42.560> speed<00:04:42.830> yes<00:04:43.190> awesome

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
occasion if you've got speed yes awesome

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.730 
occasion if you've got speed yes awesome
so<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.390> AI<00:04:44.480> can<00:04:44.780> actually<00:04:45.020> be<00:04:45.080> taken<00:04:45.350> by

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
so the AI can actually be taken by

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.600 
so the AI can actually be taken by
surprise<00:04:45.800> it's<00:04:46.250> not<00:04:46.340> going<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.520> know

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
surprise it's not going to know

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.830 
surprise it's not going to know
