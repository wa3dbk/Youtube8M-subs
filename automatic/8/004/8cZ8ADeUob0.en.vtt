denim shirt that I wear with a lot of

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.559 
denim shirt that I wear with a lot of
things<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.579> really<00:02:49.879> like<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.150> look<00:02:50.299> of<00:02:50.420> it

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
things and I really like the look of it

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.690 
things and I really like the look of it
and<00:02:50.840> especially<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:51.950> it's<00:02:52.069> big<00:02:52.280> for<00:02:52.310> some

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
and especially that it's big for some

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.369 
and especially that it's big for some
things<00:02:52.970> but<00:02:53.090> sometimes<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.930> just<00:02:53.989> want

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
things but sometimes I just want

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.220 
things but sometimes I just want
something<00:02:54.769> a<00:02:54.980> little<00:02:55.189> more<00:02:56.109> put<00:02:57.109> together

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
something a little more put together

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.990 
something a little more put together
looking<00:02:57.859> and<00:02:58.099> I<00:02:58.159> think<00:02:58.400> this<00:02:58.579> will<00:02:58.790> do<00:02:58.970> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
looking and I think this will do the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.390 
looking and I think this will do the
trick<00:02:59.120> because<00:02:59.569> it<00:02:59.810> is<00:03:00.049> a<00:03:00.439> jacket<00:03:01.099> it's<00:03:01.280> not

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
trick because it is a jacket it's not

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.240 
trick because it is a jacket it's not
just<00:03:01.579> a<00:03:01.669> big<00:03:01.879> shirt<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:03.769> can<00:03:03.919> just<00:03:03.950> wear

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
just a big shirt and I can just wear

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.890 
just a big shirt and I can just wear
this<00:03:04.400> with<00:03:04.639> skirts<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.299> stuff<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.750> it'll

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
this with skirts and stuff and it'll

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.479 
this with skirts and stuff and it'll
actually<00:03:06.139> look<00:03:06.470> cute<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:06.919> not<00:03:07.069> just<00:03:07.220> like<00:03:07.370> I

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
actually look cute and not just like I

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.129 
actually look cute and not just like I
