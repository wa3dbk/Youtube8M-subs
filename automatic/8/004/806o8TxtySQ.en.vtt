00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.280
 cyberport presents the new htc power 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.750
 the htc one has already last year 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.719
 with its outstanding features 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.670
 and functions convinced therefore could 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.990
 the flagship from taiwan to right 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.070
 in the list of the best smartphones 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.740
 classify 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.449
 the one m8 is supposed to be this success story 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.910
 now continue consistently 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:29.400
 if that works we will find it now 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:32.820
 out that of m 8 is 14 6 cm high 7 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.579
 cm wide and 9 3 millimeters deep at 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.980
 a total weight of 160 grams 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.550
 The display is 5 inches tall and offers 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.140
 us a full hd resolution of 1920 x 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.270
 1080 pixels 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.480
 the heart of the device forms 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.600
 Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor with 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.420
 four cores each supported by 2 3 ghz 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.699
 of two gigabytes of RAM 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.120
 application memory is 16 gigabytes in size 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.850
 but can by means of micro sd and up to 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.040
 128 gb to be expanded 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.110
 as with the predecessor htc sets again 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.030
 on a very high quality housing 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.260
 aluminum the edges are now 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.450
 but a bit rounder 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.070
 The housing is a little longer 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.900
 another difference is that now too 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.790
 the buttons are made of metal and not anymore 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.710
 composing plastic says it and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.780
 modified convex shaped back 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.630
 results in a very pleasant hold 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.220
 feel the light weight of 160 grams 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.829
 as well as the great quality of workmanship 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.020
 complete the perfect package 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.640
 thumbs up 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.890
 The display has grown a bit 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.000
 namely from 47 to 5 inches 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.370
 screen diagonal 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.060
 it still resolves in full hd 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.370
 a pixeldichte of 441 ppi the picture 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.830
 is therefore absolutely sharp and crisp the 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.850
 Contrast and color values â€‹â€‹are also 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.310
 above average 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.840
 as well as the viewing angle stability 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.729
 the brightness is about 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.600
 a best but a good one 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.790
 Result 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.580
 All in all, we have nothing to say 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.979
 complain about the performance has htc 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.520
 currently the best processor for mobile 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.000
 terminals install the snapdragon 801 from 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.670
 Qualcomm 2 3 gigahertz with four cores each 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.590
 ensure the absolute power stutter 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.760
 or loading difficulties are so good 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.520
 as not available 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.830
 so that's one m8 for future 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.230
 compute-intensive programs very well 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.510
 prepared we are excited 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.300
 the operating system comes the new 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.489
 android 4.4 point 2 called kitkat for 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.370
 this was supplemented with the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.620
 also new user interface sense 6 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.989
 purely visually, the os makes 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.310
 a nice and slim impression 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.239
 the functions have also 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.100
 some changed 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.170
 so can the flashing feed home now 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.540
 individualized or even easier 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.760
 There are also completely removed 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.430
 the new motion lounge with the one 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.570
 in the eighth also on gesture control 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.459
 reacts to examples 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.860
 tapping your finger twice on it 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.269
 display it will unlock the same 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.040
 happens even if you on the 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.080
 disabled screen from the bottom to 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.640
 is above 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.770
 on the other hand, wiping from left to right 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.260
 right appears flashing missing 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.120
 further wish from top to bottom 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.230
 the voice control opens the whole 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.000
 works so well 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.350
 Both the operating system and the 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.520
 Control harmonize perfectly 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.910
 together 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.250
 we give the best grade we come back 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.920
 to the hardware for the application memory 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.320
 we have 16 gb available 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.030
 but about 6 gigabytes are already occupied 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.280
 this is for a high end smartphone 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.200
 This category is not enough space 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.620
 however, one can be comforted 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.870
 micro sd card plug in up to 128 gb 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.170
 are supported for communication 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.700
 Wlan lte hspa + nfc bluetooth 4.0 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.760
 gps and infrared ready 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.770
 class made at the camera has become 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.510
 the manufacturer from taiwan still something 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.520
 to come up with something special and 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.500
 two image sensors installed 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.420
 The main camera solves with four 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.790
 megapixel on the second with 2 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.709
 megapixel this does not sound like it at first 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.540
 especially a lot but a high resolution 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.380
 does not equal an equally high 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.690
 quality 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.090
 the four megapixel cam makes like the 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.620
 predecessor very nice pictures in light 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.700
 poor conditions is the noise 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.830
 relatively low 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.230
 If it gets too dark, the built-in helps 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.880
 flash light continues the second camera can 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.070
 do not take your own photos 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.380
 this is just the distance 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.960
 to measure the scanned objective 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.830
 This can be done in post-processing 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.970
 for example, the sharp point 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.720
 change later 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.660
 during the 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.460
 and schaaf will be a nice idea at the end 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.830
 but also just a gimmick or a 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.940
 gag the camera performance in itself 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.020
 but it is good 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.120
 another word about the battery of this almost 2600 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.070
 milliHours and deliver us one 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.540
 very good battery life at 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.670
 average use one dives 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.110
 Do not charge the device for two days 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.690
 provided the energy-saving mode 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.590
 enabled a very good result 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.000
 our conclusion htc has it with the one m8 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.040
 back to the upper ranks of the 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.840
 Bestlist managed even if the 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.000
 internal memory is a little lean 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.710
 Convince all other soft 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.340
 and hardware components on whole 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.680
 line 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.890
 So if you want to spend a little more money, he likes it 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:15.580
 advertises an absolutely first-class product 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:15.580
 we give deserved 552 bastards
