00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.320 

yeah<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.440> idea<00:00:10.919> for<00:00:11.250> rotor<00:00:11.490> was<00:00:11.910> missing<00:00:12.269> me

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
yeah the idea for rotor was missing me

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.019 
yeah the idea for rotor was missing me
for<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.629> very<00:00:12.719> long<00:00:12.959> time<00:00:13.369> but<00:00:14.369> I<00:00:14.429> never<00:00:14.730> found

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:15.029 
for a very long time but I never found

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.249 
for a very long time but I never found
the<00:00:15.389> right<00:00:16.160> media<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.400> release<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.539> only

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:19.259 
the right media to release it so only

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.319 
the right media to release it so only
when<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.800> iphone<00:00:20.160> came<00:00:20.400> around<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.970> thought

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:21.329 
when the iphone came around I thought

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.720 
when the iphone came around I thought
that's<00:00:21.710> perfect<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.919> iphone<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.550> then<00:00:23.640> I

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
that's perfect for the iphone and then I

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.780 
that's perfect for the iphone and then I
decided<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:25.079> design<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.189> details<00:00:26.579> and

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
decided to design the details and

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.999 
decided to design the details and
develop<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.329> game<00:00:27.509> because<00:00:28.379> I<00:00:28.410> think<00:00:28.559> it

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
develop the game because I think it

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.580 
develop the game because I think it
needs<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.430> haptic<00:00:29.939> touch<00:00:30.270> of<00:00:30.660> turning<00:00:31.439> these

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
needs the haptic touch of turning these

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.490 
needs the haptic touch of turning these
wheels<00:00:31.950> and<00:00:32.570> you<00:00:33.570> don't<00:00:33.809> want<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.289> on

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
wheels and you don't want to do that on

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.590 
wheels and you don't want to do that on
a<00:00:34.530> PC<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.309> want<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.640> do<00:00:35.789> that<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
a PC but you want to do that on the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.979 
a PC but you want to do that on the
iphone<00:00:37.219> and<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.489> sink<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.690> ideal

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
iphone and it's a sink it's the ideal

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.660 
iphone and it's a sink it's the ideal
outlet<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.650> and<00:00:40.920> that's<00:00:41.010> right<00:00:41.310> it<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
outlet for it and that's right it on the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.229 
outlet for it and that's right it on the
iphone<00:00:41.760> now<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.590> mean<00:00:43.590> roto<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.190> not<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.760> board

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
iphone now I mean roto is not a board

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
iphone now I mean roto is not a board
game<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:45.810> least<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.200> wouldn't<00:00:46.590> implement<00:00:47.070> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
game at least I wouldn't implement it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.950 
game at least I wouldn't implement it
like<00:00:47.310> this<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.790> needs<00:00:48.180> an<00:00:48.390> electronic

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
like this so it needs an electronic

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.470 
like this so it needs an electronic
platform<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.880> very<00:00:51.090> light<00:00:51.450> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
platform and it is a very light and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.260 
platform and it is a very light and
addictive<00:00:52.170> game<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.739> therefore<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.700> needs<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
addictive game and therefore it needs a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.020 
addictive game and therefore it needs a
light<00:00:54.570> platform<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.320> iphone<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.680> ideal<00:00:56.100> yes

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.760 

well<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.150> course<00:01:00.360> i<00:01:00.510> play<00:01:00.750> my<00:01:00.930> own<00:01:00.960> games<00:01:01.440> but

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
well of course i play my own games but

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.950 
well of course i play my own games but
probably<00:01:02.430> different<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.330> other<00:01:03.510> people

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
probably different to other people

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.820 
probably different to other people
because<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:05.150> we<00:01:06.150> develop<00:01:06.570> games<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.380> needs<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
because then we develop games it needs a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.730 
because then we develop games it needs a
lot<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.100> play<00:01:08.400> test<00:01:08.700> once<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.600> game<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.320> being

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
lot of play test once the game is being

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.860 
lot of play test once the game is being
published<00:01:11.190> then<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:12.150> me<00:01:12.300> it's<00:01:12.510> kind<00:01:12.690> of<00:01:12.750> an

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
published then for me it's kind of an

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.200 
published then for me it's kind of an
old<00:01:13.050> game<00:01:13.260> because<00:01:13.740> I've<00:01:14.400> developed<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.090> few

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
old game because I've developed it a few

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.030 
old game because I've developed it a few
years<00:01:15.270> ago<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.960> usually<00:01:16.380> when<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> game<00:01:16.830> comes

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
years ago so usually when the game comes

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.440 
years ago so usually when the game comes
out<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.640> available<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.300> other

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
out and is available for the other

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.780 
out and is available for the other
players<00:01:18.750> who<00:01:18.960> then<00:01:19.110> play<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.680> will<00:01:20.160> be<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
players who then play it I will be on to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.490 
players who then play it I will be on to
the<00:01:20.910> next<00:01:21.150> games<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> future<00:01:22.230> I'm

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the next games for the future I'm

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.980 
the next games for the future I'm
playing<00:01:23.070> every<00:01:23.340> day<00:01:23.520> but<00:01:24.120> I'm<00:01:24.300> mostly<00:01:24.690> playing

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
playing every day but I'm mostly playing

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.740 
playing every day but I'm mostly playing
of<00:01:25.320> course<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.710> new<00:01:25.830> designs<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.510> games

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
of course the new designs and the games

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.100 
of course the new designs and the games
I'm<00:01:28.050> fine<00:01:28.320> tuning<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.950> bringing<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.400> release

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.560 

game<00:01:35.440> with<00:01:35.680> other<00:01:35.860> people<00:01:36.310> then<00:01:36.910> I<00:01:37.270> would

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
game with other people then I would

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.210 
game with other people then I would
expect<00:01:37.990> that<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.470> game<00:01:38.680> is<00:01:38.920> really<00:01:39.070> a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
expect that the game is really a

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.120 
expect that the game is really a
platform<00:01:39.820> so<00:01:40.270> that<00:01:40.300> I<00:01:40.750> can<00:01:41.470> have<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.890> very

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
platform so that I can have a very

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.100 
platform so that I can have a very
stimulating<00:01:42.400> and<00:01:43.060> exciting<00:01:43.180> time<00:01:43.810> with<00:01:44.020> the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
stimulating and exciting time with the

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.530 
stimulating and exciting time with the
other<00:01:44.230> players<00:01:44.500> that<00:01:44.860> means<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:45.550> want<00:01:46.150> an<00:01:46.270> easy

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
other players that means I want an easy

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.510 
other players that means I want an easy
access<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.290> game<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.890> game<00:01:47.920> maybe<00:01:48.280> not

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
access to the game the game maybe not

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.330 
access to the game the game maybe not
too<00:01:48.760> long<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:50.200> game<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.710> being<00:01:50.890> simple

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
too long and the game of being simple

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.400 
too long and the game of being simple
enough<00:01:51.580> so<00:01:51.760> that<00:01:51.790> I<00:01:52.120> can<00:01:52.180> actually<00:01:52.810> play<00:01:53.380> a

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
enough so that I can actually play a

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.620 
enough so that I can actually play a
good<00:01:53.710> part<00:01:54.130> in<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.640> game<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:55.060> not<00:01:55.240> have<00:01:55.479> to

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
good part in the game and not have to

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.320 
good part in the game and not have to
administer<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:56.140> game<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:57.520> i<00:01:58.030> look<00:01:58.180> at

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
administer the game if i look at

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.010 
administer the game if i look at
electronic<00:01:58.870> games<00:01:59.670> particularly<00:02:01.020> solitaire

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
electronic games particularly solitaire

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.980 
electronic games particularly solitaire
playing<00:02:02.320> games<00:02:02.680> like<00:02:03.130> our<00:02:03.790> roto<00:02:04.090> then<00:02:04.840> of

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
playing games like our roto then of

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.920 
playing games like our roto then of
course<00:02:05.229> i<00:02:05.440> look<00:02:05.650> much<00:02:06.130> more<00:02:06.460> for<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:07.210> very

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
course i look much more for a very

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.290

own<00:04:08.599> challenges<00:04:09.440> in<00:04:09.620> designing<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.250> right

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
own challenges in designing the right

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.790 
own challenges in designing the right
games<00:04:10.730> for<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.150> so<00:04:11.720> yes<00:04:11.930> I<00:04:12.170> am<00:04:12.319> concentrating

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
games for it so yes I am concentrating

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.820 
games for it so yes I am concentrating
more<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:13.849> more<00:04:14.030> actually<00:04:14.450> on<00:04:14.830> electronic

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
more and more actually on electronic

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.110 
more and more actually on electronic
designs<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.639> at<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.209> moment<00:04:17.389> with<00:04:19.120> the

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
designs and at the moment with the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.379 
designs and at the moment with the
evolution<00:04:20.359> of<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.989> iphone<00:04:21.410> I<00:04:21.709> am<00:04:22.220> very<00:04:22.550> very

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
evolution of the iphone I am very very

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.300 
evolution of the iphone I am very very
excited<00:04:23.660> about<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.470> possibilities<00:04:25.100> on<00:04:25.220> the

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
excited about the possibilities on the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.940 
excited about the possibilities on the
iphone

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.370 

the<00:04:29.460> puzzle<00:04:29.700> mode<00:04:30.030> is<00:04:30.420> essentially

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
the puzzle mode is essentially

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.930 
the puzzle mode is essentially
restricted<00:04:32.370> by<00:04:33.350> only<00:04:34.350> having<00:04:34.380> all<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.520> colors

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
restricted by only having all the colors

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.390 
restricted by only having all the colors
once<00:04:36.780> once<00:04:37.230> you<00:04:37.350> have<00:04:37.380> used<00:04:37.740> them<00:04:38.130> in<00:04:38.160> a

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
once once you have used them in a

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.970 
once once you have used them in a
segment<00:04:38.850> in<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.270> sector<00:04:39.510> then<00:04:40.260> they<00:04:40.650> are<00:04:40.680> not

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
segment in a sector then they are not

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.150 
segment in a sector then they are not
replenished<00:04:41.760> you<00:04:42.600> turn<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.740> different

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
replenished you turn the different

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.150 
replenished you turn the different
wheels<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:44.970> you<00:04:45.870> use<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.350> colors<00:04:46.680> once<00:04:46.920> and

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
wheels and you use the colors once and

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.980 
wheels and you use the colors once and
then<00:04:47.250> they<00:04:47.370> disappear<00:04:47.820> and<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.270> just<00:04:48.510> have<00:04:48.810> to

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
then they disappear and you just have to

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.170 
then they disappear and you just have to
make<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.200> best<00:04:49.410> use<00:04:49.710> of<00:04:49.860> all<00:04:50.250> these<00:04:50.520> available

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
make the best use of all these available

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.410 
make the best use of all these available
colors<00:04:51.480> which<00:04:52.020> is<00:04:52.230> seven<00:04:52.710> vs<00:04:53.010> times<00:04:53.400> six<00:04:53.910> so

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
colors which is seven vs times six so

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.720 
colors which is seven vs times six so
this<00:04:55.140> is<00:04:55.320> something<00:04:55.530> kind<00:04:56.100> of<00:04:56.220> a<00:04:56.280> minimalistic

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
this is something kind of a minimalistic

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.360 
this is something kind of a minimalistic
approach<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.660> I<00:04:58.230> like<00:04:58.590> it<00:04:58.800> because<00:04:59.010> you

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
approach and I like it because you

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.830 
approach and I like it because you
always<00:04:59.550> have<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.210> use<00:05:00.240> all<00:05:00.630> your<00:05:00.780> resources

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
always have to use all your resources

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.080 
always have to use all your resources
this<00:05:01.500> is<00:05:01.680> however<00:05:01.980> something<00:05:02.670> that<00:05:02.790> you<00:05:02.880> can

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
this is however something that you can

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.910 
this is however something that you can
take<00:05:03.270> plenty<00:05:03.630> of<00:05:03.810> time<00:05:04.140> over<00:05:04.350> it<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.770> just

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
take plenty of time over it and just

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.760 
take plenty of time over it and just
think<00:05:05.190> out<00:05:05.370> the<00:05:05.520> best<00:05:05.700> moves<00:05:06.000> our<00:05:06.600> second<00:05:07.500> mode

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
think out the best moves our second mode

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.450 
think out the best moves our second mode
which<00:05:08.280> is<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:09.660> action<00:05:10.200> mode<00:05:10.410> here<00:05:11.070> you<00:05:11.310> have

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
which is the action mode here you have

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.040 
which is the action mode here you have
exactly<00:05:11.970> one<00:05:12.330> minute<00:05:12.660> to<00:05:13.250> play<00:05:14.250> a<00:05:14.960> level<00:05:15.960> of

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
exactly one minute to play a level of

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.040 
exactly one minute to play a level of
the<00:05:16.170> game<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:16.620> I<00:05:17.400> find<00:05:17.760> that<00:05:17.880> very

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
the game and I find that very

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.170 
the game and I find that very
challenging<00:05:19.050> because<00:05:19.590> it<00:05:20.340> is<00:05:20.640> really<00:05:21.000> about

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
challenging because it is really about

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.550 
challenging because it is really about
speed<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:23.300> colors<00:05:24.300> in<00:05:24.450> the<00:05:24.540> segments<00:05:25.080> are<00:05:25.230> no

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
speed the colors in the segments are no

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.610 
speed the colors in the segments are no
longer<00:05:25.770> restricted<00:05:26.220> that<00:05:26.550> means<00:05:26.760> menu

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
longer restricted that means menu

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.290 
longer restricted that means menu
essentially<00:05:28.620> empty<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:29.100> wheel<00:05:29.490> by<00:05:29.730> using<00:05:30.000> all

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
essentially empty a wheel by using all

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.000 
essentially empty a wheel by using all
six<00:05:30.630> of<00:05:30.750> its<00:05:30.870> colors<00:05:31.260> it<00:05:31.440> is<00:05:31.800> actually

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
six of its colors it is actually

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.710 
six of its colors it is actually
replenished<00:05:32.730> with<00:05:32.760> another<00:05:33.090> set<00:05:33.390> of<00:05:33.540> random

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
replenished with another set of random

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.080 
replenished with another set of random
colors<00:05:34.170> so<00:05:34.530> you<00:05:34.560> want<00:05:34.890> to<00:05:35.010> be<00:05:35.040> fast<00:05:35.430> until<00:05:35.970> you

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
colors so you want to be fast until you

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.760 
colors so you want to be fast until you
want<00:05:36.270> to<00:05:36.390> make<00:05:36.540> your<00:05:36.720> points<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:37.200> get<00:05:37.350> too<00:05:37.620> many

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
want to make your points to get too many

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.490 
want to make your points to get too many
levels<00:05:38.040> and<00:05:38.720> then<00:05:39.720> there's<00:05:39.900> a<00:05:39.960> third<00:05:40.050> mode

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
levels and then there's a third mode

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.760 
levels and then there's a third mode
which<00:05:40.920> is<00:05:40.950> our<00:05:41.490> arcade<00:05:42.330> mode<00:05:42.540> which<00:05:43.380> is<00:05:44.180> a

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
which is our arcade mode which is a

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.840 
which is our arcade mode which is a
completely<00:05:46.770> different<00:05:47.100> approach<00:05:47.190> again<00:05:47.700> to

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
completely different approach again to

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.580 
completely different approach again to
the<00:05:47.970> game<00:05:48.150> because<00:05:48.570> here<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:48.960> restriction<00:05:49.500> is

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
the game because here the restriction is

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.380 
the game because here the restriction is
the<00:05:49.770> number<00:05:50.130> of<00:05:50.220> rotations<00:05:50.400> you<00:05:50.970> can<00:05:51.150> do<00:05:51.270> with

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
the number of rotations you can do with

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.050 
the number of rotations you can do with
the<00:05:51.510> wheels<00:05:51.750> and<00:05:51.990> each<00:05:52.380> level<00:05:52.860> adds<00:05:53.130> a<00:05:53.910> new

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
the wheels and each level adds a new

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.390 
the wheels and each level adds a new
color<00:05:54.330> so<00:05:54.600> you<00:05:54.660> start<00:05:54.990> very<00:05:55.290> easily<00:05:55.560> with<00:05:55.860> only

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
color so you start very easily with only

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.880 
color so you start very easily with only
three<00:05:57.270> four<00:05:57.600> colors<00:05:58.050> and<00:05:58.320> then<00:05:58.470> you<00:05:58.620> come<00:05:58.770> to

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
three four colors and then you come to

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.640 
three four colors and then you come to
five<00:05:59.100> colors<00:05:59.550> six<00:05:59.790> colors<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:00.360> of<00:06:01.050> course<00:06:01.470> the

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
five colors six colors and of course the

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.020 
five colors six colors and of course the
more<00:06:01.830> colors<00:06:02.130> you<00:06:02.250> have<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:02.640> more<00:06:02.820> difficult

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
more colors you have the more difficult

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.660 
more colors you have the more difficult
it<00:06:03.360> is<00:06:03.480> to<00:06:03.540> make<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:04.200> matches<00:06:04.680> that<00:06:04.890> by<00:06:05.310> angles

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
it is to make the matches that by angles

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.550 
it is to make the matches that by angles
and<00:06:05.820> triangles<00:06:06.030> how<00:06:06.360> we<00:06:06.420> call<00:06:06.750> them<00:06:06.930> here<00:06:07.290> it

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
and triangles how we call them here it

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.050 
and triangles how we call them here it
is<00:06:07.620> essentially<00:06:08.220> to<00:06:08.520> build<00:06:08.730> for<00:06:08.940> the<00:06:09.030> future

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
is essentially to build for the future

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.120 
is essentially to build for the future
so<00:06:09.690> it's<00:06:09.870> not<00:06:09.930> just<00:06:10.050> looking<00:06:10.560> at<00:06:10.710> one<00:06:10.740> level

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
so it's not just looking at one level

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.490 
so it's not just looking at one level
you<00:06:11.670> have<00:06:11.880> to<00:06:12.060> make<00:06:12.210> many<00:06:12.630> points<00:06:13.110> as<00:06:13.200> long<00:06:13.380> as

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
you have to make many points as long as

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.180 
you have to make many points as long as
it's<00:06:13.740> easy<00:06:13.980> and<00:06:14.310> then<00:06:14.940> you<00:06:15.660> use<00:06:16.410> these<00:06:16.740> points

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
it's easy and then you use these points

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.890 
it's easy and then you use these points
you<00:06:17.250> have<00:06:17.280> collected<00:06:17.490> early<00:06:18.060> in<00:06:18.210> later<00:06:18.510> level

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
you have collected early in later level

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.760 
you have collected early in later level
when<00:06:19.080> it<00:06:19.200> gets<00:06:19.380> hard

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.480 

I<00:06:22.830> think<00:06:23.819> yes<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.960> rotor<00:06:25.349> is<00:06:25.650> a<00:06:25.889> very<00:06:26.220> simple

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
I think yes the rotor is a very simple

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.210 
I think yes the rotor is a very simple
game<00:06:26.849> which<00:06:27.060> very<00:06:27.300> short<00:06:27.660> rules<00:06:27.960> but<00:06:28.530> it<00:06:28.680> has<00:06:28.949> a

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
game which very short rules but it has a

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.760 
game which very short rules but it has a
lot<00:06:29.250> of<00:06:29.550> the<00:06:29.849> attractive<00:06:30.539> elements<00:06:31.470> of<00:06:31.620> a

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
lot of the attractive elements of a

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.890 
lot of the attractive elements of a
board<00:06:32.009> game<00:06:32.310> you<00:06:32.729> take<00:06:32.940> it<00:06:32.970> turn<00:06:33.210> by<00:06:33.389> turn<00:06:33.419> and

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
board game you take it turn by turn and

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.200 
board game you take it turn by turn and
you<00:06:34.199> try<00:06:34.470> to<00:06:34.500> optimize<00:06:34.860> your<00:06:35.220> resources<00:06:35.819> we

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
you try to optimize your resources we

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.689 
you try to optimize your resources we
try<00:06:36.479> to<00:06:36.539> deal<00:06:37.470> with<00:06:37.560> the<00:06:37.889> restrictions<00:06:38.400> as<00:06:38.550> if

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
try to deal with the restrictions as if

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.580 
try to deal with the restrictions as if
you<00:06:38.819> had<00:06:39.000> a<00:06:39.030> board<00:06:39.300> game<00:06:39.569> but<00:06:40.440> of<00:06:40.560> course

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
you had a board game but of course

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.320
