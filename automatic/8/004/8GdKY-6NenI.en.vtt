00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.689
 you dream to discover paragliding or maybe have you ever followed a 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.689
 initiation course b you want to go further in this activity 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.099
 tiphaine production presents paragliding discover and learn 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.540
 this dvd is the ideal complement to the training provided in schools 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.970
 find the theoretical and practical aspects of learning the 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.970
 parliament in the form of video footage and animation 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.110
 the dvd proposes in particular the presentation of the material with the setting 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.110
 in place vocabulary and technical terms 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.250
 flight mechanics with penetration into the air 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.470
 the creation of the lift film 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.890
 but also the aerodynamic forces the notion of finesse and the different 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.890
 flight regimes m 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.380
 find it for more than two hours the themes of the training 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.420
 that the influx of wind on the trajectory the movements of the elbe the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.920
 different approaches to how to properly build his landing this 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.920
 that you need to know at the time of the first parts learns thereafter 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.480
 m

 such 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.260
 also discover theological methodological aspects if 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.150
 important to appreciate the environment in which you are going 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.600

 all 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:15.059
 you will be able to please have sequences that the instructors 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.640
 ski 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.810
 10 as support 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.810
 during their theoretical classes 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.399
 Yes 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:33.319
 as a bonus, discover how the designers of our 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.319
 situations and put back 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.049
 also benefit from the advice of two great professionals who exhibit their 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.049
 vision on training m 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:56.480
 finally so his mother based on the 2004 axis of the federation 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.640
 will allow you to check your knowledge for the passage of the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.640
 initial project 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.329
 m good movie and you see
