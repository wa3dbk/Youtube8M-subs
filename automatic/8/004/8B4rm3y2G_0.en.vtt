00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.029
 and it's fine even that's the typical 

00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:09.280
 yes yes what I do not bench in the lack of 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.560
 code of colleagues that she keeping 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.510
 phones that we face 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.090
 soccer to have them and cheerfully 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.070
 they pick up the phone to ask for them without 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.500
 no effort except calls 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.539
 we are days and days looking for you 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.789
 reading to the places interviewing 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.030
 breaking the soul remaining to laburar 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.550
 the out of hours and that nobody appreciates 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.469
 after the phones answer when 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.339
 there are coming calls to send 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.969
 sleeve 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:41.739
 now to never return and they break 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:43.719
 Guests and characters that win 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.600
 Popularity stories from 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.089
 Intruders break it so promising 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.379
 the things that are not going to meet 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.239
 so this does not have to break the 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.929
 people to convince is invited to 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:59.260
 come that while the balls and 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.579
 nobody for a limit people that makes you 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.670
 get up seven in the morning to 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.370
 breaking the eggs and that after 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.850
 raise the curtain the truth I was wrong 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.990
 at least that Georgian the issues 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.570
 fill your content what you want 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.270
 but do not break the characters 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.190
 guests that we already have arranged 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.410
 because they are a black stick on a stick 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.330
 is that not studying concord is not playing 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.310
 between the rule of the game want to play 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.360
 dirty we play I have no problem but 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.250
 we like it because it is very well worn 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.730
 the title that we are the worst are the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.100
 worse 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.040
 but we assume it in teles but not 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.230
 we were codes we do not generate at 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.340
 respect to the colleague and there are many who 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.740
 they do and it's very close and it fucks me not 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.990
 They can not fuck with a job 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:54.090
 simply that 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.090
 for anita you are there 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.240
 before jorge porcel please 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.840
 a despair 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:15.780
 and I need medication 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.780
 and I had no means like before other 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.450
 but that is normal 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.910
 because I was psychologically 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.390
 live with fear 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.550
 know if you are going to get good character if 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:48.180
 you'll smile yes 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.180
 I threw my self-esteem down the floor 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.030
 this lady I do not know what the son wants 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.460
 I know what he wants all my life I keep it 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.950
 it is a torment that the truth never 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.230
 Good work can get money where 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.510
 in question that daughter Maria 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.480
 she is the daughter of the disappeared, that is a 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.069
 bomb a lie does not interest me or 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.400
 talk to her or talk to him one 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.440
 it may be that from that prepared time I 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.239
 he counted that he took him every week 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.640
 monthly months 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:24.580
 and they are they had the normal exercise 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.970
 entertained a very special person the 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.970
 problems 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.790
 psychologically for example 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.740
 apart from many close friends of mine 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.740
 but very close 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.800
 He has told me anecdotes that are not very 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.970
 nice that you will not tell or give 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.970
 name to obviously not 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.439
 when the medium is not very grateful 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:59.930
 that is to say the whole world claims the 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.459
 popularity the love that woke up 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.040
 up a stage forward a camera 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.549
 jorge porcel but between colleagues and 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.280
 comrades I do not think I have that way 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.219
 unanimously of what he generated as 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.280
 artist that is to say companions of the 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.389
 interfacing especially women especially 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.609
 women 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.380
 I think at some point made standard 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.610
 reference 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.770
 to the theme of being with women 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.990
 womanizer and who also arrived and 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.060
 I counted things as I said I do not want 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.590
 listen to things like stories and 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.660
 anecdotes of engines that were going to be and 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.250
 they claimed in a bit what I said if 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.890
 the operation is theater claiming 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.340
 that 's a behavior money bands to 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.590
 see the things that maybe in those people 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.620
 He was talking a lot, he said he was fighting 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.630
 there were some old ones an old myth there is a 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.680
 old myth that I do not know if it will be true or not 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.450
 that says you had to go through it if 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.810
 I did not work, I'm your sexual preference 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.340
 he just likes to do it on time 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.180
 or want to be happy if it was true 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.180
 the good
