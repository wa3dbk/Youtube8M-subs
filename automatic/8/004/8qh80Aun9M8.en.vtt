a quick video on explaining storage in

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.130 
a quick video on explaining storage in
your<00:00:04.200> computer<00:00:05.210> the<00:00:06.210> storage<00:00:06.990> in<00:00:07.109> your

your computer the storage in your
computer<00:00:08.090> you<00:00:09.090> got<00:00:09.210> basically<00:00:09.540> two<00:00:09.780> types

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
computer you got basically two types

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.910 
computer you got basically two types
here<00:00:11.360> that<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.509> as<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:13.019> normal<00:00:13.559> user<00:00:13.740> will

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
here that you as a normal user will

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.790 
here that you as a normal user will
probably<00:00:14.250> be<00:00:14.340> caring<00:00:14.670> about<00:00:15.049> you<00:00:16.049> got<00:00:16.260> your

probably be caring about you got your
hard<00:00:17.100> drive<00:00:18.260> that's<00:00:19.260> one<00:00:19.710> actually<00:00:20.010> store

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
hard drive that's one actually store

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.359 
hard drive that's one actually store
your<00:00:20.310> files<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.060> like<00:00:21.240> your<00:00:21.859> operating<00:00:22.859> system

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
your files so like your operating system

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.490 
your files so like your operating system
your<00:00:23.760> documents<00:00:25.430> pictures<00:00:26.430> music<00:00:26.990> videos<00:00:27.990> all

your documents pictures music videos all

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500 
your documents pictures music videos all
this<00:00:28.710> stuff<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.099> stored<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.760> your<00:00:30.029> hard

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
this stuff is stored on to your hard

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.920 
this stuff is stored on to your hard
drive<00:00:31.850> the<00:00:32.850> other<00:00:33.120> type<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.450> memory<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.870> your

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
drive the other type of memory in your

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.260 
drive the other type of memory in your
system<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.530> called<00:00:34.770> RAM<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.790> that's<00:00:36.000> these

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
system is called RAM and that's these

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.520 
system is called RAM and that's these
little<00:00:36.980> sticks<00:00:37.980> here<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:39.030> computer<00:00:39.540> this

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
little sticks here in your computer this

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.069 
little sticks here in your computer this
big<00:00:40.829> board<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.520> called<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.120> motherboard

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
big board here is called the motherboard

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.410 
big board here is called the motherboard
and<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.829> goes<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.640> your<00:00:44.969> RAM

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and what goes in there is your RAM

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.319 
and what goes in there is your RAM
sticks<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.460> these<00:00:47.460> RAM<00:00:47.700> sticks<00:00:48.090> are

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
sticks and these RAM sticks are

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.799 
sticks and these RAM sticks are
basically<00:00:48.870> your<00:00:49.200> computer's<00:00:49.680> working<00:00:50.399> memory

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
basically your computer's working memory

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.500 
basically your computer's working memory
so<00:00:51.809> think<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.920> kind<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.340> as<00:00:53.610> your<00:00:54.059> desk

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
so think of it kind of like as your desk

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.849 
so think of it kind of like as your desk
space<00:00:55.129> so<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.160> say<00:00:56.489> you're<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.390> work<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:58.020> as

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
space so to say you're going work on as

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.500 
space so to say you're going work on as
many<00:00:59.219> things<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.850> fill<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.180> your<00:01:00.270> desk

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
many things that can fill in your desk

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.609 
many things that can fill in your desk
at<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.780> time<00:01:01.460> for<00:01:02.460> example<00:01:02.539> or<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:03.719> desk<00:01:03.960> at

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
at the time for example or my desk at

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.620 
at the time for example or my desk at
the<00:01:04.650> moment<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> can<00:01:05.159> fit<00:01:05.700> probably<00:01:06.030> about<00:01:06.390> two

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the moment I can fit probably about two

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.590 
the moment I can fit probably about two
computers<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.770> their<00:01:07.920> side<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.600> work

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
computers on here on their side and work

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.359 
computers on here on their side and work
on<00:01:09.840> them<00:01:10.020> at<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> same<00:01:10.950> time<00:01:13.159> that's<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
on them at the same time that's the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.460 
on them at the same time that's the
basically<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> same<00:01:15.030> thing<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> ran<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
basically the same thing as I ran the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.850 
basically the same thing as I ran the
storage<00:01:17.840> that's<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.350> your<00:01:19.619> hard

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
storage that's going to be your hard

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.850 
storage that's going to be your hard
drive<00:01:20.130> that'd<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.930> rack<00:01:22.560> of

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
drive that'd be like this rack of

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.370 
drive that'd be like this rack of
computers<00:01:23.670> over<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.540> store<00:01:24.780> tons<00:01:25.200> of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
computers over here I can store tons of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.109 
computers over here I can store tons of
computers<00:01:25.770> over<00:01:25.979> there<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.460> pull<00:01:26.759> them<00:01:26.939> off

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
computers over there I can pull them off

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.450 
computers over there I can pull them off
that<00:01:27.299> rack<00:01:27.540> put<00:01:28.470> them<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.040> my<00:01:29.159> storage

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
that rack put them up here on my storage

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.120 
that rack put them up here on my storage
space<00:01:29.549> or<00:01:30.240> my<00:01:30.450> work<00:01:30.630> area<00:01:30.869> my<00:01:31.290> desk<00:01:31.500> space<00:01:31.680> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
space or my work area my desk space and

space or my work area my desk space and
work<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.180> them<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.409> work<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.740> two<00:01:35.009> of

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
work on them and I can work on two of

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.630 
work on them and I can work on two of
them<00:01:35.250> at<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.369> time<00:01:36.049> but<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:38.130> store<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> heck

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
them at the time but I can store a heck

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.390 
them at the time but I can store a heck
of<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.909> lot<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.270> them<00:01:39.390> over<00:01:39.630> there<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.500> boxes

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
of a lot of them over there and boxes

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.190 
of a lot of them over there and boxes
and<00:01:41.610> all<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.030> stuff<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:43.700> think<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.909> says

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
and all that stuff so think of this says

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.399 
and all that stuff so think of this says
your<00:01:46.200> room<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.220> your<00:01:47.310> house<00:01:47.549> or<00:01:47.970> your<00:01:48.119> house<00:01:48.409> so

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
your room in your house or your house so

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.179 
your room in your house or your house so
to<00:01:49.470> say<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.119> as<00:01:51.180> your<00:01:52.189> actual

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
to say and think of this as your actual

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.690 
to say and think of this as your actual
desk<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:54.390> work<00:01:54.659> area<00:01:55.369> that<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.549> actually

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
desk or work area that you can actually

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.010 
desk or work area that you can actually
use<00:01:57.030> stuff<00:01:58.070> all<00:01:59.070> at<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.340> same<00:01:59.549> time<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.960> you

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
use stuff all at the same time so if you

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.980 
use stuff all at the same time so if you
have<00:02:02.030> 256<00:02:03.030> Meg's<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.780> RAM

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
have 256 Meg's of RAM

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.459 
have 256 Meg's of RAM
that's<00:02:05.420> nothing<00:02:06.420> nowadays

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
that's nothing nowadays

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.820 
that's nothing nowadays
that<00:02:08.160> would<00:02:08.310> barely<00:02:08.759> run<00:02:09.119> Windows<00:02:09.509> XP<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.739> you

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
that would barely run Windows XP so you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.559 
that would barely run Windows XP so you
go<00:02:10.979> through<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.610> pull<00:02:11.910> up<00:02:12.000> some<00:02:12.180> more<00:02:12.330> files

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
go through you pull up some more files

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.870 
go through you pull up some more files
off<00:02:12.810> your<00:02:12.959> hard<00:02:13.170> drive<00:02:13.640> something<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.760> your

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
off your hard drive something in your

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.330 
off your hard drive something in your
ram<00:02:15.060> has<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.540> be<00:02:15.690> pulled<00:02:15.989> out<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.860> can<00:02:17.010> load

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
ram has to be pulled out so it can load

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
virtual memory is what happens when you

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.960 
virtual memory is what happens when you

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
run out of space on your brand so I

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.280 
run out of space on your brand so I
can't<00:02:38.970> fit<00:02:39.150> any<00:02:39.269> more<00:02:39.300> computer's<00:02:39.870> up<00:02:40.019> here<00:02:40.170> my

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
can't work on at the same time so what I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.380 
can't work on at the same time so what I
do<00:02:46.049> is<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.440> set<00:02:46.709> them<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.760> know<00:02:47.880> over<00:02:48.120> here<00:02:48.269> on

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
do is I set them you know over here on

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.600 
do is I set them you know over here on
the<00:02:48.480> corner<00:02:48.780> on<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.560> ground<00:02:49.799> here<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.190> then<00:02:50.370> I

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
the corner on the ground here and then I

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.190 
the corner on the ground here and then I
can<00:02:50.790> go<00:02:51.090> back<00:02:51.120> work<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.810> one<00:02:51.959> real<00:02:52.170> quick

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
can go back work on this one real quick

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.309 
can go back work on this one real quick
because<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.769> guy<00:02:52.950> needs<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.400> right<00:02:53.610> now<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:55.260> I

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
because this guy needs it right now so I

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.410 
because this guy needs it right now so I
go<00:02:55.470> through<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.860> work<00:02:56.099> on<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.000> can<00:02:57.209> put

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
go through a work on it and I can put

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.940 
go through a work on it and I can put
this<00:02:57.569> one<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:58.019> know<00:02:58.140> back<00:02:58.440> over<00:02:58.739> on<00:02:58.799> the

this one you know back over on the

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.800 
this one you know back over on the
ground<00:02:59.130> pick<00:02:59.459> another<00:02:59.610> one<00:02:59.849> up<00:03:00.030> put<00:03:00.390> up<00:03:00.510> here

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
ground pick another one up put up here

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.089 
ground pick another one up put up here
work<00:03:01.019> on<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.349> that's<00:03:02.030> kind<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.090> like<00:03:04.099> how

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
work on it that's kind of like how

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.309 
work on it that's kind of like how

my desk and my desk is my RAM think of

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.370 
my desk and my desk is my RAM think of
it<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:29.970> way<00:03:30.209> that's<00:03:30.510> probably<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.139> best

it that way that's probably the best

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
analogy I can give you for memory and

analogy I can give you for memory and
how<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.450> works<00:03:36.920> for<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:38.040> more<00:03:38.310> advanced

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
how it works for you more advanced

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.870 
how it works for you more advanced
people<00:03:39.269> out<00:03:39.450> there<00:03:39.859> there<00:03:40.859> is<00:03:41.040> other<00:03:41.310> type<00:03:41.639> of

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
people out there there is other type of

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.740 
people out there there is other type of

things like that it's gonna be on a tiny
little<00:03:48.930> chip<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:50.220> think<00:03:50.880> this<00:03:51.060> one<00:03:51.269> is<00:03:51.299> here

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
little chip I think this one is here

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.860 
little chip I think this one is here
because<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.680> don't<00:03:52.799> see<00:03:53.100> any<00:03:53.310> others<00:03:53.870> believe

because I don't see any others believe

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.920 
because I don't see any others believe
it<00:03:54.959> or<00:03:55.019> not<00:03:56.000> that's<00:03:57.000> probably<00:03:57.299> be<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.630> BIOS

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
it or not that's probably be the BIOS

it or not that's probably be the BIOS
chip<00:03:58.260> there<00:03:58.650> I'm<00:03:58.920> going<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.220> assume<00:03:59.489> because

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
chip there I'm going to assume because

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.840 
chip there I'm going to assume because
you<00:04:00.120> don't<00:04:00.329> see<00:04:00.540> any<00:04:00.690> others<00:04:00.900> on<00:04:01.049> this<00:04:01.170> board

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
you don't see any others on this board

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.620 
you don't see any others on this board
besides<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.139> chipset<00:04:04.139> chip<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.540> you<00:04:06.540> know

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
besides the chipset chip and you know

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.240 
besides the chipset chip and you know
that's<00:04:06.840> gonna<00:04:06.989> have<00:04:07.230> things<00:04:07.560> like<00:04:07.739> your<00:04:07.889> BIOS

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
that's gonna have things like your BIOS

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.080 
that's gonna have things like your BIOS
settings

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
settings

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.479

you<00:04:09.989> know<00:04:11.389> startup<00:04:12.389> options<00:04:13.099> things<00:04:14.099> like

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
you know startup options things like

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.020 
you know startup options things like
that<00:04:14.790> for<00:04:15.239> your<00:04:15.540> BIOS<00:04:16.519> so<00:04:17.519> that's<00:04:17.669> another

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
computer there is things such as cache

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.490 
computer there is things such as cache
as<00:05:05.130> well<00:05:05.370> go<00:05:06.210> into<00:05:06.419> that<00:05:06.509> real<00:05:06.750> quick<00:05:07.050> for<00:05:07.349> your

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
as well go into that real quick for your

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.939 
as well go into that real quick for your
processor<00:05:08.280> that's<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.750> processors<00:05:10.650> working

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
processor that's the processors working

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.950 
processor that's the processors working
area<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:11.669> just<00:05:12.300> like<00:05:12.449> I<00:05:12.539> was<00:05:12.659> telling<00:05:12.870> you

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
area and just like I was telling you

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.159 
area and just like I was telling you
before<00:05:12.990> with<00:05:13.680> the<00:05:14.520> hard<00:05:14.789> drive<00:05:14.909> and<00:05:15.539> the<00:05:15.930> RAM

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
before with the hard drive and the RAM

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.420 
before with the hard drive and the RAM
think<00:05:17.130> of<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:18.949> cache<00:05:19.949> on<00:05:20.219> the<00:05:20.310> processor<00:05:21.060> as

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
think of the cache on the processor as

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.870 
think of the cache on the processor as
the<00:05:23.430> working<00:05:23.909> area<00:05:24.240> compared<00:05:25.169> to<00:05:25.289> the<00:05:25.409> RAM<00:05:25.880> and

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
the working area compared to the RAM and

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.809 
the working area compared to the RAM and
you'll<00:05:27.300> understand<00:05:28.229> it<00:05:28.409> a<00:05:28.860> little<00:05:29.280> bit<00:05:29.460> better

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
you'll understand it a little bit better

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:31.490 
you'll understand it a little bit better
basically<00:05:30.419> the<00:05:30.539> processor<00:05:31.080> doesn't<00:05:31.319> have<00:05:31.409> to

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
basically the processor doesn't have to

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.920 
basically the processor doesn't have to
keep<00:05:31.650> going<00:05:31.800> back<00:05:31.949> and<00:05:32.099> forth<00:05:32.479> to<00:05:33.479> the<00:05:33.569> RAM<00:05:33.750> if

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
keep going back and forth to the RAM if

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.420 
keep going back and forth to the RAM if
it<00:05:34.020> can<00:05:34.139> pull<00:05:34.349> up<00:05:34.409> more<00:05:34.590> stuff<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:34.979> keep<00:05:35.159> it<00:05:35.280> in

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
it can pull up more stuff and keep it in

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.749 
it can pull up more stuff and keep it in
here<00:05:35.729> the<00:05:36.419> RAM<00:05:36.690> won't<00:05:37.469> have<00:05:37.710> to<00:05:38.039> keep<00:05:38.610> going

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
here the RAM won't have to keep going

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.490 
here the RAM won't have to keep going
back<00:05:38.969> and<00:05:39.029> forth<00:05:39.270> to<00:05:39.539> the<00:05:39.630> hard<00:05:39.810> drive<00:05:39.990> you

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
back and forth to the hard drive you

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.100 
back and forth to the hard drive you
know<00:05:41.159> if<00:05:41.370> things<00:05:41.909> are<00:05:42.120> load<00:05:42.479> up<00:05:42.630> and<00:05:42.779> ramp<00:05:42.930> so

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
know if things are load up and ramp so

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.260 
know if things are load up and ramp so
the<00:05:43.229> more<00:05:43.469> RAM<00:05:43.710> you<00:05:43.740> have<00:05:44.099> the<00:05:44.580> less<00:05:44.789> has<00:05:45.029> to<00:05:45.150> go

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
the more RAM you have the less has to go

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.600 
the more RAM you have the less has to go
back<00:05:45.509> and<00:05:45.690> forth<00:05:45.870> to<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.169> hard<00:05:46.380> drive<00:05:46.610> the

up the better the less it has to go and

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.990 
up the better the less it has to go and
ask<00:06:18.779> the<00:06:19.139> RAM<00:06:19.319> to<00:06:19.650> go<00:06:19.770> to<00:06:19.830> pull<00:06:20.190> stuff<00:06:20.580> out<00:06:20.819> of

quick simple most basic way I can

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.909 
quick simple most basic way I can
describe<00:06:28.889> RAM<00:06:29.520> and<00:06:30.000> storage<00:06:30.270> for<00:06:30.750> you<00:06:30.930> so

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919
