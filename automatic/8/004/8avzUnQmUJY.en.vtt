00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that anything was gonna change because

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.090 
that anything was gonna change because
of<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> fact<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.049> he's<00:01:55.229> black<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.890> he's

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
of the fact that he's black because he's

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.450 
of the fact that he's black because he's
still<00:01:56.369> yes<00:01:56.880> thoroughly<00:01:57.630> well<00:01:57.810> ideally<00:01:58.380> no<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.920> I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
still yes thoroughly well ideally no I I

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.710 
still yes thoroughly well ideally no I I
know<00:01:59.610> I<00:02:00.000> know<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.600> thought

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
know I know so I thought

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.380 
know I know so I thought
other<00:02:02.500> friends<00:02:02.830> I<00:02:02.980> know<00:02:03.280> but<00:02:03.760> I<00:02:03.790> fell<00:02:04.180> for<00:02:04.300> the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
other friends I know but I fell for the

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.540 
other friends I know but I fell for the
hoping<00:02:04.630> change<00:02:04.960> thing<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:05.530> felt<00:02:05.890> like<00:02:06.130> that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
hoping change thing and felt like that

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.670 
hoping change thing and felt like that
because<00:02:07.120> he<00:02:07.270> looked<00:02:07.540> at<00:02:07.870> change<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.290> mean<00:02:08.440> now

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
because he looked at change I mean now

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.170 
because he looked at change I mean now
we<00:02:08.740> have<00:02:08.950> universal<00:02:09.430> health<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:10.030> gay

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
we have universal health and gay

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.450 
we have universal health and gay
marriage<00:02:10.600> is<00:02:10.810> going<00:02:11.050> like<00:02:11.380> so<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:12.160> I<00:02:12.280> think

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
marriage is going like so and I think

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.910 
marriage is going like so and I think
the<00:02:12.760> change<00:02:13.120> is<00:02:13.360> all<00:02:13.560> incremental<00:02:14.560> yeah<00:02:14.890> I

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
the change is all incremental yeah I

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.750 
the change is all incremental yeah I
don't<00:02:15.070> think<00:02:15.190> that<00:02:15.310> would<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.490> happened

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
don't think that would have happened

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.540 
don't think that would have happened
with<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.940> Republican<00:02:16.800> President<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:17.920> we<00:02:18.340> may

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
with the Republican President and we may

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.900 
with the Republican President and we may
have<00:02:19.180> probably<00:02:20.020> may<00:02:20.650> as<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.430> few<00:02:21.760> have

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.670 
have probably may as a few have
president<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.840> Democrats<00:02:23.320> will<00:02:23.470> have<00:02:23.560> the
