00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
well that sucks but it might have

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.210 
well that sucks but it might have
actually<00:02:42.840> saved<00:02:43.140> my<00:02:43.290> life<00:02:43.470> looking<00:02:43.799> back<00:02:44.010> at

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
actually saved my life looking back at

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.789 
actually saved my life looking back at
it<00:02:44.370> because<00:02:44.489> uh<00:02:44.610> if<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:46.019> would<00:02:46.379> have<00:02:46.500> saw<00:02:46.650> we

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
it because uh if I would have saw we

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.350 
it because uh if I would have saw we
were<00:02:46.829> both<00:02:47.129> closer<00:02:47.459> health<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.970> might<00:02:48.209> have

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
were both closer health I might have

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.460 
were both closer health I might have
stayed<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.750> fight<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.110> she<00:02:49.260> might<00:02:49.410> have

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
stayed in the fight and she might have

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.619 
stayed in the fight and she might have
killed<00:02:49.650> me<00:02:49.829> but<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.760> thought<00:02:51.329> it<00:02:51.390> might<00:02:51.420> have

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
killed me but I thought it might have

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.349 
killed me but I thought it might have
also<00:02:51.870> killed<00:02:52.049> her<00:02:52.200> anyway<00:02:52.829> um<00:02:53.280> what<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.150> wanted

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
don't show a death it's just because

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.300 
don't show a death it's just because
like<00:03:03.660> there's<00:03:04.290> not<00:03:04.440> much<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.739> learn<00:03:04.890> from<00:03:04.950> it

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
like there's not much to learn from it

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.059 
like there's not much to learn from it
or<00:03:05.489> just<00:03:06.150> because<00:03:06.359> I<00:03:06.709> don't<00:03:07.709> really<00:03:07.829> feel<00:03:07.920> like

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
or just because I don't really feel like

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.410 
or just because I don't really feel like
it's<00:03:08.340> just<00:03:08.459> like<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.670> stupid<00:03:08.970> death<00:03:09.269> or

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
it's just like a stupid death or

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.259 
it's just like a stupid death or
whatever<00:03:10.010> um<00:03:11.900> but<00:03:12.900> rather<00:03:13.709> than<00:03:14.010> like<00:03:14.730> trying

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
whatever um but rather than like trying

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.599 
whatever um but rather than like trying
to<00:03:15.329> cover<00:03:15.599> up<00:03:15.660> my<00:03:15.750> mistakes<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.739> reason<00:03:17.099> I<00:03:17.310> cut

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
to cover up my mistakes the reason I cut

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.970 
to cover up my mistakes the reason I cut
out<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:18.030> many<00:03:18.120> parts<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.870> like<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.500> speed

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
out so many parts and like I speed

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.319 
out so many parts and like I speed
through<00:03:20.220> things<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.549> such<00:03:20.730> like<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:21.120> is

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
through things and such like that is

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.970 
through things and such like that is
because<00:03:22.049> I<00:03:22.079> want<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.349> cut<00:03:22.500> out<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.620> less

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
because I want to cut out the less

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.920 
because I want to cut out the less
exciting<00:03:23.519> parts<00:03:23.819> like<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.630> don't<00:03:24.750> want<00:03:24.870> to
