00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:13.080
 in between a very fine one again 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:16.199
 Thanks to youtube I could do it 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.210
 finally pack a nice one again 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:26.620
 quad cake fine taste and whole 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:30.160
 just a lot of fun 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:37.360
 for this fine cake we need 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:41.710
 butter sugar 40 percent salt lemon 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:48.010
 sugar raisins can also be based 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:52.030
 and some almonds and flour the cash registers 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:56.290
 by 25 times 10 times 7 centimeters with 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:00.760
 lay out the buttered bread and the butter 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:05.260
 with sugar salt and lemon sugar 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:10.000
 frothy stir the soft butter 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:13.360
 of course, find pure and how it 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.350
 always solve by hand so everything is beautiful 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.250
 with each other kunz then comes the quark 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.470
 when you're pretty scary and 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:29.440
 will be really good again 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:32.370
 some states, well, and then you fall 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.910
 part of the movie 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:39.520
 That's why I can finally show how 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.610
 forearm with flour and cryer under the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.800
 But that's no problem 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.020
 and since I have twice the mass 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.050
 creates that my machine is not the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.680
 should take double big and that's why 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.630
 I'll do it with my hand 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.910
 yes, only worked well together 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.960
 become 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.200
 it would be with the cooking spoon 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.850
 probably also gone with 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.370
 you have a better hand 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.550
 feeling 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:14.920
 yes and then everything comes 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:19.090
 the half in the form because I the 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.940
 I have made double the mass 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:27.700
 a little surprise this day 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:32.230
 is ideal for small 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:36.430
 tarts that taste great the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:40.170
 you can take with you quickly or by the way 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.170
 can put on the table 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.099
 excellent for children and staff 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.670
 not too bad now I have the second one 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:56.860
 charge with an ice portioner 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.879
 Of course, can also bring with us 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.090
 teaspoon or larger with tablespoon 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:10.610
 done 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:13.040
 no problem and then yes the box shape 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.730
 from the oven about half to 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.900
 three quarters of an hour perfectly from the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.500
 nothing is hanging out of paper 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.500
 pull it off 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.750
 maybe something with the knife after 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.790
 just pick up and then pull out and 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:37.040
 I finish the thing the little ones 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.180
 tank cars are particularly good for 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.799
 children's birthdays or for the office there 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:50.000
 no crumbs do not need a plate 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:53.560
 simple finger snack some icing sugar 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.239
 about it and looks wonderful 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.109
 then I wish to succeed 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.880
 have fun baking and you know 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.209
 yes if you liked one 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:09.889
 thumbs up 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:13.549
 an abo which is also excellent and again 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:17.000
 There are many new films we have 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.900
 I'm already wondering what I'm doing 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.900
 want to do everything
