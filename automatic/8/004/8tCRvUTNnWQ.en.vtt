00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.380
 He is good 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.679
 And laid the a red Zee Zee 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.150
 resin 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.950
 Now resin h painted about 2 times 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.850
 If you do so once again , you will get rid of files 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:44.450
 a After painting the resin 12 times, use your paper 120 to drop your corner first 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.450
 It is 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.660
 is 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.070
 Taking 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.070
 Next will be written as water 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.680
 When the paper work is over and it is almost flat 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.390
 With silicon off 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.390
 It took the one with the oil stains 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.100
 After degreasing work, we will paint the resin with a feeling of finish 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.420
 To 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.950
 Once the resin is dry 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.950
 We will look-can easily part Toka extra portion of the needle 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:59.670
 Next Once you can also put One Toka extra part with a file in the student finished with water-resistant paper 400 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.670
 to come 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:11.330
 I will raise the paper more and more if there is an entire file 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.330
 I have skipped the order now, but I would like to finish with No. 1000 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.450
 This is the carbons who finished the call to the paper game 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:28.210
 This is the first of carbon pre-packaging and change there is here 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:31.450
 It's carbon , so now I'm brushing it with paper, so I'm reproducing the state of blowing the clear. 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.629
 If you dash the silicon with this 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.780
 I will put it in 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.380
 It will be in the state of blowing clear now 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.410
 I actually buy 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.950
 The finish is such an image Let's blow the clear 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:53.300
 Of course the country used this time is round stop clear sudden 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:57.550
 The mixing ratio is 10 to 1. Thinner adds 20% in a fast-paced and rice 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.550
 Use filter media to avoid purchasing 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:25.650
 Yes Clear Hardened After Clear Hardened, with paper 1500 or 2000 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:31.080
 I'm doing compound after rubbing, but I'm on a clear ride 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.850
 As it is of the compound people that we will surface which is quite heavy rainfall over the paper 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.180
 Please strike it 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.340
 The compound that makes it more beautiful is scary 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.730
 Five 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:46.220
 Kubo 期待 期待 バ ウ ン ド と バ ウ ン ド 表面 表面 表面 表面 表面 表面 の 半 半 の の 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.000
 I will use a type of extra fine 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.000
 I'm waiting 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:03.610
 The surface has become light and rough by polishing with a compound now, and it is very slick 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:11.040
 After becoming a wax on this will protect from ultraviolet light 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:16.470
 Now, please return to the original carbon mirror was completed 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:19.010
 Or from the sold in shops Looking received the I've done traveling with do this is 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.250
 It may be big 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:27.230
 I am satisfied with this 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:30.410
 I 've only joined it here, but it's almost dark and it doesn't look 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:34.120
 You can pretty stitching clean 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.120
 Rokka Family 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:42.479
 I'm really good here 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.919
 I will explain how to make carbon quite roughly in the feeling of probably I think this is roughly like this 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:50.669
 It is feeling 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:56.759
 One thing to be aware of when making carbon is resin is perfect when overpainting resin 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.920
 If you apply the resin after it has been cured , the resins will stick together and it will not work well 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:02.350
 Ten 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.820
 If c is completely cured, apply 400 or 600 or so and then resin again 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:09.380
 I paint well and ride 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:14.710
 If the resin is semi-dried and the resin is applied again, then it starts well 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.710
 Installation of carbon canard is made to the second half
