00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
talking about why I hate Geoff lobe but

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.900 
talking about why I hate Geoff lobe but
on<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.160> long<00:00:29.279> how<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.119> long<00:00:30.359> Halloween

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
on the long how it the long Halloween

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.110 
on the long how it the long Halloween
Halloween<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:34.200> think<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.190> longest<00:00:35.640> graphic

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
Halloween is I think the longest graphic

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.330 
Halloween is I think the longest graphic
novel<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.630> own<00:00:37.730> I'm<00:00:38.730> not<00:00:38.969> sure<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:40.190> think<00:00:41.190> it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
novel I own I'm not sure I think it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.540 
novel I own I'm not sure I think it
probably<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.989> longer<00:00:42.989> than<00:00:43.140> any<00:00:43.260> others<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
probably is longer than any others that

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.700 
probably is longer than any others that
I<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.910> not<00:00:45.719> counting<00:00:46.079> hard<00:00:46.260> covers<00:00:46.559> because

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
I have not counting hard covers because

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.020 
I have not counting hard covers because
hardcover<00:00:47.129> makes<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.460> look<00:00:47.550> longer<00:00:47.730> than<00:00:47.969> it

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
hardcover makes it look longer than it

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.380 
hardcover makes it look longer than it
really<00:00:48.120> is

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
really is

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.330 
really is
well<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.440> really<00:00:49.710> long<00:00:49.829> series<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.190> think

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
well it's a really long series I think

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.410 
well it's a really long series I think
it's<00:00:50.629> 13<00:00:51.629> issues<00:00:52.370> that<00:00:53.370> that's<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:54.270> long

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it's 13 issues that that's really long

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.270 
it's 13 issues that that's really long
for<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.690> miniseries<00:00:55.260> or<00:00:55.289> well<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.039> used<00:00:56.190> to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
for a miniseries or well they used to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.860 
for a miniseries or well they used to
call<00:00:56.370> maxi<00:00:56.789> series<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.149> don't<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.420> they<00:00:57.480> call

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
call maxi series I don't think they call

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.130 
call maxi series I don't think they call
him<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.020> anymore<00:00:59.510> it's<00:01:00.510> written<00:01:00.750> by<00:01:00.899> Jeff

stumbling

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.060 
stumbling
I'm<00:02:36.330> pretty<00:02:36.870> sure<00:02:37.640> that<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.910> makes<00:02:39.180> sense<00:02:40.070> I'm

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
I'm pretty sure that it makes sense I'm

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.860 
I'm pretty sure that it makes sense I'm
not<00:02:41.280> positive<00:02:41.550> because<00:02:42.000> I'm<00:02:42.120> reread<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.480> but

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
not positive because I'm reread it but

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.990 
not positive because I'm reread it but
I'm<00:02:42.960> pretty<00:02:43.140> sure<00:02:43.260> like<00:02:43.530> it's<00:02:44.010> possible<00:02:44.760> to

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
I'm pretty sure like it's possible to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.090 
I'm pretty sure like it's possible to
figure<00:02:45.330> out<00:02:45.450> who<00:02:45.630> did<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.020> before<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.830> get<00:02:46.980> to

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
figure out who did it before you get to

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.610 
figure out who did it before you get to
the<00:02:47.190> end<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.460> book<00:02:50.780> now<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.230> reason<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.590> say

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
the end of the book now the reason I say

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.770 
the end of the book now the reason I say
it's<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:52.980> greatest<00:02:53.370> Batman<00:02:53.850> story<00:02:54.120> ever<00:02:54.390> made

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
it's the greatest Batman story ever made

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.250 
it's the greatest Batman story ever made
is<00:02:55.290> because<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.930> perfectly<00:02:58.860> integrates

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
is because it perfectly integrates

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.440 
is because it perfectly integrates
supervillains<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.760> gangsters<00:03:04.850> most<00:03:05.850> Batman

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
supervillains and gangsters most Batman

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.960 
supervillains and gangsters most Batman

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
stories either do super villains or

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.630 
stories either do super villains or
gangsters<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:12.060> does<00:03:12.810> both<00:03:13.380> of<00:03:13.440> them<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.130> it

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
gangsters this does both of them and it

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.950 
gangsters this does both of them and it
does<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.150> perfectly<00:03:16.250> now

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
does it perfectly now

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.750 
does it perfectly now
this<00:03:18.960> is<00:03:19.170> supposedly<00:03:19.770> supposed<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.580> take

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
this is supposedly supposed to take

I'm not positive but I'm pretty sure

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.150 
I'm not positive but I'm pretty sure
that<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.190> origin<00:04:05.490> is<00:04:05.580> still<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:05.880> Canon<00:04:07.160> and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
that the origin is still in Canon and

just<00:06:02.560> this<00:06:03.039> really<00:06:03.339> you<00:06:03.639> know<00:06:03.729> weird<00:06:03.969> twisted

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
just this really you know weird twisted

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.320 
just this really you know weird twisted
like<00:06:04.509> you<00:06:04.599> know<00:06:04.689> it<00:06:04.990> makes<00:06:05.139> sense<00:06:05.939> but<00:06:06.939> it

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
like you know it makes sense but it

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.969 
like you know it makes sense but it
doesn't<00:06:07.779> make<00:06:07.899> sense<00:06:07.960> type<00:06:08.469> of<00:06:08.620> logic<00:06:08.949> that

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
doesn't make sense type of logic that

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.820 
doesn't make sense type of logic that
the<00:06:09.189> Joker<00:06:09.520> has<00:06:11.399> the

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:21.270 

the<00:06:15.400> biggest<00:06:18.750> problem<00:06:19.750> with<00:06:20.319> the<00:06:20.500> book<00:06:20.740> is

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
the biggest problem with the book is

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.149 
the biggest problem with the book is
probably<00:06:22.030> the<00:06:22.360> gangster<00:06:22.780> characters<00:06:23.289> well<00:06:24.129> I

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:24.159 
probably the gangster characters well I

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:26.730 
probably the gangster characters well I
I<00:06:24.639> thought<00:06:25.150> it<00:06:25.569> the<00:06:25.840> gangster<00:06:26.289> thing<00:06:26.440> was<00:06:26.590> well

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
I thought it the gangster thing was well

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.710 
I thought it the gangster thing was well
done<00:06:26.940> none<00:06:27.940> of<00:06:28.060> the<00:06:28.150> characters<00:06:28.539> are

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
done none of the characters are

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.260 
done none of the characters are
interesting<00:06:29.050> and<00:06:29.590> they<00:06:30.550> just<00:06:30.729> seem<00:06:30.970> kind<00:06:31.180> of

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
interesting and they just seem kind of

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.689 
interesting and they just seem kind of
tedious<00:06:31.680> you<00:06:32.680> know<00:06:32.800> like<00:06:33.009> every<00:06:33.250> time<00:06:33.400> I<00:06:33.430> team

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
tedious you know like every time I team
