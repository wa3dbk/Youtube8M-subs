this time from the facebook page for
information<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.850> bases<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
information on the bases so this is the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.570 
information on the bases so this is the
first<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> base<00:00:22.859> videos<00:00:23.130> we're<00:00:23.400> going<00:00:23.519> to

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
first of the base videos we're going to

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.970 
first of the base videos we're going to
do<00:00:23.699> we're<00:00:23.910> going<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.060> talk<00:00:24.240> about<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.660> new

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
do we're going to talk about the new

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.170 
do we're going to talk about the new
barchetta<00:00:25.980> basis<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.640> were<00:00:26.730> introduced

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
barchetta basis that were introduced

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.269 
barchetta basis that were introduced
this<00:00:27.449> year<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.439> let's<00:00:28.619> take<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> look<00:00:29.039> at<00:00:29.099> one<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
this year so let's take a look at one of

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.740 
this year so let's take a look at one of
these<00:00:29.400> bases<00:00:29.609> will<00:00:30.000> do<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> little<00:00:30.359> bit<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.570> an

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
these bases will do a little bit of an

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.389 
these bases will do a little bit of an
overview<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.800> new<00:00:34.890> Barchetta

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
overview so this is the new Barchetta

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.819 
overview so this is the new Barchetta
base<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.850> concept<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.540> base<00:00:36.780> was<00:00:37.110> we

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
base the concept of this base was we

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.200 
base the concept of this base was we
wanted<00:00:37.980> something<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.579> was<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.910> little<00:00:39.030> bit

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
wanted something that was a little bit

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.819 
wanted something that was a little bit
more<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.510> rock<00:00:39.750> bass<00:00:40.050> something<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.710> could

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
more of a rock bass something that could

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.470 
more of a rock bass something that could
be<00:00:40.860> also<00:00:41.070> very<00:00:41.219> versatile<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> same<00:00:42.180> time

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
be also very versatile at the same time

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.410 
be also very versatile at the same time
so<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.620> took<00:00:43.829> one<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.309> our<00:00:44.430> classic<00:00:44.910> shapes<00:00:45.180> of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
so we took one of our classic shapes of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.420 
so we took one of our classic shapes of
the<00:00:45.450> Barchetta<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.320> decided<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.160> incorporate

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the Barchetta and decided to incorporate

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.750 
the Barchetta and decided to incorporate
it<00:00:47.820> into<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.180> bass<00:00:48.570> instrument<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.340> one

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it into a bass instrument so this is one

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.729 
it into a bass instrument so this is one
of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> bar<00:00:51.210> shutter<00:00:51.449> bases<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.170> particular

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
of the bar shutter bases this particular

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.979 
of the bar shutter bases this particular
one<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> bar<00:00:53.280> chateau<00:00:53.489> st<00:00:54.030> base<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.899> we're

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
one is a bar chateau st base so we're

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.000 
one is a bar chateau st base so we're
going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.170> talk<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> little<00:00:55.469> bit<00:00:55.710> about<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
going to talk a little bit about the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.350 
going to talk a little bit about the
overview<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> bases<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.120> we'll<00:00:57.239> go

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
overview of the bases and then we'll go

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.200 
overview of the bases and then we'll go
into<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.629> individual<00:00:58.109> models<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.399> again<00:00:59.820> some

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
into the individual models so again some

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.900 
into the individual models so again some
of<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> things<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.750> are<00:01:01.550> customary<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
of the things that are customary as you

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.649 
of the things that are customary as you
have<00:01:03.180> come<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.539> know<00:01:03.570> from<00:01:03.690> DBZ<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
have come to know from DBZ we have the

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.760 
have come to know from DBZ we have the
three-dimensional<00:01:06.659> body<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
three-dimensional body so the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.490 
three-dimensional body so the
three-dimensional<00:01:08.430> contours<00:01:09.049> like<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.350> bar

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
three-dimensional contours like the bar

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.219 
three-dimensional contours like the bar
shadow<00:01:10.770> guitar<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.670> one<00:01:11.880> has<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.570> 3d

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
using it so the Barchetta base itself

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.819 
using it so the Barchetta base itself
comes<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.850> mentioned<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.450> st<00:01:37.409> version

but first let's look at some of the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.080 
but first let's look at some of the
