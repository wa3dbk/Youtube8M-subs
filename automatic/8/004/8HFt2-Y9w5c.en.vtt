an orange I'm just going to put a little
bit<00:00:31.410> more<00:00:31.800> juice<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.880> there

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.140 

I'll<00:00:36.820> sound<00:00:37.060> what

now that is great beer I think it's even
both<00:00:44.710> now<00:00:47.080> I've<00:00:48.080> been<00:00:48.290> brewing<00:00:48.560> with<00:00:48.830> this

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
both now I've been brewing with this

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.100 
both now I've been brewing with this
thing<00:00:49.460> for<00:00:49.730> almost<00:00:49.970> five<00:00:50.360> years<00:00:50.660> this<00:00:50.900> has

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
thing for almost five years this has

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.040 
thing for almost five years this has
been<00:00:51.140> in<00:00:51.380> development<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.220> I've<00:00:53.030> never<00:00:53.330> made

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
been in development and I've never made

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.530 
been in development and I've never made
a<00:00:54.080> bad<00:00:54.170> batch<00:00:54.620> of<00:00:54.650> beer<00:00:55.040> every<00:00:55.940> batch<00:00:56.150> of<00:00:56.390> beer

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
a bad batch of beer every batch of beer

a bad batch of beer every batch of beer
that<00:00:56.750> we<00:00:56.840> make<00:00:57.020> with<00:00:57.230> this<00:00:57.379> thing<00:00:57.650> I<00:00:58.070> have<00:00:58.489> to

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
that we make with this thing I have to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.250 
that we make with this thing I have to
keep<00:00:58.820> my<00:00:59.030> friends<00:00:59.420> away<00:00:59.540> from<00:00:59.660> it<00:01:00.050> I<00:01:00.110> get

how to make a great beer without a lot
of<00:01:23.390> effort<00:01:23.630> now<00:01:24.670> this<00:01:25.670> batch<00:01:25.910> of<00:01:26.119> beer<00:01:26.300> is

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
of effort now this batch of beer is

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.420 
of effort now this batch of beer is
nearly<00:01:26.750> empty<00:01:26.899> I<00:01:27.410> can<00:01:27.680> show<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:27.950> here<00:01:28.280> it's

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
nearly empty I can show you here it's

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.389 
nearly empty I can show you here it's
it's<00:01:28.910> getting<00:01:29.119> close<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.630> being<00:01:29.660> empty<00:01:30.399> the

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
it's getting close to being empty the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.700 
it's getting close to being empty the
pressure<00:01:31.670> gauge<00:01:32.000> is<00:01:32.240> down<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.630> about<00:01:32.750> five<00:01:33.080> psi

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
pressure gauge is down to about five psi

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.400 
pressure gauge is down to about five psi
after<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:35.030> was<00:01:35.149> done<00:01:35.360> fermenting<00:01:35.570> it<00:01:36.050> settled

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
after it was done fermenting it settled

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.950 
after it was done fermenting it settled
in<00:01:36.530> at<00:01:36.680> about<00:01:36.860> 10<00:01:37.100> psi<00:01:37.580> but<00:01:37.820> now<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.750> beers

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
in at about 10 psi but now the beers

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.870 
in at about 10 psi but now the beers
getting<00:01:39.229> lawless<00:01:39.680> so<00:01:39.860> it's<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.399> pressure<00:01:40.670> is

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
getting lawless so it's the pressure is

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.450 
getting lawless so it's the pressure is
kind<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.180> low<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:41.690> still<00:01:42.560> gives<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.039> a<00:01:43.070> beer

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
kind of low and still gives you a beer

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.520 
kind of low and still gives you a beer
with<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.670> great<00:01:43.940> head<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.869> unit<00:01:48.229> what<00:01:48.410> it

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
with a great head the the unit what it

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.760 
with a great head the the unit what it
does<00:01:48.770> is<00:01:49.240> while<00:01:50.240> it's<00:01:50.390> fermenting<00:01:50.569> it<00:01:51.200> retains

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
does is while it's fermenting it retains

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.580 
does is while it's fermenting it retains
the<00:01:51.979> co2<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:52.910> comes<00:01:53.149> off<00:01:53.330> of<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.600> beer<00:01:53.840> which

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
the co2 that comes off of the beer which

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.469 
the co2 that comes off of the beer which
carbonates<00:01:55.160> it<00:01:55.369> you<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:55.819> see<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.149> pressure

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
carbonates it you can see the pressure

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.949 
carbonates it you can see the pressure
right<00:01:56.780> on<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:56.990> gauge<00:01:58.119> you<00:01:59.119> dispense<00:01:59.569> the<00:01:59.780> beer

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
right on the gauge you dispense the beer

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.559 
right on the gauge you dispense the beer
out<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.170> this<00:02:00.410> port<00:02:00.770> like<00:02:01.069> I<00:02:01.190> just<00:02:01.250> did<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.910> you

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
out of this port like I just did and you

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.930 
out of this port like I just did and you
can<00:02:02.720> draw<00:02:02.959> yeast<00:02:03.289> off<00:02:03.530> this<00:02:03.740> bottom<00:02:04.130> port<00:02:04.399> I'll

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
can draw yeast off this bottom port I'll

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.710 
can draw yeast off this bottom port I'll
go<00:02:05.289> more<00:02:06.289> through<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.709> unit<00:02:06.979> later<00:02:07.220> but<00:02:07.970> this
