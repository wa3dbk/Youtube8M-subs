it's<00:01:08.009> what<00:01:08.369> Anton<00:01:08.909> Rubenstein<00:01:09.630> said<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
it's what Anton Rubenstein said it's the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.450 
it's what Anton Rubenstein said it's the
sole<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.580> piano<00:01:11.850> right<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.220> can

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
sole of the piano right and but you can

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.380 
sole of the piano right and but you can
ruin<00:01:14.790> bus<00:01:15.240> by<00:01:15.870> over<00:01:16.230> pedaling<00:01:16.770> right<00:01:17.160> so<00:01:18.060> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
ruin bus by over pedaling right so I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.330 
ruin bus by over pedaling right so I
think<00:01:18.510> it<00:01:19.050> would<00:01:19.230> be<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.530> horrible<00:01:19.620> when

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
think it would be so horrible when

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.660 
think it would be so horrible when
pianists<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.450> no<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.650> think<00:01:23.010> that<00:01:23.310> used<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
pianists do this no I think that used to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.740 
pianists do this no I think that used to
be<00:01:23.850> me<00:01:24.090> that's<00:01:25.020> me<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.880> changed<00:01:26.880> my<00:01:27.180> mind

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
be me that's me I changed my mind

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.380 
be me that's me I changed my mind
then<00:01:28.020> these<00:01:28.260> notes<00:01:28.650> are<00:01:28.920> clouded<00:01:29.790> right<00:01:30.120> so

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
then these notes are clouded right so

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.570 
then these notes are clouded right so
what<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.530> after<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.610> E

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.250 

I<00:01:35.780> put<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> pedal<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.300> the<00:01:39.300> reason<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:39.990> that

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
I put the pedal and the reason I do that

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.710 
I put the pedal and the reason I do that
is<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:41.820> here<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.510> a<00:01:42.540> broken<00:01:43.230> chord<00:01:44.720> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
is because here is a broken chord and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.620 
is because here is a broken chord and
this<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.620> little<00:01:47.100> less<00:01:49.700> right<00:01:50.700> lighten<00:01:51.390> it

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
this is a little less right lighten it

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.290 
this is a little less right lighten it
and<00:01:51.900> I<00:01:52.080> put<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.380> knife<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.090> even

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
and I put a knife and I like to even

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.480 
and I put a knife and I like to even
play<00:01:54.690> that<00:01:54.930> less<00:01:55.230> that's<00:01:55.980> what<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.340> saying

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
play that less that's what I was saying

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.070 
play that less that's what I was saying
what<00:01:56.730> I<00:01:56.760> was<00:01:56.940> saying<00:01:57.150> is<00:01:57.330> when<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.660> have<00:01:57.840> to

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
what I was saying is when you have to

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.740 
what I was saying is when you have to
see<00:01:58.350> major<00:01:58.500> broken<00:01:59.070> chords<00:01:59.490> the<00:02:00.090> second<00:02:00.570> half

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
see major broken chords the second half

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.720 
see major broken chords the second half
of<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> measure<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.380> lifting<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.520> there

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.800 

that<00:02:45.440> was<00:02:45.560> beautiful<00:02:45.980> when<00:02:46.129> I<00:02:46.159> teach<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:47.000> this

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
that was beautiful when I teach it this

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.369 
that was beautiful when I teach it this
is<00:02:48.049> what<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.319> do<00:02:48.470> i<00:02:49.180> make<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.420> pupil<00:02:50.959> divide

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
is what I do i make the pupil divide

00:02:51.379 --> 00:03:00.819 
is what I do i make the pupil divide
everything<00:02:51.890> into<00:02:52.310> bar<00:02:52.670> lengths<00:02:53.209> okay<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:59.870> that

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
everything into bar lengths okay in that

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:18.129 
everything into bar lengths okay in that
case<00:03:01.000> three<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.180> less<00:03:14.980> less<00:03:16.810> absolutely<00:03:17.810> do

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
case three is less less absolutely do

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.809 
case three is less less absolutely do
you<00:03:18.590> do<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.950> same<00:03:19.129> I<00:03:19.310> do<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.609> same<00:03:19.760> thing

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
looking for the sign else that's

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:32.740 
looking for the sign else that's
wonderful<00:03:31.699> I<00:03:31.730> love<00:03:31.819> it<00:03:32.090> he<00:03:32.180> doesn't<00:03:32.359> dismiss

Oh<00:04:13.190> funny<00:04:14.190> most<00:04:14.550> people<00:04:14.910> would<00:04:15.030> think<00:04:15.060> of<00:04:15.420> that

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
Oh funny most people would think of that

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.530 
Oh funny most people would think of that
as<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.930> car

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:31.520 

tipping<00:04:21.540> back<00:04:23.570> it's<00:04:24.570> an<00:04:24.660> amazing<00:04:25.110> ending<00:04:30.530> now

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
tipping back it's an amazing ending now

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.760 
tipping back it's an amazing ending now
that's<00:04:31.740> where<00:04:31.889> I<00:04:31.919> take<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.130> pedal<00:04:32.490> off<00:04:32.639> do<00:04:33.000> you

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
that's where I take the pedal off do you

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.900 
that's where I take the pedal off do you
don't<00:04:34.770> on<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.160> last<00:04:35.580> right<00:04:36.210> DVD<00:04:37.580> so<00:04:38.580> here's

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
don't on the last right DVD so here's

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.850 
don't on the last right DVD so here's
where<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.270> would<00:04:39.300> take<00:04:39.630> it<00:04:39.810> off<00:04:39.990> on<00:04:40.200> the<00:04:40.230> DF<00:04:40.650> I

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
where you would take it off on the DF I

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:54.020 
where you would take it off on the DF I
take<00:04:41.130> it<00:04:50.960> off<00:04:51.960> too<00:04:52.919> much<00:04:53.130> -<00:04:53.490> that's<00:04:53.520> not<00:04:54.000> a

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
take it off too much - that's not a

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.790 
take it off too much - that's not a
melody<00:04:54.720> that's<00:04:54.990> a<00:04:55.110> broken<00:04:57.110> key<00:04:58.110> melodically

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
melody that's a broken key melodically

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.010 
melody that's a broken key melodically
over<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.370> of<00:04:59.640> course<00:05:00.440> so<00:05:01.440> see<00:05:01.740> I<00:05:01.980> go<00:05:03.020> crashing

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
over that of course so see I go crashing

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.220 
over that of course so see I go crashing
into<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.650> sector<00:05:04.950> that's<00:05:05.460> your<00:05:05.700> R<00:05:05.910> so<00:05:06.360> that<00:05:06.390> I

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
into the sector that's your R so that I

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.680 
into the sector that's your R so that I
can<00:05:07.530> make<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:07.830> diminutive<00:05:08.490> so<00:05:09.480> if<00:05:09.660> I<00:05:09.900> do<00:05:09.960> this

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
can make a diminutive so if I do this

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.930 
can make a diminutive so if I do this
like<00:05:12.690> many<00:05:13.080> people<00:05:13.740> do

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
like many people do

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.730 
like many people do
and<00:05:16.450> that's<00:05:16.630> where<00:05:16.840> it's<00:05:16.960> probably<00:05:17.110> I<00:05:17.440> would

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
and that's where it's probably I would

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.720 
and that's where it's probably I would
mind<00:05:17.950> that<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.610> code<00:05:18.940> lays<00:05:19.690> an<00:05:19.990> egg<00:05:20.550> since<00:05:21.550> a

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
mind that the code lays an egg since a

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.310 
mind that the code lays an egg since a
climax<00:05:22.180> didn't<00:05:22.600> do<00:05:22.720> anything

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
climax didn't do anything

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.380 
climax didn't do anything
yeah<00:05:23.800> it's<00:05:23.920> a<00:05:23.980> climate<00:05:24.340> so<00:05:24.520> this<00:05:24.820> is<00:05:25.030> what<00:05:25.300> this

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
yeah it's a climate so this is what this

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:33.230 
yeah it's a climate so this is what this
is<00:05:25.450> what<00:05:25.810> I<00:05:25.840> do<00:05:26.020> watch<00:05:26.500> here

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:41.120 

they'll<00:05:33.840> take

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.790 

on<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:41.700> dominant<00:05:41.910> 7<00:05:42.720> so<00:05:42.900> that's<00:05:43.110> Adama<00:05:43.440> seven

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
on the dominant 7 so that's Adama seven

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.010 
on the dominant 7 so that's Adama seven
of<00:05:43.890> the<00:05:43.980> das<00:05:44.160> sub-dominant<00:05:44.670> so<00:05:45.450> he's<00:05:45.660> bringing

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
of the das sub-dominant so he's bringing

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.270 
of the das sub-dominant so he's bringing
out<00:05:46.110> the<00:05:46.290> sub-dominant

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
out the sub-dominant

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.870 
out the sub-dominant
here<00:05:47.730> so<00:05:48.180> dominant<00:05:48.780> of<00:05:48.870> alignment<00:05:49.730> so<00:05:50.730> you're

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
here so dominant of alignment so you're

00:05:50.880 --> 00:06:02.029 
here so dominant of alignment so you're
making<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:51.480> big<00:05:51.690> harmonic

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039
