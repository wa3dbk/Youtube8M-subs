00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
layers

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.080 
layers
we're<00:00:20.850> gonna<00:00:20.939> go<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.320> layer<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:23.310> can't<00:00:23.760> see<00:00:24.000> it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
we're gonna go to layer you can't see it

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.650 
we're gonna go to layer you can't see it
on<00:00:24.119> here<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.570> merge<00:00:24.990> layers<00:00:25.410> or<00:00:25.710> control<00:00:26.310> e

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
on here but merge layers or control e

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.390 
on here but merge layers or control e
that<00:00:27.660> makes<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.230> big<00:00:28.470> layer<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.250> can

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
that makes it one big layer that we can

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.120 
that makes it one big layer that we can
move<00:00:29.550> around<00:00:29.730> there<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:31.500> then<00:00:31.949> we're<00:00:32.040> gonna

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
move around there and then we're gonna

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.190 
move around there and then we're gonna
do<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> same<00:00:32.669> thing<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.329> side<00:00:33.630> bar<00:00:33.930> so

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.540 
side area and hit control D to merge
those<00:00:38.910> now<00:00:39.750> we've<00:00:39.930> got<00:00:40.110> two<00:00:40.410> single<00:00:41.370> layers

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
those now we've got two single layers

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.420 
those now we've got two single layers
for<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.850> front<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> side<00:00:42.980> so<00:00:43.980> let's<00:00:44.219> go

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
we're gonna go ahead and move it holding

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.029 
we're gonna go ahead and move it holding
shift<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.610> left<00:00:51.110> I've<00:00:52.110> got<00:00:52.140> my<00:00:52.410> snaps<00:00:52.770> on

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
shift to the left I've got my snaps on

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.740

but make sure it lines right up with

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.389 
but make sure it lines right up with
this<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:56.070> side<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> front<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> box<00:00:58.399> so

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
this the side of the front of the box so

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.970 
this the side of the front of the box so
I'm<00:00:59.460> gonna<00:00:59.609> have<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.820> right<00:00:59.850> about<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.980> now

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980

black for now let's go ahead and select
our<00:01:10.409> front<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.820> box<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:13.520> we'll<00:01:14.520> hit<00:01:14.610> ctrl

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
our front of the box here we'll hit ctrl

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.660 
our front of the box here we'll hit ctrl
T<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.420> transform<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.369> right<00:01:17.640> click

in this transform area and go to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.859 
in this transform area and go to
perspective<00:01:22.880> now<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.360> grab<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:24.840> of

these corners perspective basically that

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.130 
these corners perspective basically that
you<00:01:26.729> add<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> perspective<00:01:27.540> which<00:01:27.930> you'll<00:01:28.110> see

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
you add a perspective which you'll see

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
you add a perspective which you'll see
here<00:01:28.320> click<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> corners<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.150> on

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
in this way it adds perspective like

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.780 
in this way it adds perspective like
that<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.960> bring<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> down<00:01:37.579> kind<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.640> makes
