00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
doing it and then I realized then I

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.450

after you know months of research where
you<00:02:10.979> know<00:02:11.070> cuz<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.370> must<00:02:11.520> kept<00:02:11.670> telling<00:02:11.940> us

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
you know cuz you must kept telling us

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.640 
you know cuz you must kept telling us
that<00:02:12.180> we<00:02:12.300> need<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> larger<00:02:12.960> in<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.170> larger<00:02:13.470> screen

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that we need a larger in a larger screen

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.800 
that we need a larger in a larger screen
so<00:02:14.070> here<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.730> table<00:02:15.180> cannot<00:02:15.390> be<00:02:15.510> used<00:02:15.660> in

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
so here it is a table cannot be used in

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.480 
so here it is a table cannot be used in
one<00:02:15.959> hand<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.440> can<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.770> used<00:02:16.920> with<00:02:17.100> one<00:02:17.280> hand

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
one hand this can be used with one hand

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.070 
one hand this can be used with one hand
and<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.420> put<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.780> your<00:02:18.870> pocket

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080
