essentially have this essentially you

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.760 
essentially have this essentially you
have<00:00:53.270> this<00:00:53.450> chain<00:00:53.810> also<00:00:54.230> like<00:00:54.470> a<00:00:54.500> large

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
have this chain also like a large

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.360 
have this chain also like a large
bicycle<00:00:55.340> chain<00:00:55.579> made<00:00:56.570> of<00:00:56.780> buckets<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.560> each

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
bicycle chain made of buckets and each

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.100 
bicycle chain made of buckets and each
bucket<00:00:58.670> carries<00:00:59.210> approximately<00:00:59.360> probably

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
bucket carries approximately probably

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.190 
bucket carries approximately probably
bout<00:01:00.200> two<00:01:00.380> gallons<00:01:00.829> each<00:01:00.950> at<00:01:01.280> least<00:01:01.310> and<00:01:01.899> so<00:01:02.899> if

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
bout two gallons each at least and so if

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.270 
bout two gallons each at least and so if
you<00:01:03.350> look<00:01:03.500> at<00:01:03.649> one<00:01:03.860> whole<00:01:04.100> revolution<00:01:04.610> of<00:01:05.200> this

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
you look at one whole revolution of this

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.080 
you look at one whole revolution of this
of<00:01:07.280> this<00:01:07.820> chain<00:01:08.240> on<00:01:08.540> this<00:01:09.409> water<00:01:09.710> pump<00:01:10.040> you<00:01:10.820> see

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
of this chain on this water pump you see

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.390 
of this chain on this water pump you see
that<00:01:11.330> roughly<00:01:11.690> approximately<00:01:12.530> about<00:01:12.590> every

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
that roughly approximately about every

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.700 
that roughly approximately about every
minute<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:14.150> two<00:01:14.330> minutes<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:14.930> would<00:01:15.350> say<00:01:15.380> every

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
minute to two minutes I would say every

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.580 
minute to two minutes I would say every
two<00:01:15.920> minutes<00:01:16.280> an<00:01:17.180> additional<00:01:17.659> 80<00:01:17.930> gallons<00:01:18.500> of

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
two minutes an additional 80 gallons of

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.090 
two minutes an additional 80 gallons of
water<00:01:18.890> are<00:01:19.280> pumped<00:01:19.810> from<00:01:20.810> this<00:01:21.020> from<00:01:21.979> this

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
water are pumped from this from this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.520 
water are pumped from this from this
machine<00:01:22.549> it's<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.540> really<00:01:23.750> inventive<00:01:24.200> way<00:01:24.380> it

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
machine it's a really inventive way it

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.850 
machine it's a really inventive way it
doesn't<00:01:24.799> run<00:01:24.950> off<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:25.159> any<00:01:25.490> electricity

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860
