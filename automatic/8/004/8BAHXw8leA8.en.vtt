last<00:02:12.980> night<00:02:13.250> my<00:02:13.400> husband<00:02:13.730> went<00:02:13.910> for<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.060> run<00:02:14.209> and

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
last night my husband went for a run and

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.320 
last night my husband went for a run and
he<00:02:14.510> had<00:02:14.630> really<00:02:14.870> saw<00:02:15.110> cars<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.970> he<00:02:16.970> went<00:02:17.239> off

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
he had really saw cars and he went off

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.090 
he had really saw cars and he went off
and<00:02:17.450> did<00:02:17.510> his<00:02:17.600> sprints<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.200> ending<00:02:18.470> ended<00:02:18.980> up

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
and did his sprints and ending ended up

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.990 
and did his sprints and ending ended up
putting<00:02:19.510> his<00:02:20.510> quad<00:02:20.780> muscle<00:02:21.200> right<00:02:21.410> up<00:02:21.590> here

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
putting his quad muscle right up here

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.809 
putting his quad muscle right up here
because<00:02:23.000> his<00:02:23.450> cars<00:02:23.720> were<00:02:23.900> tight<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.819> he

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
because his cars were tight and he

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.970 
because his cars were tight and he
hadn't<00:02:26.239> really<00:02:26.720> released<00:02:27.110> them<00:02:27.260> properly<00:02:27.560> and

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980
