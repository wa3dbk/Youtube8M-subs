00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.199
 clicked time gets the practice time and 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.660
 Although it is in a very interesting 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.739
 topic also a lot of workshops 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.350
 Often first and foremost falls damn 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.850
 will be brought or wrong by many 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.339
 photographers working with me in the workshops 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.909
 are claiming at the beginning nor that a 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:47.519
 honeycomb in a reflector, the light harder 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:51.059
 it would not be so 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.860
 the size is the sole factor for 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.659
 the hardness that means the bigger one 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.790
 light source is the further that will be 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.890
 light what results from this the further 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.690
 the courses will be this size 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.519
 be relativized over the distance 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.289
 or over the size of the 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.360
 actual size of the light source so 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.610
 larger softbox softer courses closer 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.250
 at the same size also softer gradients 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.050
 the honeycomb does not change the size 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.000
 and therefore you can be clear 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.420
 say the color does not change the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.340
 hardness 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.750
 who says I want a harder light with the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.310
 color did not understand that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.740
 So please do not say photography 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.289
 what the real power is that stray light 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.940
 take or the light cone of a 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.100
 narrow the reflector further 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.979
 So if I take the color out then 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.390
 I'll get to see you soon 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.920
 my hand scatters 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.420
 So that's not a stray light easy 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.979
 the reflector fills the whole 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.090
 the moment where I take the honeycomb 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.320
 I have not got not as a 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.570
 Only when I come in here in these 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.420
 tight bunched then did not throw 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.090
 I light my hand on that again 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.130
 means that was cramped the beam of light 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.020
 a halo she does not prevent the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.439
 Hardness of a light source is not the size 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.070
 and where the picture is often different 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.810
 looks 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.979
 that is the reason why many 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.380
 Photographers claim the light will 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.450
 softer is that by scattering de 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.590
 a light often becomes the shade 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.420
 we are brightened up 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.670
 I am with the reflectors a wall 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.470
 this one knows that starts too high i too 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.880
 Sprinkle and turn the light back on 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.950
 imitate in all directions and hold 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.600
 then indirectly over 10,000 corners 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.859
 the shadows and thus the effect 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.070
 no longer so crisp and shadowy 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.959
 Contrast this was I use around 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.920
 to get stronger shadows 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.630
 the scattered light, for example, too 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.140
 Minimize the illumination 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.970
 minimize 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.769
 we just took a picture here and 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.359
 have the world around really crisp 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.989
 to have shade when I have the weapon 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.790
 use 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.640
 then my shadow will not get harder 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.980
 but only more intense and the h 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.340
 Crispy portrait not made here 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.340
 the ground
