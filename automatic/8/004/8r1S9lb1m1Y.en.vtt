getting<00:02:07.399> out<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:08.760> 10000<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.869> larger<00:02:10.260> sheet

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
getting out of the 10000 is larger sheet

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.200 
getting out of the 10000 is larger sheet
size<00:02:10.890> which<00:02:11.190> allows<00:02:11.460> us<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.790> do<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:11.910> larger

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
size which allows us to do a larger

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.960 
size which allows us to do a larger
format<00:02:12.570> in<00:02:13.080> Oakland<00:02:13.410> our<00:02:13.950> expectation<00:02:14.940> was

format in Oakland our expectation was

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.699

that the print quality would be every

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.490 
that the print quality would be every
bit<00:02:16.740> as<00:02:17.040> good<00:02:17.190> as<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.520> Indigo<00:02:17.880> 7500<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.350> is

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
bit as good as the Indigo 7500 and it is

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.100

we think that the Indigo 10000 will open
up<00:02:43.360> new<00:02:43.660> markets<00:02:43.690> for<00:02:44.200> us<00:02:44.530> beyond<00:02:44.890> traditional
