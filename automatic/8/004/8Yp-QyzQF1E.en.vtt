00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
it's really simple but I think it adds a

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.489 
it's really simple but I think it adds a
lot<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.609> the<00:02:04.909> album<00:02:05.240> all<00:02:05.420> I've<00:02:05.600> done<00:02:05.749> is<00:02:06.079> cut<00:02:06.380> it

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
lot to the album all I've done is cut it

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:09.609 
lot to the album all I've done is cut it
out<00:02:06.619> in<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.130> craft<00:02:07.399> cardstock<00:02:07.999> and<00:02:08.479> then<00:02:08.959> laid

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
out in the craft cardstock and then laid

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.640 
out in the craft cardstock and then laid
it<00:02:09.740> on<00:02:09.860> top<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.480> white<00:02:11.480> daisy<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.410> gives<00:02:12.560> it

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
it on top of white daisy and it gives it

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.440 
it on top of white daisy and it gives it
that<00:02:12.680> nice<00:02:12.920> pop<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.150> add<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.420> date

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
that nice pop so we can add the date

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.410 
that nice pop so we can add the date
here<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:15.130> also<00:02:16.130> love<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.550> fun<00:02:16.760> border<00:02:17.150> on<00:02:17.300> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
here I also love this fun border on the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.770 
here I also love this fun border on the
side

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.360 

so<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.380> can<00:02:21.500> see<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.010> great<00:02:22.220> example

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
so you can see this is a great example

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.060 
so you can see this is a great example
of<00:02:22.880> just<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.180> really<00:02:23.450> basic<00:02:23.890> mini-album<00:02:24.890> that

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
of just a really basic mini-album that

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.610 
of just a really basic mini-album that
you<00:02:25.130> can<00:02:25.310> create<00:02:25.490> using<00:02:25.730> these<00:02:26.030> keys<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:26.630> this

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
you can create using these keys so this

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.100 
you can create using these keys so this
album<00:02:27.980> has<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.220> really<00:02:28.580> over<00:02:28.970> travel<00:02:29.330> theme<00:02:29.600> but

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
album has a really over travel theme but

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.500 
album has a really over travel theme but
you<00:02:30.200> can<00:02:30.410> use<00:02:30.530> these<00:02:30.740> cutouts<00:02:31.160> for<00:02:31.730> projects

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
you can use these cutouts for projects

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.090 
you can use these cutouts for projects
that<00:02:32.900> don't<00:02:33.080> have<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.320> travel<00:02:33.710> theme<00:02:33.860> for

a<00:02:38.360> nice<00:02:38.540> friendship<00:02:38.930> card<00:02:39.290> doesn't<00:02:39.770> have

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
a nice friendship card doesn't have

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.530 
a nice friendship card doesn't have
anything<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.370> do<00:02:40.490> with<00:02:40.520> travel<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.240> uses<00:02:41.510> a

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
anything to do with travel but it uses a

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.390 
anything to do with travel but it uses a
lot<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.990> same<00:02:42.200> elements<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:42.950> are<00:02:43.370> found
