00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
show you how to set up row row code for

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.270 
show you how to set up row row code for
your<00:00:05.759> NetBeans<00:00:06.299> IDE<00:00:06.890> so<00:00:07.890> we'll<00:00:07.980> start<00:00:08.189> by

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
your NetBeans IDE so we'll start by

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.549 
your NetBeans IDE so we'll start by
opening<00:00:08.370> up<00:00:08.820> NetBeans<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:12.320> we're<00:00:13.320> going<00:00:13.469> to

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
opening up NetBeans and we're going to

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.090 
opening up NetBeans and we're going to
go<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.710> tools<00:00:14.299> and<00:00:15.299> libraries<00:00:16.170> here<00:00:16.920> we're

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
go to tools and libraries here we're

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.240 
go to tools and libraries here we're
going<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.279> create<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.910> Robo<00:00:18.210> code<00:00:18.480> library<00:00:19.250> so

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
going to create the Robo code library so

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.029 
going to create the Robo code library so
supper<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.910> new<00:00:21.180> library<00:00:21.680> and<00:00:22.680> giving

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
supper going to new library and giving

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.730 
supper going to new library and giving
it<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.189> name<00:00:23.369> for<00:00:24.300> example

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
it a name for example

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.470 
it a name for example
bro<00:00:25.740> bro<00:00:25.769> code<00:00:26.750> and<00:00:27.750> okay

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
bro bro code and okay

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.889 
bro bro code and okay
next<00:00:30.480> we're<00:00:30.599> going<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.750> add<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.900> jar<00:00:31.260> file<00:00:32.899> so

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
next we're going to add a jar file so

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.660 
next we're going to add a jar file so
navigate<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.500> where<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.829> installed<00:00:34.860> Pro

now<00:01:15.630> let's<00:01:15.810> create<00:01:15.960> our<00:01:16.140> first<00:01:16.500> project<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:18.509> we

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
now let's create our first project so we

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.039 
now let's create our first project so we

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.300 

to<00:01:35.110> add<00:01:35.230> the<00:01:35.350> library<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:35.890> project

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
to add the library to the project

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.980 
to add the library to the project
right-click<00:01:36.910> libraries<00:01:37.720> add<00:01:38.530> library<00:01:39.990> and

right-click libraries add library and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.110 
right-click libraries add library and
never<00:01:41.170> get<00:01:41.410> down<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.160> row<00:01:42.310> record<00:01:42.729> library

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
what a robot will look like and we'll

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.920 
what a robot will look like and we'll
start<00:01:57.910> battling<00:01:58.300> them<00:01:58.470> thanks<00:01:59.470> for<00:01:59.590> listening
