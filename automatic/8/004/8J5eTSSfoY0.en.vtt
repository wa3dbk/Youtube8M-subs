story where when David dresses to battle

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.300 
story where when David dresses to battle
Goliath<00:01:45.509> he<00:01:45.810> doesn't<00:01:46.140> put<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.619> armor<00:01:46.740> or

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
so much money printing that it probably

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.170 
so much money printing that it probably
will<00:04:48.050> but<00:04:48.620> just<00:04:48.860> compare<00:04:49.219> the<00:04:49.370> price<00:04:49.849> chart<00:04:50.090> i

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
how it's just absolutely falling from

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.790 
how it's just absolutely falling from
2005<00:05:06.250> till<00:05:07.250> today<00:05:07.599> now<00:05:08.599> what<00:05:09.199> this<00:05:09.409> price

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
2005 till today now what this price

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.559 
2005 till today now what this price
chart<00:05:10.159> is<00:05:10.310> is<00:05:10.520> an<00:05:10.849> inverted<00:05:13.120> price<00:05:14.120> chart<00:05:14.419> of

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
chart is is an inverted price chart of

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:19.119 
chart is is an inverted price chart of
gold<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:16.389> so<00:05:17.389> the<00:05:18.349> reason<00:05:18.560> why<00:05:18.800> i<00:05:18.830> thought

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
gold and so the reason why i thought

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:22.119 
gold and so the reason why i thought
this<00:05:19.250> was<00:05:19.430> really<00:05:19.610> interesting<00:05:20.270> was<00:05:20.300> i<00:05:21.129> have

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:22.129 
this was really interesting was i have

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.100 
this was really interesting was i have
to<00:05:22.340> believe<00:05:22.610> to<00:05:22.909> your<00:05:23.060> brain<00:05:23.360> you<00:05:23.629> can<00:05:23.810> clearly

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
to believe to your brain you can clearly

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.040 
to believe to your brain you can clearly
see<00:05:24.590> that<00:05:24.860> this<00:05:25.610> inverted<00:05:26.120> price<00:05:26.569> chart<00:05:26.930> of

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
see that this inverted price chart of

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.860 
see that this inverted price chart of
gold<00:05:27.289> so<00:05:27.529> that<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:28.159> more<00:05:28.460> this<00:05:28.669> white<00:05:29.479> line

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
gold so that the more this white line

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.170 
gold so that the more this white line
falls<00:05:30.409> the<00:05:31.250> higher<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:32.029> price<00:05:32.330> of<00:05:32.599> gold<00:05:32.659> and

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
falls the higher the price of gold and

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.999 
falls the higher the price of gold and
you<00:05:35.180> can<00:05:35.360> probably<00:05:35.629> see<00:05:35.960> here<00:05:36.259> that<00:05:36.289> this

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
you can probably see here that this

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.980 
you can probably see here that this
really<00:05:37.580> looks<00:05:37.879> like<00:05:38.120> it's<00:05:38.300> falling<00:05:38.479> and<00:05:38.810> right

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
really looks like it's falling and right

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.629 
really looks like it's falling and right
now<00:05:39.139> it's<00:05:39.319> consolidating<00:05:40.250> and<00:05:40.339> whatever

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
now it's consolidating and whatever

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.610 
now it's consolidating and whatever
something<00:05:41.389> consolidates<00:05:41.990> after<00:05:42.319> a<00:05:42.349> long

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
something consolidates after a long

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.339 
something consolidates after a long
trend<00:05:43.069> it<00:05:43.849> has<00:05:44.060> an<00:05:44.210> eighty<00:05:44.419> percent<00:05:44.629> chance<00:05:45.139> of

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
trend it has an eighty percent chance of

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:47.800 
trend it has an eighty percent chance of
breaking<00:05:45.710> out<00:05:46.159> in<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:46.699> same<00:05:47.000> direction<00:05:47.240> that

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
breaking out in the same direction that

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.129 
breaking out in the same direction that
it<00:05:48.229> came<00:05:48.710> in<00:05:48.889> so<00:05:49.069> it<00:05:49.219> came<00:05:49.430> in<00:05:49.699> falling<00:05:50.479> ending

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
it came in so it came in falling ending

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.800 
it came in so it came in falling ending
this<00:05:51.469> example<00:05:51.860> and<00:05:52.300> there's<00:05:53.300> an<00:05:53.419> eighty-five

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
this example and there's an eighty-five

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.240 
this example and there's an eighty-five
percent<00:05:53.990> chance<00:05:54.349> when<00:05:54.589> it<00:05:54.680> breaks<00:05:54.889> out<00:05:55.219> of

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
percent chance when it breaks out of

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.550 
percent chance when it breaks out of
this<00:05:55.490> consolidation<00:05:56.120> it<00:05:56.479> will<00:05:56.659> break<00:05:56.870> out<00:05:57.110> to

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
this consolidation it will break out to

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.890 
this consolidation it will break out to
the<00:05:57.680> downward<00:05:58.190> side<00:05:58.669> and<00:05:59.060> I<00:05:59.569> just<00:05:59.719> think

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
the downward side and I just think

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.119 
the downward side and I just think
that's<00:06:00.050> great<00:06:00.289> that<00:06:00.469> we<00:06:00.589> can<00:06:00.710> look<00:06:00.830> at<00:06:00.979> this

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129 
that's great that we can look at this

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.279 
that's great that we can look at this
from<00:06:01.339> a<00:06:01.430> completely<00:06:01.969> flipped<00:06:02.449> perspective

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
from a completely flipped perspective

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.700 
from a completely flipped perspective
and<00:06:03.409> notice<00:06:03.680> oh<00:06:03.860> wow<00:06:04.389> yeah<00:06:05.389> that<00:06:05.659> that<00:06:06.110> looks

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
and notice oh wow yeah that that looks

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.320 
and notice oh wow yeah that that looks
pretty<00:06:07.039> clear<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:07.610> direction<00:06:07.909> that<00:06:08.089> it's

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
pretty clear the direction that it's

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.050 
pretty clear the direction that it's
going<00:06:09.069> the<00:06:10.069> last<00:06:10.339> thing<00:06:10.520> I<00:06:10.639> want<00:06:10.789> to<00:06:10.819> show<00:06:10.909> you

amex gold bug index fee and you can

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.560 
amex gold bug index fee and you can
clearly<00:06:48.840> tell<00:06:49.130> that<00:06:50.130> the<00:06:50.310> earnings<00:06:50.790> are<00:06:51.060> going

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
clearly tell that the earnings are going

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.790 
clearly tell that the earnings are going
up<00:06:52.850> so<00:06:53.850> this<00:06:54.450> is<00:06:54.480> clearly<00:06:54.870> not<00:06:55.110> an<00:06:55.410> earnings

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
up so this is clearly not an earnings

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.400 
up so this is clearly not an earnings
thing<00:06:56.070> why<00:06:56.820> the<00:06:56.880> market<00:06:57.270> is<00:06:57.360> falling<00:06:57.570> and<00:06:57.810> I

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
thing why the market is falling and I

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.350 
thing why the market is falling and I
just<00:06:58.680> look<00:06:58.830> at<00:06:58.950> this<00:06:59.070> as<00:06:59.340> there's<00:06:59.760> a<00:06:59.850> cleaning

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
just look at this as there's a cleaning

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.840 
just look at this as there's a cleaning
out<00:07:00.540> there<00:07:01.500> are<00:07:01.650> three<00:07:02.010> big<00:07:02.220> clean<00:07:02.520> outs<00:07:02.670> in

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
out there are three big clean outs in

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.820 
out there are three big clean outs in
any<00:07:03.030> secular<00:07:03.540> bull<00:07:03.840> market<00:07:04.260> and<00:07:04.440> we<00:07:04.560> are<00:07:04.650> in

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
any secular bull market and we are in

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.980 
any secular bull market and we are in
one<00:07:05.040> now<00:07:05.250> the<00:07:05.820> reason<00:07:06.030> why<00:07:06.240> this<00:07:06.300> clean-out

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:06.990 
one now the reason why this clean-out

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.660 
one now the reason why this clean-out
feels<00:07:07.260> so<00:07:07.620> much<00:07:07.800> more<00:07:07.860> painful<00:07:08.280> than<00:07:08.610> the

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:08.670 
feels so much more painful than the

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.790 
feels so much more painful than the
previous<00:07:09.150> one<00:07:09.330> is<00:07:09.540> because<00:07:10.230> during<00:07:10.530> this

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
previous one is because during this

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.280 
previous one is because during this
clean<00:07:11.130> out<00:07:11.310> the<00:07:11.880> stock<00:07:12.150> market<00:07:12.690> itself<00:07:13.050> is

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
clean out the stock market itself is

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.040 
clean out the stock market itself is
going<00:07:13.620> up<00:07:13.800> while<00:07:14.100> this<00:07:14.370> sector<00:07:14.910> is<00:07:15.090> falling

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050 
going up while this sector is falling

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.400 
going up while this sector is falling
and<00:07:16.200> that<00:07:16.410> feels<00:07:16.680> very<00:07:17.070> very<00:07:17.460> difficult

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.410 
and that feels very very difficult

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.900 
and that feels very very difficult
