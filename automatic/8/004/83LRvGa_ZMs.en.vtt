and like we came up with this color

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.190 
and like we came up with this color
together<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.810> like<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.320> idea<00:03:31.620> um<00:03:33.020> it's<00:03:34.020> just

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
together and like the idea um it's just

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.010 
together and like the idea um it's just
that<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:35.250> kind<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.850> started<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.420> bit<00:03:36.600> too<00:03:36.780> low

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
that that kind of started a bit too low

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.010 
that that kind of started a bit too low
because<00:03:37.460> if<00:03:38.460> not<00:03:38.700> then<00:03:39.300> it<00:03:39.570> would<00:03:39.750> have<00:03:39.900> been

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
because if not then it would have been

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.040 
because if not then it would have been
perfect<00:03:40.400> but<00:03:41.400> yet<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.270> hundred<00:03:42.870> percent

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050
