00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the reason why I usually g11 in black

the reason why I usually g11 in black
ops<00:00:36.690> because<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.350> silence<00:00:37.649> formats<00:00:37.950> it

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
ops because of the silence formats it

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.389 
ops because of the silence formats it
just<00:00:38.670> feels<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.120> little<00:00:39.149> bit<00:00:39.510> similar<00:00:39.829> so<00:00:40.829> yeah

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.140 
sure who it was and it kind of made me
think<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.329> I'd<00:01:33.659> quite<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.650> video

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
think that I'd quite like to do a video

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.920 
think that I'd quite like to do a video
discussing<00:01:36.150> some<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.689> stuff<00:01:36.900> is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
discussing some of the stuff is

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.950 
discussing some of the stuff is
implemented<00:01:37.619> into<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.920> multiplayer<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
implemented into the multiplayer and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.480 
implemented into the multiplayer and
kind<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.020> what<00:01:40.200> my<00:01:40.350> opinions<00:01:40.770> are<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:41.250> it

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
kind of what my opinions are about it

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.160 
kind of what my opinions are about it
obviously<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.210> isn't<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.570> an<00:01:42.689> exclusive

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
obviously this isn't like an exclusive

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.060 
obviously this isn't like an exclusive
or<00:01:43.259> anything<00:01:43.350> because<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.770> stuff's<00:01:43.950> been

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
or anything because this stuff's been

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.789 
or anything because this stuff's been
out<00:01:44.189> for<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.399> while<00:01:44.579> probably<00:01:45.320> will<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.350> imagine

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
out for a while probably will I imagine

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.749 
out for a while probably will I imagine
the<00:01:46.860> majority<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.490> would<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.610> been

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the majority of it would have been

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.969 
the majority of it would have been
during<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> card<00:01:48.450> XP<00:01:48.750> event<00:01:49.079> some<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.890> was

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
during the card XP event some of it was

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.859 
during the card XP event some of it was
leaked<00:01:50.189> before<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.420> been<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.689> for<00:01:51.720> a

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
leaked before but it's been out for a

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.510 
leaked before but it's been out for a
little<00:01:51.930> while<00:01:52.170> yet<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:52.710> what<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.100> wanted<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> do

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
little while yet but what I wanted to do

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.039 
little while yet but what I wanted to do
was<00:01:53.670> make<00:01:53.820> sort<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> series<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.689> videos

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
was make sort of a series of videos

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.200 
was make sort of a series of videos
discussing<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.579> don't<00:01:56.850> think<00:01:57.000> I'll<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.149> able

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
discussing it I don't think I'll be able

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.359 
discussing it I don't think I'll be able
to<00:01:57.360> fit<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:57.810> into<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.350> video<00:01:58.649> they'll

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
to fit it all into this video they'll

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.240 
to fit it all into this video they'll
probably<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.729> two<00:01:59.880> parts<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.860> yeah<00:02:01.860> once

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
probably be two parts of this yeah once

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.859 
probably be two parts of this yeah once
the<00:02:02.399> country's<00:02:02.700> go<00:02:02.850> down<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.240> list<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.689> terms

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the country's go down the list in terms

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.679 
the country's go down the list in terms
of<00:02:04.170> what<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.380> know<00:02:04.530> about<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.460> what<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> think

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
of what I know about it and what I think

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.660 
of what I know about it and what I think
we'll<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.770> terms<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.069> impact<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
we'll have in terms of impact of the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.270 
we'll have in terms of impact of the
game<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:10.440> yeah<00:02:10.560> we<00:02:10.679> might<00:02:10.830> as<00:02:10.890> well<00:02:10.920> start<00:02:11.160> from

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
game so yeah we might as well start from

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.350 
game so yeah we might as well start from
the<00:02:11.370> beginning

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
the beginning

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.990 
the beginning
and<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:14.400> first<00:02:14.610> thing<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.660> read<00:02:16.200> which<00:02:16.620> was<00:02:17.610> I'm

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
and the first thing I read which was I'm

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.570 
and the first thing I read which was I'm
not<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.300> sure<00:02:18.710> it's<00:02:19.710> not<00:02:19.860> really<00:02:20.100> anything

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
not so sure it's not really anything

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.940 
not so sure it's not really anything
special<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.690> prestigious<00:02:22.440> now<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.740> 80

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
special but the prestigious now have 80

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.910 
special but the prestigious now have 80
levels<00:02:23.340> in<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:24.690> just<00:02:25.440> seems<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.650> bit<00:02:25.770> too

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
levels in and it just seems a bit too

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.020 
levels in and it just seems a bit too
many<00:02:26.160> for<00:02:26.460> me<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:28.590> was<00:02:28.710> obviously<00:02:29.010> 55<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.910> then

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
many for me it was obviously 55 and then

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.060 
many for me it was obviously 55 and then
it<00:02:30.150> was<00:02:30.330> like<00:02:31.730> 15<00:02:32.730> at<00:02:32.970> 70<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.530> just<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
it was like 15 at 70 and I just the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.350 
it was like 15 at 70 and I just the
makeup<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.370> mind<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.880> what<00:02:36.030> number<00:02:36.270> they

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
makeup the mind but what number they

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.240 
makeup the mind but what number they
want<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.570> keep<00:02:36.720> really<00:02:37.020> are<00:02:37.200> kisum<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.860> don't

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
want to keep really are kisum I don't

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.320 
want to keep really are kisum I don't
really<00:02:38.400> see<00:02:38.520> that<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.760> point<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.300> know

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
really see that the point of it you know

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.680 
really see that the point of it you know
I<00:02:39.770> why<00:02:40.770> go<00:02:41.070> up<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.310> level<00:02:41.430> 80<00:02:41.640> when<00:02:42.240> you<00:02:42.540> can

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
I why go up to level 80 when you can

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.270 
I why go up to level 80 when you can
earn<00:02:42.780> exactly<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.290> same<00:02:43.470> amount<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.709> XP<00:02:44.070> and

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
earn exactly the same amount of XP and

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.220 
earn exactly the same amount of XP and
get<00:02:44.400> up<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.580> 50<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.150> then<00:02:45.209> prestige<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:46.020> I

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
get up to 50 and then prestige and I

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.410 
get up to 50 and then prestige and I
don't<00:02:46.890> know<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.010> imagine<00:02:47.580> that's<00:02:47.700> probably<00:02:47.970> in

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
don't know I imagine that's probably in

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.330 
don't know I imagine that's probably in
order<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.840> cater<00:02:49.050> for<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.800> amount<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.160> stuff

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
order to cater for the amount of stuff

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.740 
order to cater for the amount of stuff
that's<00:02:50.489> going<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.700> be<00:02:50.760> unlocked<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.270> they

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
that's going to be unlocked and they

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.030 
that's going to be unlocked and they
just<00:02:51.900> physically<00:02:52.320> needed<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.650> create<00:02:52.830> more

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
just physically needed to create more

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.770 
just physically needed to create more
levels<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.850> can<00:02:54.090> add<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.209> lot<00:02:54.330> more<00:02:54.390> content

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
levels so you can add a lot more content

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.500 
levels so you can add a lot more content
maybe<00:02:55.620> that's<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.980> case<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.850> if<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.239> I

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
maybe that's the case and if it is I

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.880 
maybe that's the case and if it is I
think<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.780> might<00:02:57.900> be<00:02:57.959> a<00:02:58.050> good<00:02:58.140> thing<00:02:58.200> because

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
think that might be a good thing because

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.320 
think that might be a good thing because
that<00:02:59.130> means<00:02:59.459> that<00:02:59.730> there'll<00:02:59.850> be<00:02:59.880> a<00:02:59.970> lot<00:03:00.270> of

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
that means that there'll be a lot of

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.860 
that means that there'll be a lot of
stuff<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.660> unlock<00:03:01.080> sort<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.650> keep<00:03:01.800> your<00:03:01.920> busy

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
stuff to unlock sort of keep your busy

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.970 
stuff to unlock sort of keep your busy
but<00:03:03.870> will<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:04.140> discourage<00:03:04.680> people<00:03:04.830> from

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
but will it discourage people from

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.400 
but will it discourage people from
prestiging<00:03:05.700> if<00:03:05.820> it<00:03:05.910> takes<00:03:06.120> so<00:03:06.420> long<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.840> unlock

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
prestiging if it takes so long to unlock

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.960 
that's now a death streak in the game I
don't<00:03:46.860> know<00:03:47.010> why<00:03:47.190> they<00:03:47.340> want<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.549> hang<00:03:47.730> on<00:03:47.820> to

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
don't know why they want to hang on to

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.440 
don't know why they want to hang on to
this<00:03:48.320> sort<00:03:49.320> of<00:03:49.430> second<00:03:50.430> chance<00:03:50.640> idea<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.209> much

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
this sort of second chance idea so much

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.090 
this sort of second chance idea so much
it<00:03:51.690> just<00:03:51.810> seems<00:03:52.049> that<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.260> ecology<00:03:52.590> franchise

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
it just seems that the ecology franchise

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.920 
it just seems that the ecology franchise
just<00:03:53.459> so<00:03:53.910> reluctant<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.420> get<00:03:54.570> rid<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.750> it

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
just so reluctant to get rid of it

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.320 
just so reluctant to get rid of it
despite<00:03:55.200> everybody<00:03:55.799> really<00:03:56.130> hating<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:57.239> I

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
despite everybody really hating it and I

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.600 
despite everybody really hating it and I
really<00:03:57.690> don't<00:03:57.840> understand<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.459> it

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
really don't understand it is it is it

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.400 
really don't understand it is it is it
so<00:03:59.820> look<00:04:00.030> like<00:04:00.209> players<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:00.780> just<00:04:00.810> start<00:04:01.320> at

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
so look like players that just start at

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.660 
so look like players that just start at
the<00:04:01.470> game<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.680> have<00:04:01.890> really<00:04:02.070> really<00:04:02.280> bad<00:04:02.519> at

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
the game and have really really bad at

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.789 
the game and have really really bad at
it<00:04:02.760> maybe<00:04:02.970> it's<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.269> first<00:04:03.480> ecology<00:04:04.019> get<00:04:04.680> like

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
it maybe it's the first ecology get like

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.080 
it maybe it's the first ecology get like
a<00:04:04.830> fighting<00:04:05.190> chance<00:04:05.400> of<00:04:05.549> getting<00:04:05.730> some<00:04:05.850> kills

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
a fighting chance of getting some kills

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.600 
a fighting chance of getting some kills
I<00:04:06.360> don't<00:04:06.930> know<00:04:07.049> but<00:04:07.410> if<00:04:08.010> you've<00:04:08.250> got<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.400> good

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
I don't know but if you've got a good

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.220 
I don't know but if you've got a good
player<00:04:08.850> using<00:04:09.299> out<00:04:09.420> their<00:04:09.570> lab<00:04:09.720> use<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.019> to<00:04:10.110> the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
player using out their lab use it to the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.390 
player using out their lab use it to the
full<00:04:10.410> because<00:04:10.650> they'll<00:04:10.860> get<00:04:11.010> used<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.310> the

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
full because they'll get used to the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.949 
full because they'll get used to the
reaction<00:04:11.640> time<00:04:12.000> falling<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.630> rounds<00:04:12.870> of

a<00:04:14.370> lot<00:04:14.489> of<00:04:14.549> people<00:04:14.700> but<00:04:15.510> obviously<00:04:15.810> now<00:04:16.049> that

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
a lot of people but obviously now that

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.759 
a lot of people but obviously now that
is<00:04:16.640> it's<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:17.760> it's<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.479> know<00:04:18.600> a<00:04:18.630> pain<00:04:19.200> of<00:04:19.500> the

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
painkiller a death streak it might be

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.670 
painkiller a death streak it might be
you<00:04:24.030> might<00:04:24.210> account<00:04:24.599> it<00:04:24.810> less<00:04:25.110> but

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
you might account it less but

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.960 
you might account it less but
dogging<00:04:25.889> me<00:04:26.009> just<00:04:26.190> as<00:04:26.310> frustrating<00:04:26.759> if<00:04:26.820> you

dogging me just as frustrating if you

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.879 
dogging me just as frustrating if you
die<00:04:27.240> to<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:28.229> i'll<00:04:28.380> say<00:04:28.500> i<00:04:28.560> mentioned

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
die to it and i'll say i mentioned

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.110 
die to it and i'll say i mentioned
painkiller<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.490> i'm<00:04:29.669> not<00:04:29.789> too<00:04:29.940> sure<00:04:30.000> about

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
painkiller that i'm not too sure about

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.659 
painkiller that i'm not too sure about
painkiller<00:04:30.860> being<00:04:31.860> included<00:04:32.130> in<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.460> game

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
painkiller being included in the game

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.189 
painkiller being included in the game
that'll<00:04:33.150> be<00:04:33.330> pretty<00:04:33.570> annoying<00:04:33.810> if<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.080> is

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
that'll be pretty annoying if it is

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.600 
that'll be pretty annoying if it is
though<00:04:34.440> because<00:04:34.620> once<00:04:35.039> again<00:04:35.310> it's<00:04:35.490> just

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
though because once again it's just

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.790 
though because once again it's just
something<00:04:36.090> that<00:04:36.169> isn't<00:04:37.169> really<00:04:37.229> needed<00:04:37.650> a

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
something that isn't really needed a

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.710 
something that isn't really needed a
black<00:04:38.340> ops<00:04:38.550> just<00:04:38.729> fine<00:04:38.910> without<00:04:39.060> death<00:04:39.389> street

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
black ops just fine without death street

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.140 
black ops just fine without death street
something<00:04:40.139> but<00:04:41.009> it<00:04:41.100> seems<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.430> yeah

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
something but it seems that yeah

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.029 
something but it seems that yeah
Infinity<00:04:43.110> Ward<00:04:43.289> really<00:04:43.590> really<00:04:43.770> like<00:04:43.919> the

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
pope called overkill which i believe is

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.960 
pope called overkill which i believe is
from<00:04:57.449> call<00:04:57.660> of<00:04:57.690> duty<00:04:57.930> 4<00:04:57.960> which<00:04:58.949> is<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.580> basically

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
from call of duty 4 which is a basically

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.240 
from call of duty 4 which is a basically
reduction<00:05:00.630> to<00:05:00.840> have<00:05:01.349> two<00:05:01.560> primary<00:05:01.800> weapons

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
reduction to have two primary weapons

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.560 
reduction to have two primary weapons
instead<00:05:02.490> of<00:05:02.610> a<00:05:02.669> primary<00:05:03.030> in<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.150> secondary

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
instead of a primary in the secondary

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.589 
instead of a primary in the secondary
which<00:05:04.530> is<00:05:04.650> cool<00:05:04.830> but<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.970> raises<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.479> question

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
which is cool but it raises the question

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.120 
which is cool but it raises the question
while<00:05:07.139> it<00:05:07.259> raises<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:07.530> question<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.949> me<00:05:08.099> is

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
while it raises the question to me is

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.450 
while it raises the question to me is
have<00:05:09.060> they<00:05:09.210> nerfed<00:05:09.479> the<00:05:09.630> secretary<00:05:09.990> weapons
