tablespoons now I don't have anything to

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.390 
tablespoons now I don't have anything to
measure<00:01:53.270> out<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:55.000> tablespoon<00:01:56.000> with<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:58.280> we're

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
measure out a tablespoon with so we're

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.790 
measure out a tablespoon with so we're
going<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:58.550> do<00:01:58.670> this<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.060> classic<00:01:59.800> Soviet

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
going to do this the classic Soviet

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.920 
going to do this the classic Soviet
Russia<00:02:01.180> way<00:02:02.180> they're<00:02:03.110> going<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.350> take<00:02:03.560> a

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:23.930 
Russia way they're going to take a
tablespoon<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:10.429> guess<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:11.150> would<00:02:11.240> be<00:02:11.300> one

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:35.120 

bath<00:02:24.600> bucket<00:02:25.080> -

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:47.560 

now<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.160> got<00:02:36.340> two<00:02:36.520> dirty<00:02:36.730> spoons

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.760 

so<00:02:49.280> now<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.340> looks<00:02:50.400> like<00:02:50.640> somebody<00:02:51.530> puked<00:02:52.530> on

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
so now it looks like somebody puked on

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.460 
so now it looks like somebody puked on
some<00:02:53.010> cottage<00:02:53.460> cheese<00:02:53.490> in<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.090> banana<00:02:54.480> but

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
some cottage cheese in the banana but

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.380 
some cottage cheese in the banana but
anyway<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:56.310> don't<00:02:56.700> particularly<00:02:57.030> like<00:02:57.240> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
anyway I don't particularly like the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.710 
anyway I don't particularly like the
flavor<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.410> cottage<00:02:58.830> cheese<00:02:58.860> too<00:02:59.820> much<00:03:00.030> it's

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
flavor of cottage cheese too much it's

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.120 
flavor of cottage cheese too much it's
just<00:03:01.970> one<00:03:02.970> less<00:03:03.120> things<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.620> saw<00:03:05.550> this

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:22.250 
Smuckers low sugar strawberry preserve
it's<00:03:15.500> got<00:03:16.500> 25<00:03:17.250> calories<00:03:18.020> per<00:03:19.020> tablespoon<00:03:21.260> yeah

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
it's got 25 calories per tablespoon yeah

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.750
