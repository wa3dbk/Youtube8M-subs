00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.450 

all<00:07:30.390> the<00:07:30.660> wonders<00:07:30.990> are<00:07:31.200> doing<00:07:31.560> a<00:07:31.650> case<00:07:31.860> of<00:07:32.100> oh

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 
all the wonders are doing a case of oh

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:38.719 
all the wonders are doing a case of oh
 I'm<00:07:33.660> in<00:07:33.810> the<00:07:33.870> wrong<00:07:34.020> lane

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:38.729 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:42.189 

I<00:07:38.759> would<00:07:39.330> tend<00:07:39.539> onto<00:07:39.930> it<00:07:40.020> towards

00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:42.199 
I would tend onto it towards

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:43.879 
I would tend onto it towards
the

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:43.889 
the

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:47.670 
the
former<00:07:46.139> varmint<00:07:47.139> Roger

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 
former varmint Roger

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.180 
former varmint Roger
yeah<00:07:47.889> the<00:07:48.010> former<00:07:48.370> I<00:07:49.590> would<00:07:50.590> tend<00:07:50.770> towards<00:07:51.100> the

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:51.190 
yeah the former I would tend towards the

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.379 
yeah the former I would tend towards the
former<00:07:51.639> being<00:07:51.850> the<00:07:51.910> one<00:07:52.120> there's<00:07:52.300> more

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:52.389 
former being the one there's more

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:54.360 
former being the one there's more
dangerous

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.370 
dangerous

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.070 
dangerous
because<00:07:54.970> they're<00:07:55.090> already<00:07:55.240> showing<00:07:55.750> that

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 
because they're already showing that

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.220 
because they're already showing that
their<00:07:56.320> priority<00:07:56.620> is<00:07:57.040> themselves<00:07:57.910> on<00:07:58.120> the<00:07:58.240> road

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:00.230 
their priority is themselves on the road

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:04.040 
their priority is themselves on the road
whereas<00:08:01.230> the<00:08:01.650> unobservant<00:08:02.310> ones<00:08:02.870> just<00:08:03.870> are

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.050 
whereas the unobservant ones just are

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.360 
whereas the unobservant ones just are
careless

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:08.370 

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.490 

and<00:08:08.790> I<00:08:08.940> just<00:08:09.180> hope<00:08:09.330> that<00:08:09.570> one<00:08:09.720> day<00:08:09.750> I<00:08:09.900> am<00:08:10.110> NOT<00:08:10.470> a

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.500 
and I just hope that one day I am NOT a

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.510 
and I just hope that one day I am NOT a
statistic<00:08:11.280> caused<00:08:11.669> by<00:08:12.000> one<00:08:12.180> of<00:08:12.330> them
