00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.420
 hello guys, good afternoon, we are 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.400
 students of the technological institute 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.980
 vicente rocafuerte third semester 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.800
 assembly we have as a project 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.630
 present police car lights 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.980
 then I will present to you what 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.430
 are the components that we will use in 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.260
 these projects we will have a circuit 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.260
 integrated 40 17 d 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.740
 we have many very integrated 555 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.910
 timers 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.910
 we have a transistor 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.260
 what they are we have what are the gods 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.800
 world of red sunken blue color 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.730
 and sank white that will be 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.990
 used in the circuit that we will present 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.600
 we have not got the ceramic capacitor 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.240
 we also have what they are harassed 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.850
 rectifiers a capacitor 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.460
 electrolytic resistance of 22 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.619
 k and a kart 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.619
 we also have a battery of 9 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.299
 volts like a hood that 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.369
 we will need to do everything that 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.960
 we have to do in the circuit 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.570
 then my classmates 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.050
 will explain what will be done in our 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.050
 draft 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.280
 next we are going to talk about the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.039
 integrated five foundations its functions 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.740
 of timing or also how it works 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:49.329
 style of a clock what they have I'm going to 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.789
 talk about the pins of 555 are 8 in 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.590
 total we have the first end that goes 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.200
 negative what would be our land 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.209
 we have cents number 2 which is the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.880
 white cable that goes to the 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:03.969
 pin number 6 connected in series with 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.439
 the resistance of 22 degrees so 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.890
 then fine the capacitor 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.230
 electrolytic of 2.2 micro stopped good 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.420
 in this case we have item 3 that 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.760
 come straight to our new circuit 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.330
 which will be explained below that no 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.820
 I know first 4 that is connected to positive 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.160
 we have pin number 5 that goes with a 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.280
 connected ceramic capacitor 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.530
 directly to negative we have the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.600
 first number 7 has connect a 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.790
 director resistance 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.840
 and pin number 8 that is connected 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.670
 positive 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.960
 next partners I will explain 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.960
 about the integrated we have 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.109
 would return on 5 55 which is page 13 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:54.459
 let's go directly to follow integrated 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:56.170
 the wands number 14 has entries or 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.269
 reflexes 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.519
 we enter directly to the number 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.299
 16 decide aware with all time of 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:07.840
 37 characters and it's the little leg that's going 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.519
 directly to the positive we carry a 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.359
 last name number 15 directly to 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.180
 negative 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.840
 and simultaneously in host to the page 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.840
 number 14 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.880
 this week they go directly to the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.050
 diodes 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.200
 to intercalate the colors of the 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:33.989
 black blue blue red red 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:38.040
 we have the cables milestones number 1 11 and 6 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.050
 go directly to the legaz rubs and the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.350
 number 3 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:47.530
 4 and 10 to the red ones 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.850
 the rectifiers rectify the signal 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.380
 this rectifiers have caught me with 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.770
 a resistance of 470 obvious we have 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.770
 as well 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.760
 transistor 39 04 that purifies and at the same time 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:10.120
 amplifies the signals 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:12.989
 the exits to the base 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.989
 the gastor 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.940
 the collector negative value and the emitter 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:23.530
 has hosted a resistance of 47 years 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.720
 and this in turn to the leds that are going 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.270
 simultaneously from positive to negative 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.979
 a positive that negative to positive and 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.910
 negative to positive 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:37.070
 likewise we give him here those 10 904 leads 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.030
 or caught to the base 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.790
 to the base and the device and the connector 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.569
 it goes directly to the negative and the 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:51.429
 emitter that goes directly caught 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:53.469
 with an intention 470 2 ivÃ¡n the being and the 

00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:57.039
 colon leads from negative to positive 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:05:00.669
 the negative to positive and this unleashes a 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:04.630
 diode led an intense white code with 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:07.530
 urgency of 330 while its time 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.530
 the negative 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.150
 we already have our project armed in 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.900
 which we will not proceed to put a 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.900
 9 volt battery 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:36.660
 then as they should 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.900
 there they make the condition in a car of 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.290
 policeman with blue red lights none 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.290
 white 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:49.560
 it's working we want you to help us 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.039
 with a line and a comment 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.039
 Thank you
