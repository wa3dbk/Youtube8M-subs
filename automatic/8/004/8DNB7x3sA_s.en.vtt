00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
reps this week with no spots so it's

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.660

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
the same as the last week and hopefully

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.770 
the same as the last week and hopefully
it<00:03:33.460> feels<00:03:33.640> like<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.300> week<00:03:34.480> as<00:03:34.630> well

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
weeks but I finally improved on that as

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.210

well

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
well

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.190

I<00:03:42.250> ended<00:03:42.730> up<00:03:42.850> switching<00:03:43.180> my<00:03:43.480> stance<00:03:43.870> from

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
I ended up switching my stance from

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.280 
I ended up switching my stance from
conventional<00:03:44.740> to<00:03:44.830> sumo<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.959> from<00:03:46.959> just<00:03:47.170> that

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
conventional to sumo and from just that

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.310 
conventional to sumo and from just that
one<00:03:47.350> sumo<00:03:48.190> workout<00:03:48.670> before<00:03:49.240> I<00:03:49.390> pulled<00:03:49.660> for<00:03:49.900> 15

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
one sumo workout before I pulled for 15

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.910 
one sumo workout before I pulled for 15
for<00:03:50.560> 4<00:03:50.800> it<00:03:51.640> helped<00:03:52.090> me<00:03:52.270> improve<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:53.680> this

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
for 4 it helped me improve to this

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.550 
for 4 it helped me improve to this
week's<00:03:54.190> for<00:03:54.520> 15<00:03:55.090> for<00:03:55.540> 5<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:56.140> I'm<00:03:56.230> gonna<00:03:56.350> be<00:03:56.410> up

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560

in<00:03:56.740> the<00:03:57.370> weight<00:03:57.610> on<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:57.880> as<00:03:58.240> well<00:03:58.540> next<00:03:58.990> week

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
in the weight on that as well next week

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.300 
in the weight on that as well next week
I<00:03:59.350> try<00:03:59.620> for<00:03:59.920> 20<00:04:00.250> for<00:04:00.400> 5<00:04:00.640> which<00:04:01.450> is<00:04:01.480> almost<00:04:02.310> the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
I try for 20 for 5 which is almost the

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.140 
I try for 20 for 5 which is almost the
best<00:04:03.520> I've<00:04:03.670> ever<00:04:03.700> pulled<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:05.310> for<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.340> 5<00:04:06.580> rep

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
best I've ever pulled the for a 5 rep

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.199 
best I've ever pulled the for a 5 rep
set<00:04:07.540> period<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:09.220> think<00:04:09.640> my<00:04:09.700> best<00:04:09.850> is<00:04:10.000> like<00:04:10.120> I

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
set period and I think my best is like I

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.449 
set period and I think my best is like I
said<00:04:10.269> for<00:04:10.600> 25<00:04:11.110> or<00:04:11.440> 30<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.800> show<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.070> mic<00:04:12.280> right

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
said for 25 or 30 I show a mic right

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.780 
said for 25 or 30 I show a mic right
there<00:04:12.660> hopefully<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:14.080> continue<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:15.670> make

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
there hopefully and continue to make

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.820 
there hopefully and continue to make
gains<00:04:16.060> on<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.419> sumo<00:04:16.870> like<00:04:17.200> that<00:04:17.380> as<00:04:17.560> well

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
gains on the sumo like that as well

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.610 
gains on the sumo like that as well
because<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.760> think<00:04:19.120> in<00:04:19.540> the<00:04:19.570> long<00:04:19.870> run<00:04:20.230> I<00:04:20.260> can<00:04:20.530> be

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
because I think in the long run I can be

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.770 
because I think in the long run I can be
a<00:04:20.650> much<00:04:20.950> better<00:04:21.220> at<00:04:21.370> pulling<00:04:21.580> sumo<00:04:22.120> at<00:04:22.419> least

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
a much better at pulling sumo at least

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.930 
a much better at pulling sumo at least
25<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.860> 30<00:04:24.040> pounds<00:04:24.430> better<00:04:24.580> than<00:04:24.820> my

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
25 to 30 pounds better than my

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.180 
25 to 30 pounds better than my
conventional<00:04:25.510> so<00:04:26.320> hopefully<00:04:26.740> that<00:04:26.860> put<00:04:27.070> me

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
conventional so hopefully that put me

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.900 
conventional so hopefully that put me
like<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.490> five<00:04:27.960> low<00:04:28.960> five<00:04:28.990> hundreds<00:04:29.910> hopefully

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
like a five low five hundreds hopefully

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.060 
like a five low five hundreds hopefully
maybe<00:04:31.090> even<00:04:31.360> mid<00:04:31.660> five<00:04:31.870> hundreds<00:04:32.380> deadlift

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
maybe even mid five hundreds deadlift

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.790 
maybe even mid five hundreds deadlift
