00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
this is a bit more of a condensed map so

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.130 
this is a bit more of a condensed map so
should<00:02:58.390> be<00:02:58.480> much<00:02:58.660> easier<00:02:58.690> to<00:03:00.720> get<00:03:01.720> into<00:03:01.870> some

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
should be much easier to get into some

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.860 
should be much easier to get into some
