advised me to not put up any walls so
then<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.780> village<00:02:20.080> can<00:02:20.319> expand<00:02:20.709> further<00:02:20.980> how

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
then the village can expand further how

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.320 
then the village can expand further how
