we're at the 2014 winter press camp in
Palos<00:00:19.920> Verdes<00:00:20.250> California<00:00:20.660> I<00:00:21.660> wanted<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.080> go

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
Palos Verdes California I wanted to go

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.710 
Palos Verdes California I wanted to go
over<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.470> couple<00:00:23.070> things<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.550> our<00:00:23.580> new<00:00:24.300> Metron

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
over a couple things on our new Metron

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.939 
over a couple things on our new Metron
wheel<00:00:24.960> line<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.560> think<00:00:25.740> you'd<00:00:25.859> be

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
wheel line that I think you'd be

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.939 
wheel line that I think you'd be
interested<00:00:26.130> down<00:00:26.580> at<00:00:26.789> across<00:00:27.210> Maine<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:28.230> we've

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
interested down at across Maine so we've

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.030 
interested down at across Maine so we've
got<00:00:29.160> our<00:00:29.369> are<00:00:30.029> highly<00:00:30.570> Aero<00:00:30.869> Metron<00:00:31.679> wheels

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
got our are highly Aero Metron wheels

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.740 
got our are highly Aero Metron wheels
here<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.399> two<00:00:32.550> different<00:00:32.669> profiles<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.390> 40

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
here in two different profiles the 40

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.620 
here in two different profiles the 40
and<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> 55<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.520> wanted<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.940> go<00:00:36.600> over

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and the 55 and I just wanted to go over

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.330 
and the 55 and I just wanted to go over
the<00:00:36.899> complete<00:00:37.200> wheel<00:00:37.500> system<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.190> know<00:00:38.309> a

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the complete wheel system so you know a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.520 
the complete wheel system so you know a
little<00:00:38.550> bit<00:00:38.640> more<00:00:38.790> about<00:00:39.120> these<00:00:39.329> things<00:00:39.629> it's

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
little bit more about these things it's

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.970 
little bit more about these things it's
got<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> 25<00:00:41.219> millimeter<00:00:41.790> wide<00:00:41.879> rim<00:00:42.980> highly

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
got a 25 millimeter wide rim highly

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.299 
got a 25 millimeter wide rim highly
aerodynamic<00:00:44.930> it's<00:00:45.930> got<00:00:46.110> two-to-one<00:00:46.710> lacing

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
aerodynamic it's got two-to-one lacing

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.940 
aerodynamic it's got two-to-one lacing
which<00:00:48.090> increases<00:00:48.840> lateral<00:00:49.320> stiffness<00:00:49.530> as

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
which increases lateral stiffness as

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.400 
which increases lateral stiffness as
well<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:50.280> torsional<00:00:50.760> stiffness<00:00:51.199> it's<00:00:52.199> got<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
well as torsional stiffness it's got a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.860 
well as torsional stiffness it's got a
PR<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> hub<00:00:53.579> system<00:00:53.940> which<00:00:54.750> actually<00:00:55.730> allows

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
PR a hub system which actually allows

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.500 
PR a hub system which actually allows
allows<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> over<00:00:58.890> tighten<00:00:59.510> your

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
allows you not to over tighten your

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.990 
allows you not to over tighten your
bearings<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:02.010> know<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.520> that's<00:01:02.789> gonna

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
bearings so you know we that's gonna

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.899 
bearings so you know we that's gonna
spin<00:01:03.239> at<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> free<00:01:03.690> speed<00:01:04.309> it's<00:01:05.309> also<00:01:05.580> got

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
spin at a free speed it's also got

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.840 
spin at a free speed it's also got
ceramic<00:01:06.540> bearings<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.439> got<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.850> DP

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
ceramic bearings in it it's got a DP

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.719 
ceramic bearings in it it's got a DP
bladed<00:01:09.299> spokes<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.400> yeah<00:01:11.400> we're<00:01:11.580> really

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
it's also in disc brake for a rim brake

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.920 
it's also in disc brake for a rim brake
yep<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.500> 40<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.009> available<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.119> disc<00:01:48.540> brake<00:01:48.750> or

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
yep the 40 is available in disc brake or

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.020 
yep the 40 is available in disc brake or
rim<00:01:49.079> brake<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> exact<00:01:50.610> same<00:01:50.790> room

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
rim brake so this is the exact same room

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.260 
rim brake so this is the exact same room
so<00:01:51.360> yeah<00:01:51.930> exactly<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.829> same<00:01:53.009> rim<00:01:53.280> different

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
so yeah exactly the same rim different

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.420 
so yeah exactly the same rim different
hub<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.259> still<00:01:55.530> got<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.219> all
