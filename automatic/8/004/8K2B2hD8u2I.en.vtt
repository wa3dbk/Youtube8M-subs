00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
the float bowls book that I'll sort that

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.440 
the float bowls book that I'll sort that
out<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.309> the<00:00:32.309> engine<00:00:32.700> has<00:00:32.910> been<00:00:33.090> impact

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
out and the engine has been impact

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.900 
out and the engine has been impact
pieces<00:00:33.960> for<00:00:34.140> 30<00:00:34.380> years<00:00:34.800> but<00:00:35.370> don't<00:00:35.730> look

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
pieces for 30 years but don't look

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
pieces for 30 years but don't look
things<00:00:36.210> like<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.540> put<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.899> off<00:00:37.079> that'll<00:00:37.920> all

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
things like this put you off that'll all

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.540 
things like this put you off that'll all
clean<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.520> laughs<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.000> new<00:00:39.149> valves<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
clean up laughs to have new valves and

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.650 
clean up laughs to have new valves and
obviously<00:00:41.550> you'll<00:00:41.940> need<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.390> thoroughly

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
obviously you'll need for thoroughly

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.770 
obviously you'll need for thoroughly
blasting<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.410> has<00:00:43.590> been<00:00:43.829> ported<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.570> gather

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
blasting it has been ported and I gather

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.420 
blasting it has been ported and I gather
it's<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.020> big<00:00:46.200> valve<00:00:46.440> head<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.860> well

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
it's a big valve head as well

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.450 
it's a big valve head as well
that's<00:00:48.149> all<00:00:48.329> doable<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.899> set<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.739> crank<00:00:49.980> cases

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
that's all doable a set of crank cases

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.369 
that's all doable a set of crank cases
these<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.090> actually<00:00:51.449> their<00:00:51.629> thousand<00:00:52.199> mom's

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
these is actually their thousand mom's

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.950 
these is actually their thousand mom's
because<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.340> original<00:00:53.730> motor<00:00:53.910> through<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> con

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
because the original motor through a con

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.319 
because the original motor through a con
rod<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.520> got<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> original<00:00:56.940> crank

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
rod and I have got the original crank

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.560 
rod and I have got the original crank
cases<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:59.309> are<00:00:59.430> repairable<00:01:00.000> so

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
cases for it and they are repairable so

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.510 
cases for it and they are repairable so
but<00:01:01.230> again<00:01:01.320> like<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.649> said<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.219> if<00:01:02.460> you

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
but again like I said if you can if you

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.380 
but again like I said if you can if you
can<00:01:02.699> find<00:01:02.969> things

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
can find things

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.299 
can find things
everything's<00:01:03.899> doable<00:01:04.500> don't<00:01:05.040> worry<00:01:05.189> about

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
everything's doable don't worry about

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.370 
everything's doable don't worry about
how<00:01:05.549> bad<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.790> initially<00:01:06.689> looks<00:01:06.900> although<00:01:07.260> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
how bad it initially looks although it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.060 
how bad it initially looks although it
can<00:01:07.530> become<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.860> bit<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.130> mission

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
can become a bit of a mission

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:17.359 
can become a bit of a mission
gearbox<00:01:13.340> cams<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:15.030> covers<00:01:16.250> pretty<00:01:17.250> much

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
gearbox cams and covers pretty much

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.580 
gearbox cams and covers pretty much
everything<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.869> bonus<00:01:19.229> thing<00:01:19.409> was

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
everything and the bonus thing was

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.210 
everything and the bonus thing was
although<00:01:20.040> he<00:01:20.250> was<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.430> petrol<00:01:21.060> tank<00:01:21.470> here<00:01:22.470> is

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
although he was this petrol tank here is

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.600 
although he was this petrol tank here is
in<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> box<00:01:23.790> underneath<00:01:24.920> is<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.979> really<00:01:26.430> good

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
in the box underneath is a really good

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.550 
in the box underneath is a really good
original<00:01:27.390> green<00:01:27.659> tank<00:01:27.960> with<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.380> very

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
original green tank with just a very

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.410 
original green tank with just a very
small<00:01:28.890> dent<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> top<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.090> think<00:01:30.299> I'll

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
small dent in the top and I think I'll

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.560 
small dent in the top and I think I'll
probably<00:01:30.540> using<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.970> chassis<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.540> a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
probably using that one the chassis is a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.990 
probably using that one the chassis is a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
weight Christoph's he's using it to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.179 
weight Christoph's he's using it to
match<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.810> rear<00:01:37.049> foot<00:01:37.200> rest<00:01:37.439> mounts<00:01:37.770> for

match up the rear foot rest mounts for

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.219 
match up the rear foot rest mounts for
the<00:01:38.460> project<00:01:38.850> bike<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.110> the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.360

for<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.500> parts<00:02:32.800> it's<00:02:32.950> because<00:02:33.220> it's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
for the parts it's because it's

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.500 
for the parts it's because it's
non-standard<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.030> thought<00:02:34.209> I'd<00:02:34.269> go<00:02:34.360> with

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
non-standard I thought I'd go with

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.180 
non-standard I thought I'd go with
something<00:02:34.540> quite<00:02:35.019> different<00:02:35.230> see<00:02:35.980> how<00:02:36.069> it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
something quite different see how it

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.570 
something quite different see how it
looks

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580

I'm<00:02:36.730> not<00:02:36.910> sure<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.150> made<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.540> right<00:02:37.660> decision

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
I'm not sure I made the right decision

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.390 
I'm not sure I made the right decision
but<00:02:38.459> no<00:02:39.459> looks<00:02:39.940> okay<00:02:40.650> I'm<00:02:41.650> happy<00:02:41.890> certainly

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.350 

for<00:03:03.370> they'd<00:03:03.459> all<00:03:03.549> be<00:03:03.640> other<00:03:03.790> pieces<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.269> that

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
for they'd all be other pieces and that

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.940

is<00:03:04.420> actually<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:05.260> me<00:03:05.350> obviously<00:03:05.650> such<00:03:05.830> the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
is actually to me obviously such the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.400 
is actually to me obviously such the
cheaper<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.549> buy<00:03:06.700> new<00:03:06.970> parts<00:03:07.209> than<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.019> is<00:03:08.140> to

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
cheaper to buy new parts than it is to

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.849 
cheaper to buy new parts than it is to
get<00:03:08.739> them<00:03:08.920> plated<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.380> that's<00:03:11.590> what<00:03:11.769> I've

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
get them plated and so that's what I've

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.020 
get them plated and so that's what I've
done<00:03:12.269> got<00:03:13.269> me<00:03:13.329> barrels<00:03:13.720> back<00:03:13.900> from<00:03:14.170> Bill<00:03:14.560> hyams
