so in today's video I'm going to be

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.310 
so in today's video I'm going to be
comparing<00:00:29.910> two<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> high<00:00:30.720> fire<00:00:31.080> rate

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
comparing two of the high fire rate

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.440 
comparing two of the high fire rate
submachine<00:00:31.890> guns<00:00:32.099> these<00:00:32.669> are<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> scorpion

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
submachine guns these are the scorpion

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.479 
submachine guns these are the scorpion
evo<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.050> vector<00:00:34.350> k10<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.980> think<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.399> is

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
evo and the vector k10 I think this is

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.470 
evo and the vector k10 I think this is
gonna<00:00:35.640> turn<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.180> an<00:00:36.329> interesting

kill while the Scorpion is a 6 and then
finally<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> move<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.360> little<00:02:12.540> bit<00:02:12.690> back<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.080> the

weapons now once again I shot thirty-two

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.530 
weapons now once again I shot thirty-two
bullets<00:02:26.280> from<00:02:26.370> each<00:02:26.580> weapon<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.150> as<00:02:27.269> you<00:02:27.420> can

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
bullets from each weapon and as you can

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.839 
bullets from each weapon and as you can
see<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.870> Scorpion<00:02:28.440> Evo<00:02:28.769> kicks<00:02:29.069> like<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.280> mule

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
see the Scorpion Evo kicks like a mule

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.910 
see the Scorpion Evo kicks like a mule

and<00:02:37.440> as<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.799> see<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.129> Scorpion<00:02:38.549> does

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
and as you can see the Scorpion does

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.670 
and as you can see the Scorpion does
kick<00:02:39.030> straight<00:02:39.329> up<00:02:39.569> while<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.110> vector<00:02:40.470> has<00:02:40.620> a

increases your hipfire accuracy and the
suppressor<00:03:00.629> will<00:03:00.659> keep<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:00.959> off<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.200> map<00:03:01.440> in

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
suppressor will keep you off the map in

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.380 
suppressor will keep you off the map in
the<00:03:01.709> enemy<00:03:01.980> spawn<00:03:02.250> now<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.730> just<00:03:02.849> did<00:03:03.359> a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
the enemy spawn now I just did a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.390 
the enemy spawn now I just did a
comparison<00:03:03.930> on<00:03:04.049> fast<00:03:04.349> mag<00:03:04.590> versus<00:03:04.980> extended

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
comparison on fast mag versus extended

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.099 
comparison on fast mag versus extended
mag<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.790> said<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.060> fast<00:03:06.269> mag<00:03:06.510> was<00:03:06.690> overall

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
mag and I said that fast mag was overall

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.050 
mag and I said that fast mag was overall
better<00:03:07.349> but<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.920> think<00:03:08.159> with<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.370> Scorpion<00:03:08.819> Evo

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
better but I think with the Scorpion Evo

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.880 
better but I think with the Scorpion Evo
the<00:03:09.209> extended<00:03:09.690> clip<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:10.049> probably<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.560> better

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
the extended clip is probably a better

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.530 
the extended clip is probably a better
option<00:03:11.430> because<00:03:11.459> it's<00:03:11.790> reload<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.239> already

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
option because it's reload is already

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.030 
option because it's reload is already
very<00:03:12.780> fast<00:03:13.109> and<00:03:13.379> you<00:03:13.409> run<00:03:13.590> out<00:03:13.709> of<00:03:13.739> ammo

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
very fast and you run out of ammo

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.800 
very fast and you run out of ammo
quickly<00:03:14.430> with<00:03:14.579> a<00:03:14.609> 1,200<00:03:15.359> rounds<00:03:15.480> per<00:03:15.750> minute

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.080 
quickly with a 1,200 rounds per minute

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
fire rate on the other hand 36 rounds

fire rate on the other hand 36 rounds

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680

fire<00:03:19.980> rate<00:03:20.250> lasts<00:03:20.489> fairly<00:03:20.880> long<00:03:21.060> with<00:03:21.239> the

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
fire rate lasts fairly long with the

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.729 
fire rate lasts fairly long with the
vector<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.870> fast<00:03:22.109> mag<00:03:22.319> is<00:03:22.470> probably

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
vector and the fast mag is probably

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.319 
vector and the fast mag is probably
better<00:03:22.950> for<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.370> now<00:03:23.819> you<00:03:23.880> can<00:03:24.090> definitely

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
better for it now you can definitely

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.300 
better for it now you can definitely
change<00:03:24.870> these<00:03:25.109> classes<00:03:25.530> up<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.739> lot<00:03:25.919> but<00:03:26.160> this

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
change these classes up a lot but this

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.770 
change these classes up a lot but this
is<00:03:26.430> what<00:03:26.579> I<00:03:26.609> like<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:27.000> use<00:03:27.030> in<00:03:27.239> multiplayer<00:03:27.569> and

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
is what I like to use in multiplayer and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.210 
is what I like to use in multiplayer and
then<00:03:28.079> I<00:03:28.109> just<00:03:28.349> try<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.560> find<00:03:28.859> a<00:03:28.980> reliable

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
then I just try to find a reliable

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.830 
then I just try to find a reliable
weapon<00:03:29.730> that<00:03:29.849> I<00:03:29.879> can<00:03:30.060> pick<00:03:30.209> up<00:03:30.329> off<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.660> ground

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
weapon that I can pick up off the ground

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.900 
weapon that I can pick up off the ground
so<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.109> I<00:03:31.200> have<00:03:31.349> a<00:03:31.379> nice<00:03:31.590> secondary<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:32.760> that

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
so that I have a nice secondary so that

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.640 
so that I have a nice secondary so that
pretty<00:03:33.090> much<00:03:33.180> wraps<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.690> up<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.019> overall<00:03:34.440> I

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
pretty much wraps it up and overall I

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.470 
pretty much wraps it up and overall I
would<00:03:34.799> say<00:03:34.919> that<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.250> Scorpion<00:03:35.819> Evo<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.299> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
would say that the Scorpion Evo is the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.659 
would say that the Scorpion Evo is the
best<00:03:36.810> close-range<00:03:37.470> submachine<00:03:38.040> gun<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.370> this

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
best close-range submachine gun in this

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.640 
best close-range submachine gun in this
game<00:03:38.940> it's<00:03:39.419> a<00:03:39.540> straight-up<00:03:39.780> ridiculously

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
game it's a straight-up ridiculously

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.470 
game it's a straight-up ridiculously
fast<00:03:40.950> kill<00:03:41.280> from<00:03:41.489> point-blank<00:03:41.849> but<00:03:42.180> as<00:03:42.299> you

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
fast kill from point-blank but as you

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.789 
fast kill from point-blank but as you
move<00:03:42.629> back<00:03:42.660> this<00:03:43.139> gun<00:03:43.319> becomes<00:03:43.650> almost

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
move back this gun becomes almost

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.099 
move back this gun becomes almost
useless<00:03:44.370> now<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.060> vector<00:03:45.389> on<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.780> other<00:03:45.900> hand

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
useless now the vector on the other hand

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.930 
useless now the vector on the other hand
takes<00:03:46.410> quite<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.739> few<00:03:46.919> bullets<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.459> kill<00:03:47.489> but

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
takes quite a few bullets to kill but

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.670 
takes quite a few bullets to kill but
it's<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.180> only<00:03:48.449> submachine<00:03:49.230> gun<00:03:49.379> and<00:03:49.410> black

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
it's the only submachine gun and black

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
how to play with this weapon then you

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.490 
how to play with this weapon then you

rate high accuracy isn't something that

you<00:04:02.489> get<00:04:02.639> to<00:04:02.760> use<00:04:02.879> a<00:04:02.940> lot<00:04:03.269> overall<00:04:04.139> the

you get to use a lot overall the

k10<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.609> a<00:04:08.790> great<00:04:09.120> rushing<00:04:09.480> weapon<00:04:09.780> but<00:04:10.079> I'd

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
k10 is a great rushing weapon but I'd

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.659 
k10 is a great rushing weapon but I'd
recommend<00:04:10.290> slowing<00:04:10.889> down<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.129> pace<00:04:11.310> just<00:04:11.340> a

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
recommend slowing down the pace just a

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.550 
recommend slowing down the pace just a
little<00:04:11.940> bit<00:04:12.060> from<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.359> Scorpion<00:04:12.780> Evo<00:04:13.049> that

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
little bit from the Scorpion Evo that

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.140 
little bit from the Scorpion Evo that
pretty<00:04:13.769> much<00:04:13.919> wraps<00:04:14.129> up<00:04:14.310> this<00:04:14.519> black<00:04:14.760> ops<00:04:14.970> 2

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
pretty much wraps up this black ops 2

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.909 
pretty much wraps up this black ops 2
