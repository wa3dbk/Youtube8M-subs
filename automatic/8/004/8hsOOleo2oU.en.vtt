00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
 as a machine manufacturer that you think 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.990
 what is important to be good coffee 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.000
 well I think this topic can give 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.950
 much of itself a just a single parameter 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.900
 a single variable does not exist therefore 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.269
 think I would say that there are many that are the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.460
 michelle at hand the mill the machine 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.830
 of coffee thermal stability 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.020
 temperature freshness of product and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.580
 grinding very important grinding for 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.680
 get the cup we want 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.330
 has manufactured moment especially inside 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.160
 of what would be the coffee mill one 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.260
 Once you have found the point of grinding 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.020
 more suitable for your type of coffee for 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.030
 your coffee maker the weight that always has 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.730
 to be precise and especially the maneuver 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.710
 of the pressing is very important either 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.530
 using some kind of press 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.420
 traditional how can this be 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.730
 using a manual or new tupper 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.829
 methods such as pressing the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.690
 face metric dynamo at the end of the day 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.910
 ways to ensure you always use 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.550
 the same pressure has a good express 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.129
 has to be balanced has to 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.660
 have its sweetness its acidity point its 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.699
 body has to be nice a coffee 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.500
 that you want to take freshly awake 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.600
 dalaman in the morning after a 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.340
 food 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.259
 the thermal of the machine which 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.570
 means to give a good cup 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.670
 you have to have a machine that gives you 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.729
 a thermal stability that when you do 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.860
 many coffees followed keep the same 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.720
 quality and when you are long without 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.880
 do those that continue to maintain the same 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.950
 most important quality in a cafe in the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.460
 which the 4 m rule would be one more 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.049
 that is the show the coffee the espresso 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.960
 is a unique product in the world that by 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.549
 less than one euro for one euro they make you a 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.460
 product made especially for you 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.909
 in Naples and you see a gentleman who separates 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.060
 world 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.869
 he looks you in the eye and says he's going to 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.429
 start and you start the show you 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.460
 serve the tray with a glass of water 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:53.940
 to an expresso coffee 45 mm 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.090
 dense cream uniform compact 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.100
 like it was chocolate and I went to it 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.310
 drink and little less than I take it out the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.950
 cup of the hand and then ragazzi must 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.100
 ignite you cousin lakua percutir in the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.730
 mouth of pop catches coffee advice 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.690
 I would give a barista is that he should be trained 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.850
 permanently in all aspects 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.910
 that surround the cup tell you know the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.700
 machines know the mills know the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.740
 miguelas and know the peculiarities 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.260
 of a cup and be clean about everything and 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.030
 more main is maintenance of the 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.500
 cleaning machinery and 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.940
 maintenance the machine is essential 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.370
 to always get a good product 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.080
 you have to get involved a lot in what 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.270
 it's a cup of coffee from the beginning 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.610
 until the end always be open to 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.560
 learn more because always every day 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.260
 we learn things and never close 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.550
 close in a good I already know already 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.500
 it's fine to ask doubts 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.200
 example makes a good extraction of 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.590
 espresso prepares a good milk that the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.810
 milk be good too 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.580
 and a lot of practice to be able to do 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.160
 figures we have to have a power 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.019
 needed in the steam to be able 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.660
 increase milk by volume create the 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.550
 bubbles that we will then break to give 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.590
 the texture needed to make a good 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.440
 drawing communication with the customer of the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.860
 try to transmit the culture of 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.209
 The customer's coffee culture is basic and 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.129
 the most important thing a little that between 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.890
 all when we see an express 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.110
 was the fact that we know how to be critical 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.360
 with that and also the barista that is 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.220
 self-critical when you do it wrong you know 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.560
 remove it again do not do it 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.260
 try to repeat what good good barista 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.620
