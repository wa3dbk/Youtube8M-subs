00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.730
 I think we already know what is 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.730
 happening and I do not like 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.240
 what makes the places that the 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.180
 caught in this white cap and 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.399
 strange when the annexes accelerate to 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.079
 over time repair the space and 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.079
 they return the color and the life 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.590
 we will run until we can not more or not 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.590
 there will be future 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.829
 the back to life part of this 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.829

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.000
 Exactly I will not get used to this 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.830
 they have been very useful in the past 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.580
 we have a couple of them but we need 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.860
 and to know who you should go and take a 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.720
 look sure you get this time is 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.090

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.380

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.880
 we will need seven 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.520
 you guys have a lot of work to do 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.520
 the adventures I like difficult 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.399
 look is the general 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.730
 i 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.819
 a nice movement 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.210
 I can not believe I had to win 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.060
 I this time 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.330
 what happened I thought I was going to win but if 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.630
 I always win you, of course, I do not know what 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.540
 they miss but if not not removing gray hair 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.580
 I do not even know what they do wrong here but 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.680
 I had not kidnapped him one thing is 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.680

 suffer a humiliating defeat will be better 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.349
 give up now 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.470
 you're not in a position to demand me anything 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.620
 nothing but pricked 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.120
 but no no 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.120
 he had a little help 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.380
 no one ever calls me like that would it be so 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.130

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.590

 ximo doctor the last tablecloth 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.430
 after the last setback I suffered 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.969
 I came across the primordial form of this 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.280
 unique creation and I discovered that I possessed 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:16.700
 incredible powers but I myself have been 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.970
 able to master 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.160
 I could erase space and time and 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.960
 then I came up with the great idea of 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.850
 use such a great discovery to 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.850
 undo my previous defeats 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.830
 but I needed the help of something 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.210

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.560
 ready like me you are very kind to me 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.070

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.840
 friends and throw them in time to 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.630
 that fell from my parents but the more 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.880
 I show you is the day with more damage what 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.270
 is the world 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.170
 the world the world will be mine when there 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.170
 finished with sun 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.110
 to them I will not end up like crazy 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:16.919
 You will drive me crazy when it destroys 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.409
 two lonely forever you mean 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:23.610
 when we destroy them together less 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:26.039
 discuss and more destroy and destroy miami and 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.560
 as you are moving the mustache of the 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:34.189
 I just figured that now 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.189
 we are two winds rotating 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:44.639
 do not stop 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.180
 what you want to turn life 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.830
 as well 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.430
 people 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.660
 That was only an appetizer already 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.230
 The time has come for you to know your 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.230
 destination 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:36.150
 let's raise sonic dale you but it's bread 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:39.810
 eaten you can get it who they are 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:44.210
 these are insignificant the dollar is 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.210
 you go out and concentrate your spirit 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.870
 do not give up sonic I know you can 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:54.400
 do it alone 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.400
 you always want 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:07.330
 You will not be well-deserved at 6 mans with
