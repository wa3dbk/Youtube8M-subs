in<00:00:00.179> this<00:00:00.420> video<00:00:00.750> I'll<00:00:01.140> show<00:00:01.439> the<00:00:01.560> changes

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
in this video I'll show the changes

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.090 
in this video I'll show the changes
forever<00:00:02.159> growth<00:00:02.550> alpha<00:00:03.240> 2:05<00:00:03.870> which<00:00:04.770> you<00:00:04.920> can

forever growth alpha 2:05 which you can
try<00:00:05.279> if<00:00:05.549> you've<00:00:05.759> pre-ordered<00:00:06.359> in<00:00:07.290> this<00:00:07.500> alpha

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
try if you've pre-ordered in this alpha

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.980 
try if you've pre-ordered in this alpha
I<00:00:08.099> finally<00:00:08.670> added<00:00:09.000> an<00:00:09.120> in-game<00:00:09.480> settings

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
I finally added an in-game settings

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.839 
I finally added an in-game settings

Jeff<00:00:11.849> created<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.389> user<00:00:12.660> interface<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.500> I

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
Jeff created this user interface and I

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.790 
Jeff created this user interface and I
integrated<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.880> game<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.590> 2014

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
integrated it with the game in 2014

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.470 
integrated it with the game in 2014
I<00:00:16.830> don't<00:00:17.130> think<00:00:17.190> users<00:00:17.520> should<00:00:17.940> still<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
I don't think users should still have to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.689 
I don't think users should still have to
restart<00:00:18.900> games<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.770> change<00:00:20.010> graphic<00:00:20.490> settings

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
restart games to change graphic settings

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.640 
restart games to change graphic settings
so<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.449> do<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> fair<00:00:21.900> amount<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.170> technical

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
so I to do a fair amount of technical

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.140 
so I to do a fair amount of technical
work<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:23.010> make<00:00:23.160> sure<00:00:23.310> they<00:00:23.490> all<00:00:23.640> update<00:00:24.000> in

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
work to make sure they all update in

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.660 
work to make sure they all update in
real<00:00:24.330> time<00:00:24.920> this<00:00:25.920> makes<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.400> easy<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
real time this makes it easy to

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.700 
real time this makes it easy to

using only one sample point we use the

using only one sample point we use the

address this problem by taking multiple

samples within each edge pixel to

textures<00:00:52.110> are<00:00:52.289> traditionally<00:00:52.770> stored<00:00:53.070> in

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
textures are traditionally stored in

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.310 
textures are traditionally stored in
multiple<00:00:53.370> detail<00:00:54.030> levels<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.050> they<00:00:55.170> can

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
multiple detail levels so that they can

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.049 
multiple detail levels so that they can
be<00:00:55.440> smoothly<00:00:55.710> scaled<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.460> as<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:56.969> get

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
be smoothly scaled down as they get

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.660 
be smoothly scaled down as they get
farther<00:00:57.329> away<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:58.410> works<00:00:58.680> perfectly<00:00:58.949> when

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
farther away this works perfectly when

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.520 
farther away this works perfectly when
looking<00:00:59.940> at<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.149> surface<00:01:00.329> straight<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.930> but

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
looking at a surface straight on but

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.990 
looking at a surface straight on but
fails<00:01:01.829> when<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.190> look<00:01:02.340> at<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.550> from<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> side

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
fails when you look at it from the side

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
fails when you look at it from the side
because<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.019> only<00:01:04.110> reduce<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.739> detail

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
because it can only reduce the detail

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.850 
because it can only reduce the detail
isotropically<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.659> blurring<00:01:07.229> evenly<00:01:07.770> in

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
isotropically that is blurring evenly in

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.700 
isotropically that is blurring evenly in
every<00:01:08.130> direction<00:01:08.810> what<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.260> want<00:01:10.470> is

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
every direction what we really want is

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.740 
every direction what we really want is
to<00:01:10.740> filter<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.310> texture<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.880> iso<00:01:12.270> typically

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
to filter the texture and iso typically

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260 
to filter the texture and iso typically
so<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.380> only<00:01:13.470> blurs<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:14.220> direction<00:01:14.729> which

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
so it only blurs in one direction which

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.300 
so it only blurs in one direction which
we<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.720> by<00:01:15.750> combining<00:01:16.320> multiple<00:01:16.619> samples

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
we can do by combining multiple samples

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.030 
we can do by combining multiple samples
from<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.610> texture<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.750> baked<00:01:21.960> chatez<00:01:22.530> toggle

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
from the texture the baked chatez toggle

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.980 
from the texture the baked chatez toggle
determines<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> shadows<00:01:24.270> are<00:01:24.450> calculated

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
determines if the shadows are calculated

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.800 
determines if the shadows are calculated
ahead<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.380> time<00:01:25.619> or<00:01:25.830> dynamically<00:01:26.810> baked

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
ahead of time or dynamically baked

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.530 
ahead of time or dynamically baked
shadows<00:01:28.380> look<00:01:28.680> smoother<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.310> run<00:01:29.490> faster<00:01:29.970> but

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
shadows look smoother and run faster but

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.080 
shadows look smoother and run faster but
they<00:01:30.630> don't<00:01:30.780> update<00:01:31.140> as<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.439> edit<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.740> level

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
they don't update as you edit the level

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.249 
they don't update as you edit the level
typically<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.270> want<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.689> baked<00:01:33.900> chato's

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
typically you want to have baked chato's

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.260 
typically you want to have baked chato's
turned<00:01:34.560> off<00:01:34.740> while<00:01:35.070> editing<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.549> level<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.180> you

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
turned off while editing a level so you

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.910 
turned off while editing a level so you
can<00:01:36.360> more<00:01:36.479> easily<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:37.140> how<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.350> shadows<00:01:37.710> will

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
can more easily see how the shadows will

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.039 
can more easily see how the shadows will
fall<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.369> then<00:01:38.640> baked<00:01:38.909> new<00:01:39.180> shadows<00:01:39.600> when

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
fall and then baked new shadows when

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.039 
fall and then baked new shadows when
done<00:01:40.259> editing<00:01:41.479> there<00:01:42.479> are<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.630> lot<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> other
