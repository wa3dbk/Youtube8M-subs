00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
is about cockfighting which at the time

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.740 
is about cockfighting which at the time
was<00:01:13.830> written<00:01:14.070> was<00:01:14.250> still<00:01:14.640> only<00:01:15.090> legal<00:01:15.630> in

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
was written was still only legal in

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.340 
was written was still only legal in
three<00:01:16.080> states<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.509> at<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> current<00:01:18.900> time<00:01:18.990> is

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
three states and at the current time is

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.600 
three states and at the current time is
now<00:01:19.560> only<00:01:19.979> legal<00:01:20.820> really<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.450> Louisiana<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
now only legal really in Louisiana I

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.340 
now only legal really in Louisiana I
guess<00:01:23.610> New<00:01:23.850> Mexico<00:01:24.270> allows<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> county

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
guess New Mexico allows it in the county

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.510 
guess New Mexico allows it in the county
by<00:01:25.500> county<00:01:25.530> basis<00:01:27.710> but<00:01:28.710> there's<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.979> similar

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
by county basis but there's a similar

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.670 
by county basis but there's a similar
theme<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.689> here<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:32.540> all<00:01:33.540> three<00:01:34.140> stories

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
theme I see here in all three stories

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.730 
theme I see here in all three stories
and<00:01:35.750> that<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.110> issue<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.740> states<00:01:38.610> rights

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
and that is the issue of states rights

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.160 
and that is the issue of states rights
versus<00:01:40.790> federal<00:01:42.500> regulation<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:45.170> personally

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
versus federal regulation I personally

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.639 
versus federal regulation I personally
believe<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.280> states<00:01:47.700> should<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.960> more

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
believe that the states should have more

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.639 
believe that the states should have more
power<00:01:51.170> if<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:53.579> people<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.299> spoken<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
power if the people have spoken if the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.980 
power if the people have spoken if the
people<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> community<00:01:56.460> or<00:01:56.939> region<00:01:56.990> wants

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
people of the community or region wants

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.109 
people of the community or region wants
something<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.649> fill<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.880> laws<00:02:00.090> in

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
something and fill that the laws in

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.270 
something and fill that the laws in
their<00:02:00.780> area<00:02:01.259> should<00:02:01.469> be<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.680> certain<00:02:02.130> way<00:02:04.280> then

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
their area should be a certain way then

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.740 
their area should be a certain way then
why<00:02:05.460> should<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.790> federal<00:02:05.939> government<00:02:06.570> come

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
why should the federal government come

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.210 
why should the federal government come
in<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.079> tell<00:02:07.320> people<00:02:07.350> how<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> live<00:02:08.160> their
