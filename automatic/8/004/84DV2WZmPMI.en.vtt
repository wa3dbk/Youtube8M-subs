and<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.459> forth<00:03:08.730> but<00:03:09.239> now<00:03:09.989> here's<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.379> way<00:03:10.500> the

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
and so forth but now here's the way the

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:20.059 
and so forth but now here's the way the
dialogue<00:03:11.189> actually<00:03:11.760> looks<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.510> film<00:03:19.069> we

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
dialogue actually looks in the film we

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.830 
dialogue actually looks in the film we
have<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.519> put<00:03:20.760> some<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.150> those<00:03:21.239> things<00:03:21.569> in

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
have to put some of those things in

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.550 
have to put some of those things in
ourselves<00:03:22.700> although<00:03:23.700> again<00:03:23.940> we<00:03:24.900> must<00:03:25.049> go<00:03:25.379> back

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
ourselves although again we must go back

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.920 
ourselves although again we must go back
to<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:26.220> certain<00:03:26.670> basic<00:03:26.970> tenets<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.629> that's

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
to a certain basic tenets and that's

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.500 
to a certain basic tenets and that's
that<00:03:28.230> strong<00:03:29.010> dialogue<00:03:29.730> for<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.090> most<00:03:30.299> part

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
that strong dialogue for the most part

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.589 
that strong dialogue for the most part
speaks<00:03:31.230> for<00:03:31.470> itself<00:03:31.500> simply<00:03:32.489> with<00:03:32.730> he<00:03:33.269> said

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
speaks for itself simply with he said

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.509 
speaks for itself simply with he said
and<00:03:33.900> she<00:03:34.230> said<00:03:34.260> but<00:03:34.680> we<00:03:34.829> need<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.040> few<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.430> the

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
and she said but we need a few of the

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.129 
and she said but we need a few of the
other<00:03:35.639> things<00:03:35.970> let's<00:03:36.239> take<00:03:36.389> a<00:03:36.420> look<00:03:36.659> we're<00:03:36.989> not

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
other things let's take a look we're not

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.559 
other things let's take a look we're not
going<00:03:37.379> to<00:03:37.500> improve<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.639> basic<00:03:39.090> dialogue

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
going to improve this basic dialogue

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.460 
going to improve this basic dialogue
certainly<00:03:40.049> but<00:03:40.650> we<00:03:41.129> can<00:03:41.310> see<00:03:41.489> how<00:03:42.139> adding<00:03:43.139> some

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
certainly but we can see how adding some

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:51.260 
certainly but we can see how adding some
of<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:44.040> basics<00:03:44.579> works

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.690 

first<00:03:51.930> thing<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.200> we<00:03:52.470> can<00:03:52.650> do<00:03:52.890> of<00:03:53.160> course<00:03:53.430> is

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
first thing that we can do of course is

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:07.030 
first thing that we can do of course is
to<00:03:54.030> add<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.630> set<00:03:59.930> as<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:02.340> mean<00:04:02.490> like<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:03.560> cold<00:04:05.180> fog

there's<00:07:18.070> no<00:07:18.610> real<00:07:18.880> improving<00:07:19.719> on<00:07:19.900> the

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460
