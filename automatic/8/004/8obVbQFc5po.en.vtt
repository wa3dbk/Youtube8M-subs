00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.750 
just kind of disappointing tanabe I'll
take<00:04:11.780> advantage<00:04:12.170> of<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:13.310> know<00:04:13.400> things<00:04:13.670> that

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
take advantage of you know things that

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.490 
take advantage of you know things that
seem<00:04:14.630> like<00:04:14.780> they<00:04:14.900> were<00:04:14.959> all<00:04:15.140> in<00:04:15.290> our<00:04:15.350> direction

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
seem like they were all in our direction

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.710 
seem like they were all in our direction
and<00:04:15.950> then<00:04:16.100> just<00:04:17.060> wasn't<00:04:17.419> quite<00:04:17.510> good<00:04:17.570> enough

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
and then just wasn't quite good enough

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.360 
and then just wasn't quite good enough
to<00:04:17.959> take<00:04:18.049> advantage<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:18.590> so<00:04:18.890> we<00:04:19.100> didn't

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
to take advantage of it so we didn't

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.060 
to take advantage of it so we didn't
want<00:04:19.519> to<00:04:19.609> start<00:04:19.820> all<00:04:19.970> night<00:04:20.200> front<00:04:21.200> row<00:04:21.350> and

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
want to start all night front row and

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.620 
want to start all night front row and
then<00:04:22.220> man<00:04:22.520> was<00:04:22.729> just<00:04:22.880> really<00:04:23.120> good<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.360> got<00:04:23.479> by

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
then man was just really good and got by

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.840 
then man was just really good and got by
its<00:04:23.780> light<00:04:23.930> middle<00:04:24.350> of<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.500> race<00:04:24.650> so<00:04:24.950> uh<00:04:24.979> still

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
its light middle of the race so uh still

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.279 
its light middle of the race so uh still
a<00:04:25.880> good<00:04:26.000> effort<00:04:26.180> there's<00:04:26.870> nothing<00:04:27.020> to<00:04:27.169> be

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
a good effort there's nothing to be

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.500 
a good effort there's nothing to be
disappointed<00:04:27.410> with<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:29.060> know<00:04:29.120> even<00:04:29.270> from<00:04:29.450> the
