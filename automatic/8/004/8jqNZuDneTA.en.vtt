00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.509
 dear friends and today I'm going 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.040
 to be giving you a recipe for 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.309
 A basic cream is here I'm going to use 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.020
 half a liter of milk a box of 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.039
 condensed milk in a box of 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.109
 cream and 3 tablespoons well 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.330
 filled with corn starch 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.189
 so here I have a tablespoon 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.939
 but you can see that it's a spoon 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.349
 small and here I have a screen is a 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.700
 little bigger 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.690
 so this is what I come back using 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.149
 full of fear 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.329
 so I'll put this measure well 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.370
 because when this crime 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.430
 I'll be taking him to the mixer. 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.530
 so if I put less than half of fear 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.570
 He's going to give me a very soft crime. 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.850
 then later when taken to beat him 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.309
 It will get softer, they will still vote. 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.480
 using three tablespoons well 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.480
 filled with corn starch 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.860
 Now I'm going to mix everything up and I'm going to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.860
 fire until thick 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.860
 I already mixed everything and I'm going to take the fire. 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.100
 to thicken 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.320
 here I have see in it it's ready 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.350
 then you want to see the sun I took 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.689
 I put it here in my form and cover it 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.520
 with plastic film covers well breathe 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:35.130
 that does not form those balls of water and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.470
 here I'll give you a tip for you 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.700
 saw that I did not use yolk and 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.090
 vanilla 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.530
 Why when is it to take him like I said? 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.960
 for you it is a cream base because 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.799
 here you may be choosing to do 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.770
 The strawberry filling dream of Waltz Gold 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:01.079
 white pineapple 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:05.310
 what you want of fruit in the middle and 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:08.520
 bonbons is also for me to transform him 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.129
 in the filling of white gold or without 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.350
 waltz when you take him to the mixer 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.570
 I'm going to add 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.910
 a spoonful of coffee can be 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.240
 white chocolate green 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.400
 if I want it strawberry 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.370
 I 'm going to add a spoonful 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.750
 when you lift the cream to the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.540
 blender can be cream flavored green 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.960
 if I want pineapple and vote 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.570
 adding can coating pineapple 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.510
 if I want to stop I follow what I can 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:47.300
 both putting the taste of ice cream 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:49.430

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.770
