00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
like whenever i think of french stuff I

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.880 
like whenever i think of french stuff I

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
think of like cigarettes and escargot

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.160 
think of like cigarettes and escargot
and<00:03:50.400> people<00:03:50.790> riding<00:03:51.120> bicycles<00:03:51.690> with<00:03:51.900> loaves

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
and people riding bicycles with loaves

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.040 
and people riding bicycles with loaves
of<00:03:52.380> bread<00:03:52.650> behind<00:03:53.130> them<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:54.450> it's<00:03:54.720> all<00:03:54.840> about

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
of bread behind them and it's all about

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.820 
of bread behind them and it's all about
style<00:03:55.470> like<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.670> this<00:03:57.000> movie<00:03:57.830> definitely

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
style like and this movie definitely

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.560 
style like and this movie definitely
sums<00:03:59.070> that<00:03:59.220> up<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.610> think<00:03:59.910> minuit<00:04:00.360> has

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
sums that up I think minuit has

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.199 
sums that up I think minuit has
something<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:00.990> do<00:04:01.170> with<00:04:01.350> like<00:04:01.590> midnight<00:04:02.550> or<00:04:02.940> it

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
something to do with like midnight or it

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.870 
something to do with like midnight or it
means<00:04:03.390> midnight<00:04:03.810> or<00:04:04.170> nighttime<00:04:04.590> but<00:04:05.430> he<00:04:05.640> chose

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
means midnight or nighttime but he chose

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.180 
means midnight or nighttime but he chose
to<00:04:05.940> shoot<00:04:06.390> all<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.230> skating<00:04:07.620> at<00:04:07.739> night<00:04:07.920> in
