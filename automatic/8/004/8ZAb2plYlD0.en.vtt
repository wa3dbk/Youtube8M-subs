00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
an interesting Apple I must admit

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.090 
an interesting Apple I must admit
probably<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.540> more<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:43.990> historic<00:02:44.560> interest

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
probably is more of historic interest

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.930 
probably is more of historic interest
than<00:02:46.000> an<00:02:46.390> apple<00:02:46.990> which<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.320> really<00:02:47.620> worth

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
than an apple which is really worth

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.660 
than an apple which is really worth
having<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.450> your<00:02:49.750> orchard<00:02:50.100> if<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.190> didn't<00:02:51.520> have

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
it knowing what I know now I probably

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.800 
it knowing what I know now I probably
wouldn't<00:02:53.800> plant<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.280> again<00:02:54.400> but<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.910> is<00:02:55.060> but

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
wouldn't plant it again but it is but

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.140 
wouldn't plant it again but it is but
like<00:02:55.990> all<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.290> these<00:02:56.610> heritage<00:02:57.610> apples<00:02:57.970> worth

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
like all of these heritage apples worth

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.670 
like all of these heritage apples worth
keeping<00:02:58.390> alive<00:02:58.780> because<00:02:59.410> there<00:02:59.590> is

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
keeping alive because there is

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.470 
keeping alive because there is
interesting<00:03:00.220> genetics<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.480> say<00:03:01.720> curiosity
