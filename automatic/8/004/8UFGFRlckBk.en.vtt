00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.600
 now 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.439
 good 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.930
 empty bottles pure empty bottles 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:53.700
 below zero 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:57.150
 but 235 production by 7 that we got 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.750
 8 The cauldron serves but I have to 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.570
 dose that will never have my infinite 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.620
 234 physical good the materials that 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.660
 we have been making the reddish powder 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.810
 stone bright periodic powder 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.370
 come back to see what is very inferior and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.570
 spider's eye commented 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.640
 what is the network are they are and for now 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.140
 they are general positions and so I have 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.120
 said general portions this proposal 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.760
 because you can mention because all this 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.400
 stress will affect us the 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.870
 now the position is going to be the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.220
 different nothing else will make it last 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.659
 more or you can throw x the network this 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.109
 what he does is this 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.060
 that lasts harder more lake position 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:52.569
 version makes it last more or less 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.060
 position gunpowder makes you can like 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:58.090
 tell them to make the bottles go around 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.920
 throwable and the verdura of the hell then 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.290
 really does not do anything just say 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.300
 what does she do 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.110
 the mix and the spider's eye since from 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.110
 here we start 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.409
 make childhood motions 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.409
 chipi chipi chipi 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.739
 these are lots of girls and this 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.040
 exposure is thus normal is that they do not 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.920
 I said 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.980
 we need 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.310
 networks with the network are more water than going 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.310
 to generate 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.480
 will generate as she 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:41.390
 or we know and another detail may 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:46.640
 we can put 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:50.030
 in the des installer of the tower something 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.470
 well the 33 bottles either different and 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.410
 will create it 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.770
 and using more now yes that a 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.180
 material an object but you do not want 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.240
 buy one because we are means 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.560
 limited 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.740
 with gunpowder 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.520
 acute increased 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:14.830
 and that weird place position 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.830
 Thick Pitcher Potion 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:24.520
 this one gave him bottled water more 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.850
 redstone redstone equals 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.830
 what 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.210
 mundane in potion that is to say jokes come 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.410
 that there are some records below because the 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.300
 registration the durability is of the 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.180
 chance 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.040
 it says without effect but if we combine it 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.690
 with another to make an effect will last 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.290
 three hairlines here as you can see are 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.049
 two 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.000
 which we combine to endure with goldstone or 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.969
 bright stone or stone powder 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.280
 bright and create thick in position in 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:58.560
 gunpowder more normal water splash it 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.209
 he tells them I do not know why he's throwing the 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.209
 tunnel 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.209
 regrettable 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.239
 n remove this from here 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.900
 what would be where we put that 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.170
 other positions of lives was water 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.170
 lower 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:24.070
 a soybean disease 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.880
 every time he creates the rare position 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.880
 but scotland 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.380
 with warts here we have up to 5 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.110
 clear position static possibility of 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.110
 the worldly position opposition thick and 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.660
 mundane possible the weird position here 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.270
 we started from the positions 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.430
 positive so to speak positions 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.950
 negative opposition weakness and already 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.950
 the rest, we can start any 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.080
 at two 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.210
 these are to throw them for example if 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.550
 a passion of speed whether it's 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.910
 we can give more of life with the 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:07.050
 redstone a little more of the forgotten be 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:10.440
 not as much as the network are but let's 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.600
 less with goldstone or that we can 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.960
 do it with gunpowder 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.870
 and good to say now yes that basic 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.550
 the basics of positions and then 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.550
 this week to serve 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.759
 for more level to be more passion is 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:32.590
 different this week be pure 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:35.710
 positions players really and well 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.029
 I despair partial disasters I do not 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.580
 I agree with the name that asshole but I think 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:41.400
 that fell into a tailspin and see you later 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:47.660
 players 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.660
 10 points for chris eaton the dance
