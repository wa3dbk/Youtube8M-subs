00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
translate to understanding how much fuel

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.000 
translate to understanding how much fuel
costs<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.939> other<00:00:27.090> things<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.779> impact<00:00:28.380> the

bottom line in the business the most
important<00:00:37.980> issue<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.850> fleet<00:00:39.120> managers<00:00:39.690> is

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
important issue for fleet managers is

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.990 
important issue for fleet managers is
that<00:00:40.170> they<00:00:40.350> want<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.980> able<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.430> figure<00:00:41.700> out

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
that they want to be able to figure out

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.930 
that they want to be able to figure out
what<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.129> downtime<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> vehicle

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
what the downtime is for a vehicle

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
what the downtime is for a vehicle
because<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.690> impacts<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.410> bottom<00:00:46.710> line

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
because that impacts the bottom line

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.799 
because that impacts the bottom line
when<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.489> cannot<00:00:47.760> serve<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.329> customer

the<00:00:49.770> other<00:00:49.920> thing<00:00:50.190> again<00:00:50.430> will<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.789> fuel

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the other thing again will be fuel

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.340 
the other thing again will be fuel

that's taking off the bottom line of the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.330 
that's taking off the bottom line of the
