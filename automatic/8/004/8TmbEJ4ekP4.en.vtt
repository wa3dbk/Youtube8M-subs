is my fault

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.399 
is my fault
because<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.979> told<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.460> about<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.409> I

don't believe that there's any going
back<00:01:29.909> after<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.700> simply<00:01:32.700> take<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.390> take

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
back after this so simply take the take

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.630 
back after this so simply take the take
the<00:01:33.930> file<00:01:34.170> your<00:01:34.530> previous<00:01:34.979> file<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.490> had

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the file your previous file that you had

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850 
the file your previous file that you had
before<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.180> copy<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.290> somewhere<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
before and copy it to somewhere and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.859 
before and copy it to somewhere and
write<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.490> borderlands<00:01:39.270> backup<00:01:39.720> or

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
write like borderlands backup or

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.690 
write like borderlands backup or
something<00:01:40.189> so<00:01:41.189> you're<00:01:41.310> going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.490> want<00:01:41.640> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
something so you're going to want to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.850 
something so you're going to want to
drag<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> willow<00:01:42.299> engine<00:01:42.689> any<00:01:43.110> file<00:01:43.409> into

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
drag the willow engine any file into

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.179 
drag the willow engine any file into
here<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.960> that's<00:01:45.960> literally<00:01:46.619> all<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.950> have

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
here and that's literally all you have

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.370 
here and that's literally all you have
to<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:47.670> now<00:01:48.030> borderlands<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.200> run

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
to do now borderlands is going to run

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.010 
to do now borderlands is going to run
much<00:01:50.189> smoother<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.689> look<00:01:51.810> much

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
much smoother it's going to look much

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.950 
much smoother it's going to look much
nicer<00:01:52.290> then<00:01:53.220> if<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.970> simply<00:01:54.390> had<00:01:54.540> all<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
nicer then if you simply had all the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.260 
nicer then if you simply had all the
settings<00:01:55.350> turn<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> lowest<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.850> you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
settings turn to the lowest and if you

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.840 
settings turn to the lowest and if you
want<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.500> exactly<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.340> look<00:01:59.640> like

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
want to see exactly what that look like

through the app store I believe it cost

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.569 
through the app store I believe it cost
twenty<00:03:14.489> dollars<00:03:14.519> I'm<00:03:15.510> not<00:03:16.139> 100%<00:03:16.980> certain<00:03:17.370> on

twenty dollars I'm not 100% certain on
that<00:03:17.790> um<00:03:18.739> but<00:03:19.739> yes<00:03:19.949> so<00:03:20.759> now<00:03:21.209> it's<00:03:21.359> gonna<00:03:21.449> be

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
that um but yes so now it's gonna be

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.360 
that um but yes so now it's gonna be
loading<00:03:21.870> here<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.229> of<00:03:22.680> course<00:03:22.709> because<00:03:23.340> of

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
loading here and of course because of

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.039 
loading here and of course because of
the<00:03:23.549> recording<00:03:23.970> program<00:03:24.150> it's<00:03:24.599> not<00:03:24.780> gonna<00:03:24.930> be

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
the recording program it's not gonna be

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.039 
the recording program it's not gonna be
