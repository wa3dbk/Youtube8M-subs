mod<00:04:05.580> might<00:04:06.580> be<00:04:06.760> in<00:04:06.820> over<00:04:06.910> one<00:04:07.300> of<00:04:07.390> our<00:04:07.480> videos

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
mod might be in over one of our videos

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.500 
mod might be in over one of our videos
but<00:04:08.440> it's<00:04:08.980> a<00:04:10.680> fork<00:04:11.680> bell<00:04:12.400> fork<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.330> can

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
but it's a fork bell fork and you can

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.620 
but it's a fork bell fork and you can
lift<00:04:13.720> like<00:04:14.110> stacks<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.650> free<00:04:14.920> high<00:04:15.130> so<00:04:15.640> it

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
lift like stacks of free high so it

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.949 
lift like stacks of free high so it
stacks<00:04:17.049> are<00:04:17.260> free<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:17.770> then<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.430> can<00:04:18.959> just

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
stacks are free and then you can just

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.830 
stacks are free and then you can just
like<00:04:20.200> piccolo<00:04:20.590> develops<00:04:21.190> round<00:04:21.880> square<00:04:22.510> I

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
like piccolo develops round square I

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.450 
like piccolo develops round square I
think<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.110> can<00:04:23.230> also<00:04:23.350> pick<00:04:23.710> up<00:04:23.740> pallets<00:04:24.280> and

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
think you can also pick up pallets and

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.460 
think you can also pick up pallets and
sort<00:04:24.640> of<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:25.230> yeah<00:04:26.230> this<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.430> baler

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470
