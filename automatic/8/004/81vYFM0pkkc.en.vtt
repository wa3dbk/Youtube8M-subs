most<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> games<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.430> basically<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
most of the games you basically have to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.009 
most of the games you basically have to
keep<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.600> tempo<00:01:02.660> you're<00:01:03.660> doing<00:01:03.930> on

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
keep up with the tempo you're doing on

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.420 
keep up with the tempo you're doing on
the<00:01:04.110> offbeat<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:09.650> don't<00:01:10.650> really<00:01:10.830> hold<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> game

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
look at that okay so most of the games

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.780 
look at that okay so most of the games
are<00:01:27.930> exactly<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> keep
