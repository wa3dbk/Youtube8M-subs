do whales come to our rescue in this

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.729 
do whales come to our rescue in this
scenario<00:00:59.789> well<00:01:00.750> there's<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.960> new<00:01:01.109> study<00:01:01.410> by<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
scenario well there's a new study by the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.680 
scenario well there's a new study by the
Australian<00:01:02.399> Antarctic<00:01:02.550> division<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.390> found

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
Australian Antarctic division that found

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.620 
Australian Antarctic division that found
as<00:01:04.400> populations<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.640> whales<00:01:05.850> continue<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
as populations of whales continue to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.710 
as populations of whales continue to
expand<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.350> grow<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.340> amounts<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.880> whale<00:01:09.270> poo

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
expand and grow the amounts of whale poo

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.450 
expand and grow the amounts of whale poo
they<00:01:10.080> leave<00:01:10.290> behind<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.979> happens<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.430> be

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
they leave behind just happens to be

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.940 
they leave behind just happens to be
high<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.150> iron<00:01:12.420> which<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> perfect<00:01:13.770> food

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
high in iron which is the perfect food

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.910 
high in iron which is the perfect food
source<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.460> phytoplankton<00:01:15.299> balloons<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.740> in

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
source for phytoplankton balloons so in

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.530 
source for phytoplankton balloons so in
theory<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.460> more<00:01:17.610> whales<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.360> have

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
theory the more whales that you have

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.080 
theory the more whales that you have
dropping<00:01:19.110> behind<00:01:19.259> more<00:01:19.680> whale<00:01:19.950> poo<00:01:20.280> should

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
dropping behind more whale poo should

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.420 
dropping behind more whale poo should
allow<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.720> greater<00:01:21.890> phytoplankton<00:01:22.890> blooms

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
allow for greater phytoplankton blooms

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.730 
allow for greater phytoplankton blooms
and<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.330> works<00:01:24.570> directly<00:01:25.110> into<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> food

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and that works directly into the food

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.520 
and that works directly into the food
chain<00:01:25.909> tiny<00:01:26.909> shrimp<00:01:27.299> known<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.659> krill<00:01:27.960> feed<00:01:28.380> on

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
chain tiny shrimp known as krill feed on

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.770 
chain tiny shrimp known as krill feed on
the<00:01:28.710> phytoplankton<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.210> whales<00:01:30.420> make

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the phytoplankton and the whales make

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.830 
the phytoplankton and the whales make
that<00:01:30.960> krill<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.500> prime<00:01:32.130> part<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.610> their<00:01:32.759> diet<00:01:33.000> so

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that krill a prime part of their diet so

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.990 
that krill a prime part of their diet so
why<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.020> phytoplankton<00:01:34.680> important<00:01:35.369> well<00:01:35.880> they

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
why is phytoplankton important well they

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
why is phytoplankton important well they
use<00:01:36.240> sun<00:01:36.600> lights<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.140> they<00:01:37.229> actually<00:01:37.409> pull

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
use sun lights and they actually pull

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.100 
use sun lights and they actually pull
carbon<00:01:38.460> dioxide<00:01:39.030> out<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> ocean<00:01:39.630> surface

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
carbon dioxide out of the ocean surface

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.280 
carbon dioxide out of the ocean surface
as<00:01:40.530> part<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.310> their<00:01:41.430> growing<00:01:41.700> process<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:43.079> as

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
as part of their growing process so as

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.230 
as part of their growing process so as
more<00:01:43.560> carbon<00:01:44.009> dioxide<00:01:44.040> gets<00:01:44.700> pulled<00:01:44.970> out<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
more carbon dioxide gets pulled out of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.850 
more carbon dioxide gets pulled out of
the<00:01:45.329> ocean<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.810> gives<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> ocean<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.680> better

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the ocean this gives the ocean a better

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.670 
the ocean this gives the ocean a better
ability<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.909> absorb<00:01:48.329> more<00:01:48.659> carbon<00:01:49.110> dioxide

co2 being pulled out of the atmosphere

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.679 
co2 being pulled out of the atmosphere
perhaps<00:02:01.740> pulling<00:02:02.579> back<00:02:02.880> some<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.570> the

perhaps pulling back some of the

so<00:02:07.789> maybe<00:02:07.969> the<00:02:08.149> crew<00:02:08.330> of<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.450> enterprise<00:02:08.629> had

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
so maybe the crew of the enterprise had

it<00:02:09.140> right<00:02:09.289> going<00:02:09.709> back<00:02:09.920> in<00:02:10.129> time<00:02:10.369> and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
it right going back in time and

in the future according to this study it

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.440 
in the future according to this study it
may<00:02:15.470> potentially<00:02:16.190> lead<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.849> slightly
