00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
wear extensions with straight hair like

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.480 
wear extensions with straight hair like
I<00:06:19.280> can't<00:06:19.970> have<00:06:20.240> a<00:06:20.420> straight<00:06:20.870> look<00:06:21.170> but<00:06:21.830> it<00:06:22.070> does

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
I can't have a straight look but it does

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.320 
I can't have a straight look but it does
work<00:06:23.110> if<00:06:24.110> I<00:06:24.470> curl<00:06:24.710> my<00:06:24.740> hair<00:06:24.890> then<00:06:25.760> it<00:06:26.120> looks

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
work if I curl my hair then it looks

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.830 
work if I curl my hair then it looks
natural<00:06:26.570> but<00:06:27.410> um<00:06:27.910> it<00:06:28.910> just<00:06:29.030> doesn't<00:06:29.690> really

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
natural but um it just doesn't really

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.930 
natural but um it just doesn't really
work<00:06:30.290> with<00:06:30.500> my<00:06:30.650> hairstyle<00:06:31.400> that<00:06:31.490> I<00:06:31.640> have<00:06:31.790> right

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
work with my hairstyle that I have right

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.630 
work with my hairstyle that I have right
now<00:06:32.000> but<00:06:32.930> other<00:06:33.170> than<00:06:33.410> that<00:06:33.470> the<00:06:33.980> extensions

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
now but other than that the extensions

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.330 
now but other than that the extensions
are<00:06:34.970> great<00:06:35.300> what<00:06:36.260> I<00:06:36.290> mean<00:06:36.530> is<00:06:36.590> that<00:06:36.800> they<00:06:37.130> don't

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
are great what I mean is that they don't

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:43.090 
are great what I mean is that they don't
really<00:06:37.520> suit<00:06:38.000> me<00:06:40.030> like<00:06:41.030> wearing<00:06:41.480> a<00:06:41.680> loose<00:06:42.680> look

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
really suit me like wearing a loose look

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.330 
really suit me like wearing a loose look
but<00:06:43.730> I<00:06:44.000> think<00:06:44.510> they<00:06:44.720> are<00:06:44.960> great<00:06:45.350> for<00:06:45.980> braids

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
but I think they are great for braids

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.000 
but I think they are great for braids
and<00:06:46.610> I<00:06:46.700> do<00:06:46.760> a<00:06:46.880> lot<00:06:47.090> of<00:06:47.150> braiding<00:06:47.630> so<00:06:48.010> that's

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
and I do a lot of braiding so that's

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.890 
and I do a lot of braiding so that's
great<00:06:49.340> for<00:06:49.580> me<00:06:49.760> that's<00:06:50.390> what<00:06:50.510> I<00:06:50.570> like<00:06:50.840> with

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
great for me that's what I like with

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.240 
great for me that's what I like with
them<00:06:51.260> so<00:06:51.680> overall<00:06:52.670> I<00:06:53.060> think<00:06:53.180> they're<00:06:53.540> great<00:06:53.810> ah

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
them so overall I think they're great ah

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.270 
them so overall I think they're great ah
they're<00:06:55.250> not<00:06:55.460> really<00:06:56.200> fit<00:06:57.200> into<00:06:57.380> my<00:06:57.680> hairstyle

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280
