00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.370
 Ruth say that that many are 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.739
 develops but I am slightly different 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.390
 relationship itself honestly to me 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.320
 new phone somehow not break 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.410
 and I want to store them looked baing 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.660
 On the page right there is this video as 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.520
 there break it all shorter link 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.530
 there will be a description si who wants to look 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.520
 how does this apparatus break up arias and 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.640
 hammer nails bathe there and so on 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.399
 So the device at the time of unpacking is 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.190
 130 dollars he has two gigabytes 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.020
 RAM 16 gigabytes 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.190
 5 inch flash drive hd 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.640
 permissions 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.709
 battery 2 250 rear camera 13 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.759
 front 3 2 2 sims 

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:21.310
 mtk shny processor 6730 2nd who are you 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:25.000
 there it seems and where the cut off working 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:29.940
 at a frequency of 1 and 5 gigahertz 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.349
 Basically everything is normal 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.780
 what opens here like this 

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:38.970
 The kit comes with a micro yusbi cable 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.860
 silver 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.720
 shorter adapter comes with our 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.220
 outlet 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.819
 he is the block to which you will 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.729
 charge this device well and actually 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:54.610
 With a piece of paper, now let's see, but yes 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.959
 felt the power of such a camera pancake 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:03.550
 hitched look already eyes this some 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:04.780
 such a hole in the back cover so what 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.410
 not yet collapsed 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.899
 Well, in principle, the device is of course made 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.030
 captivity and deadly completely 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.610
 metal frame back we have a cover 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.840
 soft touch is done now we are under it 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.219
 crawled see what is there 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.990
 you know what I like about this device 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.540
 what's the price of it 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.820
 Duc wadded quite 130 dollars for 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.700
 a machine that can break nuts and 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.440
 Well, who needs it in principle ? 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.140
 normal price with the characteristics 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.030
 not some economics about annoy and economics 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.310
 I wanted to say sentences like this 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.630
 listen to the metal frame with your fingers 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:50.020
 cuts so shoot it all here with us 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.910
 of course the battery is stuck here 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.250
 you know you take off the cover, I would not 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.530
 said he was some kind of durable 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.120
 some kind of battery 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.640
 little thin 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.530
 as if by two thousand gave out but 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.100
 I'll tell you a review later 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.720
 how much does it give one to break 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.510
 really nothing will be well it 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.090
 pointless but damn I think that any 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.720
 the device can be broken I understand this 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.930
 apparatus with all due respect that how 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.910
 would ideally have needed beer once crap 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.850
 start but i really don't want well meaning 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.460
 themselves may think you guys phone 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.550
 This will buy it He will break it 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.010
 really cool he keeps hitting he breaks 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.280
 nuts can be metal here it 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.130
 loud smash smash everything today 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.080
 you can beat a couple of nails but 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.110
 damn well , no one will do for 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.060
 what is it all shown yes yes if you have 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.240
 you there you go someone you and do not know 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.820
 there maybe you haven't noticed the curb there yet 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.560
 something there fell the phone you fell 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.410
 one percent on the phone is it now 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.390
 will die 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.790
 right now in the diamond in his eyes will die 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.720
 so what do we show us 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.620
 shows faster camera camera 13 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:12.430
 megapixels stated make a photo 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.800
 make the photo faster so there is 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.820
 there are 1 mega pixels no 10 times 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.380
 megapixels 8 10 megapixels for 130 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.780
 dollars 12 megapixels 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.570
 so nothing inhibits looks like 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.460
 very gay me g2 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.010
 f such a plan something in the hand lies 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.229
 great still crunches because 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.550
 the lid closed and felt that 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.930
 phone as cast 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.100
 as the cast do it the space to delve 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.270
 no, let's cut the dispute with a scalpel 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.310
 so what else to see 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.550
 one percent look holds and thought already 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.860
 must die for a long time no hold on come on 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.840
 come on boy keep on come on at least 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.210
 the sound of Kate and it seems to me the sound of the keys he 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.759
 will go out 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:05:00.740
 but well, well, well, well, give at least shouting 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:03.949
 something screams but not super screams but 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.610
 will, in principle, nothing works 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.259
 see brightness we even have brightness on 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.539
 all you can put and 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.729
 and in principle, and enough resolution but 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.130
 we are five inches, well, something like this 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.880
 here I want everything, of course 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.669
 fucking 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.710
 and still split a couple of nuts well, straight 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:26.599
 do you understand that this stupid thing 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:28.669
 there will be a stupid thing well I donâ€™t even know 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.349
 I think you will understand me and in fact 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.800
 comments write how you feel 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:36.080
 crash tests I really don't watch 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.229
 crash tests because I don't understand why 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.210
 break the phone why break 6 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:44.300
 iphone or fifth iphone new of 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.060
 boxes damn so many people go and 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.789
 although dreaming about these devices i think 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.099
 About this phone someone dreams I take 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.070
 it on the camera breakin nuts inspect 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:57.740
 he splintering ladies nuts for what well yes 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.080
 so I can, in principle, another phone 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.300
 break nuts and say then pancake 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.180
 the phone could not stand well, no matter how I know 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.400
 so this phone is special 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.310
 the phone is waterproof and shockproof 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.330
 so on that is you are not particularly for the mother 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.360
 bother threw him and so on 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.979
 covers are not needed here while the back 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.680
 cover software than you will still 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.840
 after all, it can scratch but there can be soup 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.419
 super k this tires yes no one here 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.340
 rubber usual soft touch and so on i 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:27.110
 I think that if it is good to fuck it 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.900
 will fall apart into several pieces 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.430
 because it is not discovery just 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.710
 an apparatus that can actually be 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.130
 football play and he will survive there 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.900
 but here as if its all sorts of splash if 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.479
 you really need a machine 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.400
 who will be there rolling the role of nuts prick 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.800

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.330
 after a certain number of days 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.190
 I will try as soon as possible so that 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.919
 show if in test he will start me 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:57.050
 furious buggy I break it 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.509
 I give you my word and we will split neither 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.099
 one nut and move one machine 

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:02.810
 Here are the cases all thanks 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:03.919
 subscribe to the channel link to it 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.740
 will be in the description 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:10.389
