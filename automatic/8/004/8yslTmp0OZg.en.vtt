right<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> team<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.180> one's<00:01:39.450> more

what makes a good dancer a good dancer I

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.109 
what makes a good dancer a good dancer I
guess<00:01:46.710> would<00:01:47.710> be<00:01:47.860> calling<00:01:48.159> Fidesz<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.820> think

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
guess would be calling Fidesz I think

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.060 
guess would be calling Fidesz I think
because<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:49.810> know<00:01:49.930> if<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.229> have<00:01:50.500> the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
because you know if you have the

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.789 
because you know if you have the
