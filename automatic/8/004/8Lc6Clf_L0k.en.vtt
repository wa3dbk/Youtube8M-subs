the issue here so briefly what's going

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.810 
the issue here so briefly what's going
on<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.800> if<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.190> go<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.750> our<00:00:45.750> web<00:00:46.289> browser<00:00:46.610> we<00:00:47.610> try

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
on is if we go to our web browser we try

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.209 
on is if we go to our web browser we try
to<00:00:47.879> load<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.329> page<00:00:48.660> you're<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> see<00:00:50.010> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
to load up a page you're going to see it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.729 
to load up a page you're going to see it
takes<00:00:50.820> forever<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.020> make<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.350> initial

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
takes forever just to make that initial

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.959 
takes forever just to make that initial
connection<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.280> what's<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.730> right<00:00:53.940> now

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
connection so what's going on right now

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.080 
connection so what's going on right now
it<00:00:54.870> appears<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.440> ipv6<00:00:56.039> protocol<00:00:56.820> is

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
it appears that the ipv6 protocol is

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.660 
it appears that the ipv6 protocol is
broken<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:58.949> taking<00:00:59.250> some<00:00:59.430> time<00:00:59.640> to

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
broken and it's just taking some time to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.510 
broken and it's just taking some time to
and<00:01:00.469> timing<00:01:01.469> out<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.070> that's<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.399> we're

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
and timing out so that's what we're

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.759 
and timing out so that's what we're
waiting<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:02.820> right<00:01:03.180> now<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.870> ipv6

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
waiting for right now is for that ipv6

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.070 
waiting for right now is for that ipv6
request<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.369> actually<00:01:05.729> timeout<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.510> fall

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
request to actually timeout and fall

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.640 
request to actually timeout and fall
back<00:01:07.260> onto<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> ipv4<00:01:08.130> protocol<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:10.439> can

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
back onto the ipv4 protocol so this can

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.620 
back onto the ipv4 protocol so this can
happen<00:01:10.830> several<00:01:11.159> times<00:01:11.280> loading<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> web<00:01:12.360> page

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
happen several times loading a web page

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.149 
happen several times loading a web page
because<00:01:13.049> there's<00:01:13.290> different<00:01:13.710> resources

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
because there's different resources

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.910 
because there's different resources
located<00:01:14.700> at<00:01:14.790> different<00:01:15.590> addresses<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
located at different addresses of

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.399 
located at different addresses of
different<00:01:17.430> URLs<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:17.970> there<00:01:18.780> could<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.110> several

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
different URLs so there could be several

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.929 
different URLs so there could be several
name<00:01:19.890> server<00:01:20.220> requests<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.540> delayed<00:01:22.939> so

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
name server requests that get delayed so

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.330 
name server requests that get delayed so
