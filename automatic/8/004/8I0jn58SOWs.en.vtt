what you've got a new costume and with

regular version on the right of the
screen<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.350> probably<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.039> costume<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.760> most

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
screen is probably the costume that most

screen is probably the costume that most
people<00:00:48.450> are<00:00:48.690> familiar<00:00:48.960> with

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
so some variation in the costume but

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.600 
so some variation in the costume but
both<00:00:51.989> are<00:00:52.260> largely<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> same<00:00:52.920> figure

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
both are largely the same figure

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.850 
both are largely the same figure
including<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.600> hands<00:00:55.050> which<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.410> great

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
including the hands which have great

including the hands which have great
splayed<00:00:56.430> fingers<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.570> about<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.020> slice

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
splayed fingers as if is about to slice

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.069 
splayed fingers as if is about to slice
and<00:00:58.770> dice<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.340> some<00:00:59.640> Logan<00:01:00.270> however<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and dice in some Logan however the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.599 
and dice in some Logan however the
particulars<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> costume<00:01:02.399> do

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
particulars of the costume do

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.670 
particulars of the costume do
necessitate<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.420> two<00:01:03.780> having<00:01:04.229> different

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
necessitate the two having different

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.800 
necessitate the two having different
feet<00:01:04.979> which<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.610> clearly<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.540> and

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
feet which you can clearly see here and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.750 
feet which you can clearly see here and
most<00:01:07.140> obviously<00:01:07.530> they<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:08.010> different<00:01:08.490> head

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
most obviously they have different head

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.609 
most obviously they have different head
scopes<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.420> really<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.170> went<00:01:10.409> for

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
scopes I really like that they went for

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.410 
scopes I really like that they went for
different<00:01:10.950> expressions<00:01:11.549> with<00:01:11.700> each<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.210> them

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
different expressions with each of them

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.350 
different expressions with each of them
with<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> very<00:01:13.290> seemingly<00:01:14.100> letting<00:01:14.790> out<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> roar

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
with a very seemingly letting out a roar

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.960 
with a very seemingly letting out a roar
and<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.200> regular<00:01:16.680> version<00:01:16.950> having<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and the regular version having more of a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.929 
and the regular version having more of a
quieter<00:01:18.689> snarling<00:01:19.439> expression<00:01:20.430> unlike

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
quieter snarling expression unlike

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.640 
quieter snarling expression unlike
legends<00:01:21.330> select<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.840> less<00:01:21.990> about<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.409> Posey

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
legends select a less about the Posey

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.780 
legends select a less about the Posey
but<00:01:22.979> let's<00:01:23.159> take<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.430> look<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
but let's take a look at the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.880 
but let's take a look at the
articulation<00:01:24.600> anyway<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.140> heads<00:01:25.380> rotate

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
articulation anyway the heads rotate

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.210 
articulation anyway the heads rotate
side<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.250> side<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.030> look<00:01:27.479> down<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:28.049> much<00:01:28.380> but

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
side to side and look down this much but

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.960 
side to side and look down this much but
not<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.850> much<00:01:30.119> up<00:01:30.450> at<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> arms<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.680> shoulders

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
not so much up at the arms the shoulders

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.050 
not so much up at the arms the shoulders
rotate<00:01:32.970> they<00:01:33.570> also<00:01:33.900> move<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.310> much<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
rotate they also move up this much and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.350 
rotate they also move up this much and
more<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.110> back<00:01:37.439> down<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.939> there's<00:01:39.299> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
more so back down and then there's a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.950 
more so back down and then there's a
swivel<00:01:39.900> at<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.409> elbow<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:42.150> elbow<00:01:42.659> is

swivel at the elbow and the elbow is

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.679 
swivel at the elbow and the elbow is
also<00:01:43.619> hinged<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.280> move<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.909> down

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
also hinged to move up and down

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.050 
also hinged to move up and down
there's<00:01:46.049> rotation<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> wrist<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.909> then

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
there's rotation at the wrist and then

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.450 
there's rotation at the wrist and then
the<00:01:48.240> wrist<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.750> also<00:01:49.110> hinged<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.770> move<00:01:49.920> up<00:01:50.189> and

the wrist is also hinged to move up and
down<00:01:50.869> both<00:01:51.869> rotate<00:01:52.470> at<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.890> waist<00:01:53.159> then<00:01:53.460> at

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
down both rotate at the waist then at

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.760 
down both rotate at the waist then at
the<00:01:53.759> hips<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> legs<00:01:54.479> move<00:01:54.720> out<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.470> side

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
the hips the legs move out to the side

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.060 
the hips the legs move out to the side
and<00:01:56.130> then<00:01:56.759> also<00:01:57.090> back<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:58.079> they<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.590> move<00:01:58.890> to

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and then also back in they do move to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.039 
and then also back in they do move to
the<00:01:59.189> front<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.700> back<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> bit<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
the front and back but this is a bit of

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.219 
the front and back but this is a bit of
a<00:02:01.140> weird<00:02:01.409> angle<00:02:01.770> at<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.119> knee<00:02:03.149> there's<00:02:04.079> a

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
a weird angle at the knee there's a

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.039 
a weird angle at the knee there's a
single<00:02:04.890> jointed<00:02:05.549> hinge<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.299> then<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.719> also

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
single jointed hinge and then it also

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.119 
single jointed hinge and then it also
rotates<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.550> then<00:02:09.239> at<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.750> ankle<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.649> is

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
rotates and then at the ankle it is

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.460 
rotates and then at the ankle it is
hinged<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.730> move<00:02:11.940> up<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.390> down<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
hinged to move up and down and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.560 
hinged to move up and down and
also<00:02:13.830> rotates<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:15.060> let<00:02:15.210> me<00:02:15.300> know<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
also rotates so let me know in the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.090 
also rotates so let me know in the
comments<00:02:15.900> below<00:02:16.110> which<00:02:16.320> figure<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.830> think

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
comments below which figure you think

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.090 
comments below which figure you think
wins<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.700> comparison<00:02:18.110> me<00:02:19.110> personally<00:02:19.890> I

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
wins this comparison me personally I

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.240 
wins this comparison me personally I
prefer<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:21.150> Varian<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.350> just<00:02:22.710> think<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.010> has<00:02:23.220> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
prefer the Varian I just think it has a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.790 
prefer the Varian I just think it has a
slightly<00:02:23.760> better<00:02:24.090> face<00:02:24.570> sculpt<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.320> perhaps

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
slightly better face sculpt and perhaps

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.470 
slightly better face sculpt and perhaps
because<00:02:26.310> I'm<00:02:26.430> old<00:02:26.610> enough<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.910> have<00:02:27.150> read<00:02:27.330> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
because I'm old enough to have read the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.840 
because I'm old enough to have read the
x-men<00:02:28.020> comics<00:02:28.470> prior<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.100> cartoon<00:02:29.550> in<00:02:29.760> the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
x-men comics prior to the cartoon in the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.500 
x-men comics prior to the cartoon in the
90s<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:30.990> my<00:02:31.200> eyes<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:32.190> variant<00:02:32.970> one<00:02:33.150> is

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
90s so in my eyes this variant one is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.570 
90s so in my eyes this variant one is
the<00:02:33.690> classic<00:02:34.110> costume<00:02:34.320> plus<00:02:35.250> while<00:02:35.460> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
the classic costume plus while the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.580 
the classic costume plus while the
regular<00:02:35.760> version<00:02:36.210> has<00:02:36.540> been<00:02:36.750> re-released<00:02:36.990> I

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
regular version has been re-released I

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.100 
regular version has been re-released I
think<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.190> variant<00:02:38.670> hasn't<00:02:39.300> making<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.960> the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
think the variant hasn't making it the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.380 
think the variant hasn't making it the
harder<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.710> come<00:02:40.980> by<00:02:41.010> figure<00:02:41.730> anyway<00:02:42.120> for<00:02:42.330> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
harder to come by figure anyway for the
