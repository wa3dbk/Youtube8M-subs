 test driver christoph bauer on the way in 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.920
 The mattress 50 years ago was taken care of by the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.990
 French reconstructed sports car 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.760
 the paris car salon for a stir and 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.800
 Not because of the bizarre 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.160
 designs but because of its inner 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.160
 values 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.880
 I appreciate your mattresses from the years 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.680
 1966 a small sports car with 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.840
 plastic body 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.970
 with a souped up 1.3 liters 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.520
 four cylinder engine so far so good but 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.350
 that's actually special here 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.170
 the position of the engine is sitting here 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.520
 in the nape under this elevation in the 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.750
 trunk 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.750
 a mid-engine 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.570
 the first successful athletes 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.980
 middle mother carriage emerged in the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.019
 thirties of the previous 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.149
 century in the auto union 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.070
 Silver Arrows cards the mighty ones 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.930
 mother and right behind the driver and 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.140
 made for an ideal 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.140
 weight distribution 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.330
 for the formula 3 group the british 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.280
 racers forge cuba the mid-engine 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.740
 concept in the late forties 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.630
 since the sixties it is also in the 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.630
 King class formula 1 standard 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.659
 Our matra shows in bathing too 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.110
 if the engine is not warm then 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.280
 is he a real bitch and rattles 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.440
 sports and rattles 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.300
 but once at operating temperature 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.950
 is 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.510
 shows that at the latest to 3000 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.510
 turns what is in them 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.460
 so violently on the gas 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.350
 it's a pleasure to be there 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.350
 seconds from 0 to 100 and it's over 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.310
 only at 210 and that with a small one 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.310
 1.3 liters engine 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:05.280
 from 1962 to 1964 built automobile rené 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.200
 The first 190 jet then took over arms 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.030
 manufacturer matra the leadership and 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.390
 improved the use impermeability 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.390
 the speedster's production ran up 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.390
 1968 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.000
 the gear is really one in the car 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.850
 catastrophe 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.380
 So to find the way here 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.960
 is a matter of luck from the reverse gear 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.430
 not to mention that comes from that 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.890
 one to save costs 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.170
 the gearbox of a renault delivery van 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.030
 has installed 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.910
 and the whole thing still so far behind 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.650
 in the back this is over a meter long 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.040
 complicated gifts with this 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.409
 small shift lever would be connected 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.409
 that's no fun at all 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.350
 the most potent stage of the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.040
 mid-engine rocket ignited matra 1966 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.040
 at a gross weight of 775 kilograms 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.080
 this jet delivers six proud 105 ps 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.480
 that the flounder originally for the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.850
 raceway could be constructed too 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.350
 the street version hardly deny the 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.989
 Matra drives the must have a certain 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.610
 Racing affinity has existed here 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.170
 no real seats but one lays 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.989
 the interent bowls with the butt 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.880
 just above the ground and then it is 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.880
 Of course, loud 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.610
 The engine sits behind a team 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.970
 of noises 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.970
 just 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.129
 the promenade of riva del garda 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.900
 strangely misplaced almost like an ufo 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.739
 the future will be the matra 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.739
 historical scenery 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.040
 only two air hoses for drainage 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.480
 The engine heat disturbs the flowing form 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.480
 his plastic body 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.460
 Sportiness rules in the interior 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.560
 small steering wheel short shift knob and 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.560
 instruments without end 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.200
 the matra jet is really a hot one 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.270
 Flounder there is every finnish sauna 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.590
 joke as I did my I am now to 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.090
 example fan of these flat slices 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.250
 but of course they are neat 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.410
 greenhouse climate and then the sits 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.910
 cooling the front of the engine and the rear 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.610
 Connecting pipe run naturally 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.130
 through the interior and around this sauna 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.870
 construction still has to be completed 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.640
 The hot turbine directly in the back 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.280
 the driver mounted only shielded 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.890
 through this carpet but here 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.850
 you can at least open the roof 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.200
 By the way , you only have that in total 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.730
 twelve cars made if one 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.500
 has found that too high 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.650
 speeds one the rear window 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.780
 can fly away 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.110
 apropos rear window under her crouches 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.340
 of motors hexer amédée gordini 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.230
 two four- wheeled four-cylinder 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.300
 Double carburetor ensure full performance 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.300
 and wonderfully dirty sound 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.520
 on the road it is the barely 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.770
 There are better chances to get there 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.120
 museum for example in the oldtimer museum 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.120
 the autostadt in wolfsburg 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.220
 originally the matra jetta became for 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.080
 the use of the 24 hours race of 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.060
 le mans designed 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.159
 under production vehicle at actually only 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.319
 By-product of racing car development 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:19.310
 You can tell by the ingredients 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.939
 There is one sitting in the frame 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.610
 customized plastic body talk 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:27.919
 and as just 7,175 kilograms 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.069
 and for the road situation there 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.780
 Chassis with formula 1 also that is the 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.910
 two rear wheels each have two 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.160
 feathers and two dampers 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.830
 all together 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.220
 combination with this little longer 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.220
 he takes care of that 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:46.469
 Maybe play now and unbelievable 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.469
 principle 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.890
 But the real clou is his 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.170
 mid-engine while looking only before 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.000
 in racing had ventured motor and 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.950
 driver together into the car inside 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.470
 place made the cheeky matra 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.470
 this concept is also socially acceptable in everyday life 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.430
 So even if the matra jet in total 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.560
 1681 times was built so hard yet 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.770
 automotive history 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.970
 the first production vehicle with medium engine 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.980
 show with generations of 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.800
 supercars where the hammer hangs and 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.220
 thanks to the perfect weight distribution 52 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.020
 behind 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.600
 40 percent up front was in matters 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.390
 At that time, the road situation was absolutely unrivaled 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.020
 That's why it's definitely a milestone 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.020
 the automotive history 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:42.499
 and a trend setter with de 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.389
 tomaso lamborghini lotus ferrari and 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:46.879
 porsche still brought in the sixties 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:49.099
 Almost all renowned sports car manufacturers 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:51.490
 own medium motor vehicles on the 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:51.490
 Street
