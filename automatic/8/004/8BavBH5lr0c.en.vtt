outside to cocaine so he's rehydrated
himself<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.360> probably<00:01:24.689> saw<00:01:24.960> he<00:01:25.710> had<00:01:25.740> this

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
himself as you probably saw he had this

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.240 
himself as you probably saw he had this
wheel<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:28.200> are<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.890> hamster

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
wheel in there and if you are a hamster

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.710 
wheel in there and if you are a hamster
owner<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.670> probably<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.479> these

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
owner you probably know that these

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.520 
owner you probably know that these
wheels<00:01:31.140> are<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.799> big<00:01:32.159> big<00:01:32.759> no-no<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.960> cannot

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
wheels are a big big no-no you cannot

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.890 
wheels are a big big no-no you cannot
have<00:01:34.829> these<00:01:35.040> wheels<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:36.000> hamster<00:01:36.390> cage<00:01:36.420> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
have these wheels in a hamster cage I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.929 
have these wheels in a hamster cage I
took<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.409> wheel<00:01:37.619> out<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.860> his<00:01:38.100> cage<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
took this wheel out of his cage it is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.120 
took this wheel out of his cage it is
better<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.210> him<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:40.710> not<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.100> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
better for him I think do not have a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.770 
better for him I think do not have a
wheel<00:01:41.400> rather<00:01:41.790> than<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.479> wheel

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
wheel rather than have this wheel

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.080 
wheel rather than have this wheel
because<00:01:43.290> these<00:01:43.829> wheels<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.880> cause

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
because these wheels can cause

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.870 
because these wheels can cause
bumblefoot<00:01:45.810> due<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.829> ours<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.549> because

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
bumblefoot due to the ours here because

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.270 
bumblefoot due to the ours here because
if<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.180> think<00:01:48.479> about<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.960> hamsters<00:01:49.530> run<00:01:50.009> I

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
if you think about it hamsters run I

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
as my other hamsters the two reasons of

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.000 
as my other hamsters the two reasons of
why<00:03:10.700> that<00:03:10.849> is<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.239> because<00:03:11.269> one<00:03:12.140> his<00:03:12.440> wheel<00:03:12.709> is

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
why that is is because one his wheel is

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.759 
why that is is because one his wheel is
too<00:03:13.819> small<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:14.510> probably<00:03:14.720> also<00:03:15.170> pretty

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
too small and is probably also pretty

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.009 
too small and is probably also pretty

uncomfortable to run on here at see if

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.710 
uncomfortable to run on here at see if
he'll<00:03:18.260> go<00:03:18.410> in<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.680> now<00:03:19.090> because<00:03:20.090> he<00:03:20.389> is<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.540> big

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
he'll go in it now because he is a big

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.250 
he'll go in it now because he is a big

Milo's width is much much bigger than

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.259 
Milo's width is much much bigger than
the<00:03:27.470> diameter<00:03:27.980> of<00:03:28.010> this<00:03:28.160> wheel<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.700> there<00:03:29.180> we

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
the diameter of this wheel and there we

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:29.620 
the diameter of this wheel and there we
go

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
go

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.870 
go

wow<00:03:38.150> running<00:03:38.510> back<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:38.810> forth<00:03:39.049> so<00:03:39.859> what<00:03:40.130> I'm

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
wow running back and forth so what I'm

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.000 
wow running back and forth so what I'm
doing<00:03:40.459> for<00:03:40.579> Milo<00:03:40.910> is<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.450> am<00:03:41.930> of<00:03:42.440> course<00:03:42.709> not

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
doing for Milo is I am of course not

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.590 
doing for Milo is I am of course not
keeping<00:03:43.400> this<00:03:43.519> wheel<00:03:43.760> inside<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.299> his<00:03:44.389> cage

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
keeping this wheel inside of his cage

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.170 
keeping this wheel inside of his cage
because<00:03:44.870> he<00:03:45.829> can<00:03:45.980> hardly<00:03:46.160> run<00:03:46.489> on<00:03:46.639> it<00:03:46.790> anyways

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.610 
and it is not a suitable wheel for a
hamster<00:03:49.609> so<00:03:50.060> what<00:03:50.209> I'm<00:03:50.299> doing<00:03:50.600> is<00:03:50.900> taking<00:03:51.319> him

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620
