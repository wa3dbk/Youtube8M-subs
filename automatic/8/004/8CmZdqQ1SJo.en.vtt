00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.960
 today is that today we are in the 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.230
 small row in the hill and we are 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.460
 Today I know and giada giani we know 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.899
 already and there would be the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.309
 wardrobe edge and thought now 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.650
 somehow that's so cool that 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.710
 wardrobe and you too and somehow 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.610
 that's why she's one of the hottest we have now 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.610

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.379

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.579
 does not take super cool, yes, but I 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.420
 I would have believed me too first 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.870
 not lost here 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.680
 we are very far away from 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.829
 everywhere bartels street 65 volt is 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.220
 what special yes you know what here 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.269

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.269

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.500
 minute with cola and thekla so well 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.430
 and nobler of the climbing and than 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.680
 First, you're probably happy 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.440
 Now, what is it? 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.630
 what is that, anyway , the little one 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.860
 so I travel to a small library 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.380
 sorry to buy here instead 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.840
 one lends instead of buying and what can 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.340
 you can borrow so clear clothes 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.410
 but what kind of everything from 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.210
 Accessories over buttons over pants 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.860
 So blouse everyday wear me too 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.860
 again at the fundus or outfitters now 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.080
 only explicitly evening robe everything 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.119
 waltz simply as an alternative to buying 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.220
 should serve as a supplement to the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.680
 own wardrobe how come you 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.150
 to do that 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.979
 we think i had the problem that 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.060
 Every girl knows that we always have a lot 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.979
 buy too many things 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.420
 and somehow we thought it may 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.680
 but not always that we are always 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.750
 Buy new and then immediately 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.040
 find boring again and then 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.690
 we thought we could maybe 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.100
 The things just borrow short 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.209
 wear finds the then great then goes 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.830
 you return them and find new ones again 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.180
 things great, how are things going ? 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.040
 the price you pay as a library 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.269
 Member and salt season euro a month 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.680
 and then you can always fair divider on 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.230
 take it with you and again 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.040
 swap library so return 1 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.299
 should 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.890
 and the more you do about it, of course 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.860
 thinks it has such a rat tail 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.140
 that we also think about environmental issues 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.730
 have thought about how 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.680
 Clothes can be so cheap 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.230
 we find that at all well so cheap 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.570
 buy clothes and do not have to 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.280
 actually somehow again 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.920
 you can get better consumption somehow 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.640
 because also here his own clothes 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.510
 give up yourselves to sell to you or how 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.340
 does it work 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.630
 in that windows 14 euros 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.190
 monthly contribution we have now 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.870
 not the big budget around somehow 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.209
 buy or buy fat things 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.799
 but we really like to add something 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.780
 people who at home rum is somehow 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.010
 is very well received and that is so 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.450
 a little bit the idea that is for 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.640
 Wardrobe for everyone is every one of 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.840
 Bock has completely take out and everyone 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.030
 I also have something here 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.590
 I think we love it 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.600
 I think everyone should be great at everyone 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.829
 If you have a look here , there is also one 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.020
 a test abo or something 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.880
 one can also quit 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.440
 a gym or mobile phone contract 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.640
 then it was longer paid for mobile phone it is 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.390
 actually did know already in 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.040
 the toilet has been dropped 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.210
 Simply test and then refill 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.780
 if you notice okay maybe it is 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.040
 nothing for me 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:36.090
 Do not you see anything bad about it? 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.090
 come here and have to keep 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.770
 they can be in front of you because of the fear 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.620
 I do not 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.099
 beatles 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.879
 Run was the span of desperate until 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.879
 to the endstation 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.680

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.269

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.019
