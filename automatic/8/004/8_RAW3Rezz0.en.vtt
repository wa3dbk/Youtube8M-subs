the meat there it looks really nice

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:18.790 
the meat there it looks really nice
I<00:01:10.180> just<00:01:10.630> keep<00:01:10.810> cutting<00:01:11.050> back

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.280 

I've<00:01:19.370> even<00:01:19.520> attached<00:01:19.910> it<00:01:20.090> there<00:01:20.300> so<00:01:20.900> that<00:01:21.080> when

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
I've even attached it there so that when

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.320 
I've even attached it there so that when
I<00:01:21.320> flip<00:01:21.740> it<00:01:21.920> over<00:01:22.040> I<00:01:22.190> can<00:01:22.430> just<00:01:22.640> take<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.060> skin

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
I flip it over I can just take the skin

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.680 
I flip it over I can just take the skin
off

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
off

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.210 
off
now<00:01:24.050> I<00:01:24.080> flip<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.470> over<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.770> other<00:01:24.890> side

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
now I flip it over to the other side

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.270 
now I flip it over to the other side
right<00:01:25.250> away<00:01:25.750> since<00:01:26.750> it's<00:01:27.440> sometimes<00:01:27.800> easier

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
right away since it's sometimes easier

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.030 
right away since it's sometimes easier
to<00:01:29.030> do<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.390> other<00:01:29.480> side<00:01:29.810> before<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.650> remove

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
to do the other side before you remove

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:39.300 
to do the other side before you remove
the<00:01:31.100> other<00:01:31.340> one<00:01:31.550> so<00:01:31.760> I<00:01:31.790> cut<00:01:32.090> down<00:01:32.410> again

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.960 

actually<00:01:40.310> let's<00:01:40.460> move<00:01:40.610> this<00:01:40.790> out<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.119> way

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
actually let's move this out of the way

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:50.710 
actually let's move this out of the way
try<00:01:43.970> this<00:01:44.440> flatten<00:01:45.440> that<00:01:45.530> meat<00:01:45.830> out<00:01:46.010> there<00:01:49.720> cut

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
try this flatten that meat out there cut

00:01:50.720 --> 00:02:03.870 
try this flatten that meat out there cut
through<00:01:50.960> the

to<00:02:07.880> pay<00:02:08.209> off<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:10.009> then<00:02:10.099> you<00:02:10.190> can<00:02:10.340> flip<00:02:10.520> the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
to pay off and then you can flip the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.460 
to pay off and then you can flip the
meat<00:02:10.759> over<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.090> see<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.360> didn't<00:02:11.690> miss<00:02:12.200> like

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470

I<00:02:14.599> just<00:02:15.020> cuts<00:02:15.290> just<00:02:15.380> here<00:02:15.849> like<00:02:16.849> that<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.360> then

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
I just cuts just here like that and then

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.800 
I just cuts just here like that and then
what<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.680> can<00:02:18.709> do<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.190> set<00:02:19.880> your<00:02:20.000> fillets<00:02:20.420> off

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:37.219 
down angle towards the bone so you can

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:39.369 
down angle towards the bone so you can
feel<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.670> as<00:03:37.819> you<00:03:38.209> go<00:03:38.540> down<00:03:38.719> the<00:03:38.870> bone<00:03:39.049> toward

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
feel it as you go down the bone toward

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.940 
feel it as you go down the bone toward
the<00:03:39.530> skin<00:03:39.879> just<00:03:40.879> like<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.439> and<00:03:42.439> then<00:03:42.590> go<00:03:42.829> on

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
the skin just like that and then go on

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.649 
the skin just like that and then go on
the<00:03:43.069> other<00:03:43.220> side<00:03:43.549> of<00:03:43.579> the<00:03:43.700> bone<00:03:43.909> and<00:03:44.209> go

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
the other side of the bone and go

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.659 
the other side of the bone and go
towards<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.139> bone<00:03:45.349> again<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:45.859> you<00:03:45.919> don't<00:03:46.129> take

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
towards the bone again so you don't take

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:51.099 
towards the bone again so you don't take
off<00:03:46.879> my<00:03:47.120> flesh<00:03:49.419> there's<00:03:50.419> little<00:03:50.720> flesh<00:03:50.900> as

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
off my flesh there's little flesh as

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.229 
off my flesh there's little flesh as
possible<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:52.549> then<00:03:52.700> once<00:03:52.879> you've<00:03:53.030> done<00:03:53.180> that

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
possible and then once you've done that

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.020 
possible and then once you've done that
you<00:03:54.019> can<00:03:54.049> then<00:03:56.379> just<00:03:57.379> take<00:03:57.859> off<00:03:58.099> the<00:03:58.370> flesh<00:03:58.730> off

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
you can then just take off the flesh off

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.259 
you can then just take off the flesh off
the<00:03:59.739> skin<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:01.280> those<00:04:01.519> bones<00:04:01.760> will<00:04:01.969> come<00:04:02.120> up

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
the skin and those bones will come up

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.530 
the skin and those bones will come up
when<00:04:02.389> you<00:04:02.510> do<00:04:02.659> this<00:04:03.310> first<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.519> start<00:04:04.969> and<00:04:05.329> just

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
when you do this first to start and just

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.280 
when you do this first to start and just
angle<00:04:05.900> straight<00:04:06.200> down<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.819> meat<00:04:08.169> and<00:04:09.169> then

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
angle straight down to the meat and then

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.140 
angle straight down to the meat and then
you<00:04:09.409> keep<00:04:09.620> your<00:04:09.769> knife<00:04:10.090> angle<00:04:11.090> very<00:04:11.530> flat<00:04:13.150> like

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
you keep your knife angle very flat like

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.750 
you keep your knife angle very flat like
three<00:04:14.900> degrees<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.620> then<00:04:16.130> you<00:04:16.190> just<00:04:16.400> kind<00:04:16.729> of

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
three degrees and then you just kind of

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.529 
three degrees and then you just kind of
wiggle<00:04:16.909> back<00:04:17.599> and<00:04:17.659> forth<00:04:17.930> do<00:04:18.380> this<00:04:18.530> wiggle<00:04:19.539> you

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
wiggle back and forth do this wiggle you

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.719 
wiggle back and forth do this wiggle you
stretch<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.930> have<00:04:21.019> pretty<00:04:21.289> tough<00:04:21.560> skin<00:04:21.859> so<00:04:22.159> you

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
stretch to have pretty tough skin so you

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.370 
stretch to have pretty tough skin so you
shouldn't<00:04:23.030> worry<00:04:23.090> about<00:04:23.360> cutting<00:04:23.720> through<00:04:24.080> it

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380
