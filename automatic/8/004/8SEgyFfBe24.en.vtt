00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.910 
stuff as well he's got a lot of stuff on
eBay<00:01:22.509> so<00:01:23.050> I<00:01:23.080> picked<00:01:23.319> up<00:01:23.410> a<00:01:23.500> couple<00:01:23.679> of<00:01:23.770> extra

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
eBay so I picked up a couple of extra

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.630 
eBay so I picked up a couple of extra
the<00:01:24.190> extras<00:01:24.580> from<00:01:24.789> there<00:01:25.649> the<00:01:26.649> reason<00:01:27.039> being<00:01:27.280> I

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
the extras from there the reason being I

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.960 
the extras from there the reason being I
think<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.780> when<00:01:29.190> originally<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.280> 1<00:01:30.429> v<00:01:30.640> 3s

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
think that when originally the 1 v 3s

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.839 
think that when originally the 1 v 3s
were<00:01:31.149> made<00:01:31.560> they<00:01:32.560> didn't<00:01:32.860> have<00:01:33.039> snow<00:01:33.190> plows<00:01:33.520> or

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:33.849 
were made they didn't have snow plows or

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:35.639 
were made they didn't have snow plows or
they<00:01:34.270> didn't<00:01:34.479> I<00:01:34.539> didn't<00:01:34.929> have<00:01:35.050> these<00:01:35.229> pilots

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
they didn't I didn't have these pilots

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.389 
they didn't I didn't have these pilots
on<00:01:36.599> so<00:01:37.599> Hornby<00:01:37.959> decided<00:01:38.349> to<00:01:38.470> make<00:01:38.619> these

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
on so Hornby decided to make these

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.430 
on so Hornby decided to make these
without<00:01:40.240> them<00:01:40.509> even<00:01:40.720> though<00:01:41.140> every<00:01:41.349> other

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
without them even though every other

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.139 
without them even though every other
model<00:01:41.740> they<00:01:41.860> do<00:01:41.920> all<00:01:42.250> like<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.670> Northern<00:01:42.940> Rail

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
model they do all like the Northern Rail

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.830 
model they do all like the Northern Rail
and<00:01:43.179> then<00:01:43.569> the<00:01:44.560> other<00:01:44.709> liveries<00:01:45.039> do<00:01:45.250> have<00:01:45.490> them

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and then the other liveries do have them

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.960 
and then the other liveries do have them
which<00:01:46.840> is<00:01:46.990> weird<00:01:47.170> because<00:01:47.349> on<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:48.369> box<00:01:48.580> it

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
which is weird because on the box it

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.680 
which is weird because on the box it
shows<00:01:49.030> it<00:01:49.569> with<00:01:49.979> with<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.160> plows<00:01:51.340> so<00:01:51.910> anyway<00:01:52.539> I

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
shows it with with the plows so anyway I

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.740 
shows it with with the plows so anyway I
don't<00:01:52.750> know<00:01:53.050> I<00:01:53.289> don't<00:01:53.679> get<00:01:53.800> it<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:55.420> anyway<00:01:55.720> I

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
don't know I don't get it but anyway I

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.559 
don't know I don't get it but anyway I
picked<00:01:56.200> some<00:01:56.440> spares<00:01:56.739> up<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.360> fitted<00:01:58.360> them<00:01:58.390> to

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
picked some spares up and fitted them to

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.850 
picked some spares up and fitted them to
the<00:01:58.660> model<00:01:59.369> so<00:02:00.369> let's<00:02:00.399> get<00:02:00.610> down<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:00.789> details

of<00:02:22.000> these<00:02:22.180> because<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.689> really<00:02:22.930> decided<00:02:23.500> these

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
of these because it really decided these

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.780 
of these because it really decided these
really<00:02:24.129> are

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
really are

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.520 
really are
you<00:02:24.909> know<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.569> there's<00:02:25.930> there<00:02:26.200> are<00:02:26.230> this

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
you know that there's there are this

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.039 
you know that there's there are this
many<00:02:26.590> bumps<00:02:27.159> and<00:02:27.430> rivets<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.909> things<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:28.959> it

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
many bumps and rivets and things so it

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.319 
many bumps and rivets and things so it
does<00:02:29.200> look<00:02:29.349> pretty<00:02:29.470> good<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:30.640> particularly

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
does look pretty good I particularly

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.490 
does look pretty good I particularly
like<00:02:31.569> where<00:02:31.750> they've<00:02:31.840> obviously<00:02:31.959> played<00:02:32.379> it

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
like where they've obviously played it

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.280 
like where they've obviously played it
over<00:02:32.680> one<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.010> windows<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.370> looks<00:02:33.819> great

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.539 

not<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.439> I'm<00:02:38.590> being<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.920> rivet<00:02:39.189> counter

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
not that I'm being a rivet counter

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:45.149 
not that I'm being a rivet counter
heaven<00:02:40.090> forfend<00:02:40.299> no<00:02:42.060> yeah<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.620> we've<00:02:44.620> got<00:02:44.920> a

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
heaven forfend no yeah so we've got a

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.050 
heaven forfend no yeah so we've got a
lot<00:02:45.819> of<00:02:47.099> nice<00:02:48.099> detail<00:02:48.129> they've<00:02:48.700> picked<00:02:48.879> out

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
lot of nice detail they've picked out

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.440 
lot of nice detail they've picked out
the<00:02:49.329> window<00:02:50.260> stripes<00:02:50.819> window<00:02:51.819> stripes<00:02:52.060> or<00:02:52.239> the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
the window stripes window stripes or the

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.280 
the window stripes window stripes or the
window<00:02:52.750> bars<00:02:53.140> whatever<00:02:53.620> those<00:02:53.769> are<00:02:55.290> delivery

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
window bars whatever those are delivery

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.520 
window bars whatever those are delivery
is<00:02:56.409> very<00:02:56.439> nicely<00:02:56.920> applied<00:02:57.370> for<00:02:57.609> a<00:02:57.640> crisp<00:02:58.530> it's

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
is very nicely applied for a crisp it's

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.500 
is very nicely applied for a crisp it's
quite<00:02:59.769> obviously<00:03:00.519> quite<00:03:00.760> thickly<00:03:01.030> done<00:03:01.329> the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
quite obviously quite thickly done the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.589 
quite obviously quite thickly done the
finish<00:03:01.810> is<00:03:01.989> nice<00:03:02.579> roof<00:03:03.579> not<00:03:03.940> too<00:03:04.150> much<00:03:04.329> on<00:03:04.510> the

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
finish is nice roof not too much on the

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.899 
finish is nice roof not too much on the
roof<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:05.519> gray<00:03:08.400> there's<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.459> little<00:03:09.700> vent

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
roof just gray there's a little vent

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.339 
roof just gray there's a little vent
thing<00:03:10.239> in<00:03:10.359> the<00:03:10.420> middle<00:03:10.659> there<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:10.840> what<00:03:11.319> that

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
thing in the middle there and what that

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.449 
thing in the middle there and what that
is<00:03:12.120> all<00:03:13.120> kinds<00:03:13.269> of<00:03:13.450> underbody<00:03:13.810> detail<00:03:14.430> again<00:03:15.430> I

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
is all kinds of underbody detail again I

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.949 
is all kinds of underbody detail again I
mean<00:03:15.639> you<00:03:15.700> don't<00:03:15.849> see<00:03:16.090> much<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.269> that<00:03:16.450> but<00:03:16.870> it

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
mean you don't see much of that but it

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.129 
mean you don't see much of that but it
looks<00:03:17.170> good<00:03:17.470> at<00:03:17.829> least<00:03:18.450> from<00:03:19.450> from<00:03:19.900> kind<00:03:20.109> of

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
looks good at least from from kind of

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.330 
looks good at least from from kind of
this<00:03:20.349> angle<00:03:20.680> which<00:03:20.829> is<00:03:20.950> what<00:03:21.099> you'll<00:03:21.220> be

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
this angle which is what you'll be

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.649 
this angle which is what you'll be
looking<00:03:21.430> at<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.790> oh<00:03:22.200> yeah<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.349> this<00:03:23.470> one<00:03:23.739> was

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
looking at it oh yeah and this one was

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.360 
looking at it oh yeah and this one was
this<00:03:25.659> is<00:03:25.810> he<00:03:25.900> fitted<00:03:26.139> so<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.769> didn't<00:03:27.099> have<00:03:27.220> to

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
this is he fitted so I didn't have to

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.300 
this is he fitted so I didn't have to
get<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:27.909> open<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.299> put<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.450> chip<00:03:28.690> in<00:03:28.769> nice<00:03:29.769> very

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
get it open to put a chip in nice very

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.819 
get it open to put a chip in nice very
very<00:03:30.400> small<00:03:30.730> touches<00:03:30.970> are<00:03:31.299> things<00:03:31.629> like<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
very small touches are things like the

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.490 
very small touches are things like the
door<00:03:33.069> button<00:03:33.340> there<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:34.199> can<00:03:35.199> almost<00:03:35.319> imagine

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
door button there I can almost imagine

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.330 
door button there I can almost imagine
pushing<00:03:35.889> that<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.310> looks<00:03:36.489> so<00:03:36.639> good<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
pushing that it looks so good and the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.900 
pushing that it looks so good and the
bicycle<00:03:40.079> sign<00:03:41.250> which<00:03:42.250> is<00:03:42.280> very<00:03:42.609> very<00:03:42.730> nice

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
bicycle sign which is very very nice

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.270 
bicycle sign which is very very nice
also<00:03:43.599> at<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:43.989> front<00:03:44.109> end<00:03:44.440> oh<00:03:44.739> no<00:03:44.919> this<00:03:45.099> is<00:03:45.250> the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
also at the front end oh no this is the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.849 
also at the front end oh no this is the
back<00:03:45.489> end<00:03:45.519> which<00:03:46.359> one<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:46.629> it<00:03:47.040> yeah<00:03:48.040> okay<00:03:48.699> so

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
back end which one is it yeah okay so

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.559 
back end which one is it yeah okay so
most<00:03:50.859> of<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.129> probably<00:03:51.459> know<00:03:51.849> this<00:03:52.090> but<00:03:52.329> when

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
most of you probably know this but when

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.949 
most of you probably know this but when
the<00:03:52.780> one<00:03:53.049> five<00:03:53.260> threes<00:03:53.530> were<00:03:53.680> new<00:03:54.930> they<00:03:55.930> were

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
the one five threes were new they were

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.009 
the one five threes were new they were
converted<00:03:56.500> from<00:03:57.099> two<00:03:57.910> car<00:03:58.239> trains<00:03:58.569> which<00:03:58.810> were

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
converted from two car trains which were

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.970 
converted from two car trains which were
the<00:03:59.169> one<00:03:59.319> five<00:03:59.709> fives<00:04:00.549> I<00:04:01.180> think<00:04:02.049> they<00:04:02.500> were<00:04:02.560> one

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
the one five fives I think they were one

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.909 
the one five fives I think they were one
five<00:04:03.220> five<00:04:04.440> originally<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.650> then<00:04:05.799> they

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
five five originally and then they

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.619 
five five originally and then they
separated<00:04:06.340> them<00:04:06.489> into<00:04:06.549> two<00:04:06.849> occurring<00:04:07.540> but

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
separated them into two occurring but

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:08.909 
separated them into two occurring but
why<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:07.840> think<00:04:08.049> it<00:04:08.260> was<00:04:08.349> either<00:04:08.440> something<00:04:08.739> they

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
why I think it was either something they

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.020 
why I think it was either something they
problem<00:04:09.459> they're<00:04:09.579> having<00:04:09.609> with<00:04:09.940> the

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
problem they're having with the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.369 
problem they're having with the
couplings<00:04:10.449> or<00:04:10.690> it<00:04:10.780> was<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.930> problem<00:04:11.260> they<00:04:11.349> were

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
couplings or it was a problem they were

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:12.599 
couplings or it was a problem they were
having<00:04:11.470> with<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:11.859> diaphragms<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.430> can't

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
having with the diaphragms I can't

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.789 
having with the diaphragms I can't
remember<00:04:12.819> so<00:04:13.449> for<00:04:13.659> whatever<00:04:14.260> reason<00:04:14.650> they

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
remember so for whatever reason they

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:20.219 
remember so for whatever reason they
split<00:04:15.340> them<00:04:15.489> up<00:04:15.549> into<00:04:15.609> two<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:18.750> built<00:04:19.750> new

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
split them up into two and built new

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.560 
split them up into two and built new
cabins<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:21.010> think<00:04:21.430> this<00:04:21.609> is<00:04:21.789> the<00:04:21.940> new<00:04:22.090> cabined

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
cabins I think this is the new cabined

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.290 
cabins I think this is the new cabined
and<00:04:22.800> this<00:04:23.800> one<00:04:24.039> was<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.550> original<00:04:25.000> one<00:04:25.060> that

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
and this one was the original one that

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.279 
and this one was the original one that
used<00:04:25.479> to<00:04:25.539> be<00:04:25.659> a<00:04:25.690> 155<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:29.020> only<00:04:29.139> difference

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
used to be a 155 and the only difference

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.680 
used to be a 155 and the only difference
being<00:04:29.740> is<00:04:30.010> that<00:04:30.039> the<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:31.210> lights<00:04:31.479> are

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
being is that the the lights are

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.409 
being is that the the lights are
slightly<00:04:31.900> higher<00:04:32.020> on<00:04:32.650> this<00:04:33.520> one<00:04:33.849> and<00:04:34.210> the

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
slightly higher on this one and the

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.670 
slightly higher on this one and the
windows<00:04:34.780> are<00:04:34.810> a<00:04:34.960> slightly<00:04:35.169> different<00:04:35.349> shape

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
windows are a slightly different shape

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.770 
windows are a slightly different shape
but<00:04:35.830> I<00:04:35.889> mean<00:04:36.010> it<00:04:36.099> doesn't<00:04:36.250> really<00:04:36.400> matter

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
but I mean it doesn't really matter

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.870 
but I mean it doesn't really matter
they<00:04:36.930> look<00:04:37.080> pretty<00:04:37.200> similar<00:04:37.380> anyway<00:04:37.880> they're

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
they look pretty similar anyway they're

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.230 
they look pretty similar anyway they're
both<00:04:38.970> yellow<00:04:39.300> but<00:04:40.170> in<00:04:40.410> any<00:04:40.560> case<00:04:40.970> they've<00:04:41.970> been

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
both yellow but in any case they've been

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.430 
both yellow but in any case they've been
modeled<00:04:42.720> very<00:04:43.490> very<00:04:44.490> nicely<00:04:45.290> one<00:04:46.290> of<00:04:46.380> the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
modeled very very nicely one of the

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
modeled very very nicely one of the
things<00:04:46.560> I<00:04:46.650> really<00:04:46.830> like<00:04:46.950> is<00:04:46.980> that<00:04:47.100> they've

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
things I really like is that they've

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.480 
things I really like is that they've
actually<00:04:48.230> modeled<00:04:49.230> molded<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.800> proper<00:04:50.100> coupler

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
actually modeled molded a proper coupler

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.650 
actually modeled molded a proper coupler
and<00:04:50.700> not<00:04:50.850> just<00:04:51.000> left<00:04:51.180> you<00:04:51.300> with<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.480> known

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
and not just left you with a known

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.080 
and not just left you with a known
coupling<00:04:52.110> although<00:04:52.710> it<00:04:53.010> does<00:04:53.250> come<00:04:53.700> with<00:04:53.730> nan

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
coupling although it does come with nan

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.350 
coupling although it does come with nan
couplings<00:04:54.540> in<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.960> box<00:04:55.139> if<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.740> want<00:04:55.950> to<00:04:56.360> you

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
couplings in the box if you want to you

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.350 
couplings in the box if you want to you
know<00:04:57.480> run<00:04:57.690> two<00:04:57.870> of<00:04:57.960> these<00:04:58.050> together<00:04:59.360> what

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
know run two of these together what

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.550 
know run two of these together what
other<00:05:00.540> stuff<00:05:00.810> is<00:05:00.960> there<00:05:03.230> well<00:05:04.230> I<00:05:04.260> suppose<00:05:04.440> you

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
other stuff is there well I suppose you

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.020 
other stuff is there well I suppose you
can<00:05:04.710> see<00:05:04.919> that<00:05:05.100> there's<00:05:05.310> what<00:05:05.610> is<00:05:05.730> there's

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
can see that there's what is there's

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.580 
can see that there's what is there's
this<00:05:06.120> little<00:05:06.419> plate<00:05:06.690> thing<00:05:06.990> in<00:05:07.139> between<00:05:07.470> the

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
this little plate thing in between the

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.190 
this little plate thing in between the
light<00:05:07.770> and<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.490> rest<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.390> it<00:05:09.540> this<00:05:10.050> little

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
light and the rest of it this little

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.860 
light and the rest of it this little
black<00:05:10.530> plate<00:05:10.860> I<00:05:11.010> guess<00:05:11.310> that's<00:05:11.550> not<00:05:11.880> quite

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
black plate I guess that's not quite

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.390 
black plate I guess that's not quite
sure<00:05:12.930> what<00:05:13.230> that<00:05:13.260> is<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:13.590> guess<00:05:13.890> that's<00:05:14.130> like<00:05:14.280> a

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
sure what that is I guess that's like a

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.350 
sure what that is I guess that's like a
builder's<00:05:14.970> plate<00:05:15.180> or<00:05:15.270> something<00:05:17.180> as<00:05:18.180> many

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
builder's plate or something as many

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.420 
builder's plate or something as many
people<00:05:18.570> have<00:05:18.660> pointed<00:05:18.780> out<00:05:19.020> including<00:05:20.010> will

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
people have pointed out including will

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.850 
people have pointed out including will
intercity<00:05:21.180> 82<00:05:21.540> good<00:05:21.750> friend<00:05:21.930> of<00:05:21.990> mine<00:05:22.169> the

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.920 

motor<00:05:25.860> is<00:05:26.190> how<00:05:26.430> is<00:05:26.610> too<00:05:26.730> bright<00:05:26.880> in<00:05:27.060> here<00:05:27.090> so

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
motor is how is too bright in here so

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.890 
motor is how is too bright in here so
you<00:05:27.990> don't<00:05:28.500> have<00:05:29.100> to<00:05:29.419> you<00:05:30.419> know<00:05:30.510> they<00:05:30.630> haven't

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
you don't have to you know they haven't

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.440 
you don't have to you know they haven't
taken<00:05:31.110> up<00:05:31.350> any<00:05:31.470> interior<00:05:31.860> space<00:05:32.090> by<00:05:33.090> putting<00:05:33.390> a

taken up any interior space by putting a

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.350 
taken up any interior space by putting a

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
great big motor in the middle which is

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.820 
great big motor in the middle which is
what<00:05:36.600> it's<00:05:37.020> just<00:05:37.200> something<00:05:37.470> that<00:05:37.500> they<00:05:37.770> do

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
what it's just something that they do

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.930 
what it's just something that they do
struggle<00:05:38.190> with<00:05:38.370> a<00:05:38.460> lot<00:05:38.669> when<00:05:38.850> they're

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
struggle with a lot when they're

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.409 
struggle with a lot when they're
modeling<00:05:39.270> these<00:05:39.389> DM<00:05:39.690> use<00:05:39.900> because<00:05:40.350> you<00:05:41.160> know

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
modeling these DM use because you know

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.060 
modeling these DM use because you know
