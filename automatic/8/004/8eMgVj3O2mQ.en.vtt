00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.450
 process the role of the percent and because I'm not here 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.949
 negotiate 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.769
 In 3d or our voters do not really dream about it 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.109
 business deals 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.109
 This is not really annoying, of course 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.949
 the tourists the humans had by which we had ours 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.949
 I had taken pictures 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.219
 we are different diplomats let ads 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.140
 and so will come 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.510
 not spoken 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.510
 You can also change a bit because at the point 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.120
 Franken Ackermann 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.550
 stupidly starched and a pure set or Warner Bros to cut 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.700
 still do more 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.760
 then quickly got 0 4 and 0 points 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.690
 in the net 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.070
 but the product is rare 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.240
 in the canadier-one of the ladies summer the comrades 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.230
 sing along 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.230
 9 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 5 percent were made then it is still something 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.790
 Rubens is 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.920
 however, it is rejected because IT gives the Mountain 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.960
 from the modern probes percent the main game is very short 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.950
 seven of them symbol photo a good one 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.210
 for these different levels also percent can be achieved as a reason 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.460
 called fire 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.930
 among others 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.930
 Customers who raised their previous one 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.060
 can play this 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.040
 but there are black numbers 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.650
 Many Thanks 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.690
 the 7th 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.510
 who but now 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.770
 the first game 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.670
 One wants to help in this way, as has been the case now 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.270
 the insured must lead the life heavily Euro 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.159
 with the camera but for it even on the transmitter RTL 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:06.959
 has appeared in the trade
