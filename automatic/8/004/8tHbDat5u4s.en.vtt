00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.080 
to look through and just get a sense of
the<00:00:52.699> project<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:53.449> how<00:00:53.600> it's<00:00:53.780> going<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.020> sound

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
drums or the breaks just chop everything

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.350 
drums or the breaks just chop everything
up<00:01:02.420> get<00:01:02.809> them<00:01:02.960> sound<00:01:03.260> in<00:01:04.030> you<00:01:05.030> know<00:01:05.120> to<00:01:05.210> a

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
I used this drum machine to help beef up

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.510 
I used this drum machine to help beef up
some<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:16.010> the<00:01:16.100> drums<00:01:16.370> got<00:01:17.000> sort<00:01:17.270> of<00:01:18.520> tunable

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
some of the drums got sort of tunable

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.289 
some of the drums got sort of tunable
kick<00:01:20.240> drums<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.159> snares<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.520> hi-hats<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:23.180> so

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.600 
kick drums and snares and hi-hats and so
chivalry's<00:01:23.870> tuned<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.680> frequencies<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:25.430> get

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
chivalry's tuned the frequencies and get

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.539 
chivalry's tuned the frequencies and get
them<00:01:25.729> in<00:01:26.030> key<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.720> even<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:27.590> pitch<00:01:28.220> if<00:01:28.430> you

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
them in key and even in pitch if you

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.969 
them in key and even in pitch if you
want<00:01:28.760> to<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.150> drums<00:01:29.479> that<00:01:29.600> you're<00:01:29.810> using<00:01:32.979> and

want to the drums that you're using and
I<00:01:34.100> just<00:01:34.340> spent<00:01:34.549> lots<00:01:34.759> of<00:01:34.880> time<00:01:34.939> already<00:01:35.270> just

certain<00:01:38.299> way<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:38.930> then<00:01:39.590> once<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.369> drums<00:01:40.670> were

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
certain way and then once the drums were

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.429 
certain way and then once the drums were
you<00:01:44.090> know<00:01:44.210> kind<00:01:44.539> of<00:01:44.570> how<00:01:44.780> I<00:01:44.810> want<00:01:44.990> them<00:01:45.109> to<00:01:45.140> be

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
you know kind of how I want them to be

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.639 
you know kind of how I want them to be
and<00:01:45.859> I<00:01:46.070> put<00:01:46.310> them<00:01:46.460> into<00:01:46.609> the<00:01:46.820> V<00:01:47.000> synth<00:01:47.359> and<00:01:47.649> V

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
and I put them into the V synth and V

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.709 
and I put them into the V synth and V
synthesis<00:01:49.159> oh<00:01:49.250> it's<00:01:49.579> a<00:01:49.880> Roland<00:01:50.270> vsync

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
synthesis oh it's a Roland vsync

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.910 
synthesis oh it's a Roland vsync
synthesizer<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:52.130> it's<00:01:52.369> a<00:01:52.549> sampler<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.740> it's

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
synthesizer and it's a sampler and it's

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.010 
synthesizer and it's a sampler and it's
really<00:01:55.219> good<00:01:55.399> for<00:01:55.759> giving<00:01:56.090> sounds<00:01:56.689> different

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
really good for giving sounds different

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.319 
really good for giving sounds different
types<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.320> vibes<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.130> textures<00:01:58.579> and<00:01:58.700> stuff<00:01:58.939> I

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
types of vibes and textures and stuff I

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.929 
types of vibes and textures and stuff I
like<00:01:59.750> using<00:01:59.929> samplers<00:02:00.619> like<00:02:01.219> external

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
like using samplers like external

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.630 
like using samplers like external
samples<00:02:02.509> as<00:02:03.469> opposed<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.159> ones<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.549> you

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
samples as opposed to the ones that you

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.109 
samples as opposed to the ones that you
get<00:02:04.820> in<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.960> know<00:02:06.109> your<00:02:06.380> digital<00:02:07.039> ones<00:02:07.280> just

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
get in you know your digital ones just

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.730 
get in you know your digital ones just
because<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.600> feel<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.259> vibe<00:02:09.320> and

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
because of the feel and the vibe and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.670 
because of the feel and the vibe and
energy<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.250> totally<00:02:10.550> different<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:11.000> there<00:02:11.210> so

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
energy is totally different in there so

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.530 
energy is totally different in there so
you<00:02:12.680> know<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.040> fun<00:02:13.310> as<00:02:13.460> well<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.760> use<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.210> few

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
you know it is fun as well to use a few

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.450 
you know it is fun as well to use a few
different<00:02:14.900> pieces<00:02:15.050> of<00:02:15.260> equipment<00:02:15.320> I<00:02:15.800> use<00:02:15.830> the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
different pieces of equipment I use the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.610 
different pieces of equipment I use the
EMU<00:02:17.300> II<00:02:17.360> 64<00:02:18.230> as<00:02:18.440> well<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:20.450> give<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:21.080> beats<00:02:21.320> and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
EMU II 64 as well to give the beats and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.890 
EMU II 64 as well to give the beats and
the<00:02:21.710> bass<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.480> different<00:02:23.480> texture<00:02:23.780> and

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
the bass is a different texture and

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.550 
the bass is a different texture and
different<00:02:24.140> fire<00:02:24.560> with<00:02:24.800> different<00:02:25.130> feel<00:02:26.560> the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
different fire with different feel the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.430 
different fire with different feel the
strings<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.610> pads<00:02:28.910> they<00:02:29.840> were<00:02:29.900> all<00:02:30.200> done

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
strings and the pads they were all done

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.620 
strings and the pads they were all done
in<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.710> V<00:02:30.890> synth<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:33.220> used<00:02:34.220> some<00:02:34.490> samples<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.420> I

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
in the V synth I used some samples and I

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.350 
in the V synth I used some samples and I
made<00:02:36.350> up<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.740> lot<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.130> sounds<00:02:37.640> in<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:37.970> visa

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
made up a lot of the sounds in the visa

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.240 
made up a lot of the sounds in the visa
with<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.320> VC<00:02:39.680> if<00:02:39.740> you<00:02:39.890> get

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
with the VC if you get

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.410 
with the VC if you get

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
get in a synth you know and I just

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.590 
get in a synth you know and I just
combined<00:02:49.520> them<00:02:49.700> with<00:02:49.880> lots<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.180> samples<00:02:50.570> that

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
combined them with lots of samples that

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.630 
combined them with lots of samples that
I<00:02:50.750> used<00:02:50.990> some<00:02:51.320> created<00:02:51.740> some<00:02:51.950> textures<00:02:52.400> and

compression<00:05:15.230> wise<00:05:15.470> I<00:05:15.890> used<00:05:16.280> an<00:05:16.490> E<00:05:16.700> Series

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
compression wise I used an E Series

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.840 
compression wise I used an E Series
compressor<00:05:18.680> at<00:05:18.950> SSL<00:05:19.460> to<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.760> SSL<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:21.610> I<00:05:22.610> used

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
compressor at SSL to the SSL and I used

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:30.220 
compressor at SSL to the SSL and I used
a<00:05:22.970> little<00:05:23.180> bit<00:05:23.270> of<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:24.760> 1176<00:05:27.100> URI<00:05:28.270> for<00:05:29.270> some<00:05:30.140> of

a little bit of the 1176 URI for some of

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.310 
a little bit of the 1176 URI for some of
the<00:05:30.290> bases<00:05:30.800> just<00:05:31.780> sound<00:05:32.780> waves<00:05:33.080> really

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
the bases just sound waves really

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.590 
the bases just sound waves really

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
of feel bit coloration as well and I

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.170 
of feel bit coloration as well and I
think<00:05:41.270> that's<00:05:41.630> about<00:05:41.900> it<00:05:42.340> I<00:05:43.340> hope<00:05:43.880> you<00:05:44.030> all
