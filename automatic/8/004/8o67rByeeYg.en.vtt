 also evokes they have to live 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.759
 in the cemetery 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.289
 although they think we're going 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.170
 because they need to believe that 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.550
 something after but we stay there 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.109
 that it becomes a brake on what being 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.519

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.130
 go away and then stay the web 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.269
 I think we're going to heaven the truth

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:25.330
 to look behind the mirror 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:29.380
 is pursued by bad luck in 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.030

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.729

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.810
