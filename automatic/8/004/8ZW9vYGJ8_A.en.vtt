00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.500
 hello as I promised we will 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.570
 so continue to see how to do 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.950
 the waterproofing of a roof terrace so 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.750
 after doing our acroterics so the 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.820
 waterproofing readings really have 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.040
 today how to ask of a 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.160
 share the costières so that's a 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.349
 costières hence the name costières which is 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.250
 puts on the sides so the curb goes 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:34.000
 to actually be pointing at the wood support 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.700
 and then maybe here too since 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.880
 after we will have discovered in so 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.520
 we will start by cutting and measuring 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.440
 our costières fix them and then we 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.440
 will see how we will seal 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.720
 I have to put my first 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.320
 costières I'm going to miss a piece 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:18.229
 so I'm going to cut a piece and I 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:22.160
 will do so then in fact so the 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:25.340
 curb is going to serve on the side of the 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.470
 green roof so I can of 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.930
 strange support since on the ground we go 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.930
 so have our members anne who will come 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.960
 at the sealing here we will have gold 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.570
 after the insulation is sure this costières 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.090
 so we see that our acrotères in that 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.640
 this is wooden will come to put so 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.280
 libertine 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.720
 so it's greener will ensure 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.340
 sealing against rainwater 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.200
 who will fall on the top 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.040
 will run off when I arrive on a 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.140
 angle I'm making a small come back that I 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.899
 I 'm going to fold 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.180
 easily so fooling here of course 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.280
 to loot and then then I'm going 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.640
 continue all my all the way around with my 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.640
 curbs 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.209
 so in fact here I removed the ledge 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.840
 of third mascon so that the other can 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.840
 pass on 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.129
 So here we are, we have finished 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.849
 causses tr so we pointed them as we 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.150
 saw just now 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.000
 and now we will start laying the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.680
 roll of last offense and a membrane 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.829
 which will allow us to do the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.810
 first sealing layer 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.599
 so we go first the tip and and then 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.989
 we will see comfrey edges with a 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.989
 blowpipe
