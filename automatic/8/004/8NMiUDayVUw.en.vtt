this is my second one my first one was

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.880 
this is my second one my first one was
really<00:00:56.510> not<00:00:56.660> a<00:00:56.690> lot<00:00:56.870> of<00:00:56.989> time<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.620> put<00:00:57.770> on

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
really not a lot of time to put on

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.330 
really not a lot of time to put on
muscles<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:58.489> I<00:00:58.960> had<00:00:59.960> a<00:00:59.989> little<00:01:00.260> bit<00:01:00.560> not<00:01:01.010> enough

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
muscles so I had a little bit not enough

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.400

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
but you know my shoulders are almost

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.620 
but you know my shoulders are almost
good<00:01:03.649> enough<00:01:03.710> but<00:01:04.189> what<00:01:05.030> I<00:01:05.059> wanted<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.449> talk

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
good enough but what I wanted to talk

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.359 
good enough but what I wanted to talk
about<00:01:05.810> was<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.170> diet<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.930> secret<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.799> I

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
about was the diet so the secret to I

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.139 
about was the diet so the secret to I
guess<00:01:10.820> losing<00:01:11.180> fat<00:01:11.659> in<00:01:12.350> general<00:01:12.920> is<00:01:13.189> to<00:01:13.729> eat<00:01:13.880> as

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
guess losing fat in general is to eat as

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.649 
guess losing fat in general is to eat as
often<00:01:14.899> as<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:15.860> can<00:01:15.890> even<00:01:16.640> up<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.210> three<00:01:17.450> top

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
often as you can even up to three top

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.580 
often as you can even up to three top
every<00:01:17.990> three<00:01:18.229> hours

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
every three hours

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.760 
every three hours
so<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:20.270> leanest<00:01:20.690> people<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.500> leanest

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
so the leanest people the leanest

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.830 
so the leanest people the leanest
Fitness<00:01:22.100> competitors<00:01:22.430> they<00:01:23.299> basically<00:01:23.659> eat

Fitness competitors they basically eat
on<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.409> watch<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.490> they<00:01:25.670> never<00:01:25.820> go<00:01:26.120> more<00:01:26.420> than

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
on the watch so they never go more than

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.500 
on the watch so they never go more than
three<00:01:27.110> maybe<00:01:27.799> four<00:01:28.400> hours<00:01:28.460> without<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.270> meal

three maybe four hours without a meal

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.090 
three maybe four hours without a meal
every<00:01:30.350> single<00:01:30.740> meal<00:01:30.890> has<00:01:31.250> protein<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:32.210> and

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
every single meal has protein in it and

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.670 
every single meal has protein in it and
basically<00:01:34.100> a<00:01:34.610> lean<00:01:35.150> piece<00:01:35.479> of<00:01:35.750> protein<00:01:36.409> would

basically a lean piece of protein would

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.890 
basically a lean piece of protein would
be<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:37.490> piece<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:37.940> chicken<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.420> size<00:01:38.630> of<00:01:38.810> your

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
little bit of starch as a yeah yams are

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.899 
little bit of starch as a yeah yams are
one<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.859> the<00:02:29.920> healthiest<00:02:30.310> starches<00:02:30.639> because

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
one of the healthiest starches because

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.030 
one of the healthiest starches because
of<00:02:31.000> all<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.180> vitamins<00:02:31.599> and<00:02:31.780> they're<00:02:31.989> plus<00:02:32.769> as

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
of all the vitamins and they're plus as

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.459 
of all the vitamins and they're plus as
many<00:02:33.370> green<00:02:33.760> vegetables<00:02:34.450> as<00:02:34.750> can<00:02:35.049> fit<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.349> your

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:35.469 
many green vegetables as can fit on your

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.500 
many green vegetables as can fit on your
plate<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.400> do<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.669> every<00:02:36.879> three<00:02:37.120> hours

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
plate and you do that every three hours

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.610 
plate and you do that every three hours
so<00:02:37.930> one<00:02:38.230> way<00:02:39.189> of<00:02:39.219> thinking<00:02:39.879> about<00:02:39.999> it<00:02:40.209> is<00:02:40.629> at

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
so one way of thinking about it is at

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.229 
so one way of thinking about it is at
the<00:02:41.829> end<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.159> meal<00:02:42.340> we<00:02:42.519> tend<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.790> stuff<00:02:43.060> our

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
the end of the meal we tend to stuff our

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.179 
the end of the meal we tend to stuff our
faces<00:02:43.269> because<00:02:44.109> we<00:02:44.500> think<00:02:44.769> we're<00:02:44.889> not<00:02:45.040> going

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
faces because we think we're not going

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.720 
faces because we think we're not going
to<00:02:45.250> get<00:02:45.340> another<00:02:45.579> meal<00:02:45.909> forever<00:02:47.129> so<00:02:48.129> you<00:02:48.669> know

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
to get another meal forever so you know

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.119 
to get another meal forever so you know
we're<00:02:48.969> designed<00:02:49.359> for<00:02:49.599> feast<00:02:49.840> or<00:02:50.019> famine<00:02:50.230> so

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
we're designed for feast or famine so

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.140 
we're designed for feast or famine so
basically<00:02:51.579> what<00:02:52.269> you<00:02:52.599> have<00:02:52.629> to<00:02:52.959> remember<00:02:53.500> is

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
basically what you have to remember is

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.970 
basically what you have to remember is
you<00:02:55.150> should<00:02:55.540> be<00:02:55.569> hungry<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.230> couple<00:02:56.680> hours

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
you should be hungry a couple hours

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.679 
you should be hungry a couple hours
after<00:02:57.219> these<00:02:57.639> meals<00:02:57.969> so<00:02:58.889> you<00:02:59.889> know<00:03:00.090> eat<00:03:01.090> and

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
after these meals so you know eat and

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.860 
after these meals so you know eat and
don't<00:03:02.349> fill<00:03:02.889> yourself<00:03:03.310> up<00:03:03.549> until<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:04.750> know

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
don't fill yourself up until you know

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.159 
don't fill yourself up until you know
you<00:03:04.930> feel<00:03:05.349> like<00:03:05.819> gagging<00:03:06.819> just<00:03:07.629> eat<00:03:07.810> enough

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:08.169 
you feel like gagging just eat enough

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:12.170 
you feel like gagging just eat enough
for<00:03:08.980> three<00:03:09.430> hours<00:03:09.579> worth<00:03:09.969> a<00:03:10.659> second<00:03:11.379> trick<00:03:11.590> is

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
for three hours worth a second trick is

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.249 
for three hours worth a second trick is
you<00:03:13.180> will<00:03:14.139> feel<00:03:15.099> as<00:03:15.489> good<00:03:15.970> as<00:03:16.209> your<00:03:16.540> last<00:03:16.569> meal

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:17.259 
you will feel as good as your last meal

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.159 
you will feel as good as your last meal
for<00:03:17.620> example<00:03:18.220> at<00:03:18.310> 3<00:03:18.519> o'clock<00:03:18.549> a<00:03:19.209> lot<00:03:19.689> of<00:03:19.810> people

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
for example at 3 o'clock a lot of people

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.140 
for example at 3 o'clock a lot of people
just<00:03:20.650> doze<00:03:21.009> off<00:03:21.310> that's<00:03:21.790> because<00:03:22.030> they

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
just doze off that's because they

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.830 
just doze off that's because they
probably<00:03:22.389> had<00:03:22.689> more<00:03:23.229> than<00:03:23.829> 30<00:03:24.370> grams<00:03:24.970> of<00:03:25.329> carbs

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
probably had more than 30 grams of carbs

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.800 
probably had more than 30 grams of carbs
for<00:03:26.229> a<00:03:26.259> woman<00:03:26.650> or<00:03:26.889> more<00:03:27.489> than<00:03:27.639> 45<00:03:28.180> grams<00:03:28.479> of

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
for a woman or more than 45 grams of

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.710 
for a woman or more than 45 grams of
carbs<00:03:29.169> for<00:03:29.439> men<00:03:29.709> in<00:03:29.979> a<00:03:30.189> meal<00:03:30.459> what<00:03:31.239> makes<00:03:31.479> that

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
carbs for men in a meal what makes that

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.619 
carbs for men in a meal what makes that
carb<00:03:32.079> worse<00:03:32.379> is<00:03:32.799> if<00:03:33.040> it's<00:03:33.250> starchy<00:03:34.060> or<00:03:34.389> high

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
carb worse is if it's starchy or high

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.050 
carb worse is if it's starchy or high
glycemic<00:03:34.930> index<00:03:35.769> basically<00:03:36.430> it<00:03:36.790> means<00:03:36.939> it

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
glycemic index basically it means it

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.509 
glycemic index basically it means it
goes<00:03:37.180> into<00:03:37.239> your<00:03:37.569> bloodstream<00:03:37.750> super<00:03:38.470> fast<00:03:38.709> so

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
goes into your bloodstream super fast so

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.909 
goes into your bloodstream super fast so
you<00:03:39.879> want<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.299> control<00:03:40.810> that<00:03:41.079> by<00:03:41.319> two<00:03:41.379> things

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
you want to control that by two things

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.189 
you want to control that by two things
one<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:42.790> can<00:03:43.329> control<00:03:43.659> that<00:03:43.810> by<00:03:43.870> eating

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
one you can control that by eating

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.949 
one you can control that by eating
protein<00:03:44.620> in<00:03:44.769> that<00:03:44.919> meal<00:03:45.150> secondly<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.780> can

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
protein in that meal secondly you can

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.289 
protein in that meal secondly you can
control<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.439> by<00:03:47.590> eating<00:03:47.739> fiber<00:03:48.220> in<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:49.060> meals

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
control it by eating fiber in the meals

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.199 
control it by eating fiber in the meals
so<00:03:49.659> the<00:03:49.780> more<00:03:50.290> fiber<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:51.129> more<00:03:51.280> water<00:03:51.489> content

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
so the more fiber the more water content

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.520 
so the more fiber the more water content
it'll<00:03:52.780> slow<00:03:53.079> help<00:03:53.349> slow<00:03:53.859> down<00:03:54.069> how<00:03:54.340> fast<00:03:55.530> those

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
it'll slow help slow down how fast those

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.240 
it'll slow help slow down how fast those
carbs<00:03:57.040> hit<00:03:57.310> your<00:03:57.489> bloodstream<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:59.129> you<00:04:00.129> know

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
carbs hit your bloodstream and you know

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.709 
carbs hit your bloodstream and you know
so<00:04:00.489> what<00:04:00.639> you<00:04:00.759> want<00:04:00.939> to<00:04:01.030> do<00:04:01.120> is<00:04:01.239> rule<00:04:01.449> of<00:04:01.540> thumb

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:01.719 
so what you want to do is rule of thumb

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.929 
so what you want to do is rule of thumb
women<00:04:02.349> do<00:04:02.739> not<00:04:02.919> eat<00:04:03.099> more<00:04:03.250> than<00:04:03.430> 30<00:04:03.579> grams<00:04:03.790> of

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
women do not eat more than 30 grams of

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.420 
women do not eat more than 30 grams of

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
carbs in a meal you drink one juice

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.429 
carbs in a meal you drink one juice
that's<00:04:06.879> 30<00:04:07.120> grams<00:04:07.359> of<00:04:07.569> carbs<00:04:07.870> you're<00:04:08.019> done<00:04:08.169> you
