00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
is the wing on the back shouldn't be

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.940

there<00:01:14.330> but<00:01:14.540> I<00:01:14.659> can't<00:01:14.900> get<00:01:15.050> rid<00:01:15.080> of<00:01:15.229> it<00:01:15.440> so<00:01:15.770> it

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
there but I can't get rid of it so it

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.340 
there but I can't get rid of it so it
has<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.310> stay<00:01:16.580> but<00:01:17.270> other<00:01:17.450> than<00:01:17.659> that<00:01:17.750> this<00:01:18.080> car

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
has to stay but other than that this car

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.410 
has to stay but other than that this car
is<00:01:18.380> honestly<00:01:19.070> identical<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:19.940> movie<00:01:20.270> it

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
is honestly identical to the movie it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.120 
is honestly identical to the movie it
even<00:01:20.630> has<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.900> blower<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.320> everything<00:01:21.920> so

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.400 
back but don't see how this car actually
can<00:01:40.220> boost<00:01:40.460> anything<00:01:40.940> I<00:01:41.210> mean<00:01:41.420> as<00:01:41.870> you<00:01:42.050> can<00:01:42.110> see

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
can boost anything I mean as you can see

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.350 
can boost anything I mean as you can see
by<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.650> gentleman<00:01:43.160> saw<00:01:43.280> happen<00:01:43.640> that's<00:01:44.150> are

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
like went off the throttle because a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.570 
like went off the throttle because a
suspension<00:01:47.480> is<00:01:47.960> not<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.440> great<00:01:48.830> I<00:01:49.160> have<00:01:49.430> to

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.610 
suspension is not that great I have to
upgrade<00:01:49.760> it<00:01:50.150> a<00:01:50.240> little<00:01:50.480> bit<00:01:50.690> so<00:01:51.200> every<00:01:51.440> time

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
upgrade it a little bit so every time

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.410 
upgrade it a little bit so every time
I'm<00:01:51.800> landing<00:01:52.370> this<00:01:52.460> thing<00:01:52.580> feels<00:01:53.120> like<00:01:53.270> it's

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420

this<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.340> probably<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.730> best<00:02:31.970> deal<00:02:32.270> game<00:02:32.480> any

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810
