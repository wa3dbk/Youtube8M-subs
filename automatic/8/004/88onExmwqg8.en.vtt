oh yeah last night at the hotel actually
I<00:00:47.240> think<00:00:47.360> it's<00:00:47.510> quite<00:00:47.870> normal<00:00:48.050> year<00:00:48.380> but<00:00:48.530> they

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
I think it's quite normal year but they

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.790 
I think it's quite normal year but they
had<00:00:48.740> a<00:00:48.770> only<00:00:49.730> double<00:00:50.030> beds<00:00:50.210> for<00:00:50.390> everyone<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:51.290> I

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
had a only double beds for everyone so I

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.150 
had a only double beds for everyone so I
think<00:00:52.670> Josh<00:00:52.970> Jonesy<00:00:53.600> he<00:00:54.350> shared<00:00:54.650> with<00:00:54.710> Wilson

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160

think Josh Jonesy he shared with Wilson
and<00:00:56.170> Pete<00:00:57.170> shared<00:00:57.980> with<00:00:58.250> Alby<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.330> me<00:00:59.660> and

an ambulance coming or crossing or

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.890 
an ambulance coming or crossing or
something<00:02:57.940> like<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.090> because<00:02:58.359> you<00:02:58.510> can't

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900
