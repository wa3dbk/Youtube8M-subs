00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.990

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.220

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.080
 discovering for a video today is a 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.050
 step by step of a box that I did there 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.989
 long time andrÃ© not of this box love 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.690
 It's a son, actually go to him. 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.710
 Christmas 2005 was our first Christmas 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.750
 together and this box and uses until today is 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.469
 You see, she looked so good and there 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:51.699
 It was made and he keeps everything to himself. 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.879
 it in here lot of thing that I already 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.370
 I gave it to him 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.449
 Good. What are you going to need to do? 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.579
 this box 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.600
 first you'll buy an ink 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.640
 black 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.149
 if the box does not go black because I 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.119
 I bought this box it's all black then 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:13.270
 You do not have to face the lid only 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:16.619
 You can see here the detail of the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.599
 other one here is the cover print 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.849
 she invented and covered with that role 

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:23.080
 so what I did bought an ink 

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:26.890
 black 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:30.039
 even wash and went on Porpoise Caps 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.539
 rest of the box you can see it here is 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.840
 everything ready 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.250
 so she was already black did not help me 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.390

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:45.929

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:59.410
 if it were small negative negatives 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:03.489
 Colorful I did in the old these little squares 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.220

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:08.489

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.780

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.140
 sticker to get easier then 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:26.239
