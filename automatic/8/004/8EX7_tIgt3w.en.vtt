focused on in that video is essentially
good<00:00:30.090> solo<00:00:30.779> tactics<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.650> getting<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.189> nuclear

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
good solo tactics to getting a nuclear

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.000 
good solo tactics to getting a nuclear
killer<00:00:33.059> basically<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.200> killer<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.920> are

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
some good killstreaks to run what are

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.569 
some good killstreaks to run what are
the<00:00:36.690> best<00:00:36.840> guns<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.320> run<00:00:37.500> maps<00:00:37.950> all<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.370> kind

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the best guns to run maps all that kind

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.200 
the best guns to run maps all that kind
of<00:00:38.640> stuff<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.090> I've<00:00:39.180> gotta<00:00:39.510> love<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:41.210> some

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
of stuff and I've gotta love it but some

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.910 
of stuff and I've gotta love it but some
of<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.450> might<00:00:42.660> not<00:00:42.780> always<00:00:42.960> run<00:00:43.200> solo<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.739> mean

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
of you might not always run solo I mean

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.459 
of you might not always run solo I mean
I<00:00:43.950> generally<00:00:44.700> do<00:00:44.910> I've<00:00:45.870> been<00:00:45.989> playing<00:00:46.230> more

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
I generally do I've been playing more

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.319 
I generally do I've been playing more
with<00:00:46.500> parties<00:00:47.010> now<00:00:47.190> than<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.640> really<00:00:48.210> ever

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
with parties now than I have really ever

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.319 
with parties now than I have really ever
before<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:49.020> I'm<00:00:49.950> more<00:00:50.430> often<00:00:50.760> than<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:50.940> again

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
before but I'm more often than not again

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.729 
before but I'm more often than not again
when<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:51.780> play<00:00:51.899> by<00:00:52.050> my<00:00:52.199> stuff<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.590> that's

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
when I just play by my stuff and that's

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.590 
when I just play by my stuff and that's
that's<00:00:53.039> how<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> rolls<00:00:53.460> that's<00:00:54.329> how<00:00:54.480> i<00:00:54.510> roll

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
that's how it rolls that's how i roll

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.580 
that's how it rolls that's how i roll
rather<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:56.329> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.510> basically<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.170> different

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
rather but this is basically a different

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.099 
rather but this is basically a different
approach<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.699> clearly<00:01:00.149> very

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
approach to it and it's clearly very

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.429 
approach to it and it's clearly very
effective<00:01:01.940> this<00:01:02.940> works<00:01:03.239> only<00:01:03.840> with<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.229> full

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
effective this works only with a full

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.070 
effective this works only with a full
party<00:01:04.799> or<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.909> you're<00:01:06.030> lucky<00:01:06.180> maybe<00:01:06.570> five<00:01:07.049> or

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
party or if you're lucky maybe five or

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.530 
party or if you're lucky maybe five or
four<00:01:07.530> depends<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.549> your<00:01:08.640> random<00:01:09.060> surely<00:01:09.390> but

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
four depends on your random surely but

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.030 
four depends on your random surely but
you<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:09.810> want<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.020> depend<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.409> random<00:01:10.799> so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
you don't want to depend on random so

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.859 
you don't want to depend on random so
generally<00:01:11.430> speaking<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> six<00:01:12.450> party

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
generally speaking this is a six party

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.109 
generally speaking this is a six party
or<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.979> want<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> ground<00:01:14.549> war<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:14.909> it's

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
or if you want to ground war but it's

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.289 
or if you want to ground war but it's
not<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.810> easy<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.140> ground<00:01:16.380> war<00:01:16.560> uh<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:18.150> you

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
not as easy in ground war uh and if you

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.920 
not as easy in ground war uh and if you
run<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> full<00:01:18.659> party<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.530> play<00:01:19.770> demolition

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
run a full party and you play demolition

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.960 
run a full party and you play demolition
that's<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.439> how<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.920> gonna<00:01:23.040> go<00:01:23.159> and

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
think successful mentioned that three or

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.680 
think successful mentioned that three or
four<00:03:25.980> people<00:03:26.400> were<00:03:26.820> able<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.090> pick<00:03:27.240> up<00:03:27.330> nuclear

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
four people were able to pick up nuclear

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.600 
four people were able to pick up nuclear
in<00:03:27.990> this<00:03:28.170> game<00:03:28.380> was<00:03:28.530> alone<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:29.160> then<00:03:29.490> they

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
in this game was alone and then they

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.250 
in this game was alone and then they
were<00:03:29.670> able<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.910> do<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.180> again<00:03:30.450> on<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.720> same<00:03:30.960> map

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
were able to do it again on the same map

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.700 
were able to do it again on the same map
so<00:03:32.870> assuming<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.020> you<00:03:34.140> are<00:03:34.170> running<00:03:34.560> the

so assuming that you are running the

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.990 
so assuming that you are running the
right<00:03:34.830> killstreaks<00:03:35.370> you're<00:03:35.550> all<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.880> only

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
right killstreaks you're all and only

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.370 
right killstreaks you're all and only
running<00:03:36.330> your<00:03:36.480> favorite<00:03:36.720> guns<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.110> you're

running your favorite guns and you're

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.870 
running your favorite guns and you're
playing<00:03:37.500> demolition<00:03:38.160> there's<00:03:38.670> only<00:03:38.760> one

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
playing demolition there's only one

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.280 
playing demolition there's only one
other<00:03:39.060> thing<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.480> have<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.600> keep<00:03:39.780> in<00:03:39.930> mind<00:03:40.110> and

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
other thing you have to keep in mind and

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.240 
other thing you have to keep in mind and
that<00:03:40.350> is<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:41.010> map<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.580> was<00:03:42.570> told<00:03:42.720> by<00:03:42.900> him<00:03:43.250> success

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
that is a map I was told by him success

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
that is a map I was told by him success
that<00:03:44.810> basically<00:03:46.100> standoff<00:03:47.100> is<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.790> map<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.150> do

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
that basically standoff is the map to do

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.150 
that basically standoff is the map to do
this<00:03:48.390> on<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:49.290> can't<00:03:49.470> really<00:03:49.590> go<00:03:49.770> wrong<00:03:49.800> with

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
this on you can't really go wrong with

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
this on you can't really go wrong with
standoff<00:03:50.580> it's<00:03:50.850> got<00:03:51.030> very<00:03:51.690> very<00:03:52.320> powerful

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
standoff it's got very very powerful

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.970 
standoff it's got very very powerful
spawn<00:03:54.180> traps<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:55.140> can<00:03:55.290> see<00:03:55.440> here<00:03:55.710> I<00:03:55.740> picked

spawn traps you can see here I picked

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.340 
spawn traps you can see here I picked
this<00:03:56.070> clip<00:03:56.400> from<00:03:56.430> from<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.300> gameplay<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:58.140> just

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
this clip from from the gameplay it just

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.050 
this clip from from the gameplay it just
goes<00:03:58.470> on<00:03:58.590> an<00:03:58.710> absolute<00:03:59.370> tear<00:03:59.670> on<00:03:59.850> the<00:03:59.940> enemy

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
goes on an absolute tear on the enemy

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.930 
goes on an absolute tear on the enemy
team<00:04:00.440> non-stop<00:04:01.440> kills<00:04:01.770> constantly<00:04:02.460> going<00:04:02.700> and

going<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.240> going<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:03.720> it's<00:04:04.650> it's<00:04:05.100> just

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
going and going and it's it's just

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.540 
going and going and it's it's just
amazing<00:04:06.180> how<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.560> spawn<00:04:08.010> trap<00:04:08.220> works<00:04:08.400> in

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
amazing how the spawn trap works in

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.660 
amazing how the spawn trap works in
demolition<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.210> the<00:04:09.270> spawns<00:04:09.540> rarely<00:04:10.050> flip

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
demolition and the spawns rarely flip

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.560 
demolition and the spawns rarely flip
obviously<00:04:11.670> if<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:11.790> push<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.060> way<00:04:12.210> too<00:04:12.270> far

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
obviously if you push in way too far

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.180 
obviously if you push in way too far
they<00:04:12.750> will<00:04:12.960> eventually<00:04:13.110> flip<00:04:13.680> but<00:04:13.860> this<00:04:14.040> is

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
they will eventually flip but this is

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.840 
they will eventually flip but this is
something<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.520> can<00:04:14.670> explain<00:04:15.090> uh<00:04:16.460> he<00:04:17.460> told<00:04:17.730> me

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
something you can explain uh he told me

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.160 
something you can explain uh he told me
it<00:04:17.970> doesn't<00:04:18.299> work<00:04:18.390> as<00:04:18.510> well<00:04:18.540> in<00:04:18.720> other<00:04:18.870> maps

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
it doesn't work as well in other maps

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.530 
it doesn't work as well in other maps
but<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.770> actually<00:04:20.010> know<00:04:20.460> that<00:04:20.760> there<00:04:21.120> are<00:04:21.150> some

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
but I actually know that there are some

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.650 
but I actually know that there are some
it<00:04:21.900> would<00:04:22.020> work<00:04:22.140> very<00:04:22.200> well<00:04:22.650> on<00:04:23.660> specifically

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
it would work very well on specifically

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.510 
it would work very well on specifically
and<00:04:24.960> that<00:04:25.080> like<00:04:25.260> hijacked<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:26.010> worked<00:04:26.310> well<00:04:26.490> on

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
and that like hijacked it worked well on

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.970 
and that like hijacked it worked well on
the<00:04:26.760> demolition<00:04:27.300> there's<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.380> couple<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.830> other

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
the demolition there's a couple of other

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.130 
the demolition there's a couple of other
maps<00:04:29.190> that<00:04:29.370> work<00:04:29.700> for<00:04:29.910> as<00:04:30.030> well<00:04:30.300> but<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.990> most

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
maps that work for as well but the most

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.470 
maps that work for as well but the most
part<00:04:31.350> is<00:04:31.440> as<00:04:31.650> long<00:04:31.770> as<00:04:31.920> you<00:04:31.980> get<00:04:32.130> like<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.400> map<00:04:33.300> of

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
part is as long as you get like a map of

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.170 
part is as long as you get like a map of
the<00:04:33.570> pretty<00:04:33.900> much<00:04:34.080> set<00:04:34.350> in<00:04:34.470> stone<00:04:34.710> spot<00:04:35.180> you're

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.480 
gave in my other video about going solo
and<00:05:03.450> then<00:05:03.770> just<00:05:04.770> expanding<00:05:05.310> that<00:05:05.430> to

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
and then just expanding that to

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.840 
and then just expanding that to
basically<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.150> full<00:05:06.330> team<00:05:07.310> using<00:05:08.310> entirely

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
basically a full team using entirely

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.390 
basically a full team using entirely
supported<00:05:09.720> killstreak<00:05:10.200> suit<00:05:10.470> there's<00:05:11.370> a

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
supported killstreak suit there's a

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.890 
supported killstreak suit there's a
couple<00:05:11.490> of<00:05:11.670> good<00:05:11.820> ways<00:05:11.940> to<00:05:12.000> do<00:05:12.360> it<00:05:12.510> obviously

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
couple of good ways to do it obviously

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.960 
couple of good ways to do it obviously
this<00:05:13.050> one<00:05:13.230> is<00:05:13.350> better<00:05:13.560> but<00:05:13.920> if<00:05:14.220> not<00:05:14.580> you<00:05:14.760> can<00:05:14.850> go

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
this one is better but if not you can go

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.340 
this one is better but if not you can go
check<00:05:15.180> out<00:05:15.300> my<00:05:15.390> other<00:05:15.510> video<00:05:15.810> and<00:05:16.080> see<00:05:16.230> what

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350

check out my other video and see what
you<00:05:16.410> think<00:05:16.440> it<00:05:16.770> should<00:05:16.950> be<00:05:16.980> in<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.250> bottom

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
you think it should be in the bottom

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.800 
you think it should be in the bottom
corner<00:05:17.520> if<00:05:17.880> you<00:05:17.970> haven't<00:05:18.210> already<00:05:18.240> exited<00:05:18.630> out

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
corner if you haven't already exited out

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.960 
corner if you haven't already exited out
which<00:05:19.800> I<00:05:19.920> wouldn't<00:05:20.130> blame<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.400> for<00:05:20.550> doing<00:05:20.640> but

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
which I wouldn't blame you for doing but

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.920 
which I wouldn't blame you for doing but
anyway<00:05:21.270> you<00:05:21.330> could<00:05:21.480> take<00:05:21.600> a<00:05:21.630> look<00:05:21.810> at<00:05:21.870> the
