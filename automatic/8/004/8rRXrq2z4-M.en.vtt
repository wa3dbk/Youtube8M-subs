00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 of the earth with the sole help of gravity 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.430
 it is possible to reach a speed of 5 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.839
 one kilometers per hour 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:12.139
 but that's nothing compared to the speed that the animal reaches 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.139
 ranks second on our list 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:19.419
 The peregrine falcon 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.199
 this animal will be thrown minced 322 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.199
 1 meter per hour which makes it the fastest in the air 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.699
 cross 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.480
 most of the paratroopers if to the idea of ​​what was the speed of a 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.130
 hawk 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.210
 after all a lower speed means that they can open the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.570
 Parachute does not lose the shoulders as a result of the impact 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.780
 but some are looking for something more exciting 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.280
 welcome to the sport of speed launches 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.589
 competitors wear special suits to reduce wind resistance 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.929
 they throw themselves with their heads down so they fall as fast as 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.940
 of course the hardest part is slowing down enough to 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.940
 to open the parachute 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.760
 but the peregrine falcons will not leave until they hit something 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.390
 mockus 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.330
 two collisions of them are devastating for everyone who is in 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
 the air 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.380
 I said sometimes they are not a good combination 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.660
 In the United States alone, the collisions with birds that live in the 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.330
 Airlines 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
 hundred million dollars a year 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.490
 It is understandable that all measures are taken to reduce this problem 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.780
 commercial airports and air force bases 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.270
 they hired someone very special to patrol the airspace 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.610
 I present them, we act 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.159
 it's not the pilot 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.159
 is the ground crew of an airplane is ordinary 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.069
 The peregrine falcon 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.239
 with a python brian no-fly zones in the vicinity of the 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.239
 airports 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:37.129
 I'll play to is to clear the area of ​​birds that can cause accidents 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.249
 but it came from is a murderer 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.249
 is trained to attack ton 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:49.149
 we attract alarcón 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:52.819
 Let's see that Zelaya is the image of a city that we inhabit Carmen 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.759
 the advice so that several times about that 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.949
 to see it 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:01.729
 the session its five-year partners contains DNA and is marrying 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.949
 so it moves further 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.949
 sos 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:24.069
 That's right after the door for the local birds to head towards another 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.069
 county 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.949
 man was Moroccan origin 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.469
 it does not fulfill its task perfectly 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.779
 but even he can not compete with the animal that holds the first place in 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:56.779
 our list 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.670
 we can find the fastest animal almost anywhere on the planet 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.999
 may be the fastest of the animals that backed out 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:24.389
 but it can not escape that they inscribe the entomologist of the zoo of san luis 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.750
 the beetle stuttgart and so without guide or tigris beetle a rocket in 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.730
 miniature that fastest insect on the planet and surely one of the most 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.849
 fierce 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.809
 maybe the tiger beetle bears his name this predatory activity there is 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:44.710
 adult animals that catch their prey as the sentry that is adopted 

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:47.709
 the same position as tigers zárate 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.569
 but it is also that the tigers uses its incredible sight to detect 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.729
 your prices 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.860
 then he took full advantage of his speed to get it out 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.740
 because they are fast the civil beetle 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.449
 fair 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.280
 if we place a tiger beetle on a race track it advances the same 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:34.699
 speed that a person walking fast the actress 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:40.489
 good 8 kilometers per hour does not sound very impressive I wanted to imagine that 

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:43.809
 had the same size as a person 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:48.080
 it would only take him half a second to win the 100 meters flat race with 

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:51.079
 a big cut in a nightclub 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.539
 to equal a beetle you have to advance more than 497 kilometers per hour 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:12.720
 but the fastest runner on the planet also has its problems 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.960
 the tiger beetles run so fast that they become blind 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.069
 if we observe a tiger beetle while home 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.069
 if we want them to run and stop 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:34.460
 his huge eyes work well when the tether beetle taquito but a 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.069
 Once it starts to run 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:39.830
 and can not process information quickly enough to see what the 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.029
 surrounds 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:43.999
 ap 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:46.999
 the tigers beetle the number one runner on the planet 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:50.529
 because its speed exceeds even its organism 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:57.210
 the life of the tigers beetle must be very strange 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:01.599
 when it's still, it looks perfectly 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.399
 but when he runs 

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:13.399
 have to stop to see again 

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:21.269
 once it detects its target it is thrown but the eyes can not keep up 

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:25.599
 if there is something that can be stopped 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:26.589
 search 

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:29.589
 and move forward again 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.610
 it is a form of home and extraordinary 

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:39.199
 but when you have the speed of the tiger beetle you have to resort to 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.869
 extraordinary solutions 

00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:45.210
 it is understandable that this is the number one sprinter on our list 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.509
 after all when speed is about 

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:51.740
 the tiger beetle is truly extraordinary 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.290
 This can 

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:54.890
 animal planet alex
