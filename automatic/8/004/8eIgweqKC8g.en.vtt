the morning time on an empty stomach
the<00:00:47.450> reason<00:00:47.810> why<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.320> when<00:00:48.980> you're<00:00:49.130> an<00:00:49.220> empty

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
stomach you don't have any sugars you

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.540 
stomach you don't have any sugars you
don't<00:00:51.290> have<00:00:51.380> anything<00:00:51.740> in<00:00:51.980> your<00:00:52.010> stomach<00:00:52.430> to

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
don't have anything in your stomach to

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.150 
don't have anything in your stomach to
burn<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:53.390> when<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:53.810> do<00:00:53.990> cardio<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.740> low

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
burn so when you do cardio on a low

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.910 
burn so when you do cardio on a low
intensity<00:00:55.640> scale<00:00:55.840> your<00:00:56.840> body<00:00:57.110> has<00:00:57.410> time<00:00:57.650> to<00:00:57.800> go

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
intensity scale your body has time to go

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.530 
intensity scale your body has time to go
ahead<00:00:58.130> and<00:00:58.220> break<00:00:58.400> down<00:00:58.579> your<00:00:58.760> body<00:00:58.940> fat<00:00:59.240> and

ahead and break down your body fat and
use<00:00:59.750> that<00:00:59.930> energy<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:00.560> that's<00:01:00.829> what<00:01:01.010> it's

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
use that energy and that's what it's

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.490 
use that energy and that's what it's
going<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:01.280> do<00:01:01.460> now<00:01:02.240> here's<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.900> key<00:01:03.079> here's<00:01:03.440> a

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
key point to this make sure because I

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.810 
key point to this make sure because I
made<00:01:05.600> this<00:01:05.720> mistake<00:01:05.930> before<00:01:06.610> when<00:01:07.610> you're

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
made this mistake before when you're

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.310 
made this mistake before when you're
when<00:01:08.120> you're<00:01:08.240> doing<00:01:08.270> cardio<00:01:08.600> on<00:01:08.930> an<00:01:09.080> empty

when you're doing cardio on an empty

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.930 
when you're doing cardio on an empty
stomach<00:01:09.560> make<00:01:10.070> sure<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:10.550> keep<00:01:10.760> the

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
stomach make sure that you keep the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.630 
stomach make sure that you keep the
intensity<00:01:11.360> really<00:01:11.720> low<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:12.830> I'm<00:01:13.159> going<00:01:13.430> I'm

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
intensity really low so I'm going I'm

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.280 
intensity really low so I'm going I'm
going<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.940> little<00:01:14.090> slower<00:01:14.510> than<00:01:14.720> usual<00:01:15.110> I

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
going a little slower than usual I

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.170 
going a little slower than usual I
usually<00:01:15.620> go<00:01:15.770> with<00:01:15.800> like<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.130> brisk<00:01:16.490> walk<00:01:16.880> to

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
usually go with like a brisk walk to

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.090 
usually go with like a brisk walk to
maybe<00:01:17.390> about<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.659> power<00:01:17.930> walk<00:01:18.200> but<00:01:18.890> that's

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
maybe about a power walk but that's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.430 
maybe about a power walk but that's
about<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:20.450> really<00:01:20.630> depends<00:01:21.020> on<00:01:21.200> your

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
about it and it really depends on your

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.590 
about it and it really depends on your
cardiovascular<00:01:22.100> level<00:01:22.550> you<00:01:23.150> want<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.450> make

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
cardiovascular level you want to make

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.149 
cardiovascular level you want to make
sure<00:01:23.810> that<00:01:23.960> when<00:01:24.170> you're<00:01:24.350> doing<00:01:24.620> your<00:01:24.650> walking

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
sure that when you're doing your walking

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.890 
sure that when you're doing your walking
or<00:01:25.400> when<00:01:25.729> you're<00:01:25.850> doing<00:01:26.090> your<00:01:26.240> morning<00:01:26.540> cardio

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
or when you're doing your morning cardio

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.110 
or when you're doing your morning cardio
you<00:01:27.380> got<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.680> make<00:01:27.830> sure<00:01:28.070> that<00:01:28.370> your<00:01:28.580> breath

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
you got to make sure that your breath

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.820 
you got to make sure that your breath
that<00:01:29.330> you're<00:01:29.479> taking<00:01:29.840> we<00:01:30.290> got<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.590> make<00:01:30.680> sure

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
that you're taking we got to make sure

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.190 
that you're taking we got to make sure
the<00:01:30.920> heart<00:01:31.250> rate<00:01:31.400> is<00:01:31.549> low<00:01:31.729> enough<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:33.049> way

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
the heart rate is low enough so the way

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.660 
the heart rate is low enough so the way
you<00:01:33.260> can<00:01:33.470> gauge<00:01:33.680> that<00:01:33.950> without<00:01:34.280> actually

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
you can gauge that without actually

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.910 
you can gauge that without actually
having<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:35.090> get<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.299> heart<00:01:35.600> rate<00:01:35.720> monitor<00:01:35.960> or

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
having to get a heart rate monitor or

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.800 
having to get a heart rate monitor or
one<00:01:37.220> of<00:01:37.310> those<00:01:37.490> watches<00:01:37.820> or<00:01:38.270> stuff<00:01:38.420> like<00:01:38.479> that

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
one of those watches or stuff like that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.110 
one of those watches or stuff like that
is<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.620> go<00:01:39.770> ahead<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.250> gauge<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.610> way<00:01:40.970> you're

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
is to go ahead and gauge the way you're

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.760 
is to go ahead and gauge the way you're
breathing<00:01:41.330> like<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.049> see<00:01:42.229> how<00:01:42.380> I'm<00:01:42.500> able<00:01:42.590> to

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
breathing like you see how I'm able to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.649 
breathing like you see how I'm able to
talk<00:01:42.979> right<00:01:43.250> now<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.729> walk<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.360> can<00:01:44.510> talk

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
talk right now and walk and I can talk

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.780 
talk right now and walk and I can talk
all<00:01:44.840> day<00:01:44.900> like<00:01:45.229> this<00:01:45.470> but<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.400> moment<00:01:46.760> that

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
all day like this but the moment that

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.580 
all day like this but the moment that
your<00:01:47.030> cardio<00:01:47.390> becomes<00:01:47.720> too<00:01:47.930> intense<00:01:48.320> and

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
your cardio becomes too intense and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.840 
your cardio becomes too intense and
you're<00:01:48.710> not<00:01:48.860> able<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.310> carry<00:01:49.549> on<00:01:49.729> the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
you're not able to carry on the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.760 
you're not able to carry on the
conversation<00:01:50.200> that's<00:01:51.200> when<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:51.560> know<00:01:51.710> you

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
conversation that's when you know you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.710 
conversation that's when you know you
got<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.100> Taylor<00:01:52.520> down<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.240> get<00:01:53.390> your<00:01:53.570> heart

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
got a Taylor down and get your heart

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.539 
got a Taylor down and get your heart
rate<00:01:53.900> back<00:01:53.930> down<00:01:54.110> because<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:54.979> moment<00:01:55.430> your

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
rate back down because a moment your

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.760 
rate back down because a moment your
heart<00:01:55.760> rate<00:01:55.909> gets<00:01:56.150> too<00:01:56.390> high<00:01:56.600> your<00:01:57.500> body

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
heart rate gets too high your body

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.890 
heart rate gets too high your body
doesn't<00:01:58.189> have<00:01:58.369> a<00:01:58.549> chance<00:01:58.939> to<00:01:59.210> break<00:01:59.420> down<00:01:59.600> body

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
doesn't have a chance to break down body

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.840 
doesn't have a chance to break down body
fat<00:02:00.170> anymore<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:01.040> wants<00:02:01.400> to<00:02:01.490> go<00:02:01.610> ahead<00:02:01.670> and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
fat anymore it wants to go ahead and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.460 
fat anymore it wants to go ahead and
break<00:02:02.060> down<00:02:02.210> something<00:02:02.540> that's<00:02:02.810> easier<00:02:03.200> break

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
break down something that's easier break

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.929 
break down something that's easier break
down<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:03.979> it's<00:02:04.130> going<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.310> break<00:02:04.490> down<00:02:04.520> either

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
down and it's going to break down either

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.080 
down and it's going to break down either
sugars<00:02:05.479> or<00:02:05.720> muscle<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:07.460> because<00:02:07.729> your<00:02:07.909> body

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
sugars or muscle and because your body

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.279 
sugars or muscle and because your body
doesn't<00:02:08.149> have<00:02:08.390> any<00:02:08.599> sugar<00:02:08.810> because<00:02:09.140> it's

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
doesn't have any sugar because it's

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.140 
doesn't have any sugar because it's
early<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.649> morning<00:02:09.729> your<00:02:10.729> bodies<00:02:11.000> can

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
early in the morning your bodies can

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.790 
early in the morning your bodies can
break<00:02:11.450> down<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.780> next<00:02:12.020> easiest<00:02:12.200> thing<00:02:12.620> which

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
break down the next easiest thing which

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.320 
break down the next easiest thing which
is<00:02:12.950> most

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
is most

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.300 
is most
so<00:02:14.020> keep<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.410> mind<00:02:14.620> when<00:02:14.920> you're<00:02:15.010> doing<00:02:15.250> this

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
so keep in mind when you're doing this

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.890 
so keep in mind when you're doing this
morning<00:02:15.580> cardio<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:16.270> got<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.630> keep<00:02:16.750> the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
morning cardio you got to keep the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.960 
morning cardio you got to keep the
intensity<00:02:17.410> really<00:02:17.650> low<00:02:17.950> I'll<00:02:18.670> suggest

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
intensity really low I'll suggest

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.850 
intensity really low I'll suggest
starting<00:02:19.570> off<00:02:19.720> maybe<00:02:20.050> about<00:02:20.290> three<00:02:20.500> times<00:02:20.740> a

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
starting off maybe about three times a

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.520 
starting off maybe about three times a
week<00:02:20.890> at<00:02:21.580> about<00:02:21.880> 10<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.270> 15<00:02:22.600> minutes<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.410> they

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
week at about 10 to 15 minutes and they

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.720 
week at about 10 to 15 minutes and they
kind<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.740> build<00:02:23.950> up<00:02:24.130> from<00:02:24.220> there

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
kind of build up from there

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.000 
kind of build up from there
currently<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.510> go<00:02:25.840> maybe<00:02:26.080> about<00:02:26.380> 4<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.830> 5<00:02:26.980> times

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
currently I go maybe about 4 to 5 times

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.670 
currently I go maybe about 4 to 5 times
a<00:02:27.400> week<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:28.150> about<00:02:28.300> 20<00:02:29.020> minutes<00:02:29.350> in<00:02:29.590> the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
a week and about 20 minutes in the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.170 
a week and about 20 minutes in the
morning<00:02:29.980> just<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.400> brisk<00:02:30.640> walk

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
morning just a brisk walk

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.570 
morning just a brisk walk
not<00:02:31.630> too<00:02:31.780> much<00:02:31.930> think<00:02:32.290> about<00:02:32.560> doing<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.400> walk

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
not too much think about doing the walk

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.790 
not too much think about doing the walk
throw<00:02:33.910> my<00:02:34.030> headphones<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.630> just<00:02:34.690> go<00:02:34.960> so<00:02:35.620> this

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
throw my headphones and just go so this

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.450 
throw my headphones and just go so this
is<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.920> really<00:02:36.220> great<00:02:36.580> way<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:37.780> easily

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
is a really great way to just easily

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.870 
is a really great way to just easily
easily<00:02:40.200> burn<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.500> up<00:02:42.100> without<00:02:42.250> having<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.700> do

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
easily burn that up without having to do

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.730 
easily burn that up without having to do
much<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.780> pretty<00:02:44.110> much<00:02:44.230> one<00:02:44.350> of<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.470> easiest

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
much so pretty much one of the easiest

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.250 
much so pretty much one of the easiest
ways<00:02:45.040> besides<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.540> morning<00:02:46.870> time<00:02:47.020> on<00:02:47.140> an

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
ways besides the morning time on an

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.090 
ways besides the morning time on an
empty<00:02:47.500> stomach

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
empty stomach

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.190 
empty stomach
if<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.490> walk<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:49.450> keep<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.780> intensity

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
if you walk and just keep the intensity

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.840 
if you walk and just keep the intensity
really<00:02:50.320> low<00:02:50.590> like<00:02:50.800> this<00:02:50.830> any<00:02:51.220> other<00:02:51.550> time

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
really low like this any other time

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.700 
really low like this any other time
throughout<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.240> day<00:02:52.450> it's<00:02:52.750> not<00:02:53.470> going<00:02:53.650> to

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
throughout the day it's not going to

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.290 
throughout the day it's not going to
work<00:02:53.860> really<00:02:54.040> well<00:02:54.160> for<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.670> because

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
work really well for you because

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.030 
work really well for you because
intensity<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:55.990> just<00:02:56.200> too<00:02:56.350> low<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:56.890> got

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
intensity is just too low and you got

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.980 
intensity is just too low and you got
sugars<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:57.580> your<00:02:57.610> stomach<00:02:58.030> for<00:02:58.540> your<00:02:58.660> body<00:02:58.840> to

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
sugars in your stomach for your body to

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.570 
sugars in your stomach for your body to
burn<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.530> it's<00:02:59.650> not<00:02:59.770> going<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.040> burn<00:03:00.130> any<00:03:00.370> fat

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
burn so it's not going to burn any fat

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.790 
burn so it's not going to burn any fat
but<00:03:01.210> in<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.450> morning<00:03:01.750> time<00:03:01.930> on<00:03:02.170> empty<00:03:02.410> stomach

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
but in the morning time on empty stomach

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.090 
but in the morning time on empty stomach
this<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.820> perfect<00:03:04.030> time<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.470> hope<00:03:05.890> this

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
this is the perfect time so I hope this
