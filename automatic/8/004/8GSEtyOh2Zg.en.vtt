assemble two black triangles and one
yellow<00:00:32.349> girll<00:00:32.619> triangle<00:00:33.250> like<00:00:33.489> this<00:00:40.590> make

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
yellow girll triangle like this make

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.070 
yellow girll triangle like this make
sixteen<00:00:42.190> of<00:00:42.370> these<00:00:42.640> then<00:00:43.510> connect<00:00:43.960> them

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
sixteen of these then connect them

00:00:44.080 --> 00:01:15.560 
sixteen of these then connect them
together<00:00:44.320> like<00:00:44.739> this<00:01:08.610> then<00:01:09.610> close<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.149> circle

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:46.120 

now<00:01:16.570> add<00:01:16.930> 2<00:01:17.649> more<00:01:17.890> rows<00:01:18.220> of<00:01:18.580> of<00:01:18.820> black

now<00:01:47.130> squeeze<00:01:47.580> it<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.420> give<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.750> cup<00:01:48.960> shape

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.070 

like<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.800> and<00:01:53.840> here's<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> body<00:01:56.540> now<00:01:57.540> make

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
like this and here's the body now make

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.140 
like this and here's the body now make
an<00:01:58.380> inverted<00:01:59.010> row<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.660> normal<00:02:01.140> this

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
an inverted row so this is normal this

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:38.700 
an inverted row so this is normal this
is<00:02:03.150> inverted<00:02:04.340> with<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.370> round<00:02:05.729> side<00:02:06.229> inwards

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710
