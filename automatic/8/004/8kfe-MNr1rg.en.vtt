hey you guessed that this video is all
about<00:00:03.470> the<00:00:04.470> humble<00:00:04.920> good<00:00:05.819> old<00:00:06.029> party<00:00:06.779> sparkler

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
about the humble good old party sparkler

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.440 
about the humble good old party sparkler
now

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
now

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.629 
now
wait<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:10.019> see<00:00:10.230> what<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.590> found<00:00:10.620> out<00:00:11.040> about<00:00:11.160> these

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
wait to see what I found out about these

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.730 
wait to see what I found out about these
and<00:00:11.940> critters<00:00:12.179> I've<00:00:12.929> known<00:00:13.170> for<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> long<00:00:13.410> time

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
and critters I've known for a long time

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.279 
and critters I've known for a long time
that<00:00:14.099> not<00:00:14.250> every<00:00:14.490> Sparkle<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.150> same<00:00:15.389> and

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
that not every Sparkle is the same and

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.779 
that not every Sparkle is the same and
that's<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.560> steer<00:00:16.800> clear<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.460> generic

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
that's to steer clear of the generic

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.060 
that's to steer clear of the generic
brands<00:00:18.270> like<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.590> used<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.800> get<00:00:19.949> this

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
brands like this and I used to get this

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.340 
brands like this and I used to get this
brand<00:00:20.279> because<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.060> knew<00:00:21.270> they<00:00:21.449> had<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.660> nice<00:00:21.869> big

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
brand because I knew they had a nice big

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.460 
brand because I knew they had a nice big
fat<00:00:22.560> sparkler<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.570> of<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.750> they<00:00:25.260> had<00:00:25.439> a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
fat sparkler and of that they had a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.859 
fat sparkler and of that they had a
serial<00:00:25.859> number<00:00:25.890> here<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.250> zero<00:00:26.820> nine<00:00:27.539> seven

can't read and this is an art packet I
don't<00:00:50.670> know<00:00:50.730> how<00:00:50.820> long<00:00:50.940> I've<00:00:51.090> had<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.270> for

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
don't know how long I've had this for

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.810 
don't know how long I've had this for
possibly<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.140> couple<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.410> years<00:00:52.739> number<00:00:53.579> ten

eight pieces zero nine seven eight and
again<00:00:56.910> something<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.239> can't<00:00:57.449> read<00:00:57.629> there<00:00:57.870> but

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
again something I can't read there but

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.900 
again something I can't read there but
look<00:00:58.680> at<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.829> sparkles<00:00:59.280> from<00:00:59.370> these<00:00:59.579> packets

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
look at the sparkles from these packets

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.549 
look at the sparkles from these packets
are<00:01:00.059> vastly<00:01:00.690> different

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
are vastly different

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.470 
are vastly different
well<00:01:02.010> here<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.280> two<00:01:02.520> sparkles<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
well here are the two sparkles this is a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.899 
well here are the two sparkles this is a
newer<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.320> I've<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.589> purchased<00:01:04.909> nice

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
newer one that I've just purchased nice

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.730 
newer one that I've just purchased nice
and<00:01:06.119> thin<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and thin as you can see and this is the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.260 
and thin as you can see and this is the
old<00:01:07.920> stock<00:01:08.250> which<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.549> don't<00:01:08.610> know<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> date<00:01:09.090> on

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
old stock which I don't know the date on

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.810 
old stock which I don't know the date on
and<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:10.290> much<00:01:10.650> much<00:01:10.799> fatter<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> effect

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
and it's much much fatter and the effect

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.510 
and it's much much fatter and the effect
for<00:01:12.360> between<00:01:12.689> these<00:01:12.869> two<00:01:13.080> sparklers<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
for between these two sparklers all the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.760 
for between these two sparklers all the
difference<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> effect<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.479> enormous<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
difference of the effect is enormous and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.080 
difference of the effect is enormous and
I<00:01:16.890> only<00:01:17.009> found<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.909> made<00:01:18.060> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
I only found this out because I made a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.940 
I only found this out because I made a
video<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.600> initially<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.140> did<00:01:19.380> some<00:01:19.560> tests

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
video and initially I did some tests

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.700 
video and initially I did some tests
using<00:01:20.490> some<00:01:20.670> old<00:01:20.759> sparklers<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.530> then<00:01:22.530> when<00:01:22.680> I

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
using some old sparklers and then when I

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.350 
using some old sparklers and then when I
went<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.979> buy<00:01:23.130> some<00:01:23.159> new<00:01:23.790> sparklers<00:01:24.270> I

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
went to buy some new sparklers I

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.719 
went to buy some new sparklers I
couldn't<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.110> same<00:01:25.290> effect<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.640> I

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
couldn't get the same effect and then I

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.330 
couldn't get the same effect and then I
realized<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.509> there's<00:01:28.380> been<00:01:28.590> some<00:01:28.860> sort<00:01:29.070> of

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
realized that there's been some sort of

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.580 
realized that there's been some sort of
downsize<00:01:30.030> going<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.320> show<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
downsize going on and if I show you the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.800 
downsize going on and if I show you the
sparkle<00:01:31.829> side-by-side<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:33.240> thin<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.630> is

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
sparkle side-by-side that thin one is

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.969 
sparkle side-by-side that thin one is
the<00:01:33.990> new<00:01:34.140> stock<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.560> I've<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:34.770> purchased

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the new stock that I've just purchased

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.670 
the new stock that I've just purchased
and<00:01:35.420> as<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.600> older<00:01:36.869> stock<00:01:37.110> there<00:01:37.320> which<00:01:37.530> is

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and as the older stock there which is

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.679 
and as the older stock there which is
much<00:01:37.860> much<00:01:38.070> fatter<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.270> introduced

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
much much fatter and if I introduced

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.170 
much much fatter and if I introduced
into<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.110> mix<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.340> sparklers<00:01:41.850> which

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
into this mix one of the sparklers which

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.030 
into this mix one of the sparklers which
