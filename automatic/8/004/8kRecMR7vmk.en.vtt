00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.419
 hello today I'm going to do a kind of 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.679
 potpourri because he is not leaving me the 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:13.310
 time to February 26, 2015 I did not 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.550
 He is leaving time 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.500
 work on what would be now do the 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.230
 transplants then I will take advantage and 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.950
 I'm going to do a little medley of how 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.500
 is 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.390
 some of the seedbeds and the 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.980
 transplants those that are made and the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.980
 that are still to be done, I hope you like it 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.420
 well you can see in this area that I have 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.710
 the seedbeds I'll see if I move a 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.950
 little by little and see where they are like 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.320
 I advise you sometimes to put them under 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.630
 an eave for example there are see the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.990
 protection 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.900
 the cactus apollo also up here 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.170
 missed any corner for 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.640
 place the pots 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.940
 and there you see the seedbed that I made the other 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.460
 francisco's day he had sent me 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.500
 the seeds from cádiz and others 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.380
 seeds that I got to see if there 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.110
 luck and the follower 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.670
 because I am a good case also say 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.770
 that I had not talked to myself that I was going to 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.799
 give away seeds 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.049
 and they are from Jesús Espinoza de Jaén to see 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.920
 Jesus and then say what are these 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:32.700
 why seeds 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.860
 It did not come in your letter and I got confused 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.219
 there you see the method I used to 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.140
 protect some of the seedbeds and if 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.930
 you look there 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.120
 There is already a plantation of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.390
 wild apple trees 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.280
 the first ones that seeds that are already 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.950
 sprouting and now let's go towards the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.840
 area where there are some trees that I am 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.290
 and some transplanted certain by 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.290
 transplant 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.770
 in this area in this area and 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.920
 transplanted the larger ones 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.520
 I always start and now I have to 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.610
 transplant all those 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.160
 set the amount of tree that I 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.440
 is about to transplant the light is are the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.670
 which you are what I would call you ask 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.670
 it is for lack the bonsai 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.120
 in another area in another area I take advantage of 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.760
 go placing 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.810
 and to open a bit of field in the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.910
 where are they 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.280
 the trees without transplanting then 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.770
 then unified them all down in the area 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.530
 that I showed in the other part of the video 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.510
 but while I placed you here, look at 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.130
 You see her from the pines 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.280
 these are pine trees from last year all 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.230
 here there is red pine white pine and pine 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.970
 Japanese black 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.549
 fix the seedlings there you have them 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.129
 transplanted now I tell you days ago 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:03.590
 always believe that I here in the cup a 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.380
 piece of cloth good window next door 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.810
 there you see 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.080
 I planted about 200 seeds and must have 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.120
 some 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.300
 20 or 30 copies is that 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.080
 there are very few 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.080
 they do not usually 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.099
 in doing many and here you have already 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.439
 several varieties here these you see from 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.200
 whiter I run out of stone 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.170
 color the stone of the placed so that we 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.189
 come out a lot of grass but good comes out the same 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.689
 but against that mania that entered me and 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.660
 if you notice this is starting to 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.480
 to sprout 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:48.819
 Well, you are the first you know that it springs 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:51.000
 and these targets are forgiveness are arts to 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.260
 final 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.390
 from last year it 's in seeds and there 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:01.420
 that are not distinguished are doing items 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.560
 and curious that this and recently that what 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:08.230
 I have bought them at the fair I made several 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.690
 this is seen here that look like contrast 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.120
 it is in American cranberry 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.280
 in fixing 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.859
 there I have more 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.040
 already to finish in this medley of 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.620
 videos you remember the seventies and 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.300
 so many elbows because they are beginning to see 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.300
 so chord rose 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.400
 to see how the image looks today because 

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:33.400
 premiere camera 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:41.900
 took the opportunity to make the video 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:45.139
 the buds as they are coming out 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.930
 and some are already more advanced according to 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.310
 the variety are more red or greener 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.639
 notice everyone starting also sing 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.160
 see the trees or the bushes when 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.760
 they sprout now and approach the spring 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.300
 see how cool 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.040
 to like to see 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.409
 he took it out 2 and a sprout 2 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.860
 this is the result 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:11.629
 of work that is well done 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.519
 we can go someday and see the cuttings 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:15.409
 also the video that the heads of 

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:17.689
 carnation and I leave you I hope that I have 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.949
 liked this potpourri does not know how 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:20.249
 the image comes out now that it starts 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:25.210
 to rain 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:29.490
 and I'm going to stop this video this to 26 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.490
