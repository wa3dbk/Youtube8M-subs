00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello so today we find ourselves 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.770
 for a new fishing video at the 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.520
 carp 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.720
 today the temperatures seem 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.970
 to warm up so they'll put 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.950
 the fish activity we can do 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.009
 big priming we're just going to fish with 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.859
 a stick and to wet the stick miz 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.439
 fun fishing amine auspices because I'm going 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.050
 fish with boilies spice bomb 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.410
 fresh from home fun fishing so I 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.060
 obviously took a spicy stick mix and 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.140
 for the wet instead of taking 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.510
 the water I saw that I have no pepy 2.10 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.390
 it's fun fishing I have hot damon 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.850
 at starbucks and in the same tastes 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:45.719
 than the fans so no but well the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.710
 sticks and well next we are we 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.180
 nothing to put a lot because it's 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:58.789
 really concentrated as a liquid 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:58.789
 just what's wet and after 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.680
 she'll put a little bit 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.510
 what if we do not wet the game stick on 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.119
 is going to do the sticks just okay 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.299
 break it's going to break the mouth in the 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.920
 net of little so much wet them then 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.690
 once we mix the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.640
 everything we will be able to take when 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.259
 comes to mix and bake in the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.080
 stic we will not do big tic because 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:52.790
 the cards are not feeding so much 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:57.130
 so once we have it in the tube 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:01.220
 audacity and we will push with the pusher 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:06.950
 and you see it does not overflow on the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:13.540
 sides then there to fix 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:17.260
 we turn to lock the stic 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:25.880
 once we've done that we get out of the rab 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:28.420
 to kill she's not even that stick of 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.420
 equipment 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:46.659
 but she is here that's what we get 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.219
 so here it is we took a 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.349

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:34.900

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.340

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.290
