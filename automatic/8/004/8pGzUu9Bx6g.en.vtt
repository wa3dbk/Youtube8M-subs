00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
game for families to play it's expanded

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.470 
game for families to play it's expanded
creatively<00:04:18.639> as<00:04:18.700> expanded<00:04:19.239> with<00:04:19.389> the

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
creatively as expanded with the

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.930 
creatively as expanded with the
technology<00:04:19.780> so<00:04:20.680> all<00:04:21.010> around<00:04:21.310> it's<00:04:21.519> going<00:04:21.880> to

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
technology so all around it's going to

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.750 
technology so all around it's going to
be<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.120> better<00:04:22.780> stronger<00:04:23.139> game<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:24.340> it's<00:04:24.490> not

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
be a better stronger game and it's not
