00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.110
 today the axis has shown the world its new 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.309
 ipad that represents your round the world 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.110
 of the tablets 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.150
 the result is really good as you 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.080
 We show below in our 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.330
 video 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.610
 the axis has opted for a size 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.720
 unusual but that little by little is gaining 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.570
 ground the gp has 8.3 inches of 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.390
 screen feels perfect in the hand 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.250
 due to the treatment of the materials 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.720
 specifically the back is of 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.780
 aluminum 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.850
 the speakers offer stereo sound 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.040
 in the back we find a 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.980
 camera and a card slot 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.260
 micro SD 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.809
 the device fits great in the hand 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.050
 It's compact and narrow, not really 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.970
 thick and not very heavy if we continue 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.829
 with the screen we discovered that according to the 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.949
 Shaft is the first 8-inch screen 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.870
 with full hd resolution although in 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.440
 reality has a little more concretely 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.740
 in 1920 x 1080 pixels the color is 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.470
 it's pretty good and it looks realistic 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.540
 of an ips LCD panel that offers a 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.530
 Luminous experience as seen when putting 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.119
 the maximum brightness 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.680
 The LG Gepac is equipped with Android 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.400
 4.2.2 combined with the own interface 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.470
 of lg most of the functions of the 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.250
 software of the manufacturer are already known 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.310
 because we could see them on axis 2 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.170
 for example is light side a function of 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.080
 multitasking with which we can have 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.940
 open up to three applications for 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.580
 we close them by sliding three fingers 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.400
 to the left to access them 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.940
 we press this icon and we will find the 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.940
 three applications 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.350
 we have to slide the fingers again 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.820
 and the three applications will appear 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.820
 we can open them by clicking 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.150
 Quick memo is also well known with 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.900
 we make a screenshot and 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.450
 we can take notes on it 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.070
 what knock on we just have to do 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.320
 double click on the screen to 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.880
 get it to turn on or off 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.170
 this function was announced in the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.170
 Presentation of LG 2 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.750
 another new software feature is that it 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.920
 can customize the buttons 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.920
 front of the screen 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.520
 We will find several options for 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.490
 choose with different orders as 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.050
 appreciate here once we choose the 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.940
 our 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.510
 it will automatically appear in the part 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.510
 lower 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.710
 let's talk about the camera 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.570
 located in the back has 5 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.090
 megapixels although as always a 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.130
 camera on a tablet is arguably the one that 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.200
 really want to get good pictures 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.050
 should use a smartphone or a 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.420
 real camera 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.760
 this has been our quick analysis of 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.470
 lg pad that by the way will arrive at the end 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.770
 from this month of September to the market 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.090
 although we still do not know the price 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.090
 when would you pay your tablet perez
