00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.420
 out there 20 years 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.180
 I started super comfortable with a friend who was going 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.250
 to buy a table and invited me to 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.940
 We buy between the two and that did not stop 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.460
 skating and nine years ago I tried the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.460
 skateboarding and pay good that 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.460
 literally 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.840
 skate riding on a board the 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.330
 most delicious sensation there is more to 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.360
 everything more than women more than rumba more 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.190
 what things that many people think is what 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.480
 better more than silver but understand 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.880
 rollerblading 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.750
 is the key to my life and that is why 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.159
 I was passionate and that's where everything 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.580
 that all the environment that has reached me 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.530
 everything all the good that I have been 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.030
 entered to me as a profession as a friend 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.030
 like all good things 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.909
 and there I dedicated myself to record the friends and 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.580
 This became like a little bit of 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.290
 profession and I really like to encourage 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.759
 boost the skaters with a lot of talent 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.400
 from the smallest to the largest 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.979
 the degrees I have the patience there 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.170
 be constantly recording the ones 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.390
 yes and wait for them to do the trick 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.549
 and then the photography and 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.630
 all that environment that is well fine at 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.630
 I think it's very cool 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:14.540
 ha ha ha also making this turn 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:18.830
 but out there in 10 minutes 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.830
 to tell you 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.410
 i 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.630
 if school nations out there nine years and 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.360
 which means particles like patch 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.860
 patch Medellin how to pass good and 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.330
 indicate a bit how is the 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.740
 skateboarding then it's like my 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.060
 school but more than a school is a 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.640
 park then what do we do there 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.560
 have fun having fun in skate for 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.310
 that the peeled ones are motivated and do well 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.190
 things having fun and why not to 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.600
 true professional level then let's go 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.220
 making as a story a little bit of the 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.220
 skateboarding well-aimed 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.819
 and we started with 23 children and already 18 20 30 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.090
 40 about madness after already 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.969
 start somewhere else where it's more 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:01.109
 quiet and good people come out of there 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:03.420
 and good skaters and we already have two or 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.829
 three who are doing good 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.829
 representation at a Latin American level 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.049
 is very Bacano because he has not played very 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.870
 difficult but we have tried to handle it 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.519
 very well and when the force of 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.019
 the industry we will be very 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.030
 prepared for that but I know we're going 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.250
 well we are on the right track 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.990
 the truth I dream that the skaters 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.630
 Colombians have a professional level 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.960
 so high that they can live from that what 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.960
 I dream
