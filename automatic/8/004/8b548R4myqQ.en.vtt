that kind of had a hand in it so

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.650 
that kind of had a hand in it so
obviously<00:00:50.219> 13<00:00:50.610> reasons<00:00:50.879> why<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.090> more<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
obviously 13 reasons why is more of a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.389 
obviously 13 reasons why is more of a
darker<00:00:52.020> contemporary<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.829> does<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.190> trigger

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
darker contemporary it does have trigger

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.430 
darker contemporary it does have trigger
warnings<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.090> depression<00:00:54.629> suicide<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
warnings for depression suicide and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.840 
warnings for depression suicide and
sexual<00:00:55.829> assault<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.610> are<00:00:56.670> not

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
sexual assault so if you are not

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.549 
sexual assault so if you are not
comfortable<00:00:57.090> those<00:00:57.449> topics<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.050> would<00:00:58.410> not

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
comfortable those topics I would not

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.869 
comfortable those topics I would not
recommend<00:00:58.739> reading<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.340> book<00:00:59.640> it

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
recommend reading this book it

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.639 
recommend reading this book it
definitely<00:01:00.180> deals<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.020> very<00:01:01.050> blunt

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
definitely deals with it in a very blunt

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.740 
definitely deals with it in a very blunt
and<00:01:02.059> doesn't<00:01:03.059> really<00:01:03.180> hold<00:01:03.359> anything<00:01:03.600> back

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and doesn't really hold anything back

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.450 
and doesn't really hold anything back
kind<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.309> not

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
kind of way so if you are not

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.530 
kind of way so if you are not
comfortable<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> would

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
comfortable with that that I would

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.969 
comfortable with that that I would
definitely<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:07.110> read<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.500> book<00:01:07.770> but<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
definitely not read this book but I

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.350 
definitely not read this book but I
think<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.580> comfortable<00:01:09.030> those

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
think if you are comfortable those

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.480 
think if you are comfortable those
topics<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:10.409> you're<00:01:10.799> really<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.369> enjoy

topics then you're really going to enjoy

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.330 
topics then you're really going to enjoy
this<00:01:11.790> book<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.150> handles<00:01:12.600> them<00:01:12.840> well<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.590> think<00:01:13.920> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
this book it handles them well I think I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.429 
this book it handles them well I think I
think<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.700> very<00:01:14.850> realistic<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.810> doesn't

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
think it's very realistic and doesn't

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.070 
think it's very realistic and doesn't
glamorize<00:01:17.070> anything<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.909> my<00:01:18.030> opinion<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
glamorize anything in my opinion and it

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.620 
glamorize anything in my opinion and it
is<00:01:19.530> very<00:01:19.740> realistically<00:01:20.250> done<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.450> far<00:01:21.570> as

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
is very realistically done so as far as

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.940 
is very realistically done so as far as
the<00:01:21.810> characters<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> reason<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.710> really

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the characters the reason that I really

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.280 
the characters the reason that I really
like<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> audiobook<00:01:23.820> version<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.600> clay

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
like the audiobook version is that clay

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.080 
like the audiobook version is that clay
is<00:01:25.530> basically<00:01:25.860> responding<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.580> things<00:01:26.880> that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
is basically responding to things that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.050 
is basically responding to things that
she<00:01:27.600> says<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.380> tapes<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.040> she<00:01:29.729> will<00:01:29.909> be

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
she says on the tapes so she will be

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.340 
she says on the tapes so she will be
talking<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.689> they'll<00:01:30.780> almost<00:01:30.900> be<00:01:31.079> having<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
talking and they'll almost be having a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.810 
talking and they'll almost be having a
kind<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.619> conversation<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.670> way<00:01:32.790> even

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
kind of conversation in a way even

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.960 
kind of conversation in a way even
though<00:01:33.329> she's<00:01:33.869> obviously<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:35.460> he

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
though she's obviously not there but he

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.249 
though she's obviously not there but he
is<00:01:36.000> kind<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.329> responding<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.720> think<00:01:36.900> she<00:01:37.020> says

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
is kind of responding to think she says

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.109 
is kind of responding to think she says
and<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.710> very<00:01:37.920> easy<00:01:37.979> with<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.460> audiobook<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and it's very easy with the audiobook to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.670 
and it's very easy with the audiobook to
kind<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.390> get<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.659> conversation<00:01:40.380> they<00:01:40.530> have

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
kind of get that conversation they have

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.380 
kind of get that conversation they have
two<00:01:40.860> different<00:01:41.189> narrators<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.579> guy<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.180> girl

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
two different narrators a guy and a girl

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.020 
two different narrators a guy and a girl
so<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.320> definitely<00:01:43.470> feels<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
so it definitely feels like a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.580 
so it definitely feels like a
conversations<00:01:45.750> happening<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.290> kind<00:01:46.530> of

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
conversations happening and you kind of

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.350 
conversations happening and you kind of
almost<00:01:46.920> get<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.070> experience<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.329> are

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
almost get to experience it like you are

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.060 
almost get to experience it like you are
yourself<00:01:48.960> listening<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> tape<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.860> well

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
yourself listening to the tape as well

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.830 
yourself listening to the tape as well
which<00:01:50.640> i<00:01:50.759> think<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> really<00:01:51.299> important

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
which i think is a really important

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.030 
which i think is a really important
component<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.649> really<00:01:52.829> recommend

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
component of it so I really recommend

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.850 
component of it so I really recommend
again<00:01:53.610> listening<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> audiobook<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.619> far

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
again listening to the audiobook as far

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.709 
again listening to the audiobook as far
as<00:01:56.009> their<00:01:56.159> characters<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.939> did<00:01:57.149> enjoy<00:01:57.450> both<00:01:57.689> of

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
as their characters I did enjoy both of

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.310 
as their characters I did enjoy both of
them

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
to talk about a little later but I

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.560

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
really enjoyed her as a character and I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.899 
really enjoyed her as a character and I
really<00:02:03.930> enjoy<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.619> all<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.369> kind<00:02:05.790> of

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
really enjoy just all the kind of

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.550 
really enjoy just all the kind of
inflection<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.689> voice<00:02:06.840> inflection<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.380> got

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
inflection the voice inflection we got

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.869 
inflection the voice inflection we got
and<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.160> very<00:02:08.310> emotional<00:02:08.729> story

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
and it's a very emotional story

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.430 
and it's a very emotional story
obviously<00:02:09.149> which<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.629> why<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.840> think<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.410> is

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
obviously which is why I think it is

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.480 
obviously which is why I think it is
better<00:02:10.709> done

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
better done

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.220 
better done

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
going on and like I said it does not

some hopefulness towards the end and I
think<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.230> was<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.410> really<00:02:46.620> good<00:02:46.920> book<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.340> read

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
think it was a really good book to read

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.680 
think it was a really good book to read
if<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.730> are<00:02:47.760> interested<00:02:48.240> in<00:02:48.300> these<00:02:48.360> kinds<00:02:48.660> of

if you are interested in these kinds of

if you are interested in these kinds of
darker<00:02:49.110> ye<00:02:49.380> contemporaries<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.370> think<00:02:50.520> you'd

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
darker ye contemporaries I think you'd

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.520

actually want to include a little bit of

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.050 
actually want to include a little bit of
a<00:02:57.810> potentially<00:02:58.470> spoilery<00:02:59.370> thing<00:02:59.730> so<00:02:59.880> I'll<00:02:59.970> be

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
a potentially spoilery thing so I'll be

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.550 
a potentially spoilery thing so I'll be
putting<00:03:00.210> spoiler<00:03:00.630> right<00:03:00.750> here<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.230> when<00:03:01.380> I'm

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
putting spoiler right here and when I'm

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.110 
putting spoiler right here and when I'm
done<00:03:01.830> with<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.280> spoiler<00:03:02.670> warning<00:03:03.000> will

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
done with that the spoiler warning will

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.450 
done with that the spoiler warning will
go<00:03:03.300> away<00:03:03.420> it's<00:03:04.260> not<00:03:04.410> completely<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:05.040> spoiler

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
go away it's not completely a spoiler

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.460 
go away it's not completely a spoiler
but<00:03:05.580> if<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.880> are<00:03:06.150> somebody<00:03:06.840> who<00:03:07.020> is<00:03:07.140> more

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
but if you are somebody who is more

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.530 
but if you are somebody who is more
sensitive<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.130> how<00:03:08.310> issues<00:03:08.760> like<00:03:08.940> suicide<00:03:09.420> are

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
sensitive to how issues like suicide are

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.510 
sensitive to how issues like suicide are
handled<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.170> did<00:03:10.650> want<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.830> point<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.250> part

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
handled I did want to point this part

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.430 
handled I did want to point this part
out<00:03:11.730> because<00:03:12.510> for<00:03:12.840> some<00:03:12.990> people<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.230> think<00:03:13.350> they

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
out because for some people I think they

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.870 
out because for some people I think they
would<00:03:13.560> ruin<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:13.860> story<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.400> didn't<00:03:14.640> ruin<00:03:14.730> it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
would ruin the story it didn't ruin it

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.510 
would ruin the story it didn't ruin it
for<00:03:14.910> me<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.420> was<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.810> kind<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.590> negative<00:03:17.070> for

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
for me it was a kind of a negative for

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.700 
for me it was a kind of a negative for
me<00:03:17.640> but<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.420> didn't<00:03:18.780> ruin<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.050> completely<00:03:19.560> but

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
me but it didn't ruin it completely but

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.170 
me but it didn't ruin it completely but
I<00:03:19.770> feel<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.100> if<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.370> are<00:03:20.520> more<00:03:20.670> sensitive<00:03:21.060> to

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
I feel like if you are more sensitive to

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.430 
I feel like if you are more sensitive to
different<00:03:21.540> things<00:03:21.570> about<00:03:21.840> suicide<00:03:22.410> and

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
different things about suicide and

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.840 
different things about suicide and
depression<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.190> might<00:03:23.340> ruin<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.610> for<00:03:23.640> you

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
depression that it might ruin it for you

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.180 
depression that it might ruin it for you
so<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.030> wanted<00:03:24.210> to<00:03:24.270> give<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.540> potential

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
so I wanted to give this potential

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.010 
so I wanted to give this potential
warning<00:03:26.190> if<00:03:26.460> you<00:03:26.520> might<00:03:27.420> want<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.720> read<00:03:27.870> this

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
warning if you might want to read this

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.720 
warning if you might want to read this
story<00:03:28.410> potentially<00:03:28.950> for<00:03:29.100> how<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.430> handled

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
story potentially for how it is handled

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.600 
story potentially for how it is handled
so<00:03:30.150> again<00:03:30.450> here<00:03:31.200> we<00:03:31.290> go<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:32.160> one<00:03:32.250> problem<00:03:32.490> I

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
so again here we go the one problem I

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.010 
so again here we go the one problem I
had<00:03:32.760> with<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.910> story<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.330> what<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.660> story

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
had with the story and what the story

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.720 
had with the story and what the story
itself<00:03:34.260> got<00:03:34.500> four<00:03:34.740> stars<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.160> because<00:03:35.400> Taurus

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
itself got four stars is because Taurus

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.240 
itself got four stars is because Taurus
II<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.060> clay<00:03:36.480> kind<00:03:36.900> of<00:03:37.140> makes<00:03:37.740> it<00:03:37.950> seem<00:03:38.190> like

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
II and clay kind of makes it seem like

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.040 
II and clay kind of makes it seem like
and<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.850> story<00:03:39.090> kind<00:03:39.210> of<00:03:39.330> makes<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.570> seem<00:03:39.750> like

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
and the story kind of makes it seem like

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.640 
and the story kind of makes it seem like
she<00:03:40.890> could<00:03:41.550> have<00:03:41.670> been<00:03:41.850> saved<00:03:42.210> by<00:03:42.900> clay<00:03:43.290> and

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
she could have been saved by clay and

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.680 
she could have been saved by clay and
that<00:03:43.680> clay<00:03:44.100> could<00:03:44.310> kind<00:03:44.490> of<00:03:44.550> be<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.670> savior<00:03:45.450> and

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
that clay could kind of be a savior and

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.540 
that clay could kind of be a savior and
I<00:03:45.900> really<00:03:46.440> didn't<00:03:46.740> like<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:47.190> kind<00:03:47.490> of

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
I really didn't like that kind of

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.130 
I really didn't like that kind of
storyline<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.510> really<00:03:48.690> bothered<00:03:49.110> me

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
storyline and that really bothered me

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.660 
storyline and that really bothered me
because<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.530> don't<00:03:49.590> feel<00:03:49.830> like<00:03:49.890> if<00:03:50.280> somebody

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
because I don't feel like if somebody

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.300 
because I don't feel like if somebody
has<00:03:51.020> depression<00:03:52.020> or<00:03:52.470> has<00:03:52.620> suicidal<00:03:53.010> thoughts

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
has depression or has suicidal thoughts

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.460 
has depression or has suicidal thoughts
that<00:03:53.550> somebody<00:03:53.910> else<00:03:54.090> can<00:03:54.330> save<00:03:54.690> them<00:03:55.140> and

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
that somebody else can save them and

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.340 
that somebody else can save them and
that<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.640> know<00:03:56.820> somebody<00:03:57.360> can<00:03:57.780> prevent<00:03:58.140> them

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
that you know somebody can prevent them

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.260 
that you know somebody can prevent them
from<00:03:58.380> doing<00:03:58.680> whatever<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.580> is<00:03:59.670> they<00:03:59.970> want<00:04:00.210> to

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
from doing whatever it is they want to

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.080 
from doing whatever it is they want to
do<00:04:00.540> or<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:01.650> somebody<00:04:01.920> can<00:04:02.280> cure<00:04:02.940> your

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
do or that somebody can cure your

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.180 
do or that somebody can cure your
depression<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.900> don't<00:04:04.110> like<00:04:04.500> that<00:04:04.770> storyline

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
depression I don't like that storyline

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.410 
depression I don't like that storyline
at<00:04:05.400> all<00:04:05.520> because<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.880> don't<00:04:06.030> think<00:04:06.210> that<00:04:06.300> is

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
at all because I don't think that is

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.600 
at all because I don't think that is
accurate<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.230> felt<00:04:07.560> like<00:04:07.800> there's<00:04:08.430> a<00:04:08.490> lot

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
accurate and I felt like there's a lot

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.040 
accurate and I felt like there's a lot
of<00:04:08.700> times<00:04:08.880> where<00:04:09.090> clay<00:04:09.300> kind<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:09.630> said<00:04:09.780> like<00:04:09.900> if

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
of times where clay kind of said like if

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.390 
of times where clay kind of said like if
you<00:04:10.140> had<00:04:10.260> just<00:04:10.380> told<00:04:10.620> me<00:04:10.860> I<00:04:10.890> could<00:04:11.100> have<00:04:11.130> saved

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
you had just told me I could have saved

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.449 
you had just told me I could have saved
you<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.590> just<00:04:13.590> really<00:04:13.860> don't<00:04:13.980> like<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.370> way

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
you and I just really don't like the way

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.949 
you and I just really don't like the way
that<00:04:14.580> is<00:04:14.730> handled<00:04:15.090> because<00:04:15.180> that's<00:04:15.570> not<00:04:15.750> how

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
that is handled because that's not how

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.260 
that is handled because that's not how
depression<00:04:16.709> works<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.549> it's<00:04:17.790> not<00:04:17.940> like<00:04:18.120> you

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
depression works and it's not like you

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.969 
depression works and it's not like you
can<00:04:18.450> save<00:04:18.690> somebody<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:19.230> on<00:04:19.320> one<00:04:19.500> hand<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.919> don't

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
can save somebody so on one hand I don't

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.909 
can save somebody so on one hand I don't
like<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.669> implication<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:21.570> somebody<00:04:21.989> can

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
like the implication that somebody can

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.680 
like the implication that somebody can
be<00:04:23.100> staged<00:04:23.400> by<00:04:23.520> somebody<00:04:23.850> else

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
be staged by somebody else

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.360 
be staged by somebody else
there's<00:04:24.960> on<00:04:25.230> both<00:04:25.560> sides<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.920> the<00:04:26.010> equation<00:04:26.310> I

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
there's on both sides of the equation I

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.560 
there's on both sides of the equation I
feel<00:04:26.490> like<00:04:26.580> that's<00:04:26.700> a<00:04:26.760> negative<00:04:27.120> thing<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.480> be

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
feel like that's a negative thing to be

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.360 
feel like that's a negative thing to be
saying<00:04:27.840> so<00:04:28.350> at<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.530> very<00:04:28.710> end<00:04:28.920> there<00:04:29.220> is<00:04:29.340> a

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
saying so at the very end there is a

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.710 
saying so at the very end there is a
situation<00:04:29.880> where<00:04:30.030> there's<00:04:30.210> another<00:04:30.450> girl

follows her after the whole storyline is
done<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.930> with<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.410> implication<00:04:38.010> that<00:04:38.130> maybe

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
done and with the implication that maybe

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.940 
done and with the implication that maybe
he<00:04:38.490> can<00:04:38.640> save<00:04:38.940> her<00:04:39.510> so<00:04:40.230> I<00:04:40.260> don't<00:04:40.590> like<00:04:40.800> this

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
because you can't save someone's mental

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.600 
because you can't save someone's mental
illness<00:04:49.350> somebody<00:04:49.680> who<00:04:49.950> has<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.250> mental

illness somebody who has a mental
illness<00:04:50.730> needs<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.630> get<00:04:51.720> help<00:04:51.900> themselves<00:04:52.380> and

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
illness needs to get help themselves and

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.470 
illness needs to get help themselves and
there's<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.220> lot<00:04:53.340> of<00:04:53.370> enabling<00:04:53.910> with<00:04:54.120> that<00:04:54.240> kind

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
there's a lot of enabling with that kind

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.880 
there's a lot of enabling with that kind
of<00:04:54.570> thought<00:04:54.780> that<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:54.990> can<00:04:55.230> save<00:04:55.470> somebody

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
of thought that you can save somebody

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.670 
of thought that you can save somebody
and<00:04:56.190> it's<00:04:56.310> just<00:04:56.520> a<00:04:56.670> very<00:04:57.150> negative<00:04:57.480> thing<00:04:57.990> I

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
and it's just a very negative thing I

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.860 
and it's just a very negative thing I
think<00:04:59.160> so<00:04:59.280> that's<00:04:59.460> why<00:04:59.670> I<00:04:59.700> gave<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.480> a<00:05:00.630> lower

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
think so that's why I gave it a lower

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.120 
think so that's why I gave it a lower
rating<00:05:01.110> if<00:05:01.320> that's<00:05:01.440> something<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:01.920> also

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
rating if that's something that you also

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.500 
rating if that's something that you also
do<00:05:02.310> not<00:05:02.460> like<00:05:02.580> as<00:05:02.730> well<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:03.060> did<00:05:03.210> want<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.390> give

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
really like the way that most of the

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.890 
really like the way that most of the
things<00:05:08.220> were<00:05:08.490> handled<00:05:08.850> in<00:05:08.970> it<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.360> I<00:05:09.540> gave<00:05:09.750> the
