and I'm just going to show you one lap
try<00:00:41.199> and<00:00:41.260> keep<00:00:41.530> on<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.859> lookout<00:00:42.129> for<00:00:42.570> physics

try and keep on the lookout for physics
ton<00:00:44.880> of<00:00:45.000> stuff

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.720 

you'll<00:00:55.410> probably<00:00:55.649> notice<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.460> everything

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
you'll probably notice that everything

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.790 
you'll probably notice that everything
seems<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.269> bit<00:00:57.420> narrow<00:00:57.750> that's<00:00:58.050> because<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.469> had

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
seems a bit narrow that's because I had

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.090 
seems a bit narrow that's because I had
a<00:00:58.829> set<00:00:59.160> up<00:00:59.309> for

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.750 

1445

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
1445

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.110 
1445
and<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.690> most

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
and the most

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.420 
and the most
for<00:01:09.240> most<00:01:09.630> part<00:01:09.750> i<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.290> around<00:01:10.500> 30<00:01:10.950> frames<00:01:11.310> per

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
for most part i get around 30 frames per

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.910 
for most part i get around 30 frames per
second<00:01:12.060> which<00:01:12.240> is

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
second which is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.180 
second which is
definitely<00:01:13.790> playable<00:01:14.360> by

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
definitely playable by

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.470 
definitely playable by
probably<00:01:16.060> not<00:01:16.240> as<00:01:16.450> smooth<00:01:16.750> as<00:01:16.900> I<00:01:17.050> was<00:01:17.200> like

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.730 

that<00:01:24.549> is<00:01:24.789> a<00:01:25.180> slow<00:01:25.689> down<00:01:25.869> with<00:01:26.049> traps<00:01:26.409> that

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
that is a slow down with traps that

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.149 
that is a slow down with traps that
almost<00:01:27.430> never<00:01:27.670> happens<00:01:27.789> in<00:01:28.509> gameplay<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.950> fact

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
almost never happens in gameplay in fact

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:40.450 
almost never happens in gameplay in fact
it's<00:01:30.369> never<00:01:30.610> happened<00:01:31.090> without<00:01:31.689> rap<00:01:32.049> song

all<00:01:40.909> as<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.540> can<00:01:41.659> see<00:01:41.990> on<00:01:42.229> pretty<00:01:42.979> much

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.249 

but<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:48.030> wasn't<00:01:48.210> exactly<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.200> this

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
but that wasn't exactly the one of this

but that wasn't exactly the one of this
video<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.100> demonstrate<00:01:50.810> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
video is just to demonstrate the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:06.610 
video is just to demonstrate the
hardware<00:01:52.170> capabilities<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.860> laptop

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.010 

as<00:02:07.160> you<00:02:07.340> can<00:02:07.430> see<00:02:07.700> how<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.750> can<00:02:08.840> actually

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
as you can see how you can actually

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.970 
as you can see how you can actually
loose<00:02:09.380> parts<00:02:09.920> from<00:02:10.640> your<00:02:10.820> car<00:02:11.060> hit<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.570> walls

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
loose parts from your car hit the walls

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.630 
loose parts from your car hit the walls
just<00:02:12.980> lost<00:02:13.190> my<00:02:13.370> bumper<00:02:13.820> and<00:02:15.250> one<00:02:16.250> other<00:02:16.370> thing

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
just lost my bumper and one other thing

just lost my bumper and one other thing
that<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.790> can't<00:02:17.060> see<00:02:17.420> through<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.810> replay<00:02:18.200> is

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
that you can't see through the replay is

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.500 
that you can't see through the replay is
you<00:02:19.310> actually<00:02:19.690> all<00:02:21.190> damaged<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.940> core<00:02:23.150> parts

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
you actually all damaged the core parts

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.060 
you actually all damaged the core parts
they<00:02:23.720> can<00:02:23.870> lose<00:02:23.990> their<00:02:24.170> integrity<00:02:24.440> from

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
they can lose their integrity from

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.229 
they can lose their integrity from
accidents

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.820

and Here I am approaching final stretch

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.309 
and Here I am approaching final stretch
of<00:02:32.890> my<00:02:33.160> first<00:02:33.430> lap

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.620 

now<00:02:37.829> I'm<00:02:38.040> done
