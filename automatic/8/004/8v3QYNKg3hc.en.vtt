00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 which congratulates me on 17 seconds 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.700
 style with a 0 for 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.370
 It was the schedule to self out 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.870
 starting blocks to come yes no we try 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.790
 always good that the starting blocks too 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.080
 but your nose has a second 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.299
 to a 0 state that seemed to him in that 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.560
 you can estimate that in advance 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.050
 but now we what was nice to be like that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.880
 but mainly to nec the illusion 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.020
 make sure that there is something for them 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.350
 would remain at the end of the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.320
 contest 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.640
 yes no i think that's when you get up so quickly 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.090
 that advantage comes that feeling in everyone 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.230
 case a lot less moisture and that 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.180
 second that I think 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.520
 you can put it down but also quite briefly 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.860
 afterwards for our feeling and then you have the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.750
 was held firmly when you are PSV 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.750
 the neck plays also wash you want 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 And there you just have to show that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.239
 your rowin 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.340
 play the first half I think is a good one 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.170
 first half what you just said and is 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.160
 certainly i took a few chances but then 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.210
 is there a charity right now? 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.340
 man I think 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.690
 very good rattles of just twice 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.699
 and then still got two more schools 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.309
 dike or something that also grabs well 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.199
 izak own is sometimes a good 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.950
 keeper always stood after your pocket semester 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.470
 her suit makes me think again today 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.540
 a very important balls well we 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.939
 two are still just for me 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.979
 two have been three moments in which 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.689
 so he saves us 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.759
 is text today the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.110
 criticism was so on which you isaacson 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.090
 don't understand you completely 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.040
 well look he knows that himself 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.799
 a man have been me moments that who 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.030
 be less but I think that's him 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.500
 from from 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.060
 technical staff of the group of players 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.200
 Oh no I carried on to it 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.820
 go and you'll see that now 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.950
 eggs need quality 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.150
 I already think imposing from the first half 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.190
 that second half might be even better 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.770
 used to be 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.090
 yes you are just sitting out at a given time 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.190
 that the scrap metal be with your how 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.540
 longer the competition for this 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.520
 the more have walked and their 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.560
 become a mother and then you see that we 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.420
 just can't have the walk anymore 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.680
 riders and then we see players 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.180
 the good from management 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.080
 felt that a field also so that 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.080
 second half was so good 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.720
 yeah you notice that you know that 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.019
 are a boss or a woman it is just 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.670
 yummy 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.080
 I think there was a second thing they had 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.239
 quiet possession were they 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.250
 perhaps still had far to 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.560
 but I think this goal too 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.330
 free was his calm and was from the very 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.739
 stuff might be in the second half 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.870
 in particular, but also most of 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.410
 the first half with best psv what we tot 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.989
 I have seen this season so far 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.390
 that we that we really good match on 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.890
 kind of just maybe that it is indeed 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.180
 that it's about a little less long period 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.769
 it was indeed like snow 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.540
 We played the greatest use of the game 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.950
 actually pretty good from concentrating 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.200
 on 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.090
 so i do n't know if we should just 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.340
 we made sure this was tower and and still 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.989
 trying to get better because even though it was 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.610
 Today was a nice race 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.410
 still not good because what i am 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.849
 just said if it was a word or two 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.769
 about the participation in the competition 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.030
 I think we go another way too 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.269
 have just had a phases that 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.620
 doing very well and today I think 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.209
 also to do with the course of the match 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.010
 girl so fast and just force google 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.959
 football of course nice 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.450
 genius sometimes nice second half 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.120
 you get a penalty but want and lazovic 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.430
 and Jonathan eventually glasses 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.190
 bike case and then I still see Jonathan 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.040
 congratulate lazovic and success people 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.510
 that the atmosphere at the moment in that group 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.069
 well i actually don't like it anymore 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.340
 like a normal one 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.170
 would be very bad if it is not true that 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.060
 is ok but it is everybody else's everything 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.440
 and yes it is all love peace 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.480
 let me call it that 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.340
 yes but yes that is actually actually 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.700
 hear it so but it is a fact 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.510
 that I now just more on waternet 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.720
 good playing goals 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.720
 and then there is more at stake 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.220
 scoop along beni secretly from your striker 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.349
 me and I am I am definitely one 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.689
 midfielder only yes it looked like one 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.489
 you know a bit about a pointed goal 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.049
 I was okay when I was allowed to come after it 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.159
 but I just need one 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.730
 bit crazy because you had stijn 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:00.110
 both on 6 May no conformation 6 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.250
 someone who can let you in most 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.510
 we nowhere reasonably well predict it 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.790
 Korea 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.040
 guest again lock you with time 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.150
 when do you score another department 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.099
 must be free going pine 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.390
 predicts what do you think of the time 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.390
 what you are playing today 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.959
 actually i thought it wasn't like that 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.199
 not so liked 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.310
 advance but afterwards you can do 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.260
 some strength 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.580
 China or 7 state with three points then 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.169
 makes time not from 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.430
 every day it's just about humor 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.350
 that you have to do you have to play rocco 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.010
 let it be too 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.010
 you shouldn't worry about that
