 the school is insufficient 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.840
 what characterizes the transition from childhood to adolescence 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.430
 it's the search for autonomy

 two played the role of mediator to overcome some fears 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.130
 for the parents 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.460
 creator of the separation 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.490
 or matter 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.510
 For the young

 cream of frustration or not to be loved at these crystals 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.960
 we will seek to secure young people and to accompany them in their 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 taking responsibility 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.639
 I did it because she needed my winners 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.489
 fault 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.749
 and it is precisely there I found through me an e 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.579
 when my parents enrolled me in the boarding of these crises of that time 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.279
 that I was not too 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:21.019
 because a lot of the German of our friends 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.999
 whatever his accusations 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.799
 q a fundamentalist on fire yet it's a bit my family body

 the other three factories in computing brings new habits 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.639
 you have to get used to new people compared to implementing 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.249
 the penalties I was not bad to see his year with the launch of his 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.599

 work permit to collect a piece as coach 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.210
 what is good is that we are all solidary and responsible in the case 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.059
 from the madeleine 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.229
 and when necessary it's family 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.229
 these will also be paradoxical 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:59.619
 to believe it must take points but never the tax remains to 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:00.780
 work in the evening 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.780
 there was work and more heat 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:11.169

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.679
 especially the league - which allows children to be much more 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:16.560

 find himself face to face so do not see his parents too closely and so that 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.489
 this summer 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.220
 by himself in his camp here we remained faithful to actually 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.499
 the establishment for 18 years 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:33.350
 this one 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.619
 it's because we appreciate the fact 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:38.679
 that children are welcomed as individuals 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.609
 she is exciting investigation 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.059

 his confidence and his self-esteem 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.239
 for that 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.439
 we rely on sports activities 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:57.499
 musical 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:00.499

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.119
 at the same time that I could for young and old 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:09.329
