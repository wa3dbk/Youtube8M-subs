00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.669
 the winner of the last volume was 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:17.460
 30 47 hours and I bring good time a 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.460
 a little late 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:27.090
 a day late the air but a long day 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.090
 people waited anxiously for this 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:35.270
 to be able to see him belfield we started the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.920
 volume 7 and we start with the court of 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.920
 21 to 15 happy 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:51.210
 traveling to the future what the fuck 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.250
 we see how it is transported several times 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.850
 from the same place coming back from the past of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.850
 present and future 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.180
 that he twisted his neck 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.270
 this was in a power version 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270
 rangers 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.430
 here 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.840
 you can see your feet 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:01.490
 here thrown but the goalkeeper 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.630
 and sent him flying with the pure wind 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.830
 many times but not 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.990
 and in number 4 we have to believe in their 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.490
 machine that is on your falcon nothing else 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.440
 here trying to park apparently 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.440
 I do not know what the hell and suddenly it starts with 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.330
 parking result 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:13.570
 I think this is that it has been installed 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.570
 windows vista 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:27.730
 happy sad to lose 50 kilos 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.950
 and I think then all the people now 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.950
 what do i keep 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.700
 for gravity you know how to have a jet 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:58.330
 to win of course the used paddles 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.330
 and save life when meters 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:07.040
 ramÃ³n in a portal and dying suddenly 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:12.340
 but bad tula very bad luck of 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.340
 appear and disappear took it 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.459
 forever or whatever 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.790
 but that he lived in this little world he 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.790
 it takes 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.370
 the driver and the end of volume 7 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.000
 I hope you liked it and I'm going to 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.710
 ask a favorcito more of his plays 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.170
 describe the good please the bad 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.670
 the best I can, I do not want anything 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.290
 if I tell you to describe it, it's not for 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.090
 to give me any blowjob or not to 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.920
 that leave me with doubt a bad example of 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.270
 this would be 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.910
 he was not playing team slayer and better 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.740
 see the play and something incredible happened to me or 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.300
 does not specify well what happened to them if not 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.160
 I'm not going to see them reject too many 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.490
 mails because they do not specify well they know 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.190
 that explains why you did not put my play 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.390
 to that that can happen so if not 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.610
 possible change, I will not give it for 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.810
 had his move because I feel like I'm going to 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.340
 do for a hundred I'm going to waste your time 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:18.780
