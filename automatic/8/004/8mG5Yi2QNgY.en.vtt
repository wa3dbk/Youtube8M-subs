00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.309 
for the game but 15 weapons versus 300
weapons<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:12.970> an<00:02:13.180> entirely<00:02:13.480> different<00:02:13.630> problem

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
weapons is an entirely different problem

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.800 
weapons is an entirely different problem
and<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.310> dead<00:02:15.760> rising<00:02:15.940> 2<00:02:16.150> we<00:02:16.269> have<00:02:16.360> 50<00:02:16.720> of

and in the dead rising 2 we have 50 of

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.720 
and in the dead rising 2 we have 50 of
the<00:02:16.930> combo<00:02:17.260> weapons<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:18.100> these<00:02:18.370> are<00:02:18.430> weapons

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
the combo weapons so these are weapons

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.490

that you take to other parts put them

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.800 
that you take to other parts put them
