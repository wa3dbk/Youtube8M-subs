here go ahead and get him back in the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.580 
here go ahead and get him back in the
water<00:01:05.810> I'm<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.050> show<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.200> here<00:01:07.440> the

water I'm going to show you here the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.050 
water I'm going to show you here the
technique<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.250> we're<00:01:08.369> using<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.850> catch

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
technique that we're using to catch

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.719 
technique that we're using to catch
these<00:01:09.300> walleyes<00:01:09.570> jigging<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:11.039> we're<00:01:11.430> coming

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
these walleyes jigging so we're coming

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.730 
these walleyes jigging so we're coming
up<00:01:11.789> along<00:01:11.940> structure<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.170> believe<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.710> be

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
up along structure that we believe to be

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.609 
up along structure that we believe to be
holding<00:01:14.190> fish<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.360> cast<00:01:15.960> our<00:01:16.200> jig<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
holding fish then we cast our jig and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.279 
holding fish then we cast our jig and
plastic<00:01:17.160> out<00:01:17.539> then<00:01:18.539> you<00:01:18.660> just<00:01:18.810> sit<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.050> wait

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
plastic out then you just sit and wait

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:20.660 
plastic out then you just sit and wait
for<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.679> sink<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> bottom<00:01:20.130> and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
for it to sink to the bottom and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
for it to sink to the bottom and
depending<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.060> how<00:01:21.210> deep<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.690> it<00:01:21.960> might

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
depending on how deep it is it might

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.889 
depending on how deep it is it might
take<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> few<00:01:22.890> seconds<00:01:23.570> once<00:01:24.570> you're<00:01:24.690> on<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
take a few seconds once you're on the

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.210 
take a few seconds once you're on the
bottom<00:01:25.289> then<00:01:25.470> you're<00:01:25.590> gonna<00:01:25.679> start<00:01:25.979> hopping

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
bottom then you're gonna start hopping

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.210 
bottom then you're gonna start hopping
it<00:01:26.520> back<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:28.350> most<00:01:28.710> important

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it back to you and the most important

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.040 
it back to you and the most important
thing<00:01:29.399> to<00:01:29.550> remember<00:01:29.580> when<00:01:29.970> fishing<00:01:30.330> plastics

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
thing to remember when fishing plastics

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.749 
thing to remember when fishing plastics
is<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.289> you<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.710> fish<00:01:31.920> them<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.280> little

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
is that you have to fish them a little

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.029 
is that you have to fish them a little
bit<00:01:32.880> differently<00:01:33.360> than<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.350> would<00:01:34.380> fish<00:01:34.770> live

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
bit differently than you would fish live

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.219 
bit differently than you would fish live
bait<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.729> lot<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.149> times<00:01:36.300> live<00:01:36.509> bait<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.020> work

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
bait a lot of times live bait you work

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.710 
bait a lot of times live bait you work
real<00:01:37.500> slow<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.340> easy<00:01:38.520> along<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.149> bottom<00:01:39.330> so

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
real slow and easy along the bottom so

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.589 
real slow and easy along the bottom so
it<00:01:40.080> doesn't<00:01:40.140> tend<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.619> work<00:01:40.830> too<00:01:41.039> well<00:01:41.250> for

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
it doesn't tend to work too well for

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:43.940 
it doesn't tend to work too well for
plastics<00:01:42.599> a<00:01:42.720> lot<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.959> times<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.349> have<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.649> pop

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
plastics a lot of times you have to pop

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.559 
plastics a lot of times you have to pop
them<00:01:44.160> that's<00:01:44.369> what<00:01:44.489> we<00:01:44.550> call<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.849> snap<00:01:45.090> jigging

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
them that's what we call it snap jigging

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.749 
them that's what we call it snap jigging
because<00:01:46.080> we're<00:01:46.259> snapping<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> jig<00:01:47.130> pretty

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
because we're snapping the jig pretty

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.880 
because we're snapping the jig pretty
hard<00:01:48.060> off<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.330> bottom<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:48.929> as<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.679> see

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
hard off the bottom so as you can see

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.710 
hard off the bottom so as you can see
here<00:01:50.190> I'm<00:01:50.520> waiting<00:01:51.030> till<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.209> hits<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.569> bottom

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
here I'm waiting till it hits the bottom

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.320 
here I'm waiting till it hits the bottom
and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.530> I'm<00:01:52.679> snapping<00:01:53.429> it<00:01:53.550> up<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.940> then<00:01:54.209> I'm

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
and then I'm snapping it up and then I'm

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.300 
and then I'm snapping it up and then I'm
leaving<00:01:54.630> my<00:01:54.750> rod<00:01:54.959> tip<00:01:54.989> up<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.770> keeping<00:01:56.160> my

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
leaving my rod tip up and keeping my

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.669 
leaving my rod tip up and keeping my
line<00:01:56.550> caught<00:01:56.970> because<00:01:57.239> normally<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.440> fish

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
line caught because normally the fish

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.130 
line caught because normally the fish
will<00:01:58.920> strike<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.970> jig<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.539> falling<00:02:00.959> back

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
will strike as the jig is falling back

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.540 
will strike as the jig is falling back
to<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.470> bottom<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.099> I<00:02:02.399> pop<00:02:03.239> it<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:04.190> hold<00:02:05.190> my<00:02:05.369> rod

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
to the bottom so I pop it up hold my rod

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.339 
to the bottom so I pop it up hold my rod
tip<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.000> wait<00:02:06.330> for<00:02:06.539> the<00:02:06.599> jig<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.929> sink<00:02:07.170> down

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
tip and wait for the jig to sink down

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.770 
tip and wait for the jig to sink down
and<00:02:07.679> if<00:02:07.800> I<00:02:07.979> feel<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> fish<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.879> set<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> hook<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
and if I feel a fish I set the hook and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.930 
and if I feel a fish I set the hook and
as<00:02:10.140> soon<00:02:10.289> as<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.470> feel<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.709> or<00:02:10.950> if<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.550> feel<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.849> hit

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
as soon as I feel it or if I feel it hit

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.119 
as soon as I feel it or if I feel it hit
the<00:02:12.030> bottom<00:02:12.360> then<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.959> reel<00:02:13.170> down<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.739> make

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
the bottom then I reel down and make

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.559 
the bottom then I reel down and make
another<00:02:14.340> pop<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.180> repeat<00:02:15.540> that

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
another pop and I just repeat that

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.110 
another pop and I just repeat that
process<00:02:15.810> all<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.709> way<00:02:16.800> until<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.520> jig<00:02:17.970> is

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
process all the way until the jig is

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.979 
process all the way until the jig is
back<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.569> boat

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
this technique here the rod I'm using is

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.300

action shield tournament rod the reason

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.699 
action shield tournament rod the reason
I<00:03:13.579> like<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.819> long<00:03:14.209> rod<00:03:14.599> for<00:03:14.959> this<00:03:15.079> technique<00:03:15.500> is

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
I like a long rod for this technique is

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.819 
I like a long rod for this technique is
because<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:17.239> allows<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.750> cast<00:03:18.079> your<00:03:18.319> jig<00:03:18.650> a

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
because it allows you to cast your jig a

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.300 
because it allows you to cast your jig a
long<00:03:19.189> ways<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:19.909> it<00:03:20.299> also<00:03:20.329> allows<00:03:20.989> you<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.379> pick

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
long ways and it also allows you to pick

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.490 
long ways and it also allows you to pick
up<00:03:22.459> any<00:03:22.639> slack<00:03:22.909> that<00:03:23.359> gets<00:03:23.569> in<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.900> line<00:03:24.109> when

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
up any slack that gets in the line when

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.349 
up any slack that gets in the line when
you<00:03:24.620> feel<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.829> bite<00:03:25.069> and<00:03:25.370> set<00:03:25.669> the<00:03:25.790> hook<00:03:25.939> really

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
you feel a bite and set the hook really

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.569 
you feel a bite and set the hook really
hard<00:03:26.659> because<00:03:27.079> a<00:03:27.109> lot<00:03:27.319> of<00:03:27.349> the<00:03:27.500> times<00:03:27.799> the<00:03:28.400> fish

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
hard because a lot of the times the fish

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.159 
hard because a lot of the times the fish
will<00:03:28.760> bite<00:03:28.939> when<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.299> jig<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:29.540> quite<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:29.959> ways

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
will bite when the jig is quite a ways

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.809 
will bite when the jig is quite a ways
away<00:03:30.319> from<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.709> boat<00:03:30.889> so<00:03:31.099> that<00:03:31.129> longer<00:03:31.489> rod

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
away from the boat so that longer rod

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.729 
away from the boat so that longer rod
allows<00:03:32.480> you<00:03:32.659> to<00:03:32.750> put<00:03:32.900> more<00:03:33.079> power<00:03:33.319> into<00:03:33.500> your

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
allows you to put more power into your
