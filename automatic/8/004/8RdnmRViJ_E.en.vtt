talk about in a little bit let me show
you<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.180> detail<00:01:37.570> of<00:01:37.690> how<00:01:37.720> these<00:01:37.960> things<00:01:38.020> work

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
you the detail of how these things work

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.330 
you the detail of how these things work
we've<00:01:39.850> got<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:40.000> cutaway<00:01:40.330> here<00:01:40.830> is<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:42.160> same

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
we've got a cutaway here is the same

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.999 
we've got a cutaway here is the same
unit<00:01:42.520> only<00:01:42.760> smaller<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.380> what<00:01:44.530> we<00:01:44.650> did<00:01:44.800> was

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
unit only smaller so what we did was

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.670 
unit only smaller so what we did was
incorporated<00:01:45.880> these<00:01:45.970> flow<00:01:46.270> dividers<00:01:46.810> you

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
incorporated these flow dividers you

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.560 
incorporated these flow dividers you
have<00:01:47.830> one<00:01:48.040> here<00:01:48.400> and<00:01:48.550> then<00:01:49.030> one<00:01:49.210> in<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.360> other

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
have one here and then one in the other

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.859 
have one here and then one in the other
tank<00:01:49.930> with<00:01:50.890> these<00:01:51.100> do<00:01:51.400> these<00:01:52.180> create<00:01:52.660> water

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
tank with these do these create water

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.630 
tank with these do these create water
movement<00:01:53.350> in<00:01:53.470> three<00:01:53.740> different<00:01:53.950> passes<00:01:54.490> so

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
movement in three different passes so

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.910 
movement in three different passes so
water<00:01:54.850> comes<00:01:55.090> in<00:01:55.330> here<00:01:55.360> it's<00:01:56.170> your<00:01:56.410> first<00:01:56.590> flow

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
water comes in here it's your first flow

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.240 
water comes in here it's your first flow
divider<00:01:57.280> comes<00:01:57.640> across<00:01:58.590> down<00:01:59.590> into<00:01:59.860> your<00:01:59.950> tank

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
divider comes across down into your tank

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.940 
divider comes across down into your tank
to<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.520> second<00:02:00.880> flow<00:02:01.060> divider<00:02:01.560> across<00:02:02.560> again

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
to the second flow divider across again

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.520 
to the second flow divider across again
down<00:02:03.820> in<00:02:03.970> here<00:02:04.149> essentially<00:02:04.509> three<00:02:04.899> passes<00:02:05.410> in

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
down in here essentially three passes in

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.380 
down in here essentially three passes in
front<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.920> fan<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.640> conventional<00:02:07.210> right

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
front of the fan the conventional right

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.880 
front of the fan the conventional right
here<00:02:07.600> like<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:07.869> have<00:02:08.020> right<00:02:08.229> now<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.470> cross

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
here like you have right now a cross

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.220 
here like you have right now a cross
flow<00:02:09.069> going<00:02:09.490> to<00:02:09.550> be<00:02:09.670> from<00:02:09.880> one<00:02:10.090> tank<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.569> the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230

going<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.110> be<00:02:50.200> impressed<00:02:50.319> with<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.830> results

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
going to be impressed with the results

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.420 
going to be impressed with the results
we<00:02:52.020> installed<00:02:53.020> each<00:02:53.140> radiator<00:02:53.620> in<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.980> 68

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
we installed each radiator in the 68

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.520 
we installed each radiator in the 68
Camaro<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:55.209> then<00:02:55.450> put<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.630> thermocouple<00:02:56.020> into

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
Camaro and then put a thermocouple into

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.500 
Camaro and then put a thermocouple into
the<00:02:56.650> inlet<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.040> outlet<00:02:57.580> of<00:02:57.819> each<00:02:58.060> right<00:02:58.330> ear

the inlet and outlet of each right ear

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.120 
the inlet and outlet of each right ear
so<00:02:58.540> we<00:02:58.780> can<00:02:58.900> measure<00:02:59.050> temperature<00:02:59.350> coming<00:03:00.010> in

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
so we can measure temperature coming in

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.670 
so we can measure temperature coming in
and<00:03:00.340> going<00:03:00.550> out<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.900> engine<00:03:02.170> was<00:03:02.230> then<00:03:02.439> run

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
and going out the engine was then run

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.630 
and going out the engine was then run
until<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.010> temperature

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640
