my<00:04:18.930> mind<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.560> apex<00:04:19.980> of<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.190> offense<00:04:20.580> is<00:04:20.700> the

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
my mind the apex of the offense is the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.090 
my mind the apex of the offense is the
center<00:04:21.150> but<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.230> doesn't<00:04:22.560> mean<00:04:22.710> every

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
center but that doesn't mean every

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.920 
center but that doesn't mean every
position<00:04:23.370> is<00:04:23.670> set<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:24.000> stone<00:04:24.210> after<00:04:24.870> an

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
position is set in stone after an

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.360 
position is set in stone after an
intense<00:04:25.290> spring<00:04:25.620> practice<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.190> most

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
intense spring practice the most

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.190 
intense spring practice the most
improved<00:04:26.790> position<00:04:27.270> was<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.690> offensive<00:04:27.990> line

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
improved position was the offensive line

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.610 
improved position was the offensive line
but<00:04:28.920> the<00:04:29.190> battle<00:04:29.550> continues<00:04:29.670> I<00:04:30.330> read<00:04:31.140> Fraggles

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
but the battle continues I read Fraggles

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.920 
but the battle continues I read Fraggles

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.660 
deckers right on his heels for that
position<00:04:36.210> so<00:04:36.780> we<00:04:37.620> just<00:04:37.800> need<00:04:37.950> to<00:04:38.070> continue<00:04:38.520> to

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
position so we just need to continue to

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.430 
position so we just need to continue to
develop<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.300> recruit<00:04:39.570> depth<00:04:39.840> without<00:04:40.050> that's

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
develop and recruit depth without that's

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.490 
develop and recruit depth without that's
the<00:04:40.680> one<00:04:40.890> group<00:04:41.190> that<00:04:41.720> as<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:42.960> said<00:04:43.200> throughout

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
the one group that as I said throughout

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.560 
the one group that as I said throughout
the<00:04:43.680> spring<00:04:43.890> and<00:04:44.220> then<00:04:44.430> after<00:04:44.760> I've<00:04:44.880> now<00:04:45.330> had<00:04:45.480> a

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
the spring and then after I've now had a

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.480 
the spring and then after I've now had a
chance<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.960> reflect<00:04:46.200> and<00:04:46.440> go<00:04:47.160> through<00:04:47.370> the

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
chance to reflect and go through the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.010 
chance to reflect and go through the
final<00:04:47.760> grades<00:04:48.000> of<00:04:48.180> spring<00:04:48.420> practice<00:04:48.450> our

offense<00:04:49.380> line<00:04:49.560> was<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.800> most<00:04:49.980> improved

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
offense line was the most improved

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.640 
offense line was the most improved
