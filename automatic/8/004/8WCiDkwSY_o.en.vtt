and the church just I don't really know

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:01.990 
and the church just I don't really know
how<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.070> could<00:03:01.190> have<00:03:01.280> done<00:03:01.459> it<00:03:01.580> without<00:03:01.670> the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
how it could have done it without the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:18.220 
how it could have done it without the
church<00:03:14.020> he<00:03:15.020> gave<00:03:15.290> us<00:03:15.319> off<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:16.250> God<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.989> he<00:03:17.989> made

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
church he gave us off to God and he made

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.540 
church he gave us off to God and he made
his<00:03:18.440> peace<00:03:18.770> before<00:03:19.370> he<00:03:19.670> went<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:21.680> that

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
his peace before he went and that that

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.440 
his peace before he went and that that
is<00:03:22.760> what<00:03:23.380> was<00:03:24.380> most<00:03:24.650> important<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.910> both<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.150> us

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
I think maybe it was happy about eight

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.250 
I think maybe it was happy about eight
hours<00:03:32.120> before<00:03:32.840> he<00:03:32.900> actually<00:03:33.050> died<00:03:34.090> um<00:03:35.200> where<00:03:36.200> I

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
hours before he actually died um where I

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.990 
hours before he actually died um where I
just<00:03:36.530> nailed<00:03:36.769> in<00:03:37.010> his<00:03:37.130> bed<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.600> prayed<00:03:38.959> and
