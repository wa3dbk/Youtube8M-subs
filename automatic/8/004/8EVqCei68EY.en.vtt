going to talk to you about how to

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.640 
going to talk to you about how to
germinate<00:00:17.160> Morning<00:00:17.580> Glory<00:00:17.609> seeds<00:00:18.650> morning

glories<00:00:19.920> are<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> beautiful<00:00:21.109> old-fashioned

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
glories are a beautiful old-fashioned

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.380 
glories are a beautiful old-fashioned
summer<00:00:22.439> flowering<00:00:23.010> vine<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:24.000> are<00:00:24.119> really

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
summer flowering vine that are really

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.170 
summer flowering vine that are really
very<00:00:24.660> easy<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.199> grow<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:25.859> sometimes<00:00:26.820> they<00:00:27.029> can

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
very easy to grow but sometimes they can

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.990 
very easy to grow but sometimes they can
be<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.330> little<00:00:27.810> tricky<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.260> get<00:00:28.470> started<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.760> I'm

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
be a little tricky to get started so I'm

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.910 
be a little tricky to get started so I'm
going<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.330> give<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> few<00:00:31.230> pointers<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.890> how

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
going to give you a few pointers on how

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.350 
going to give you a few pointers on how
to<00:00:32.369> get<00:00:32.759> Morning<00:00:33.149> Glory<00:00:33.180> seeds<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.320> germinate

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
to get Morning Glory seeds to germinate

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.840 
to get Morning Glory seeds to germinate
the<00:00:36.360> first<00:00:36.660> way<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> very<00:00:37.649> simply<00:00:38.160> soak<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
the first way is to very simply soak the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.650 
the first way is to very simply soak the
seeds<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:40.020> shallow<00:00:40.500> dish<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.160> water

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
seeds in a shallow dish of water

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.810 
seeds in a shallow dish of water
sometimes<00:00:42.660> that's<00:00:42.989> enough<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:44.129> soften<00:00:44.430> them

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
sometimes that's enough to soften them

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.170 
sometimes that's enough to soften them
enough<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.539> sprout<00:00:45.899> if<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:47.579> doesn't<00:00:48.000> work

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
enough to sprout if that doesn't work

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.200 
enough to sprout if that doesn't work
then<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.320> use<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:50.000> 50/50<00:00:51.000> percent

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
then you can use a 50/50 percent

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
then you can use a 50/50 percent
solution<00:00:51.920> half<00:00:52.920> water<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.670> half<00:00:54.230> hydrogen

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
solution half water and half hydrogen

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.880 
solution half water and half hydrogen
peroxide<00:00:56.360> that<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.660> help<00:00:57.870> weaken<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> seed

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
peroxide that can help weaken the seed

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.689 
peroxide that can help weaken the seed
coat<00:00:59.250> enough<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.480> help<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.079> seed<00:01:01.320> sprout<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
coat enough to help the seed sprout the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.350 
coat enough to help the seed sprout the
third<00:01:02.969> way<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.719> actually<00:01:03.840> Knick<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.949> seed

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
third way is to actually Knick the seed

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.149 
third way is to actually Knick the seed
now<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> riskiest<00:01:07.200> way<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:08.010> be

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
now this is the riskiest way so do be

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.550 
now this is the riskiest way so do be
careful<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.700> decide<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.210> try<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.720> wear

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
careful if you decide to try this wear

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560 
careful if you decide to try this wear
gloves<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.189> use<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> knife<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.450> sharp

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
gloves and use a knife that's sharp

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.469 
gloves and use a knife that's sharp
enough<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.409> Nick<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> seed<00:01:14.070> easily<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.270> seeds

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
enough to Nick the seed easily the seeds

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.140 
enough to Nick the seed easily the seeds
are<00:01:15.600> also<00:01:15.750> very<00:01:16.140> small<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.700> careful

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
are also very small so be careful

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.929 
are also very small so be careful
remember<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.549> morning-glory<00:01:20.549> seeds

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
remember that morning-glory seeds

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.520 
remember that morning-glory seeds
germinate<00:01:21.890> between<00:01:22.890> 59<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.720> 90<00:01:24.720> degrees<00:01:25.140> so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
germinate between 59 and 90 degrees so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.770 
germinate between 59 and 90 degrees so
if<00:01:26.040> you're<00:01:26.189> having<00:01:26.430> trouble<00:01:27.000> getting<00:01:27.210> your

if you're having trouble getting your
seats<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.229> germinate<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.829> may<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.340> it's

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
seats to germinate it may be that it's

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.789 
seats to germinate it may be that it's
too<00:01:29.729> cool<00:01:30.030> outside<00:01:30.329> or<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.439> might<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.650> that

too cool outside or it might be that
it's<00:01:32.070> too<00:01:32.310> hot<00:01:32.960> once<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.140> seeds<00:01:34.380> germinate<00:01:34.979> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
it's too hot once the seeds germinate it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.460 
it's too hot once the seeds germinate it
won't<00:01:35.759> be<00:01:35.909> long<00:01:36.119> before<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.960> beautiful
