some other object boots would not be

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.999 
some other object boots would not be
circulating<00:01:02.750> through<00:01:02.930> it<00:01:02.989> would<00:01:03.770> make<00:01:03.980> a

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
trail like that and this particle here

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.550 
trail like that and this particle here
is<00:01:07.160> a<00:01:07.220> deputy<00:01:08.180> particle<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:09.229> can<00:01:09.380> see

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
is a deputy particle and you can see

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.230 
is a deputy particle and you can see
that<00:01:09.710> it's<00:01:09.890> basically<00:01:10.310> it<00:01:10.490> hasn't<00:01:10.880> moved<00:01:10.970> at

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
that it's basically it hasn't moved at

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
thousand kilometers an hour and if you

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.440 
thousand kilometers an hour and if you
do<00:04:15.690> this<00:04:15.840> then<00:04:16.560> this<00:04:16.919> tiny<00:04:17.340> object<00:04:17.789> here<00:04:18.090> will

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
do this then this tiny object here will

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.349 
do this then this tiny object here will
cause<00:04:18.900> such<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.530> crater<00:04:19.919> so<00:04:20.789> what<00:04:20.940> one<00:04:21.090> tries<00:04:21.329> to

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
cause such a crater so what one tries to

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.870 
cause such a crater so what one tries to
do<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.900> improve<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.800> shields<00:04:23.250> in<00:04:23.430> order<00:04:23.820> to

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
do is improve the shields in order to

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.969 
do is improve the shields in order to
increase<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.840> shielding<00:04:25.169> capability<00:04:25.770> from

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
increase the shielding capability from

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.250 
increase the shielding capability from
one<00:04:26.250> centimeter<00:04:26.729> upwards<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.479> the<00:04:28.110> other

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
one centimeter upwards and the other

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.990 
one centimeter upwards and the other
thing<00:04:28.349> is<00:04:28.530> we<00:04:29.070> try<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.370> improve<00:04:29.820> the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
thing is we try to improve the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.909 
thing is we try to improve the
observations<00:04:30.659> to<00:04:30.930> reduce<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.560> tracking

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
observations to reduce the tracking

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.810 
observations to reduce the tracking
threshold<00:04:32.430> from<00:04:32.640> 10<00:04:32.849> centimeters

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
threshold from 10 centimeters

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.330 
threshold from 10 centimeters
so<00:04:34.330> there's<00:04:34.510> three<00:04:34.930> centimeters<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.800> grey

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
so there's three centimeters of grey

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.340
