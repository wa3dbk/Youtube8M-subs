that<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.959> know<00:03:16.590> there's<00:03:16.829> also<00:03:17.069> he<00:03:17.280> does<00:03:17.459> shoot

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
that you know there's also he does shoot

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.190 
that you know there's also he does shoot
real<00:03:17.910> bullets<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.329> things<00:03:18.450> like<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.900> do

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
real bullets and things like that I do

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.300 
real bullets and things like that I do
think<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.680> kind<00:03:19.889> of<00:03:19.950> would<00:03:20.069> have<00:03:20.190> been<00:03:20.280> a

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
think it kind of would have been a

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.830 
think it kind of would have been a
cooler<00:03:20.700> movie<00:03:21.090> though<00:03:21.269> if<00:03:21.419> they<00:03:21.540> could<00:03:21.750> have

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
cooler movie though if they could have

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.259 
cooler movie though if they could have
gone<00:03:22.440> for<00:03:22.980> an<00:03:23.160> R<00:03:23.280> rating<00:03:23.669> and<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.819> had<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.120> really

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
gone for an R rating and I had to really

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.150 
gone for an R rating and I had to really
worry<00:03:24.569> about<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.810> could<00:03:25.049> even<00:03:25.139> tell<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.680> couple

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
worry about you could even tell a couple

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.190 
worry about you could even tell a couple
times<00:03:26.519> they<00:03:26.730> had<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:26.940> cut<00:03:27.120> away<00:03:27.269> from<00:03:28.109> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
times they had to cut away from the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.319 
times they had to cut away from the
language<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:29.310> know<00:03:29.340> they<00:03:29.669> were<00:03:29.970> going<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.180> say

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
language you know they were going to say

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.400 
language you know they were going to say
something<00:03:30.359> you<00:03:30.810> know<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.079> they<00:03:31.169> have<00:03:31.290> to

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
something you know that they have to

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.440 
something you know that they have to
consent<00:03:31.709> cut<00:03:31.950> away<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:32.819> kind<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.209> stuff

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
consent cut away so that kind of stuff

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.629 
consent cut away so that kind of stuff
was<00:03:34.049> one<00:03:34.200> of<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.319> biggest<00:03:34.440> downfalls<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.489> have

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
was one of the biggest downfalls I have

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.009 
was one of the biggest downfalls I have
a<00:03:35.669> feeling<00:03:36.000> knowing<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.239> comes<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.630> blu-ray

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
a feeling knowing this comes the blu-ray

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.800 
a feeling knowing this comes the blu-ray
that's<00:03:37.560> going<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.829> end<00:03:37.859> up<00:03:38.099> being<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.780> like<00:03:39.780> a

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
that's going to end up being a like a

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.229 
that's going to end up being a like a
director's<00:03:40.349> cut<00:03:40.650> or<00:03:40.919> an<00:03:41.430> uncut<00:03:41.760> version<00:03:42.150> you

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
director's cut or an uncut version you

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.449 
director's cut or an uncut version you
know<00:03:42.329> if<00:03:43.019> they<00:03:43.230> even<00:03:43.260> shot<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.190> because<00:03:44.370> you

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
know if they even shot it because you

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.039 
know if they even shot it because you
know<00:03:44.579> with<00:03:45.150> this<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.450> really<00:03:45.720> don't<00:03:45.900> know<00:03:46.019> if

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
know with this you really don't know if

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.770 
know with this you really don't know if
they<00:03:46.380> are<00:03:46.410> aiming<00:03:46.799> for<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.220> pg-13<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.599> whole

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
they are aiming for a pg-13 the whole

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.879 
they are aiming for a pg-13 the whole
time<00:03:48.989> they<00:03:49.109> may<00:03:49.230> not<00:03:49.349> have<00:03:49.500> even<00:03:49.560> bothered

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
time they may not have even bothered

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.030 
time they may not have even bothered
with<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.819> alternate<00:03:51.269> takes<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:52.290> said<00:03:52.980> I

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
with the alternate takes I I said I

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.129 
with the alternate takes I I said I
didn't<00:03:53.310> hate<00:03:53.459> this<00:03:53.639> one<00:03:53.880> but<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.510> doesn't<00:03:54.930> it's

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
didn't hate this one but it doesn't it's

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.839 
didn't hate this one but it doesn't it's
not<00:03:55.290> those<00:03:55.500> ones<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.829> has<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.220> exist<00:03:56.340> but<00:03:56.730> you

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
not those ones it has to exist but you

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.339 
not those ones it has to exist but you
could<00:03:57.000> say<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.180> with<00:03:57.780> pretty<00:03:57.989> much<00:03:58.109> all

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
could say that with pretty much all

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.520 
could say that with pretty much all
remakes<00:03:58.829> they<00:03:58.980> don't<00:03:59.160> have<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.730> exist<00:04:00.090> but<00:04:00.840> it

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
remakes they don't have to exist but it

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.830 
remakes they don't have to exist but it
what<00:04:01.919> it<00:04:02.040> did<00:04:02.220> though<00:04:02.430> was<00:04:02.660> really<00:04:03.660> go<00:04:03.810> a

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
what it did though was really go a

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.449 
what it did though was really go a
different<00:04:04.109> direction<00:04:04.379> and<00:04:04.859> wasn't<00:04:05.160> really

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
different direction and wasn't really

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.339 
different direction and wasn't really
making<00:04:05.669> the<00:04:06.030> exact<00:04:06.359> same<00:04:06.599> movie<00:04:06.900> again<00:04:07.139> and

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
making the exact same movie again and

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.020 
making the exact same movie again and
that<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.470> liked<00:04:07.829> was<00:04:08.099> that<00:04:08.129> it<00:04:08.609> had<00:04:08.669> some

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
that I liked was that it had some

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.729 
that I liked was that it had some
different<00:04:09.359> aspects<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:09.989> different

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
different aspects to it different

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.589 
different aspects to it different
technologies<00:04:11.459> different<00:04:12.239> things<00:04:12.389> like<00:04:12.510> that

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
technologies different things like that

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.539 
technologies different things like that
and<00:04:12.780> put<00:04:13.079> more<00:04:13.379> with<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.650> family<00:04:14.099> in<00:04:14.129> there

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
and put more with the family in there

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.150 
and put more with the family in there
and<00:04:14.760> more<00:04:15.359> emotional<00:04:15.930> things<00:04:16.199> to<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.650> they

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
and more emotional things to it they

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.310 
and more emotional things to it they
also<00:04:17.340> had<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.729> ability<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.180> control<00:04:18.660> the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
also had the ability to control the

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.529 
also had the ability to control the
Robocop<00:04:19.859> character<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.370> whole<00:04:20.639> lot<00:04:20.820> more<00:04:21.150> than

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
Robocop character a whole lot more than

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.050 
Robocop character a whole lot more than
in<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.109> original<00:04:22.560> one<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.880> kind

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
in the original one and that that kind

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.230 
in the original one and that that kind
of<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.300> pain<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:24.960> know<00:04:25.080> some<00:04:25.289> of<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.409> times

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
of a pain you know some of the times

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.930 
of a pain you know some of the times
overall<00:04:27.240> though<00:04:27.450> I

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
overall though I

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.180 
overall though I
didn't<00:04:28.150> hate<00:04:28.390> it<00:04:28.420> I<00:04:29.380> think<00:04:29.860> people<00:04:30.130> will

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
didn't hate it I think people will

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.430 
didn't hate it I think people will
probably<00:04:30.430> like<00:04:30.910> it<00:04:30.940> but<00:04:31.600> I<00:04:31.660> think<00:04:31.750> you<00:04:32.260> know

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
probably like it but I think you know

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.800 
probably like it but I think you know
the<00:04:32.710> pg-13<00:04:33.370> really<00:04:33.700> does<00:04:33.940> take<00:04:34.270> away<00:04:34.510> from<00:04:34.690> it

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
the pg-13 really does take away from it

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.920 
the pg-13 really does take away from it
a<00:04:34.900> bit<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.370> thought<00:04:36.370> some<00:04:36.610> of<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:36.760> music<00:04:37.240> during

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
a bit I thought some of the music during

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.630 
a bit I thought some of the music during
some<00:04:38.170> of<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.290> fights<00:04:38.530> was<00:04:38.770> not<00:04:39.130> exactly

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
some of the fights was not exactly

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.910 
some of the fights was not exactly
perfect<00:04:40.330> i<00:04:40.420> would<00:04:40.600> have<00:04:40.720> kind<00:04:41.290> of<00:04:41.380> rather<00:04:41.560> had

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
perfect i would have kind of rather had

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.740 
perfect i would have kind of rather had
more<00:04:42.310> of<00:04:42.400> an<00:04:42.490> elected<00:04:42.880> have<00:04:43.450> kind<00:04:43.690> of

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
more of an elected have kind of

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.570 
more of an elected have kind of
electronic<00:04:44.320> kind<00:04:44.890> of<00:04:44.950> music<00:04:45.250> but<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.460> music

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
electronic kind of music but the music

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.420 
electronic kind of music but the music
they<00:04:45.910> picked<00:04:46.180> was<00:04:46.870> not<00:04:47.170> perfect<00:04:47.950> it<00:04:48.070> was<00:04:48.160> not
