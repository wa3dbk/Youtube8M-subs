like<00:01:03.480> i<00:01:03.719> don't<00:01:04.350> know<00:01:04.440> it<00:01:04.680> does<00:01:05.190> weird<00:01:05.400> things

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
like i don't know it does weird things

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.180 
like i don't know it does weird things
to<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.909> gun<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.810> reduces<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.500> range<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
to the gun like reduces the range and

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.710 
to the gun like reduces the range and
reduces<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> damage<00:01:08.820> though<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.450> takes<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
reduces the damage though it takes a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.080 
reduces the damage though it takes a
little<00:01:09.840> bit<00:01:09.990> longer<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.580> i<00:01:11.760> often

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
little bit longer to do that i often

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.730 
little bit longer to do that i often
reduces<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> damage<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.260> reduces<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
reduces the damage but it reduces the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.140 
reduces the damage but it reduces the
brain<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.310> then<00:01:14.430> there's<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> whole<00:01:14.790> range

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
brain to then there's the whole range

with<00:03:14.550> flak<00:03:14.790> jacket<00:03:15.180> for<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.420> perk<00:03:15.630> 1<00:03:15.810> greed<00:03:16.080> I

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
with flak jacket for the perk 1 greed I

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.440 
with flak jacket for the perk 1 greed I
don't<00:03:17.100> think<00:03:17.160> flak<00:03:17.520> jacket<00:03:17.910> really<00:03:18.060> does<00:03:18.240> much

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
don't think flak jacket really does much

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.130 
don't think flak jacket really does much
for<00:03:18.660> me<00:03:18.750> in<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.970> this<00:03:20.970> game<00:03:21.180> but<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.750> think

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
for me in this this game but I think

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.590 
for me in this this game but I think
that<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.130> is<00:03:23.160> useful<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.940> lot<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.150> games<00:03:24.300> and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
that it is useful in a lot of games and

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.320 
that it is useful in a lot of games and
I<00:03:24.900> think<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.440> would<00:03:26.400> actually<00:03:26.490> rather<00:03:26.940> had

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
I think I would actually rather had

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.610 
I think I would actually rather had
extreme<00:03:27.810> conditioning<00:03:28.200> cuz<00:03:28.350> I'm<00:03:28.410> running

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
extreme conditioning cuz I'm running

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.960 
extreme conditioning cuz I'm running
around<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.890> map<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.070> lot<00:03:29.340> as<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.550> see<00:03:29.760> cuz<00:03:29.940> I

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
around the map a lot as you see cuz I

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.400 
around the map a lot as you see cuz I
like<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.209> stick<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.600> outskirts<00:03:31.020> of<00:03:31.290> the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
like to stick to the outskirts of the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.840 
like to stick to the outskirts of the
map<00:03:31.560> when<00:03:31.770> I'm<00:03:31.860> what<00:03:32.100> I'm<00:03:32.190> doing<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.490> series

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.210 
with SMG or an assault rifle or
something<00:03:42.270> or<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:43.320> know<00:03:43.440> when<00:03:43.709> their<00:03:43.860> snipers

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
something or you know when their snipers

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.040 
something or you know when their snipers
in<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.370> map<00:03:44.550> like<00:03:44.760> you've<00:03:44.880> seen<00:03:45.120> like<00:03:45.750> at

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
in the map like you've seen like at

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.510 
in the map like you've seen like at
least<00:03:46.140> two<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.500> them<00:03:46.620> in<00:03:46.950> this<00:03:47.100> game<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:49.650> like

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
least two of them in this game so like

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.949 
least two of them in this game so like
60<00:03:50.820> outskirts<00:03:51.270> in<00:03:51.360> extreme<00:03:51.660> conditioning

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
60 outskirts in extreme conditioning

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.300 
60 outskirts in extreme conditioning
would<00:03:52.080> have<00:03:52.170> helped<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.380> lot<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:52.980> think<00:03:53.130> that

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
would have helped a lot so I think that

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.730 
would have helped a lot so I think that
would<00:03:53.730> be<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.880> better<00:03:54.060> one<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.330> use<00:03:54.450> also<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.410> find

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
would be a better one to use also I find

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.199 
would be a better one to use also I find
in<00:03:55.860> free-for-all<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.340> lot<00:03:56.550> of<00:03:56.640> people<00:03:56.760> use

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
in free-for-all a lot of people use

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.170 
in free-for-all a lot of people use
tackle<00:03:57.959> equipment<00:03:58.680> like<00:03:59.340> shock<00:03:59.550> charges<00:04:00.030> and

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
tackle equipment like shock charges and

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.330 
tackle equipment like shock charges and
stuff<00:04:00.390> so<00:04:00.709> tactical<00:04:01.709> mask<00:04:01.920> might<00:04:02.130> have<00:04:02.220> been<00:04:02.310> a

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
stuff so tactical mask might have been a

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.180 
stuff so tactical mask might have been a
better<00:04:02.459> choice<00:04:02.580> also<00:04:02.940> but<00:04:03.950> whatever<00:04:04.950> i'm

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
better choice also but whatever i'm

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.350 
better choice also but whatever i'm
thinking<00:04:05.490> affects<00:04:05.700> me<00:04:05.820> much<00:04:05.970> in<00:04:06.060> this<00:04:06.150> game

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
thinking affects me much in this game

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.250 
thinking affects me much in this game
that's<00:04:06.510> why<00:04:06.630> i<00:04:06.660> wish<00:04:06.810> i<00:04:06.900> had<00:04:07.020> extreme

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
that's why i wish i had extreme

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.740 
that's why i wish i had extreme
conditioning<00:04:07.680> but<00:04:08.180> like<00:04:09.180> i<00:04:09.300> said<00:04:09.330> what<00:04:09.660> can

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
conditioning but like i said what can

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.960 
conditioning but like i said what can
you<00:04:09.810> do<00:04:09.930> once<00:04:10.140> it<00:04:10.230> started<00:04:10.590> right<00:04:10.739> so<00:04:11.310> then<00:04:11.850> i'm

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
you do once it started right so then i'm

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.050 
you do once it started right so then i'm
also<00:04:12.150> running<00:04:12.450> toughness<00:04:13.050> and<00:04:13.230> scavenger

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
also running toughness and scavenger

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.270 
also running toughness and scavenger
that's<00:04:15.060> my<00:04:15.270> to<00:04:16.080> greed<00:04:16.380> because<00:04:16.680> you<00:04:17.160> know<00:04:17.250> i

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
don't have to run a primary so i can

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.140

idea maybe just give this a shot and try

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.370 
idea maybe just give this a shot and try
it<00:06:49.240> out<00:06:49.330> for<00:06:49.450> yourself<00:06:49.510> and<00:06:50.020> let<00:06:50.139> me<00:06:50.230> know<00:06:50.350> how

it<00:06:50.620> goes<00:06:50.650> and<00:06:51.100> then<00:06:51.280> maybe<00:06:52.030> your<00:06:52.270> mind<00:06:52.600> will

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
it goes and then maybe your mind will

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.220 
it goes and then maybe your mind will
change<00:06:53.639> its<00:06:54.639> not<00:06:54.790> easiest<00:06:55.330> but<00:06:55.510> i'm<00:06:55.630> sure<00:06:55.660> some

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230
