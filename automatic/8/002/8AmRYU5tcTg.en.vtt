00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.310 
bread it's a nice sunny day today you
know<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:44.030> there's<00:03:44.300> a<00:03:44.360> lot<00:03:44.390> of<00:03:44.570> fish<00:03:44.810> up<00:03:45.020> near

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
know so there's a lot of fish up near

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.280 
know so there's a lot of fish up near
the<00:03:45.440> surface<00:03:45.740> I<00:03:46.100> can<00:03:46.250> see<00:03:46.490> fish<00:03:46.820> now<00:03:47.290> ghosties

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
the surface I can see fish now ghosties

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.220 
the surface I can see fish now ghosties
and<00:03:48.320> Commons<00:03:49.010> all<00:03:49.550> sorts<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.180> caught<00:03:50.450> just

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.800 
and Commons all sorts of caught just
under<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.680> surface<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:52.720> hopefully<00:03:53.720> we<00:03:53.780> can

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
under the surface so hopefully we can

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.050 
under the surface so hopefully we can
catch<00:03:54.140> some<00:03:54.410> bigger<00:03:54.650> fish<00:03:54.770> on<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.850> bread
