recordings it's a real punchy tone when

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.719 
recordings it's a real punchy tone when
you're<00:04:54.870> when<00:04:55.080> you're<00:04:55.110> plucking<00:04:55.439> it<00:04:55.680> hard<00:04:55.889> and

you're when you're plucking it hard and

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:57.950 
you're when you're plucking it hard and
doing<00:04:56.849> some<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.240> those<00:04:57.330> things<00:04:57.569> of<00:04:57.659> course<00:04:57.779> the

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
doing some of those things of course the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.890 
doing some of those things of course the
best<00:04:58.110> way<00:04:58.229> to<00:04:58.319> sound<00:04:58.590> like<00:04:58.710> Robert<00:04:59.069> Johnson<00:04:59.490> is

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
best way to sound like Robert Johnson is

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.269 
best way to sound like Robert Johnson is
to<00:05:00.900> be<00:05:01.020> able<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.199> play<00:05:01.379> like<00:05:01.409> Robert<00:05:01.919> Johnson

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:02.279 
to be able to play like Robert Johnson

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.760 
to be able to play like Robert Johnson
but<00:05:02.400> anyway<00:05:02.699> that's<00:05:03.389> another<00:05:03.750> video<00:05:04.349> I<00:05:04.409> guess

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
but anyway that's another video I guess

for a little while quite a bit of money

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.320 
for a little while quite a bit of money
this<00:05:19.830> actually<00:05:20.250> would<00:05:20.310> make<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.520> great<00:05:20.729> travel

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
this actually would make a great travel

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.939 
this actually would make a great travel
sized<00:05:21.509> guitar<00:05:21.930> and<00:05:22.259> one<00:05:22.439> of<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.560> great<00:05:22.710> things

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
sized guitar and one of the great things

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.129 
sized guitar and one of the great things
that<00:05:23.009> they<00:05:23.159> did<00:05:23.370> on<00:05:23.520> this<00:05:23.789> that<00:05:24.089> a<00:05:24.300> lot<00:05:24.659> of<00:05:24.900> the

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
that they did on this that a lot of the

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.700 
that they did on this that a lot of the
little<00:05:26.300> auditorium<00:05:27.300> sizes<00:05:27.689> didn't<00:05:28.020> do<00:05:28.110> is<00:05:28.500> it

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
little auditorium sizes didn't do is it

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.189 
little auditorium sizes didn't do is it
still<00:05:28.889> kept<00:05:29.069> a<00:05:29.129> full<00:05:29.339> length<00:05:29.550> scale<00:05:30.000> and<00:05:30.330> so

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
still kept a full length scale and so

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.139 
still kept a full length scale and so
it's<00:05:31.349> a<00:05:31.469> I<00:05:31.740> believe<00:05:31.979> 25<00:05:32.550> and<00:05:32.729> a<00:05:32.759> quarter<00:05:33.029> inch

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:33.149 
it's a I believe 25 and a quarter inch

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:35.029 
it's a I believe 25 and a quarter inch
of<00:05:33.240> scale<00:05:33.449> and<00:05:33.719> so<00:05:34.259> you<00:05:34.319> don't<00:05:34.680> feel<00:05:34.830> cramped

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
of scale and so you don't feel cramped

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.499 
of scale and so you don't feel cramped
on<00:05:35.339> it<00:05:35.490> like<00:05:35.610> you<00:05:35.759> do<00:05:35.849> on<00:05:35.969> some<00:05:36.180> of<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.330> travel

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
on it like you do on some of the travel

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.540 
on it like you do on some of the travel
guitars<00:05:36.960> which<00:05:37.169> I<00:05:37.379> use<00:05:37.589> a<00:05:37.620> shorter<00:05:38.069> scale<00:05:38.310> as

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
guitars which I use a shorter scale as

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.829 
guitars which I use a shorter scale as
well<00:05:38.699> what<00:05:39.210> they've<00:05:39.330> done<00:05:39.449> is<00:05:39.599> they've<00:05:39.719> moved

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:39.839 
well what they've done is they've moved

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.899 
well what they've done is they've moved
the<00:05:39.990> bridge<00:05:40.199> further<00:05:40.529> down<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:40.919> body<00:05:41.129> and<00:05:41.399> get

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
the bridge further down the body and get

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.999 
the bridge further down the body and get
the<00:05:42.000> same<00:05:42.210> scale<00:05:42.569> length<00:05:42.870> this<00:05:43.469> one<00:05:43.710> connects

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
the same scale length this one connects

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.399 
the same scale length this one connects
at<00:05:44.159> the<00:05:44.250> 12th<00:05:44.550> fret<00:05:44.699> the<00:05:45.389> other<00:05:45.810> two<00:05:45.990> connected

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
at the 12th fret the other two connected

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.829 
at the 12th fret the other two connected
14th<00:05:46.919> fret<00:05:47.189> which<00:05:48.029> is<00:05:48.060> more<00:05:48.300> what<00:05:48.360> we're<00:05:48.659> used
