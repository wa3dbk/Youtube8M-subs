00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
Abraham Darby patented a process for

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.030 
Abraham Darby patented a process for
casting<00:01:09.150> pots<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.960> pans<00:01:10.170> out<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> iron

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
casting pots and pans out of the iron

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.969 
casting pots and pans out of the iron
now<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.880> gave<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.600> way<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.470> types<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
now that gave the way to the types of

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.270 
now that gave the way to the types of
pots<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.310> pans<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.790> use<00:01:15.270> today<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.650> once

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
pots and pans that we use today so once

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.460 
pots and pans that we use today so once
you<00:01:17.490> get<00:01:17.670> cast<00:01:18.030> iron<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.960> prep<00:01:19.320> it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you get cast iron you have to prep it

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.780 
you get cast iron you have to prep it
for<00:01:19.500> use<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.340> done<00:01:20.549> through<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.759> process

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
for use this is done through a process

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.330 
for use this is done through a process
called<00:01:21.210> seasoning<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.290> basically<00:01:23.159> when

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
called seasoning and basically when

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
called seasoning and basically when
you've<00:01:23.460> seasoned<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.060> pen<00:01:24.299> you're<00:01:24.630> putting<00:01:24.990> fat

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
you've seasoned a pen you're putting fat

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.520 
you've seasoned a pen you're putting fat
inside<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:26.880> ridges<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.420> grooves

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
inside the little ridges and grooves

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.679 
inside the little ridges and grooves
inside<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.650> pan<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.700> baking<00:01:30.090> them<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
inside of pan and then baking them to

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.719 
inside of pan and then baking them to
create<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.079> slick<00:01:31.530> surface<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.549> cook

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
create a slick surface that you can cook

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.850 
create a slick surface that you can cook
on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.600> goal<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> fat<00:01:34.409> molecules

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
on the goal is to get the fat molecules

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.830 
on the goal is to get the fat molecules
consistently<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.729> evenly<00:01:35.850> spread<00:01:36.119> over<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
consistently and evenly spread over the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.179 
consistently and evenly spread over the
pan<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:37.530> bring<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.159> a

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
pan and then bring it up to a

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.280 
pan and then bring it up to a
temperature<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:39.390> allows<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.960> fat

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
temperature that allows the fat

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.740 
temperature that allows the fat
molecules<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.130> polymerize<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> pan<00:01:42.570> which

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
molecules to polymerize on the pan which

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.850 
molecules to polymerize on the pan which
is<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.020> say<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.320> they<00:01:43.439> create<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.189> matrix

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
is to say that they create a matrix
