550<00:01:48.210> k<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.869> mean<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.740> getting<00:01:50.159> ridiculous

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
550 k I mean this is getting ridiculous

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.609 
550 k I mean this is getting ridiculous
and<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.450> main<00:01:51.630> reason<00:01:52.110> why<00:01:52.259> I

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
