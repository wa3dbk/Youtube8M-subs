thought<00:04:03.269> that<00:04:03.420> was<00:04:03.600> my<00:04:03.750> role<00:04:03.959> in<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.290> and

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
thought that was my role in it and

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.930 
thought that was my role in it and
especially<00:04:06.030> with<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:06.989> nuclear<00:04:07.500> power

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
especially with the the nuclear power

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.890 
especially with the the nuclear power
disaster<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.230> also<00:04:11.220> felt<00:04:11.700> as<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.600> other

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
disaster I also felt as the other

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.590 
disaster I also felt as the other
members<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.710> our<00:04:13.830> group<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.330> that<00:04:15.330> would<00:04:15.510> be

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
members of our group that that would be

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.240 
members of our group that that would be
the<00:04:15.750> area<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:16.230> other<00:04:16.650> groups<00:04:16.950> would<00:04:17.100> be

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
the area that that other groups would be

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.760 
the area that that other groups would be
most<00:04:17.790> reluctant<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:18.480> go<00:04:18.600> into<00:04:18.930> because<00:04:19.290> of<00:04:19.470> the

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
most reluctant to go into because of the

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.720 
most reluctant to go into because of the
dangers<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:21.840> we<00:04:21.959> just<00:04:22.170> decided<00:04:22.530> that

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
dangers and so we just decided that

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.760 
dangers and so we just decided that
taking<00:04:23.730> in<00:04:23.850> account<00:04:24.230> the<00:04:25.230> risks<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.620> things

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
taking in account the risks and things

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.590 
taking in account the risks and things
we<00:04:26.040> still<00:04:26.250> felt<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:26.640> we<00:04:26.790> wanted<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.390> try<00:04:27.570> and

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
we still felt that we wanted to try and

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.510 
we still felt that we wanted to try and
do<00:04:27.750> what<00:04:27.870> we<00:04:27.960> could<00:04:28.200> do<00:04:28.920> you<00:04:29.190> have<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.340> website
