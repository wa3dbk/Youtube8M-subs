00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:08.330
 what do we do 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.340
 we highlight the depth of the roots 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.250
 seven plus gray on the percentage of gray hair 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.300
 We are not so big somewhere 40 percent 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.300
 probably in length we have a client with us 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.269
 painted paint 74 paint 74 took out 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.039
 left a shade of 73 we want something more 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.279
 naturally and in the area 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.619
 natural sevens for this we did 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.140
 have you knocked the loops so it was a little 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.840
 brighter and then we will 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.300
 we took this recipe 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.610
 the recipe on the roots we had a natural 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.399
 base 70 gray about 30 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.570
 percent and we took the next recipe we 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.379
 took 70 paint because we have gray 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.899
 plus 77 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.079
 this client desire was plus 6 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.739
 percentage oxide 77 we took twice 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.379
 more because gray hair is less than 50 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.899
 percent and xenon respectively took 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.650
 30 grams 100 paints only 30 grams 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.000
 the length of the painted base of us was 7 3 strands 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.650
 we made strands we had 83 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.780
 not to go into the blackout and remove 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.290
 the length of the gold we took on the tone 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.450
 lighter paint took 866 from paint 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.030
 which already contains purple 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.830
 pigment and yes how do we strand 83 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.710
 we did exactly the same 86 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.680
 will remove yellows and took a three percent 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.210
 oxide and one-to-one proportions now 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.340
 full of dryness 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.370
 and see what we have here in Italy 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.120
 already done highlighting highlighting 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.330
 pulled made mountain rotten will 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.030
 and 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:53.960
 one foot on the other hand and see what 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.960
 we made it 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.560
 footwear 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.050
 white 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:32.580
 here and frontal well we did not him 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.470
 for the sake of highlighting highlighting do for 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.020
 order to disengage the front parietal 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.070
 new someone for sex alif on oil 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.940
 choose between 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.070
 well we had a minute on the floor hit the floor 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.410
 And so you need a shot highlighting visually 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.840
 white lighter and made these 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.370
 Here are delicate very beautiful 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.370
