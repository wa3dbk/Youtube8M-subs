larger<00:00:03.780> plants<00:00:04.319> now<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.220> larger<00:00:06.029> plant<00:00:06.390> is

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
larger plants now a larger plant is

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.470 
larger plants now a larger plant is
going<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.259> be<00:00:07.560> heavier<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.370> lift<00:00:08.639> it's<00:00:09.269> going

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
going to be heavier to lift it's going

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.320 
going to be heavier to lift it's going
to<00:00:09.570> be<00:00:09.690> more<00:00:09.900> difficult<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.530> maneuver<00:00:11.330> but

three people depending on the size of
the<00:00:47.219> plant<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.910> size<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> container

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
the plant and the size of the container

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.959 
the plant and the size of the container
now<00:00:51.770> when<00:00:52.770> you're<00:00:52.920> dealing<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.579> larger

now when you're dealing with the larger

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.529 
now when you're dealing with the larger
plant<00:00:54.500> also<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:56.340> might<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> lot<00:00:57.300> more

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
plant also it might be a lot more

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.040 
plant also it might be a lot more
difficult<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.469> out<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> pot<00:00:59.160> so<00:01:00.149> with

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
difficult to get out of the pot so with

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.410 
difficult to get out of the pot so with
a<00:01:01.100> plastic<00:01:02.100> pot<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.239> take

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
a plastic pot like this you can take

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.500 
a plastic pot like this you can take
some<00:01:03.690> pruners<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:05.100> cut<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.790> pot<00:01:06.030> open

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
some pruners and just cut the pot open

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.940 
some pruners and just cut the pot open
and<00:01:07.400> break<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.610> pot<00:01:08.790> open<00:01:09.030> or<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.290> terracotta

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
and break the pot open or the terracotta

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.880 
and break the pot open or the terracotta
or<00:01:11.310> ceramic<00:01:11.909> use<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> hammer<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.110> smash<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
or ceramic use a hammer and smash the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.850 
or ceramic use a hammer and smash the
pot<00:01:14.070> open<00:01:14.540> then<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.140> take<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
pot open then you can just take the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.460 
pot open then you can just take the
plant<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.909> place<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.689> into<00:01:18.900> its<00:01:19.290> new

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
plant and place it into its new

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.690 
plant and place it into its new
container<00:01:20.689> add<00:01:21.689> more<00:01:22.020> soil<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.740> then<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
container add more soil and then the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.609 
container add more soil and then the
technique<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.450> pretty<00:01:24.720> much<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.140> same<00:01:25.320> for

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
technique is pretty much the same for

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.760 
technique is pretty much the same for
finishing<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:26.509> so<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.439> little

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
finishing up so this is a little

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.429 
finishing up so this is a little
demonstration<00:01:28.979> here

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
look how when I add this bamboo plant

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.809 
look how when I add this bamboo plant
into<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:38.149> pot<00:01:38.420> look<00:01:38.990> how<00:01:39.140> nice<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:39.619> looks<00:01:39.819> and
