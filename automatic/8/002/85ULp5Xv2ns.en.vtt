00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.370
 a stage marked by the heat in the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.390
 Andes experience 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.060
 It has been the constant 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.860
 marc coma and cyril of second and third 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.870
 respectively they have always rolled 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.729
 together but for the first time since the 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.979
 exit the French marches forward and 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.409
 will already two minutes to coma advancing 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.210
 what in the general to the new club keeps 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.520
 a regular rhythm and ends in fourth 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.530
 position 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.140
 the general classification continues to clarify 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.000
 already there are big differences great 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.829
 barrier edges here more than 13 minutes to 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.460
 the competition led by cyril despres 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.460
 and mark eat 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.530
 finally the third special has not 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.450
 has been cropped and has offered the 300 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.220
 kilometers planned pilots 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.410
 including favorites have had 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.240
 many navigational difficulties and it's 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.680
 nani roma with their mini they have found 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.820
 the shortest way to reach the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.500
 goal 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.000
 the leaders have opened track but they 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.280
 have lost due to the absence of 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.410
 footprints on the track so the group 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.810
 formed by peta consell al attiyah and 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.420
 sainz and divides accuses the blow when passing 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.310
 by the first waypoint newfoundland limits 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.380
 the damage and ends less than five 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.660
 minutes of Rome that wins this third 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.060
 stage with a totally classification 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.040
 unexpected indeed among the ten 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.620
 first are the Polish holowczyc in 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.970
 second position and the South African peter 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.040
 in third 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.140
 seagate and grove gordon also perform 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.420
 a good job placing himself in fifth and 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.220
 sixth position respectively in the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.350
 general nani roma has hit a big blow 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.510
 by leaving the minis of your first two 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.370
 persecutors of renovation and attiyah to 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.360
 nine and ten minutes respectively 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.890
 stefan pk consell loses almost 30 minutes 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.530
 we have crossed an off-piste with a 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.940
 abundant vegetation and when leaving there 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.200
 we had three of the four wheels 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.640
 punctured 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.220
 we have gotten into the mouth of the wolf 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.810
 because we had no other choice but not 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.140
 we thought we were going to click three 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.140
 wheels 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.969
 here we have a bitch known baldwin 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.890
 by his ballistic nickname the American 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.780
 who has already won other rallies and returns 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.299
 for the second time in the dakar after his 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.219
 first experience in 2009 had 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.810
 greater ambitions before the departure of 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.299
 the test this year reach the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.340
 national supremacy yes I can finish 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.260
 ahead of robby gordon will always be 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.329
 a victory is the second objective of 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.980
 my list first win the race and 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.680
 then if you can not beat the rubin 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.870
 dreaming is important I think everyone 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.150
 we must dream in ibi chase albo dreamer 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.290
 at the moment the two American pilots 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.790
 they have difficult 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.189
 robby gordon was more than three hours 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.769
 of the leader dj baldwin is in the position 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:38.960
 number 81 to more than 7 hours from the head 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.210

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.070

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.020
 leader in cars has been a good day for 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.630
 the secondo nani roma makes a 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.890
 double the stage and the general one occurs 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.530
 a change in the sort order 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.170
 general stefan pk consell is the great 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.810
