ladder

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
ladder

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.709 
ladder
like<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> ladder<00:00:50.129> straight<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:51.449> want

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
like a ladder straight you don't want

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.470 
like a ladder straight you don't want
pure<00:00:52.110> vertical<00:00:52.800> speed<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.610> don't<00:00:54.090> want<00:00:54.270> that

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
pure vertical speed you don't want that

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.600 
pure vertical speed you don't want that
like<00:00:54.690> no<00:00:54.840> matter<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.110> your<00:00:55.800> mind<00:00:56.100> tells<00:00:56.219> you

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
like no matter what your mind tells you

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760 
like no matter what your mind tells you
that's<00:00:57.090> not<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.539> entire<00:00:57.840> point<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.410> lot<00:00:58.590> of

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
that's not the entire point a lot of

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.369 
that's not the entire point a lot of
shaping<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.370> big<00:00:59.969> part<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.480> getting<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.260> your

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
shaping a big part of getting to be your

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.460 
shaping a big part of getting to be your
destination<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> ladder<00:01:03.180> strafe<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.719> also

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
destination with a ladder strafe is also

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.440 
destination with a ladder strafe is also
horizontal<00:01:05.010> speed<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:05.970> not<00:01:06.119> sure<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.360> we're

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
horizontal speed I'm not sure if we're

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.580 
horizontal speed I'm not sure if we're
using<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.810> under<00:01:07.049> percent<00:01:07.229> right<00:01:07.470> now<00:01:07.560> I

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
using that under percent right now I

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.190 
using that under percent right now I
really<00:01:07.770> care<00:01:08.180> well<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.330> means<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.930> want<00:01:10.110> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
really care well that means you want to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.000 
really care well that means you want to
come<00:01:10.380> off<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.250> ladder<00:01:12.650> horizontally<00:01:13.650> or<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
come off the ladder horizontally or to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.789 
come off the ladder horizontally or to
like<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:15.119> side<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.810> another<00:01:15.990> side<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.530> also

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
like one side to another side and also

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.620 
like one side to another side and also
vertically<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.820> want<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.270> when<00:01:18.509> you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
vertically so you want to like when you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.690 
vertically so you want to like when you
finally<00:01:18.900> come<00:01:19.229> off<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> ladder<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.430> want<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
finally come off the ladder you want to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
finally come off the ladder you want to
be<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.390> direction<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:22.080> sends<00:01:22.409> you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
be going in a direction that sends you

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.740 
be going in a direction that sends you
to<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.770> side<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.280> also<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.820> up<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.630> that

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
to the side but also going up so that

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.210 
to the side but also going up so that
usually<00:01:24.900> works<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.040> like

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
usually works if you can do it like

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.190 
usually works if you can do it like
right<00:01:26.640> around<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> left<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> top<00:01:27.720> corner

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
right around the left of the top corner

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.590 
right around the left of the top corner
of<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> ladder<00:01:29.369> now<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:29.970> gonna<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
of the ladder now I'm gonna do it the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.210 
of the ladder now I'm gonna do it the
easier<00:01:31.049> way<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.259> do<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.770> ladder<00:01:31.890> stress

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
easier way to do the ladder stress

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.100 
easier way to do the ladder stress
because<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.329> front<00:01:33.600> ways<00:01:33.780> but

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
because you can do it front ways but

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.800 
because you can do it front ways but
it's<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:34.470> harder<00:01:34.799> from<00:01:35.250> me<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.640> go<00:01:36.479> up<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
it's a little harder from me I go up to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
it's a little harder from me I go up to
the<00:01:36.930> top<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.380> ladder<00:01:37.500> close<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.640> out

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the top of a ladder close to it up out

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.359 
the top of a ladder close to it up out
here<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.290> want<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.530> go<00:01:40.619> up<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
here and I want to go up and to the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.880 
here and I want to go up and to the
right<00:01:41.460> now<00:01:42.030> before<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.930> do<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.200> I'm<00:01:43.409> my<00:01:43.619> tomato

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
right now before I do this I'm my tomato

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.200 
right now before I do this I'm my tomato
sake<00:01:44.130> don't<00:01:44.340> don't<00:01:44.729> judge<00:01:44.909> me<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.890> didn't<00:01:46.890> cool

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
sake don't don't judge me I didn't cool

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.850 
sake don't don't judge me I didn't cool
see<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.750> gives<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.140> enough<00:01:49.470> speed

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
see that it gives you enough speed

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.139 
see that it gives you enough speed
coming<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.299> around<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.130> going<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.520> high

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
coming up and around and going up high

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.959 
coming up and around and going up high
so<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.290> get<00:01:55.439> double<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.130> velocity<00:01:56.310> and

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
so you get double the velocity and

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.670 
so you get double the velocity and
that's<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.479> where<00:01:57.840> your<00:01:57.990> ladders<00:01:58.380> waves

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
that's really where your ladders waves

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.899 
that's really where your ladders waves
come<00:01:58.950> from<00:01:59.250> when<00:01:59.759> people<00:02:00.090> go<00:02:00.299> up<00:02:00.570> over<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> top

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
come from when people go up over the top

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.510 
come from when people go up over the top
that<00:02:02.909> makes<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.270> ten<00:02:03.570> times<00:02:03.780> harder<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:05.250> just

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
that makes it ten times harder so just

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.800 
that makes it ten times harder so just
get<00:02:05.700> near<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> top<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.479> ladder

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
get near the top of the ladder

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.650 
get near the top of the ladder
and<00:02:07.020> come<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.069> around

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
and come up and around

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.530 
and come up and around
like<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.590> but<00:02:09.800> suffer<00:02:10.160> make<00:02:10.340> it<00:02:10.520> so<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.150> all

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
like that but suffer make it so I all

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.660 
like that but suffer make it so I all
that<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.020> see<00:02:12.200> when<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:12.530> think<00:02:12.920> or<00:02:13.220> what<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.550> did

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
that the see when I think or what I did

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.040 
that the see when I think or what I did
there<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:13.940> automatically<00:02:14.540> know<00:02:14.720> what<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:14.870> did

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
there I automatically know what I did

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.750 
there I automatically know what I did
wrong<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.410> did<00:02:15.560> not<00:02:15.680> go<00:02:15.830> up<00:02:16.010> high<00:02:16.280> enough<00:02:16.520> so

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
wrong I did not go up high enough so

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.340 
wrong I did not go up high enough so
that<00:02:16.940> means<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.240> probably<00:02:17.270> came<00:02:17.630> off<00:02:17.660> the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
that means I probably came off the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.870 
that means I probably came off the
ladder<00:02:18.530> like<00:02:18.920> right<00:02:19.190> here<00:02:19.430> when<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:19.640> needed<00:02:19.820> to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
ladder like right here when I needed to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.850 
ladder like right here when I needed to
come<00:02:20.060> off<00:02:20.210> up<00:02:20.390> here<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:21.170> was<00:02:21.290> really<00:02:21.590> easy<00:02:21.770> to

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
come off up here it was really easy to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.740 
come off up here it was really easy to
identify<00:02:22.490> how<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:22.880> do<00:02:23.210> a<00:02:23.240> lot<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.510> stroke

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
identify how to do a lot of stroke

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.510 
identify how to do a lot of stroke
better<00:02:23.990> but<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:24.650> hard<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:24.830> do<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.160> on<00:02:25.280> your

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
better but it's hard to do it on your

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.650 
better but it's hard to do it on your
first<00:02:26.000> try<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.290> hope<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:27.740> video<00:02:28.010> helped
