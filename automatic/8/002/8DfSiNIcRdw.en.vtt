the<00:03:05.510> 300<00:03:06.050> I<00:03:06.200> when<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.069> turn<00:03:07.489> my<00:03:09.190> patrol<00:03:10.190> stick<00:03:10.750> up

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
the 300 I when I turn my patrol stick up

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.479 
the 300 I when I turn my patrol stick up
and<00:03:11.870> down<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:12.319> then<00:03:12.830> left<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:13.220> right<00:03:13.340> or

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
and down and then left and right or

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.790 
and down and then left and right or
actually<00:03:13.700> turn<00:03:13.880> whoever<00:03:14.420> for<00:03:14.930> this<00:03:15.050> one<00:03:15.230> it

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
actually turn whoever for this one it

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.670 
actually turn whoever for this one it
actually<00:03:15.950> has<00:03:16.220> petals<00:03:16.760> if<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.420> can<00:03:17.540> see<00:03:17.690> so

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
actually has petals if you can see so

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.680 
actually has petals if you can see so
instead<00:03:18.890> of<00:03:18.980> having<00:03:19.040> left<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.610> right<00:03:19.730> your<00:03:20.420> I

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
instead of having left and right your I

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.449 
instead of having left and right your I
think<00:03:20.959> that's<00:03:21.080> all<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:21.350> actually<00:03:21.920> has<00:03:22.130> petals

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
think that's all is actually has petals

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.520 
think that's all is actually has petals
that<00:03:22.610> it<00:03:22.790> has<00:03:22.910> four<00:03:23.840> years<00:03:23.989> go<00:03:24.110> up<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.410> down

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
that it has four years go up and down

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.449 
that it has four years go up and down
that<00:03:24.590> all<00:03:24.830> four<00:03:24.980> petals<00:03:25.569> so<00:03:26.569> it's<00:03:26.930> more<00:03:27.140> of<00:03:27.260> a

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
that all four petals so it's more of a

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.949 
that all four petals so it's more of a
military<00:03:28.459> ish<00:03:29.170> plane<00:03:30.170> fighter<00:03:31.360> but<00:03:32.360> i<00:03:32.720> just

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
military ish plane fighter but i just

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:33.940 
military ish plane fighter but i just
want<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.110> show<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:33.319> that<00:03:33.410> because<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.709> was<00:03:33.890> a

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
I've blasters haha and also I was

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.330 
I've blasters haha and also I was
looking<00:04:00.920> on<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:01.400> brochure<00:04:01.760> for<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.150> 300<00:04:02.810> ah

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
looking on the brochure for the 300 ah

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.150 
looking on the brochure for the 300 ah
yeah<00:04:04.340> 300<00:04:04.880> 325<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.870> sorry<00:04:06.350> not<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.769> racing<00:04:07.070> one

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
yeah 300 325 a sorry not the racing one

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.390 
yeah 300 325 a sorry not the racing one
and<00:04:07.370> it's<00:04:07.940> in<00:04:08.060> has<00:04:08.239> beds<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:09.920> looked<00:04:10.160> on<00:04:10.250> some

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
and it's in has beds so I looked on some

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.340 
and it's in has beds so I looked on some
images<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:10.910> just

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
images and just

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.390 
images and just
they're<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.160> beds<00:04:14.420> they're<00:04:15.420> inside<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:16.200> wall

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
they're the beds they're inside the wall

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.580 
they're the beds they're inside the wall
so<00:04:17.400> this<00:04:17.850> point<00:04:18.270> this<00:04:18.420> ship<00:04:18.870> does<00:04:19.170> have<00:04:19.350> beds

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
so this point this ship does have beds

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.310 
so this point this ship does have beds
and<00:04:19.860> storage<00:04:20.790> however<00:04:21.570> it's<00:04:21.900> not<00:04:21.959> actually

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
and storage however it's not actually

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.010 
and storage however it's not actually
accessible<00:04:22.620> at<00:04:22.860> this<00:04:23.010> time<00:04:23.190> so<00:04:23.910> actually<00:04:24.660> come

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
accessible at this time so actually come

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.710 
accessible at this time so actually come
underneath<00:04:25.530> these<00:04:25.770> panels<00:04:26.510> it'll<00:04:27.510> fall<00:04:27.690> out

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
underneath these panels it'll fall out

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.050 
underneath these panels it'll fall out
eventually<00:04:28.050> see<00:04:28.830> this<00:04:29.010> UT<00:04:29.610> would<00:04:29.760> actually

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
eventually see this UT would actually

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.750 
eventually see this UT would actually
maybe<00:04:30.450> going<00:04:30.720> back<00:04:30.810> in<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:30.990> pilot's<00:04:31.200> seat<00:04:31.350> and

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
maybe going back in the pilot's seat and

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.280 
maybe going back in the pilot's seat and
I<00:04:32.760> think<00:04:32.940> this<00:04:33.030> is<00:04:33.120> also<00:04:33.330> storage<00:04:33.750> in<00:04:33.870> here<00:04:34.050> a

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
I think this is also storage in here a

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.270 
I think this is also storage in here a
bigger<00:04:34.860> yeah<00:04:35.640> right<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:37.800> doesn't<00:04:38.040> come<00:04:38.160> up

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
bigger yeah right it doesn't come up

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.120 
bigger yeah right it doesn't come up
with<00:04:38.430> anything<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:39.450> while<00:04:40.110> on<00:04:40.170> this<00:04:40.290> side<00:04:40.470> it

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
with anything so while on this side it

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.550 
with anything so while on this side it
does<00:04:41.310> so<00:04:42.240> this<00:04:42.540> might<00:04:42.690> hear<00:04:43.200> actually<00:04:43.500> be

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
does so this might hear actually be

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.120
