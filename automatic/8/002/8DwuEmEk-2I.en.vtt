00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
November and I haven't worn it like

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.799 
November and I haven't worn it like
constantly<00:00:14.070> otherwise<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.389> wouldn't<00:00:15.630> have

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
constantly otherwise it wouldn't have

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.180 
constantly otherwise it wouldn't have
lasted<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.619> long

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
lasted this long

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.019 
lasted this long
I've<00:00:17.279> rotated<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:20.189> decided<00:00:20.880> to

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
I've rotated it and I just decided to

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.769 
I've rotated it and I just decided to
start<00:00:21.090> wearing<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.720> again<00:00:21.840> last<00:00:22.590> week<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.779> it

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
start wearing it again last week and it

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.960 
start wearing it again last week and it
still<00:00:25.080> looks<00:00:25.109> very<00:00:25.410> good<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.730> actually

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
still looks very good I just actually

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.519 
still looks very good I just actually
watched<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.630> today<00:00:28.939> it<00:00:29.939> originally<00:00:30.630> comes<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
watched it today it originally comes a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.060 
watched it today it originally comes a
lot<00:00:32.250> longer<00:00:32.460> than<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.329> probably<00:00:34.070> comes

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
lot longer than this it probably comes

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.190 
lot longer than this it probably comes
all<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.579> way<00:00:35.610> down<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:36.950> probably<00:00:37.950> under<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
all the way down here probably under the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.889 
all the way down here probably under the
boob<00:00:40.200> area<00:00:40.910> but<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> decided<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.510> cut<00:00:42.750> it

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
boob area but I decided to cut it

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.810 
boob area but I decided to cut it
because<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.500> way<00:00:43.800> too<00:00:43.829> long<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.760> was

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
because it was just way too long it was

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.299 
because it was just way too long it was
ridiculous<00:00:46.579> but<00:00:47.579> once<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.000> could<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.480> cut<00:00:48.840> about

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
ridiculous but once I could it cut about

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.819 
ridiculous but once I could it cut about
maybe<00:00:50.309> five<00:00:50.789> inches<00:00:51.390> off<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:52.289> looks<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.649> lot

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
maybe five inches off it looks a lot

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.450 
maybe five inches off it looks a lot
better<00:00:53.719> I<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> headband<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.219> mine

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
better I just have a headband on mine

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
better I just have a headband on mine
because<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.879> didn't<00:00:57.149> want<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.360> blend<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:57.809> hair

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
because I didn't want to blend my hair

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.220 
because I didn't want to blend my hair
because<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:59.010> know<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.609> lot<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.850> people<00:01:00.210> say<00:01:00.449> don't

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
because I know a lot of people say don't

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.110 
because I know a lot of people say don't
be<00:01:01.350> afraid<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.829> blend<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.280> my<00:01:02.460> hair<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.940> not

be afraid to blend but my hair is not

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.109 
be afraid to blend but my hair is not
gonna<00:01:03.439> cooperate<00:01:04.439> with<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.189> hair<00:01:05.640> texture

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
gonna cooperate with this hair texture

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.539 
kind of like dreading up a little bit if
you<00:02:25.440> can<00:02:25.590> see<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.209> look<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.390> went<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:27.959> there

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
you can see that look I went in there

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.020 
you can see that look I went in there
but<00:02:30.019> yeah<00:02:31.099> but<00:02:32.099> that's<00:02:32.250> fine<00:02:32.549> I<00:02:32.580> think<00:02:32.910> it's

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
but yeah but that's fine I think it's

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.640 
but yeah but that's fine I think it's
starting<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.390> look<00:02:33.510> more<00:02:34.080> realistic<00:02:36.650> the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
starting to look more realistic the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.640 
starting to look more realistic the
older<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.190> gets<00:02:38.220> that's<00:02:38.819> why<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> love<00:02:39.650> curly

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
older it gets that's why I love curly

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.140 
older it gets that's why I love curly
wigs<00:02:40.860> because<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.280> longer<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:41.640> have<00:02:41.910> them

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
wigs because the longer you have them

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.259 
wigs because the longer you have them
the<00:02:42.810> more<00:02:43.019> realistic<00:02:43.200> they<00:02:43.980> look<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.549> with

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
the more realistic they look and with

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.350 
the more realistic they look and with
curly<00:02:45.630> wigs<00:02:46.250> they<00:02:47.250> seem<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.700> last<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.209> lot

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
curly wigs they seem to last a lot

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.180 
curly wigs they seem to last a lot
longer<00:02:48.420> than<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.049> straight<00:02:49.410> synthetic<00:02:49.980> wigs

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
longer than the straight synthetic wigs

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.270 
longer than the straight synthetic wigs
because<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.900> don't<00:02:52.680> know<00:02:52.799> something<00:02:53.220> about

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
because I don't know something about

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.270 
because I don't know something about
straight<00:02:53.700> weeks<00:02:53.910> just<00:02:54.090> don't<00:02:54.329> last<00:02:54.540> long<00:02:55.280> if

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
straight weeks just don't last long if

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.860 
straight weeks just don't last long if
