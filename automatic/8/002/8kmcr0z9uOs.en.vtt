00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
help them take this industry for the

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.789 
help them take this industry for the
next<00:03:11.120> level<00:03:11.359> because<00:03:11.510> there's<00:03:12.049> a<00:03:12.109> lot<00:03:12.380> of<00:03:12.560> each

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
next level because there's a lot of each

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.470 
next level because there's a lot of each
hearted<00:03:13.100> character<00:03:13.549> in<00:03:13.670> this<00:03:13.790> industry<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.389> I

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
hearted character in this industry and I

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.360 
hearted character in this industry and I
think<00:03:14.540> it's<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.410> very<00:03:15.620> exciting<00:03:15.859> time<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.250> be

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
think it's a very exciting time to be

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.910 
think it's a very exciting time to be
involved<00:03:16.730> not<00:03:17.720> just<00:03:18.079> with<00:03:18.230> horse<00:03:18.440> racing<00:03:18.530> but

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
involved not just with horse racing but

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.180 
involved not just with horse racing but
in<00:03:19.010> all<00:03:19.160> ways<00:03:19.480> horse<00:03:20.480> activity<00:03:21.049> so<00:03:21.260> hopefully

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
in all ways horse activity so hopefully

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.010 
in all ways horse activity so hopefully
why<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:23.180> would<00:03:23.480> be<00:03:23.510> relevant

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
why it would be relevant

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.980 
why it would be relevant
because<00:03:25.680> if<00:03:25.800> they<00:03:25.920> want<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.220> become<00:03:26.520> involved

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
because if they want to become involved

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.390 
because if they want to become involved
hopefully<00:03:27.990> there's<00:03:28.200> some<00:03:28.320> things<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.800> in

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
hopefully there's some things that in

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.610 
hopefully there's some things that in
this<00:03:29.490> presentation<00:03:30.050> they<00:03:31.050> can<00:03:31.200> take<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.350> piece

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
this presentation they can take a piece

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.620 
this presentation they can take a piece
of<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:32.070> get<00:03:32.520> a<00:03:32.550> part<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.790> their<00:03:32.910> portfolio<00:03:33.090> I

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
of and get a part of their portfolio I

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.150 
of and get a part of their portfolio I
do<00:03:34.230> think<00:03:34.560> there<00:03:34.680> are<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.860> number<00:03:34.890> of

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
do think there are a number of

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.740 
do think there are a number of
opportunities<00:03:35.460> for<00:03:35.820> people<00:03:36.000> wanting<00:03:36.600> to

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
opportunities for people wanting to

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.960 
opportunities for people wanting to
enter<00:03:37.290> in<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.740> first<00:03:38.040> industry<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.520> would<00:03:38.700> say

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
enter in the first industry I would say

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.210 
enter in the first industry I would say
one<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.330> biggest<00:03:39.690> areas<00:03:40.170> of<00:03:40.560> opportunity

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
one of the biggest areas of opportunity

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.850 
one of the biggest areas of opportunity
and<00:03:42.260> probably<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.350> opinion<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.710> our

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
and probably the opinion of our

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.650 
and probably the opinion of our
association<00:03:44.430> certainly<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:44.940> me<00:03:45.060> would<00:03:45.240> be<00:03:45.360> in

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
association certainly of me would be in

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.630 
association certainly of me would be in
terms<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:46.080> Education<00:03:46.740> and<00:03:46.890> often<00:03:47.250> I'm<00:03:47.340> not

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:12.389 
we were fortunate we lived on an acreage
and<00:05:11.079> I<00:05:11.169> could<00:05:11.379> ride<00:05:11.529> in<00:05:11.649> our<00:05:11.739> backyard<00:05:12.129> those

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.009 
opportunities aren't there to the degree
that<00:05:14.589> they<00:05:14.889> were<00:05:14.949> when<00:05:15.789> I<00:05:15.819> was<00:05:16.089> a<00:05:16.119> kid<00:05:16.449> up<00:05:16.839> two

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:17.019 
that they were when I was a kid up two

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:19.919 
that they were when I was a kid up two
years<00:05:17.169> ago<00:05:18.300> so<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:19.329> think<00:05:19.449> people<00:05:19.629> who

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:19.929 
years ago so I think people who

00:05:19.929 --> 00:05:21.629 
years ago so I think people who
understand<00:05:20.469> today's<00:05:20.769> youth<00:05:21.009> and<00:05:21.189> have<00:05:21.309> a<00:05:21.339> mind

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
understand today's youth and have a mind

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.600 
understand today's youth and have a mind
of<00:05:21.759> today's<00:05:22.059> youth<00:05:22.209> works<00:05:22.569> it's<00:05:22.839> quick<00:05:23.429> it's<00:05:24.429> a

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
of today's youth works it's quick it's a

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.419 
of today's youth works it's quick it's a
little<00:05:24.849> bit<00:05:24.969> more<00:05:25.209> edgy<00:05:25.929> than<00:05:26.800> when<00:05:27.009> I<00:05:27.189> was

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:27.429 
little bit more edgy than when I was

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:29.850 
little bit more edgy than when I was
younger<00:05:27.839> so<00:05:28.839> people<00:05:29.110> who<00:05:29.199> understand<00:05:29.709> that

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
younger so people who understand that

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.399 
younger so people who understand that
and<00:05:30.039> who<00:05:30.159> can<00:05:30.339> develop<00:05:30.489> programs<00:05:31.179> are<00:05:31.539> really

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
and who can develop programs are really

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.139 
and who can develop programs are really
going<00:05:32.529> to<00:05:32.589> have<00:05:32.769> in<00:05:33.039> my<00:05:33.489> opinion<00:05:33.819> almost

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:34.149
