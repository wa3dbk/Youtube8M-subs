00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
the right of the guy and then when I aim

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.840 
the right of the guy and then when I aim
in<00:03:28.960> its<00:03:29.440> sniper<00:03:30.010> it's<00:03:30.160> gonna<00:03:30.280> automatically

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
in its sniper it's gonna automatically

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.700 
in its sniper it's gonna automatically
move<00:03:31.150> towards<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.630> center<00:03:31.810> of<00:03:31.960> him<00:03:32.110> because

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
move towards the center of him because

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.490 
move towards the center of him because
of<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:32.860> auto<00:03:33.010> aim<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.990> quick<00:03:34.990> scoping<00:03:35.350> is

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
of the auto aim and quick scoping is

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.050 
of the auto aim and quick scoping is
pretty<00:03:35.770> much<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:35.950> glitch<00:03:36.280> in<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.430> system

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
pretty much a glitch in the system

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.090 
pretty much a glitch in the system
and<00:03:37.210> Treyarch<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.290> infinity<00:03:38.680> board<00:03:38.890> have

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
and Treyarch and infinity board have

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.740 
and Treyarch and infinity board have
been<00:03:39.130> trying<00:03:39.490> to<00:03:39.550> find<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.880> way<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.150> stop<00:03:40.540> this

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
been trying to find a way to stop this

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.320 
been trying to find a way to stop this
and<00:03:41.410> they<00:03:41.680> can't<00:03:41.890> just<00:03:42.010> get<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:42.700> or<00:03:43.090> move<00:03:43.240> out

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
and they can't just get it or move out

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.580 
and they can't just get it or move out
away<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.630> completely<00:03:43.960> because<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.380> really

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
away and completely because you really

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.320 
away and completely because you really
need<00:03:44.740> that<00:03:44.830> on<00:03:44.980> console<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.850> you<00:03:45.910> have<00:03:46.000> analog

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
need that on console and you have analog

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.640 
need that on console and you have analog
sticks<00:03:46.600> need<00:03:46.780> all<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.020> mouse<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.200> really

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
sticks need all the mouse you really

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.040 
sticks need all the mouse you really
need<00:03:47.920> auto<00:03:48.100> in<00:03:48.340> it's<00:03:48.970> not<00:03:49.180> even<00:03:49.390> it's<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:49.900> need

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
need auto in it's not even it's you need

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.410 
need auto in it's not even it's you need
it<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:51.310> they've<00:03:51.670> been<00:03:51.790> trying<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.150> figure<00:03:52.300> out

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
it so they've been trying to figure out

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.890 
it so they've been trying to figure out
a<00:03:52.510> way<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.780> stop<00:03:53.170> quickscoping<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:55.000> reduce<00:03:55.690> it

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
a way to stop quickscoping and reduce it

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.180 
a way to stop quickscoping and reduce it
and<00:03:56.080> make<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.410> little<00:03:56.590> bit<00:03:56.710> harder<00:03:56.980> than<00:03:57.010> it

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
and make it a little bit harder than it

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.980 
and make it a little bit harder than it
actually<00:03:57.310> is<00:03:57.550> and<00:03:58.270> I<00:03:58.330> think<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.630> snipers<00:03:58.960> in

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
actually is and I think the snipers in

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.530 
actually is and I think the snipers in
black<00:03:59.200> ops<00:03:59.380> 2<00:03:59.470> or<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.190> lot<00:04:00.490> more<00:04:00.520> overpowered<00:04:01.300> a

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
black ops 2 or a lot more overpowered a

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.270 
black ops 2 or a lot more overpowered a
lot<00:04:01.900> better<00:04:02.200> than<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.530> cypress<00:04:02.860> in<00:04:02.950> previous

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
lot better than the cypress in previous

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.510 
lot better than the cypress in previous
games<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:04.320> they're<00:04:05.320> really<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.530> prattle<00:04:06.250> is

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
games and they're really the prattle is

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.150 
games and they're really the prattle is
necessary<00:04:06.970> because<00:04:07.750> people<00:04:08.410> are<00:04:08.500> brown<00:04:09.040> or

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
necessary because people are brown or

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.710 
necessary because people are brown or
lobbies<00:04:09.520> were<00:04:09.610> getting<00:04:09.820> ridiculous<00:04:10.150> everyone

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
lobbies were getting ridiculous everyone

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.240 
lobbies were getting ridiculous everyone
will<00:04:10.810> just<00:04:10.930> have<00:04:11.080> tagging<00:04:11.440> suits<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:12.130> a

will just have tagging suits and a

will just have tagging suits and a
bulletin<00:04:12.670> DSR<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.360> then<00:04:13.930> just<00:04:14.260> spam<00:04:14.800> just<00:04:15.370> put

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
bulletin DSR and then just spam just put

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.220 
bulletin DSR and then just spam just put
sniper<00:04:16.209> things<00:04:16.510> everywhere<00:04:16.870> it's<00:04:17.049> almost

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
sniper things everywhere it's almost

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.539 
sniper things everywhere it's almost
impossible<00:04:17.500> to<00:04:17.799> play<00:04:18.010> ground<00:04:18.220> war<00:04:18.370> anymore

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
impossible to play ground war anymore

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.789 
impossible to play ground war anymore
and<00:04:19.000> all<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.900> snipers<00:04:20.290> and<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.500> people<00:04:20.709> who

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
and all the snipers and the people who

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
use snipers all the time and don't use

use snipers all the time and don't use
any<00:04:22.420> other<00:04:22.540> weapon<00:04:22.900> and<00:04:23.020> black<00:04:23.140> ops<00:04:23.320> 2<00:04:23.500> will

any other weapon and black ops 2 will
definately<00:04:24.340> complain<00:04:24.580> about<00:04:24.670> this<00:04:24.850> patch

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
definately complain about this patch

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.340 
definately complain about this patch
because<00:04:25.360> they<00:04:25.450> like<00:04:25.630> these<00:04:25.780> weapons<00:04:26.140> but

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
because they like these weapons but

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.810 
because they like these weapons but
people<00:04:26.950> who<00:04:27.010> actually<00:04:27.190> who<00:04:27.520> play<00:04:27.670> the<00:04:27.790> game

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
people who actually who play the game

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.300 
people who actually who play the game
and<00:04:28.180> don't<00:04:28.330> just<00:04:28.600> use<00:04:28.780> snipers<00:04:29.110> like<00:04:29.230> me<00:04:29.410> think

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
and don't just use snipers like me think

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.130 
and don't just use snipers like me think
that<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:30.850> these<00:04:31.210> snipers<00:04:31.360> really<00:04:31.750> do<00:04:31.900> needs

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
that the these snipers really do needs

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.510 
that the these snipers really do needs
an<00:04:32.350> earth<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:32.770> think<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.040> nerf<00:04:33.220> was<00:04:33.370> very

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
an earth and I think the nerf was very

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.510 
an earth and I think the nerf was very
necessary<00:04:34.440> Auto<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:35.830> think<00:04:36.040> also<00:04:36.280> needs<00:04:36.460> to

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
necessary Auto and I think also needs to

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.950 
necessary Auto and I think also needs to
be<00:04:36.580> patched<00:04:36.910> a<00:04:37.030> little<00:04:37.210> bit<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.510> think<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.810> auto

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
be patched a little bit I think the auto

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.110 
be patched a little bit I think the auto
and<00:04:38.170> I<00:04:38.530> don't<00:04:38.650> think<00:04:38.980> the<00:04:39.490> sniper<00:04:39.700> patch<00:04:39.940> was

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
and I don't think the sniper patch was

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.450 
and I don't think the sniper patch was
totally<00:04:40.830> totally<00:04:41.830> changed<00:04:42.100> everything<00:04:42.310> the

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
totally totally changed everything the

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.460 
totally totally changed everything the
way<00:04:42.670> it<00:04:43.300> should<00:04:43.360> have<00:04:43.510> been<00:04:43.690> changed<00:04:43.900> I<00:04:44.290> think

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
way it should have been changed I think

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.540 
way it should have been changed I think
they<00:04:44.740> should<00:04:44.860> have<00:04:44.890> changes<00:04:45.250> so<00:04:45.370> that<00:04:45.400> the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
they should have changes so that the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.909 
they should have changes so that the
auto<00:04:45.790> aim<00:04:46.000> is<00:04:46.150> reduced<00:04:46.540> on<00:04:46.810> snipers<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.800> that

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
auto aim is reduced on snipers and that

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.320 
auto aim is reduced on snipers and that
it<00:04:48.040> only<00:04:48.220> works<00:04:48.490> at<00:04:48.669> a<00:04:48.700> certain<00:04:49.030> amount<00:04:49.210> of

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
it only works at a certain amount of

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.060 
it only works at a certain amount of
range<00:04:49.600> or<00:04:49.870> like<00:04:50.470> it's<00:04:50.650> only

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
range or like it's only

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.280 
range or like it's only
a<00:04:51.340> little<00:04:51.700> closer<00:04:51.910> to<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.210> guy<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:53.110> that<00:04:53.260> was

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
a little closer to the guy and that was

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.360 
a little closer to the guy and that was
a<00:04:53.410> pretty<00:04:53.590> nice<00:04:53.680> known<00:04:53.860> scope<00:04:54.100> right<00:04:54.220> now

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
a pretty nice known scope right now

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.060 
a pretty nice known scope right now
right<00:04:55.150> that<00:04:55.300> was<00:04:55.450> pretty<00:04:55.600> cool<00:04:55.750> I<00:04:56.070> think

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
right that was pretty cool I think

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.200 
right that was pretty cool I think
that's<00:04:57.340> what<00:04:57.460> they<00:04:57.520> should<00:04:57.550> have<00:04:57.700> done<00:04:57.910> and

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
that's what they should have done and

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.910 
that's what they should have done and
the<00:04:58.690> sniper<00:04:58.960> patch<00:04:59.110> would<00:04:59.350> have<00:04:59.470> been<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.740> lot

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
the sniper patch would have been a lot

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.370 
the sniper patch would have been a lot
more<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:01.660> would<00:05:01.780> have<00:05:01.870> been<00:05:01.960> better<00:05:02.110> because

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
more it would have been better because

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.450 
more it would have been better because
now<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.560> sniper<00:05:02.830> is<00:05:02.950> almost<00:05:03.280> useless

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
now the sniper is almost useless

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.550 
now the sniper is almost useless
apparently<00:05:04.090> that's<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.300> lot<00:05:04.480> to<00:05:04.690> call<00:05:04.870> it<00:05:05.050> they

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
apparently that's a lot to call it they

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.890 
apparently that's a lot to call it they
say<00:05:05.710> that<00:05:05.860> this<00:05:05.980> type<00:05:06.130> is<00:05:06.250> really<00:05:06.490> bad<00:05:06.640> and<00:05:06.910> if

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
say that this type is really bad and if

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.180 
say that this type is really bad and if
it's<00:05:08.080> that<00:05:08.230> way<00:05:08.380> then<00:05:08.620> I<00:05:08.740> don't<00:05:08.920> know<00:05:08.980> maybe

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
it's that way then I don't know maybe

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.100 
it's that way then I don't know maybe
this<00:05:09.370> heritage<00:05:09.700> wasn't<00:05:10.030> fair<00:05:10.180> enough<00:05:10.390> but

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
this heritage wasn't fair enough but

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.660 
this heritage wasn't fair enough but
looking<00:05:11.620> at<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.770> stats<00:05:12.010> and<00:05:12.220> looking<00:05:12.460> at<00:05:12.550> the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
looking at the stats and looking at the

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.610 
looking at the stats and looking at the
raw<00:05:12.970> stats<00:05:13.240> it<00:05:13.840> seemed<00:05:14.050> like<00:05:14.200> it's<00:05:14.470> never

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
raw stats it seemed like it's never

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.760 
raw stats it seemed like it's never
hatch<00:05:14.860> is<00:05:15.040> kind<00:05:15.220> of<00:05:15.280> um<00:05:15.750> necessary<00:05:16.750> to<00:05:17.620> me<00:05:17.740> I

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
two shots on me and then I just aim in

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.020 
two shots on me and then I just aim in
my<00:05:25.390> sight<00:05:25.630> and<00:05:25.660> the<00:05:26.080> aiming<00:05:26.380> so<00:05:26.860> fast<00:05:27.160> and<00:05:27.460> then

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
my sight and the aiming so fast and then

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.490

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
you just got a kill because they say a

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.010 
you just got a kill because they say a
man<00:05:29.710> ridiculously<00:05:30.190> fast<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:30.820> the<00:05:31.390> DSR<00:05:31.810> would

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
man ridiculously fast and the DSR would

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.140 
man ridiculously fast and the DSR would
shoot<00:05:32.920> aims<00:05:33.130> it<00:05:33.310> a<00:05:33.370> little<00:05:33.580> slower<00:05:33.790> than<00:05:34.060> the

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
shoot aims it a little slower than the

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.700 
shoot aims it a little slower than the
ballista<00:05:34.540> but<00:05:34.960> it<00:05:35.020> still<00:05:35.170> aims<00:05:35.380> in<00:05:35.530> pretty

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
ballista but it still aims in pretty

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.650 
ballista but it still aims in pretty
fast<00:05:35.830> and<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.220> Bliss<00:05:36.400> amz<00:05:36.820> like<00:05:37.180> twice<00:05:37.480> the

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
fast and the Bliss amz like twice the

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.160 
fast and the Bliss amz like twice the
speed<00:05:38.230> of<00:05:38.290> the<00:05:38.470> DSR<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:39.270> these<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.600> DSR<00:05:40.990> can

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
speed of the DSR and these the DSR can

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.170 
speed of the DSR and these the DSR can
get<00:05:41.290> one-hit<00:05:41.620> kills<00:05:41.830> almost<00:05:42.130> at<00:05:42.430> any<00:05:42.580> range<00:05:42.880> at

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
get one-hit kills almost at any range at

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.020 
get one-hit kills almost at any range at
any<00:05:43.690> part<00:05:43.900> of<00:05:43.930> your<00:05:44.020> body

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
any part of your body

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.540 
any part of your body
I<00:05:46.030> mean<00:05:46.270> it's<00:05:46.870> it's<00:05:47.770> like<00:05:47.830> a<00:05:47.890> one-hit<00:05:48.250> killing

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
I mean it's it's like a one-hit killing

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.790 
I mean it's it's like a one-hit killing
machine<00:05:48.850> it's<00:05:49.060> like<00:05:49.210> um<00:05:49.390> it's<00:05:50.350> like<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:50.620> same

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
machine it's like um it's like the same

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.280 
machine it's like um it's like the same
speed<00:05:51.040> is<00:05:51.160> like<00:05:51.310> aiming<00:05:51.730> an<00:05:51.850> assault<00:05:52.180> rifle<00:05:52.540> or

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
speed is like aiming an assault rifle or

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.780 
speed is like aiming an assault rifle or
I<00:05:53.350> mean<00:05:53.740> not<00:05:53.860> as<00:05:53.980> Saul<00:05:54.160> rifle<00:05:54.400> maybe<00:05:54.520> put<00:05:54.760> a

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
I mean not as Saul rifle maybe put a

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.520 
I mean not as Saul rifle maybe put a
like<00:05:54.940> a<00:05:54.970> light<00:05:55.240> machine<00:05:55.540> gun<00:05:55.690> it's<00:05:56.350> like<00:05:56.440> the

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
like a light machine gun it's like the

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.510 
like a light machine gun it's like the
same<00:05:56.650> she<00:05:56.770> just<00:05:56.920> like<00:05:57.010> Amy<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:57.370> I<00:05:57.400> like

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
same she just like Amy and I like

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.010 
same she just like Amy and I like
machine<00:05:57.760> gun<00:05:57.910> and<00:05:58.330> then<00:05:58.480> getting<00:05:58.690> on<00:05:58.780> one<00:05:58.870> hit

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
machine gun and then getting on one hit

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.990 
machine gun and then getting on one hit
kill<00:05:59.170> with<00:05:59.290> it<00:05:59.440> and<00:05:59.620> it's<00:06:00.340> easier<00:06:00.670> to<00:06:00.700> hit<00:06:00.880> your

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
kill with it and it's easier to hit your

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.430 
kill with it and it's easier to hit your
shots<00:06:01.210> because<00:06:01.540> you<00:06:01.690> have<00:06:01.810> a<00:06:01.870> scope<00:06:02.200> and

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
shots because you have a scope and

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.590 
shots because you have a scope and
because<00:06:02.920> the<00:06:03.040> automated<00:06:03.430> factor<00:06:03.880> and<00:06:04.240> there

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
because the automated factor and there

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.880 
because the automated factor and there
we<00:06:04.690> go<00:06:04.840> you<00:06:04.900> have<00:06:05.140> the<00:06:05.320> best<00:06:05.530> gun<00:06:05.710> in<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:05.830> game

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
we go you have the best gun in the game

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.480 
we go you have the best gun in the game
the<00:06:06.430> ballista<00:06:06.880> what<00:06:07.890> it<00:06:08.890> does<00:06:09.160> when<00:06:09.400> you're

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
the ballista what it does when you're

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.620 
the ballista what it does when you're
playing<00:06:09.700> in<00:06:09.820> ground<00:06:10.000> were<00:06:10.090> lobbying<00:06:10.270> you<00:06:10.510> have

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
playing in ground were lobbying you have

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.630 
playing in ground were lobbying you have
tactical<00:06:11.020> insertion<00:06:11.140> and<00:06:11.680> you<00:06:11.740> have<00:06:11.890> a<00:06:12.160> team

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
tactical insertion and you have a team

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.060 
tactical insertion and you have a team
of<00:06:12.670> also<00:06:13.090> using<00:06:13.450> ballistas<00:06:13.840> and<00:06:14.350> it<00:06:14.500> has<00:06:14.860> some

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
of also using ballistas and it has some

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.380 
of also using ballistas and it has some
potential<00:06:15.400> to<00:06:15.610> be<00:06:15.730> the<00:06:15.760> best<00:06:15.850> gun<00:06:16.120> in<00:06:16.150> the<00:06:16.240> game

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
potential to be the best gun in the game

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.180 
potential to be the best gun in the game
and<00:06:16.600> that's<00:06:16.660> see<00:06:16.990> right<00:06:17.170> there<00:06:17.380> I<00:06:17.530> wasn't<00:06:18.010> even

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
and that's see right there I wasn't even

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.240 
and that's see right there I wasn't even
I<00:06:18.460> just<00:06:18.910> aimed<00:06:19.150> in<00:06:19.360> that<00:06:20.140> even<00:06:20.410> I<00:06:20.650> probably

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
I just aimed in that even I probably

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.920 
I just aimed in that even I probably
wasn't<00:06:21.580> my<00:06:21.910> anoxic<00:06:22.270> spawn<00:06:22.450> probably<00:06:22.750> and

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
wasn't my anoxic spawn probably and

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.420 
wasn't my anoxic spawn probably and
anywhere<00:06:23.380> near<00:06:23.590> the<00:06:23.710> guy's<00:06:23.830> body<00:06:24.040> I<00:06:24.220> just

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
anywhere near the guy's body I just

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.820 
anywhere near the guy's body I just
aimed<00:06:24.610> in<00:06:24.790> and<00:06:25.300> the<00:06:25.420> auto<00:06:25.540> in<00:06:25.750> fact<00:06:25.990> here<00:06:26.170> works

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
aimed in and the auto in fact here works

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.260 
aimed in and the auto in fact here works
so<00:06:27.040> that<00:06:27.070> aims<00:06:27.430> indirectly<00:06:27.910> at<00:06:28.030> the<00:06:28.120> guy's

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
so that aims indirectly at the guy's

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.100 
so that aims indirectly at the guy's
body<00:06:28.480> and<00:06:28.780> that's<00:06:28.900> why<00:06:28.990> it's<00:06:29.080> really

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
body and that's why it's really

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.200 
body and that's why it's really
necessary<00:06:29.380> and<00:06:29.950> that's<00:06:30.730> why<00:06:30.850> I<00:06:30.880> just<00:06:31.060> that's

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
necessary and that's why I just that's

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.550 
necessary and that's why I just that's
just<00:06:31.270> my<00:06:31.540> stance<00:06:31.750> on<00:06:31.900> earth<00:06:31.990> at<00:06:32.230> games<00:06:32.410> we're
