00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
plus BCD fantastic BCD let's have a

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.740 
plus BCD fantastic BCD let's have a
closer<00:00:12.299> look<00:00:13.910> okay<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:14.940> starting<00:00:15.360> at<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.570> top

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
closer look okay so starting at the top

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.260 
closer look okay so starting at the top
then<00:00:16.310> this<00:00:17.310> BCE<00:00:17.610> is<00:00:17.730> quite<00:00:17.880> different<00:00:18.090> to

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
then this BCE is quite different to

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.300 
then this BCE is quite different to
others<00:00:19.050> as<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.500> bladder<00:00:19.710> systems<00:00:20.160> actually

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
others as the bladder systems actually

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.429 
others as the bladder systems actually
separate<00:00:20.789> from<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> harness<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:22.199> just

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
separate from the harness this just

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.019 
separate from the harness this just
means<00:00:22.619> when<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:22.890> inflated<00:00:23.070> it's<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.730> lot<00:00:23.880> more

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
means when it's inflated it's a lot more

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.820 
means when it's inflated it's a lot more

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
from the harness itself just making it a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.450
