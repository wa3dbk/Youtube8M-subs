00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.569
 for vÃ©lez it is illuminated and we are going to learn 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.970
 to play the song the new world where 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.800
 his mafia edition is a super song 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.990
 simple because we only carry four 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.519
 chords so let's see how it 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.030
 listen to our song and then 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.030
 we will learn 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.430
 and that's all our song and it 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.309
 repeats in the chorus and at the end exactly 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.170
 the same chords the whole song well 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.010
 let's start let's put if 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.839
 minor on the seventh fret and we're going to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.839
 touch three relationships down 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:56.180
 then we use the largest and two radios 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.180
 down and we repeat these two times 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:07.370
 we become older and we play three times 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.370
 D major down twice so low 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.090
 this 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:25.100
 if they put 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.299
 it sounds exactly the same so in 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.740
 the problem but that we owe them 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.250
 remember if they have to be forced 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.399
 the seventh after that in the fifth after 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.049
 and in the second after triple the 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.930
 what because the note that we are going to use 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.009
 is the one that carries the first string 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.009
 what we are going to see is this 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.540
 d 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.220
 and if we do not carry those notes not only 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.430
 hear the same so I recommend you to 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.259
 you use it get in the seventh and fifth 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.320
