00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.189
 here at intermot cologne for you 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.639
 present in preview the new 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.830
 200 g is liquid when you look at it 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.540
 like that at first attracted 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.539
 because she looks like you 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.609
 recognize well this gs 125 horses a 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.720
 equivalent weight of innovations 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.769
 interesting techniques 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.910
 an adjustable bubble an active suspension 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:31.320
 in abs the disengageable and the envi 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.610
 it is quite sweaty to go 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.010
 try it because it really is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.290
 very sexy very seductive and ride 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.210
 attack develops all the accessories 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.710
 necessary for that by the time she 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.899
 you will be delivered you can equity 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.219
 well as you see this new 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.460
 motor is pretty interesting you have 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.020
 here the training chains for the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.990
 camshafts where you discover there the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.829
 generator 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.570
 the starter who 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.039
 borders on the crown of think 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.240
 that here in primary school she covered 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.040
 gearbox 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.040
 sp under the main block 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.560
 and interesting thing 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.890
 here the injection operation 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.810
 the exhaust that down and this 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.700
 clutch that is laid at the front 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.530
 multidiscs oil bath and that one 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.210
 can extract easily by disassembling the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.190
 front quarter and that allows this 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.290
 photo a good distribution of the masses 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.270
 and easy maintenance 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.670
 we are now on the triumph 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.900
 tiger explore for this machine we 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.670
 have developed a whole set 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.780
 of accessories as we know how to do 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.850
 the luggage prices I have under rock by 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.360
 equipment various protections bag the 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.710
 tank 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.960
 but I would like to talk to you more 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.060
 especially thoratec saddles that 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.830
 we develop and market and 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.360
 you have a whole set of the one that 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.420
 was developed for this machine 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.860
 and then also talk to you again about 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.300
 tower-tech suspensions that have been 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.560
 developed for people who 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.360
 travel in difficult conditions 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.420
 and who can remount their suspension 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.740
 and leave without worry will have them support 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.950
 faithful throughout their journey 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.649
 of course 7,800 gs you can admire 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.750
 the studied forms of crashes by 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.340
 upper part to avoid 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.890
 damage to the plastics the radiator 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.290
 vital organs and lower part 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.750
 for the engine block 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.790
 also note fixations that have 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.379
 been studied with bolts allowing 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.829
 shear to avoid 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.629
 irreversible damage to the engine and 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.640
 then we can take a look at the 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.710
 hoof that is here enveloping 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.270
 we saw enough thick to protect 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.950
 but also equipped with skis 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.480
 plastic that are there to cover the 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.430
 fixations and avoid any damage 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.250
 irreversible during shocks or 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.190
 unplanned disassembly for attac equipped 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.900
 90 bikes for the gs trophy 2012 which will have 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.470
 place in south africa in november 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.380
 next 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.600
 and all these machines have been protected 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.940
 especially here by rage bar 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.840
 superior that allows the bike double 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.400
 avoid painful damage thoratec 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.580
 has been developing for over a year now 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.380
 suspensions they are available 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.900
 currently four levels the level one 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.080
 system of cars good settings of 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.350
 mechanical compression of the tents by 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.390
 buttons and clips a second level that 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.209
 does not have the bottle but the preload 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.480
 hydraulic a third level like 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.130
 this one with separate bottle the 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.400
 hydraulic loads control of relaxation 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.660
 is also slow compression and 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.660
 fast compression available 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.570
 finally for those who travel and who 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.290
 use their machine so 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.240
 extreme 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.860
 you will find this damper 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.000
 which is called extreme and it is 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.750
 differentiable because it is 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.770
 adjustable authors separate bottle 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.180
 slow and fast compression always 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.730
 hydraulic tension and inside it 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.860
 is equipped with the pds system which is in 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.750
 made with an extra piston that 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.640
 will move into a housing role 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.890
 in reduced and that will allow in case 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.710
 of extreme use either in charge 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.690
 either during a very violent jump of 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.250
 to brake the damping of the motorcycle in 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.019
 end of the race to avoid all 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.489
 damage related to transmission and 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.799
 mechanical constraints on this 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.540
 damper all the suspensions that 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.460
 turn with develop have been studied for 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.560
 traveling that is to say that when you 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.690
 buy a suspension thoratec she is 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.690
 ready to go on your bike with 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.370
 passenger baggage and that's of course for 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.790
 those who have a little less use 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.830
 strict 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.330
 they are adaptable just 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.860
 time of the order we specify the 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.570
 operating constraints they are 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.980
 currently available a whole 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.280
 pallet of machines intended for 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.190
 travels i'm going to talk to you now 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.550
 of the 11.90 adventure ktm 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.630
 we are up of the earth model 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.640
 as you can see she is 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.310
 a little more classic in his line a 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.150
 side exhaust a tank with a 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.850
 single fill 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.940
 it's a machine that weighs about 230 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.510
 kg all equipped and who develops in 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:12.040
 its free version 150 horses 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:15.600
 it remains a ktm dna and presents the 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.070
 v engine sound nice and 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.190
 some differences you have on this 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.200
 model 11 90 serves a front wheel of 21 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.960
 a rear wheel of May 18 in his 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.120
 adventure version it will be equipped 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.840
 original again from 19 in the front and 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.280
 from 17 to the back on the model 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.170
 adventure you will also have the 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.510
 opportunity to see a machine with 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.790
 piloted suspensions and a smart abs 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.960
 which allows, if necessary, to have only 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.670
 from down to the front in any terrain 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.890
 and a road available at the back 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.920
 Here you also have the 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.750
 monobloc on this adventure version 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.570
 but it is available also that 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.630
 which places a nice aesthetic a 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:58.090
 articulated windshield you can see it 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.280
 of different sizes with the big 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.870
 trend here at interbox electronics 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.980
 took precedence over the management of 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.720
 vehicles both on suspension as on 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.020
 braking and the complete management of 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.510
 engine 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.780
 see you later for everyone 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.780
 details
