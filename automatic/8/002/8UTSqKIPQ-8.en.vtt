played<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:30.170> reasonable<00:03:31.170> move<00:03:31.320> like<00:03:31.700> way<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.940> d2

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
played a reasonable move like way to d2

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.750 
played a reasonable move like way to d2
we<00:03:33.540> already<00:03:33.690> said<00:03:34.050> plane<00:03:34.470> takes<00:03:34.740> on<00:03:34.950> c3<00:03:35.190> and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
we already said plane takes on c3 and

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.210 
we already said plane takes on c3 and
then<00:03:35.820> we<00:03:36.660> have<00:03:36.960> Bishop<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.610> b4<00:03:39.770> so<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:41.040> game

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
then we have Bishop to b4 so the game

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.820 
then we have Bishop to b4 so the game
was<00:03:41.340> continued<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:41.910> light<00:03:42.240> to<00:03:42.450> b3<00:03:42.930> attacking

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
was continued and light to b3 attacking

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.690 
was continued and light to b3 attacking
Queen<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.570> rook<00:03:45.690> if<00:03:46.560> Queen<00:03:46.980> goes<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.430> e3

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
Queen and the rook if Queen goes to e3

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.340 
Queen and the rook if Queen goes to e3
then<00:03:48.680> black<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.710> winning<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.280> rook

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
then black is winning the rook

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.040 
then black is winning the rook
so<00:03:52.350> if<00:03:52.470> pin<00:03:52.740> wants<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.160> protect<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.700> rock<00:03:54.050> then

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
so if pin wants to protect the rock then

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.420 
so if pin wants to protect the rock then
we<00:03:55.230> would<00:03:55.350> have<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:55.650> variation<00:03:56.010> Knight

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
we would have this variation Knight

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.020 
we would have this variation Knight
takes<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:57.000> d4<00:03:57.480> this<00:03:57.690> is<00:03:57.900> discard<00:03:58.350> attack<00:03:59.030> Queen

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
takes on d4 this is discard attack Queen

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.460 
takes on d4 this is discard attack Queen
to<00:04:00.330> d2<00:04:01.370> Knight<00:04:02.370> takes<00:04:02.700> bishop<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.540> this

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
to d2 Knight takes bishop and this

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.790 
to d2 Knight takes bishop and this
position<00:04:05.340> is<00:04:05.630> not<00:04:06.630> fun<00:04:06.990> to<00:04:07.170> play<00:04:07.380> for<00:04:07.620> white

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
position is not fun to play for white

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.420 
position is not fun to play for white
that's<00:04:08.640> why<00:04:09.560> he<00:04:10.560> resigned<00:04:10.890> in<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:11.640> position

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
that's why he resigned in this position

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.850 
that's why he resigned in this position
