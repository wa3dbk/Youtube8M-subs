00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.490 
episode so I think I know where the
other<00:00:36.210> conclusion<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.230> will<00:00:37.380> be<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
other conclusion of this will be a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.950 
other conclusion of this will be a

and the music and that bit was quite

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.349 
and the music and that bit was quite
interesting<00:02:55.709> as<00:02:55.829> well<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.760> yeah<00:02:56.849> overall<00:02:57.209> it

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
interesting as well but yeah overall it

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:58.819

was<00:02:57.480> quite<00:02:57.629> a<00:02:57.659> bit<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.840> action<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.590> especially

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
was quite a bit of action and especially

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.110 
was quite a bit of action and especially
that<00:02:59.040> final<00:02:59.310> scene<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.519> would<00:02:59.639> like<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.849> see<00:03:00.000> the

that final scene I would like to see the
Boston<00:03:00.450> action<00:03:00.720> but<00:03:00.840> I'm<00:03:00.930> guessing<00:03:01.079> that<00:03:01.260> same

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
Boston action but I'm guessing that same
