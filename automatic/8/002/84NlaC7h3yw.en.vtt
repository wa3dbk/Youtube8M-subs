00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 if the days would be something if not only 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.290
 then it is incredibly like salad and 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.880
 My problem is that I mostly always 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.860
 to make the same salad and always that 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.590
 Same dressing because you had 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.870
 in and you know how it works and does 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.670
 that's just how it works in cooperation 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.289
 with five wonderful others 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.600
 I want you guys today, but youtube 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.490
 show a very special recipe and that 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.250
 for a summery salad and a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.410
 Strawberry and I think that's something 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.900
 to prepare another event normally 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.000
 It was me just like that 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.910
 but we thought we would leave more 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.640
 make earthquakes and show you 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.200
 wonderful recipes and ideas 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.020
 you simply can do with something and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.300
 link our flames and in the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.399
 infobox but now only to my 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.379
 concept and how you like something fruity 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.190
 Change had gotten it okay 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.190
 be shocked 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.470
 you need to win the app 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.290
 of course strawberries I have now 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.640
 500 grams then brought more oil there 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.100
 me now because the oil could do that though 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.280
 also quite simply take olive oil white 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.890
 balsamic a teaspoon of sugar 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.390
 teaspoon sesame seeds a little salt 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.460
 and some water for the right one 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.130
 Consistency The app you can get first 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.880
 once all clean that is the strunk 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.880
 make up up 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.420
 Now basically all the ingredients come in 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.820
 the mixer that is first the strawberries 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.220
 and then gradually the others too 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:50.080
 ingredients so the spoon sugar yours 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:56.610
 About two teaspoons salt the teaspoon 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.610
 sesame seeds two tablespoons of your oil 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.610
 and only once carefully ans it 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.680
 approach and therefore only one 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.179
 tablespoon but you can afterwards 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.759
 when tasting again exactly 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:15.410
 and a tablespoon of water for 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.360
 the consistency is a mix of one here 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.430
 bit jump start but then mixed up 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.260
 everything is wonderful and get it 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.150
 wonderful color and now it is whole 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.800
 important that you taste good and 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.900
 if you want you can still salt and 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.430
 Add pepper or a little more 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.190
 I eat more depending on how you do it 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.780
 I like it and now I have it in that way 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.110
 a glass filled and you can 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.760
 Close well and yes I think so 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.760
 already two days in the refrigerator store 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.879
 For the senate, I first with 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.540
 a rucola base starts to come 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.540
 avocado 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.459
 besides salad I love field salad 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.500
 and I just got the strawberries in 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.480
 sliced â€‹â€‹and now with that 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.069
 salad beautifully decorated I think that 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.069
 colors are really beautiful 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.360
 also a little bit more now 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.360
 avocado and grated cheese over it 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.739
 and now you can already speak your little red 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.019
 give it over and I think because they are so 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.459
 you can easily get away with it 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.250
 actually a bit more, too 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.599
 I'll admit it to this day 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.160
 I do not feel so much right now 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.810
 but when I really did it then 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.670
 I have eaten even more 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.140
 made and also still roasted 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.370
 sesame give the right one again 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:42.129
 nice aroma and finished is your own 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.650
 made little red and yummy 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.080
 summery salad with a maybe 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.700
 something else touch so this one 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.040
 standard salads you usually get 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.150
 So enjoy the warm days and 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.610
 let him taste you 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.680
