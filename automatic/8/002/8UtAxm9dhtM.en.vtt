another episode of spawn point now
today's<00:00:12.059> episode<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.570> going<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.929> be<00:00:12.990> slightly

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
today's episode is going to be slightly

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.070 
today's episode is going to be slightly
different<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.950> usual<00:00:14.360> most<00:00:15.360> episodes<00:00:15.599> we<00:00:15.839> test

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
different to usual most episodes we test

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.200 
different to usual most episodes we test
one<00:00:16.379> block<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.830> one<00:00:16.980> block<00:00:17.190> only<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.730> today's

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
one block and one block only in today's

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.000 
one block and one block only in today's
episode<00:00:18.420> I've<00:00:18.930> been<00:00:19.529> getting<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> lot<00:00:19.949> of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
episode I've been getting a lot of

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.950 
episode I've been getting a lot of
requests<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.820> test<00:00:21.029> one<00:00:21.240> specific<00:00:21.720> block

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
requests to test one specific block

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.900 
requests to test one specific block
however<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.920> block<00:00:23.189> makes<00:00:23.460> no<00:00:23.670> real

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
however this block makes no real

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.849 
however this block makes no real
practical<00:00:24.449> sense<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.019> test<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.590> thought<00:00:25.740> I'd

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
practical sense to test so I thought I'd

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.230 
practical sense to test so I thought I'd
throw<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.070> couple<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.490> other<00:00:26.609> related<00:00:26.880> blocks

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
throw a couple of other related blocks

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.870 
throw a couple of other related blocks
into<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.689> test<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.260> make<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.099> special<00:00:29.580> out<00:00:29.730> of

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
into the test and make a special out of

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.319 
into the test and make a special out of
it<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.289> today's<00:00:31.410> episode<00:00:32.210> we<00:00:33.210> were

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
it so in today's episode we were

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.479 
it so in today's episode we were
requested<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:33.989> test<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.559> end<00:00:34.739> portal<00:00:35.219> frame

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
requested to test the end portal frame

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.940 
requested to test the end portal frame
and<00:00:35.790> alongside<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.960> will<00:00:37.260> also<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.559> testing

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and alongside that will also be testing

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.970 
and alongside that will also be testing
n<00:00:38.129> stone<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.180> ender<00:00:39.480> chest<00:00:39.510> ok<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:40.829> you

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
n stone and the ender chest ok so as you

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.619 
n stone and the ender chest ok so as you
can<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.219> we've<00:00:41.370> got<00:00:41.399> our<00:00:41.640> test<00:00:41.969> pad<00:00:42.149> set<00:00:42.480> up

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
can see we've got our test pad set up

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.650 
can see we've got our test pad set up
for<00:00:43.079> our<00:00:43.290> first<00:00:43.590> test<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:45.059> guess<00:00:45.300> as<00:00:45.480> to

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
for our first test now my guess as to

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.330 
for our first test now my guess as to
why<00:00:45.840> people<00:00:45.870> wanted<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> ender

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
why people wanted to see the ender

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.180 
why people wanted to see the ender
portal<00:00:47.820> frame<00:00:48.059> tested<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.829> simply<00:00:49.829> because

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
portal frame tested is simply because

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.470 
portal frame tested is simply because
since<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:51.239> such<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.649> rare<00:00:52.649> block<00:00:53.480> wasn't

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
since it was such a rare block wasn't

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.270 
since it was such a rare block wasn't
previously<00:00:54.690> available<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.530> us<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.800> creative

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
previously available to us in creative

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.060 
previously available to us in creative
mode<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.120> kind<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.360> jazz<00:00:57.530> it<00:00:58.530> would

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
mode and all that kind of jazz it would

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.069 
mode and all that kind of jazz it would
have<00:00:59.219> been<00:00:59.250> very<00:00:59.340> rare<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.359> whole<00:01:00.719> room

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
have been very rare to see a whole room

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.290 
have been very rare to see a whole room
filled<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:01.680> these<00:01:01.920> things<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.000> people

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
filled with these things and so people

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.270 
filled with these things and so people
would<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.480> quite<00:01:03.690> curious<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.739> whether<00:01:04.949> or

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
would be quite curious as to whether or

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.240 
would be quite curious as to whether or
not<00:01:05.339> mobs<00:01:06.030> were<00:01:06.180> able<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> spawn<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:06.930> them<00:01:07.250> so

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
not mobs were able to spawn on them so

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.010 
not mobs were able to spawn on them so
let's<00:01:08.580> flick<00:01:08.820> off<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> lights<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:09.869> what

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
let's flick off the lights and see what

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.539 
let's flick off the lights and see what
happens<00:01:15.080> ok<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.140> now<00:01:16.380> as<00:01:16.560> usual<00:01:17.040> we've<00:01:17.220> got<00:01:17.400> our

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
happens ok so now as usual we've got our

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.210 
happens ok so now as usual we've got our
one<00:01:17.840> control<00:01:18.840> pad<00:01:19.049> over<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.799> covered

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
one control pad over there not covered

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.880 
one control pad over there not covered
in<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.580> blocking<00:01:20.880> question<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.680> can't

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
in the blocking question so if we can't

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.429 
in the blocking question so if we can't
get<00:01:23.070> any<00:01:23.250> spawns<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.330> end<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.990> portal

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
get any spawns on the end of portal

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.080 
get any spawns on the end of portal
frames<00:01:25.680> we'll<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.640> try<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:26.850> get<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
frames we'll see if we can try and get a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.450 
frames we'll see if we can try and get a
spawn<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.020> back<00:01:28.350> pad<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.100> looks<00:01:29.310> like

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
spawn on that back pad and it looks like

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.670 
spawn on that back pad and it looks like
we<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.729> got<00:01:30.240> we've<00:01:31.140> definitely<00:01:31.290> got<00:01:31.530> one

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
we have got we've definitely got one

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.249 
we have got we've definitely got one
spider<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> back<00:01:32.490> pad<00:01:32.700> there<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.259> now

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
spider on the back pad there and now

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.990 
spider on the back pad there and now
skeleton<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.070> I'm<00:01:35.159> still<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.549> seeing<00:01:35.759> any

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
skeleton but I'm still not seeing any

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.440 
skeleton but I'm still not seeing any
spawns<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.810> ender<00:01:37.140> portal<00:01:37.439> frames<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.970> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
spawns on the ender portal frames so it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.340 
spawns on the ender portal frames so it
looks<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.380> mobs<00:01:41.310> cannot<00:01:42.000> spawn<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.630> these

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
looks like mobs cannot spawn on these

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.649 
looks like mobs cannot spawn on these
portal<00:01:43.770> frames<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.759> let's<00:01:45.060> set<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> next

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
portal frames so let's set up the next

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.899 
portal frames so let's set up the next
test<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.170> there<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:46.950> test<00:01:47.399> number<00:01:47.700> two

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
test and there we have test number two

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.539 
test and there we have test number two
set<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.360> now<00:01:48.960> my<00:01:49.409> guess<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> reason<00:01:50.100> why

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
set up now my guess is to the reason why

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.539 
set up now my guess is to the reason why
n<00:01:50.909> stone<00:01:51.329> was<00:01:51.710> suggested<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> possible<00:01:52.920> test

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
n stone was suggested as a possible test

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.370 
n stone was suggested as a possible test
is<00:01:54.090> pretty<00:01:54.270> much<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.540> same<00:01:54.810> reason<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.350> I

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
is pretty much the same reason that I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.260 
is pretty much the same reason that I
think<00:01:55.590> netherrack<00:01:56.100> was<00:01:56.340> suggested<00:01:56.880> all<00:01:57.090> those

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
think netherrack was suggested all those

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.090 
think netherrack was suggested all those
episodes<00:01:57.540> ago<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.649> simply<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> fact

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
episodes ago and it's simply the fact

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.730 
episodes ago and it's simply the fact
that<00:01:59.460> netherrack<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.509> n<00:02:00.990> stone<00:02:01.350> are<00:02:01.530> mostly

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
that netherrack and n stone are mostly

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.649 
that netherrack and n stone are mostly
found<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.310> alternate<00:02:02.880> dimensions<00:02:03.450> in

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
found in alternate dimensions in

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.440 
found in alternate dimensions in
Minecraft<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:05.159> although<00:02:05.579> they<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:05.969> mobs

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
Minecraft and although they do have mobs

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.969 
Minecraft and although they do have mobs
spawn<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.960> them<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.409> Endermen<00:02:07.770> in

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
spawn on them so like the Endermen in

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.910 
spawn on them so like the Endermen in
the<00:02:08.069> end<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:09.000> lot<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.660> people<00:02:09.780> don't<00:02:10.140> see<00:02:10.440> large

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the end a lot of people don't see large

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.700 
the end a lot of people don't see large
clusters<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.580> n<00:02:12.000> stone<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.629> the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
clusters of n stone in the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.280 
clusters of n stone in the
over<00:02:13.890> world<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:15.090> such<00:02:15.360> people<00:02:15.960> seem<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.200> be

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
over world and as such people seem to be

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.530 
over world and as such people seem to be
curious<00:02:16.560> as<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.040> whether<00:02:17.190> mobs<00:02:18.030> other<00:02:18.270> than

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
curious as to whether mobs other than

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.210 
curious as to whether mobs other than
Endermen<00:02:18.960> are<00:02:19.140> able<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.500> spawn<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:19.890> top<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.130> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
Endermen are able to spawn on top of the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.160 
Endermen are able to spawn on top of the
end<00:02:20.340> stone<00:02:20.610> with<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.570> being<00:02:21.750> said<00:02:21.810> let's

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
end stone with that being said let's

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.420 
end stone with that being said let's
flick<00:02:22.350> off<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.590> lights<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:22.950> see<00:02:23.160> if<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.340> get

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
flick off the lights and see if we get

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:38.170 
flick off the lights and see if we get
any<00:02:23.610> spawns<00:02:23.970> aside<00:02:24.420> from<00:02:24.570> endermen

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.899 

and<00:02:38.299> already<00:02:38.599> we<00:02:38.780> see<00:02:38.959> spiders<00:02:39.650> skeletons<00:02:40.310> and

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
and already we see spiders skeletons and

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.979 
and already we see spiders skeletons and
what<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.480> thought<00:02:41.719> was<00:02:41.989> a<00:02:42.049> spider<00:02:42.500> jockey<00:02:42.769> spawn

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
what I thought was a spider jockey spawn

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.199 
what I thought was a spider jockey spawn
so<00:02:44.989> as<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.170> can<00:02:45.349> see<00:02:45.560> mobs<00:02:45.890> can<00:02:46.219> clearly<00:02:46.730> spawn

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
so as you can see mobs can clearly spawn

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.449 
so as you can see mobs can clearly spawn
on<00:02:47.540> top<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.930> n<00:02:48.079> stone<00:02:48.530> alright<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.040> as<00:02:49.219> you<00:02:49.340> can

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
on top of n stone alright and as you can

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.830 
on top of n stone alright and as you can
see<00:02:49.489> guys<00:02:49.790> we've<00:02:50.000> got<00:02:50.150> our<00:02:50.269> third<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:50.810> final

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
see guys we've got our third and final

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.250 
see guys we've got our third and final
test<00:02:51.409> setup<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:51.980> boy<00:02:52.430> does<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:52.700> look<00:02:52.879> cool<00:02:53.260> now

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
test setup and boy does it look cool now

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.220 
test setup and boy does it look cool now
to<00:02:54.319> be<00:02:54.709> honest<00:02:55.069> this<00:02:55.849> test<00:02:56.180> wasn't<00:02:56.510> requested

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
to be honest this test wasn't requested

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.500 
to be honest this test wasn't requested
I<00:02:57.409> just<00:02:57.739> thought<00:02:57.889> it<00:02:58.010> went<00:02:58.159> along<00:02:58.430> with<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.969> N

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
I just thought it went along with the N

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.459 
I just thought it went along with the N
stone<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.439> end<00:03:00.590> portal<00:03:01.040> frame<00:03:01.579> tests<00:03:02.239> and

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:02.469 
stone and the end portal frame tests and

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.789 
stone and the end portal frame tests and
so<00:03:03.469> I<00:03:03.709> thought<00:03:04.159> I'd<00:03:04.310> do<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.579> for<00:03:04.609> this<00:03:04.819> sake<00:03:05.510> of

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
so I thought I'd do it for this sake of

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.770 
so I thought I'd do it for this sake of
being<00:03:06.799> thorough<00:03:07.189> and<00:03:07.489> also<00:03:08.269> just<00:03:08.540> thought

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
being thorough and also just thought

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.179 
being thorough and also just thought
just<00:03:09.290> because<00:03:09.349> I<00:03:09.560> thought<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.739> would<00:03:09.889> be<00:03:09.980> cool

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
just because I thought it would be cool

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.300 
just because I thought it would be cool
to<00:03:10.250> see<00:03:10.430> an<00:03:10.879> entire<00:03:11.329> room<00:03:11.629> filled<00:03:12.049> with

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
to see an entire room filled with

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.270 
to see an entire room filled with
halley's<00:03:13.310> n<00:03:13.519> chests<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.180> I've<00:03:14.659> got<00:03:15.409> us<00:03:15.560> got<00:03:16.189> to

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
halley's n chests and I've got us got to

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.190 
halley's n chests and I've got us got to
say<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:16.489> think<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.329> was<00:03:17.450> right<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.930> think<00:03:18.079> that

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
say I think I was right I think that

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.159 
say I think I was right I think that
looks<00:03:18.290> absolutely<00:03:18.769> awesome<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:20.750> be<00:03:20.870> honest

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
looks absolutely awesome to be honest

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.270 
looks absolutely awesome to be honest
I'm<00:03:21.349> not<00:03:21.379> really<00:03:21.650> expecting<00:03:22.220> any<00:03:22.730> spawns<00:03:23.389> but

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
I'm not really expecting any spawns but

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.559 
I'm not really expecting any spawns but
just<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.400> be<00:03:25.519> safe<00:03:25.549> let's<00:03:25.939> flick<00:03:26.299> off<00:03:26.450> the

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
just to be safe let's flick off the

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:36.369 
just to be safe let's flick off the
lights<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.049> see<00:03:27.709> what<00:03:27.889> happens<00:03:34.930> now<00:03:35.930> I'm<00:03:36.319> not

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
lights and see what happens now I'm not

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.259 
lights and see what happens now I'm not
sure<00:03:36.650> how<00:03:37.069> well<00:03:37.310> this<00:03:37.459> test<00:03:37.730> is<00:03:37.879> going<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.120> work

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
sure how well this test is going to work

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.300 
sure how well this test is going to work
because<00:03:38.480> I<00:03:38.659> believe<00:03:39.109> these<00:03:39.500> n<00:03:39.709> chests<00:03:40.189> do

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
because I believe these n chests do

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.250 
because I believe these n chests do
actually<00:03:40.609> give<00:03:40.849> off<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.299> little<00:03:41.599> bit<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:41.959> light

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
actually give off a little bit of light

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.759 
actually give off a little bit of light
but<00:03:43.159> hopefully<00:03:43.639> it's<00:03:43.790> dark<00:03:44.120> enough<00:03:44.299> on<00:03:44.599> that

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.379 

on<00:03:48.769> our<00:03:48.919> control<00:03:49.340> pad<00:03:49.549> up<00:03:49.669> the<00:03:49.790> back<00:03:49.970> there<00:03:50.209> to

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
on our control pad up the back there to

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.860 
on our control pad up the back there to
try<00:03:50.629> and<00:03:50.750> get<00:03:50.870> some<00:03:51.109> spawns<00:03:51.500> regardless<00:03:52.250> oh

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
try and get some spawns regardless oh

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.050 
try and get some spawns regardless oh
it's<00:03:53.870> not<00:03:54.319> looking<00:03:55.040> like<00:03:55.280> we're<00:03:55.669> going<00:03:55.849> to<00:03:55.909> be

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
it's not looking like we're going to be

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.309 
it's not looking like we're going to be
terribly<00:03:56.870> lucky<00:03:58.780> alright<00:03:59.780> there<00:03:59.930> we<00:03:59.959> go<00:04:00.079> we<00:04:00.199> do

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
terribly lucky alright there we go we do

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.929 
terribly lucky alright there we go we do
actually<00:04:00.709> have<00:04:00.739> a<00:04:00.859> spider<00:04:01.189> on<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.519> back<00:04:01.699> pad

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:01.939 
actually have a spider on that back pad

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.349 
actually have a spider on that back pad
finally<00:04:02.569> so<00:04:02.780> there<00:04:03.500> we<00:04:03.560> go<00:04:03.620> guys<00:04:03.859> I<00:04:04.669> think

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
finally so there we go guys I think

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.089 
finally so there we go guys I think
that's<00:04:05.479> pretty<00:04:05.599> conclusive<00:04:06.169> proof<00:04:06.409> that<00:04:06.470> mobs
