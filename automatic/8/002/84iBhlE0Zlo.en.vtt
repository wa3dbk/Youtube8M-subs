00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hi everyone on the other side of the screen, 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.109
 accuracy and computex 2014 passed 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.519
 presentation of the company asus and now we 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.389
 look at the news that she 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.150
 introduced myself now in my hands two 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.820
 compact tablet which is called 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.130
 asus fonepad 7 and asus fonepad 8 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.619
 basically they have the same stuffing 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.380
 only the screen size is different and 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.500
 the thickness of the body inside we stand 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.380
 intel atom quad 1 processor and 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.960
 8 gigahertz in principle in all new items 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.090
 which were presented at the exhibition from 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.660
 the company consists of intel processor 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.989
 screen on the battle tablets and wait for 1280 by 800 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.700
 this oh see prices in principle itself by 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.620
 imagine the matrix is good enough but 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.270
 permission of course a little lame 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.820
 Only the site of the RAM is inside 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.520
 one gigabyte of memory there are two cameras on 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.250
 5 megapixels behind and 2 megapixels 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.219
 in front is the same with modelka which 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.370
 It does not have a screen of 7 inches; it is under 7 enclosures 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.080
 They differ too much not on seven 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.990
 as thick as she has this 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.290
 here is the hatch under which I think 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.939
 SIM card slot and memory card even 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.380
 two sim cards it seems like you can insert 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.509
 so it closes 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.030
 they are made in different colors and we 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.400
 red model here also available 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.100
 power button it is on the side 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.259
 volume rocker there is a connector for 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.439
 headphone course and the front is 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.450
 two stereo speakers the same as 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.720
 see on the eight two stereo speakers and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.579
 two cameras and behind is such a beam 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.250
 but the surface is already at eight more 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.470
 It is an interesting kind of the Rakhova 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.390
 I don't break and as you can see 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.130
 something like a golden color or color 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.490
 champagne is now fashionable to do such 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.810
 colors and besides this the tablet is thinner and in 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.090
 hand when you hold it 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.770
 well it seems easy enough both 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.930
 tablet work on the latest version 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.110
 android 4.4 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.149
 asus is the earth 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.950
 and if I'm not mistaken, it is called as 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.870
 copper and ikonochka we performed here in 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.170
 the very flat design 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.220
 with flat shadows the gallery here has 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.220
 this icon 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.930
 cool air balloon here 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.930
 some very strange pictures 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.670
 vague here as there is a visit menu in 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.890
 principle works more or less quickly 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.140
 considering that it is still not yet 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.730
 the final sample is most likely trying 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.620
 less quickly as you can see there 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.600
 notification panel it is also changed 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.270
 beautiful such pretty ikonochki 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.520
 You can run a calculator through it and 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.890
 there is still a quick memo here 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.380
 some dictionaries and there is a power mode 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.590
 savings but also all sorts of stuff 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.280
 who the leader like to add 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.200
 own devices 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.090
 changed the application standard this here 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.470
 for example, the same calendar as you can see 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.120
 slightly different design 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.850
 like a little bit on this and from here the top 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.110
 parts made in some color other than 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.580
 calendar and also changed zip 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.230
 customer and also looks different here 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.340
 the truth is not logged in the window is still there 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.950
 several applications here for example 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.720
 file manager is also built in like 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.390
 well, maybe some more 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.210
 I forgot a couple of applications but in principle 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.760
 the shell does not cause unpleasant emotions 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.130
 she works pretty fast and 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.080
 looks pretty distinctive 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.239
 The feature of these devices is exactly 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.239
 the background of the filing is that according to them 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.320
 you can call they have applications 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.330
 the phone is laid out dial any 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.670
 numbers like this i call 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.310
 by the way here how many saw if 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.470
 people use things like phone 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.850
 then it is mostly for some reason girls but I 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.920
 do not want to say anything against 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.660
 but always looks a little weird and more 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.130
 one device that the company showed 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.970
 asus here at computex 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:42.150
 called asus transformer book he 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.739
 bless you grief must say it 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.720
 such a name is much official here 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.010
 written what is unique for the device 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.560
 first he is not to the threads that it can not 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.019
 touch and get ie we like 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.720
 at least looking at this will be understand 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.660
 what asus can do well beautiful thin 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.420
 cases for laptops and tablets that 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.500
 nice and not even sure what it is 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.150
 the image on the display is possible 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.250
 just the end of the carton is inserted here 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.470
 honestly not clear but on 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.239
 really the idea is to create 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.180
 cool laptop 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.760
 hyphen tablet on windows 8 1 in fact 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.769
 such a competitor 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.010
 microsoft devices which are called 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.109
 surprise super slim gadget without 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.060
 keyboard thickness is only 7 and 3 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.520
 millimeter and extinguishes very little and for 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.830
 tablet well, and with a keyboard 12 half 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.479
 millimeters, too, you know not to fig 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.370
 as for the characteristics of something about them 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.740
 general almost unknown unknown 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.630
 what we know for sure is that the display 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.169
 has a diagonal of 12 half inches and 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.020
 its resolution is 1564 40 pixels then what 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.720
 also called 4 cases hd 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.520
 i call the cup burn 2 key and in general 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.729
 can imagine 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.110
 what is at stake on high resolution 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.570
 the picture will be on it and very clear 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.300
 some fresher enterol processor 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.030
 Most likely put here and RAM 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.880
 up to 4 gigs well, another nice bonus to 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.500
 mobility device supports 4g network 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.229
 that is, you can really fully 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.910
 use tablet aries room 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.650
 it's good, but more to the owner 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.570
 information will also not be this 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.180
 unpretentious hd-cameras by the way here in this 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.180
 sample pay attention curious even 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.250
 there is no hole under this camera frontally 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.250
 although the specifications say that it is from 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.139
 out of curiosity it's really cool 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.300
 just a layout that's nothing yet 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.190
 but we know how asus wants 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.979
 make it and imagine if you 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.539
 using a laptop on windows 81 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.960
 then it might be nice 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.430
 option 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.460
 take into account what can always be separated 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.349
 this cap and use the device in 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.180
 car in a taxi or in public 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:44.300
 transport he considers how he 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.830
 thin maybe it will even be comfortable 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.840
 subscribe to the channel it was 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.820
 androidbro.ru tackle in those computer 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.820
