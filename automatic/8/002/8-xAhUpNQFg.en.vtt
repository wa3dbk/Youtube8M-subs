00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.180
 well welcome back to my channel 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.980
 revolutionize your beauty this time 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.400
 I'm going to show you how to make the braid 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.679
 of waterfall but with the cord braid 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.130
 that I will teach him because I'm going to 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:21.020
 use in the next good video let's go 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.620
 to take a lock of here from the shore 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.830
 this have made us have here what 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.300
 let's divide in two 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.930
 if in two these two piglets the one below 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.430
 it's going to go over the top if we take that 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.710
 and the volcanoes 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.770
 ok now the bottom one is this and the one 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.440
 up is this one already there were processes 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.690
 well now having the well we are going to 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.870
 take a lock from up here that would be 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.480
 our third male 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.129
 these two strands are the main ones and 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.860
 are the ones we are going to use during 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.469
 all the braid this is going to be additional 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.860
 that it's going to be here loose 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.290
 to make it our waterfall braid 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.759
 good this strand we are going to put it in 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.560
 half of these two ok and we let them go what 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.090
 we leave like this loose 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.260
 we are both going back to do the first 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.530
 the one below is passed over 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.420
 and we are like this this lock here is going to 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.930
 be loose and we're not going to 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.930
 use 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.829
 we have our two locks and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.250
 let's go back to take another one from here 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.250
 above 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.420
 we do the same thing this lock 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.200
 we take from above we are going to drop it 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.930
 between the two strands that we already have 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.860
 so that we are left with this cross 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.380
 upwards 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.409
 ok and here are our many 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.869
 milestones 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.869
 and that is what we are going to repeat 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.979
 of all our 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:33.000
 I leave here my braid and the only thing that 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.000
 I do is wrap up these facts 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.700
 and here I will put 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.700
 a goal list 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.709
 and so our braid would be 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:53.490
 if they are fixed then the effect here is what 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.740
 same because the loose strands remain 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.080
 as you can see it there you look at this 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.710
 braid like that and in the other video you look 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.320
 a three-strand woven braid but that 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:09.150
 it is more difficult this method is more 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.900
 simple is already how you like it 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.510
 look if we lift her up here they look at each other 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.690
 all the locks that are loose what 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.780
 which is why it's called cascade braid 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.860
 if you are ruffled because nothing else pull 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.200
 the millionaires down 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.110
 well here is the braid of 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.410
 waterfall with another method I hope you have them 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:37.270
 liked and do not miss the next video 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.270
