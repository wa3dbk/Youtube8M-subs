rig when I was shooting this it was just

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.089 
rig when I was shooting this it was just
the<00:00:23.220> latest<00:00:23.670> LCD<00:00:24.570> viewfinder<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.650> camera

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
held up to my eye and I was just

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.130 
held up to my eye and I was just
supporting<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.769> with<00:00:29.340> my<00:00:29.490> hands<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.019> was

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
supporting this with my hands so it was

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.110 
supporting this with my hands so it was
very<00:00:31.500> minimal<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:32.130> was<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> pleasure<00:00:32.940> to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120

stuff attached to the camera that you

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.280

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
shooting inside a plane it looks big

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.750 
shooting inside a plane it looks big
open<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.230> spacious<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:53.160> certainly<00:00:53.520> had<00:00:53.730> no

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760

problems<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.660> lens<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.110> terms<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.500> focusing

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
problems this lens in terms of focusing

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.979 
problems this lens in terms of focusing
because<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.670> zone<00:00:56.940> forecast<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.570> most<00:00:57.780> of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
because I just zone forecast it most of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.470 
because I just zone forecast it most of
the<00:00:58.079> time<00:00:58.340> most<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> shots<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.120> here<00:01:00.329> have

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the time most of the shots in here have

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.630 
the time most of the shots in here have
not<00:01:00.719> been<00:01:00.989> stabilized<00:01:01.620> there<00:01:01.920> are<00:01:02.070> two<00:01:02.370> shots

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
not been stabilized there are two shots

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.729 
not been stabilized there are two shots
that<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.940> did<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> little<00:01:03.510> bit<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
that I did do a little bit of

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.440 
that I did do a little bit of
stabilization<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.670> fairly<00:01:05.939> minimal

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
stabilization on but it's fairly minimal

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330 
stabilization on but it's fairly minimal
cleanup<00:01:06.900> all<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.650> rest<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.159> is

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
cleanup all the rest of this is

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.310 
cleanup all the rest of this is
literally<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.939> raw<00:01:09.150> camera<00:01:09.450> footage<00:01:09.960> usually

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
literally the raw camera footage usually

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.109 
literally the raw camera footage usually
with<00:01:10.439> some<00:01:10.470> basic<00:01:10.979> color<00:01:11.189> correction<00:01:11.760> done<00:01:11.970> on

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
with some basic color correction done on

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.090 
with some basic color correction done on
it<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.659> sound<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> built-in<00:01:13.830> camera

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
mic zone focusing with this lens I had

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.649 
mic zone focusing with this lens I had
absolutely<00:01:17.100> no<00:01:17.400> problem<00:01:17.939> keeping<00:01:18.270> things<00:01:18.509> in

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
absolutely no problem keeping things in

focus even when I was shooting at fairly
wide<00:01:20.909> open<00:01:21.390> listens<00:01:22.200> was<00:01:22.380> great<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> just

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
wide open listens was great to just

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.770 
wide open listens was great to just
carry<00:01:23.250> around<00:01:23.340> when<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> shot<00:01:24.210> happened<00:01:24.659> in

handheld<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.100> camera<00:01:59.909> up<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.119> my

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
handheld I just have the camera up to my

fourteen<00:02:12.280> millimeter<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.970> course<00:02:13.240> is<00:02:13.450> just

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
fourteen millimeter of course is just

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.870 
fourteen millimeter of course is just
one<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.840> those<00:02:14.020> great<00:02:14.440> lenses<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.040> have<00:02:15.250> when

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
one of those great lenses to have when

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.460 
one of those great lenses to have when
you<00:02:16.000> really<00:02:16.270> need<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.630> get<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.810> big<00:02:17.170> subject

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
you really need to get a big subject

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.260 
you really need to get a big subject
inning<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:17.980> just<00:02:18.190> can't<00:02:18.400> back<00:02:18.640> up<00:02:18.670> like<00:02:19.120> when

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
inning you just can't back up like when

inning you just can't back up like when
I<00:02:19.300> was<00:02:19.480> on<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.750> deck<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.140> ship<00:02:20.470> here<00:02:20.710> it

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
I was on the deck of the ship here it

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.250 
I was on the deck of the ship here it
was<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:21.760> no<00:02:22.000> other<00:02:22.030> place<00:02:22.450> for<00:02:22.480> me<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.840> go<00:02:23.050> or

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
was just no other place for me to go or

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.960 
was just no other place for me to go or
I<00:02:23.290> was<00:02:23.560> standing<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.130> yet<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.430> got<00:02:24.670> everything

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
I was standing and yet I got everything

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.920 
I was standing and yet I got everything
in<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:27.100> check<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.460> out<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.760> ROE<00:02:27.880> keen<00:02:28.120> on<00:02:28.270> 14

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
in so check it out the ROE keen on 14

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.390 
in so check it out the ROE keen on 14
2.8<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:29.860> really<00:02:30.400> very<00:02:30.790> nice<00:02:30.970> lens
