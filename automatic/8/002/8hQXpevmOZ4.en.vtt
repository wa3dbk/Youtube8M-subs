00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
and wild interpretations of Scripture

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.490

their figures of it now I believe that

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.959 
their figures of it now I believe that
when<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.550> say<00:00:42.110> that<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.559> church<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.010> not<00:00:44.670> in

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the Old Testament then when you find a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.350 
the Old Testament then when you find a
verse<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.870> scripture<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.739> Isaiah<00:00:50.120> that<00:00:51.120> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
verse of scripture in Isaiah that you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.319 
verse of scripture in Isaiah that you

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
sorry that my brother and very good

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.330 
sorry that my brother and very good
friend<00:03:10.740> took<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:12.860> interpretation<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.890> mean

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
friend took the interpretation to mean

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.560 
friend took the interpretation to mean
the<00:03:14.940> rapture<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.780> church<00:03:15.930> because<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:17.570> know

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
the rapture of the church because I know

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.740 
the rapture of the church because I know
that<00:03:18.870> he's<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.080> very<00:03:19.530> excellent<00:03:20.130> preacher<00:03:20.760> but

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
that he's a very excellent preacher but

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.780 
that he's a very excellent preacher but
I<00:03:21.810> guess<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.560> they<00:03:22.830> all<00:03:22.980> can't<00:03:23.370> agree<00:03:23.760> with

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
I guess that they all can't agree with

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.110 
I guess that they all can't agree with
me<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:24.990> we<00:03:25.470> just<00:03:25.770> have<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.280> hope<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.580> they

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
me and so we just have to hope that they

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.980 
me and so we just have to hope that they
will<00:03:28.020> all<00:03:28.380> see<00:03:28.920> like<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.430> see<00:03:29.880> but<00:03:30.810> the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
will all see like I see but the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.990 
will all see like I see but the
interesting<00:03:31.230> thing<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.830> some<00:03:32.340> day<00:03:32.550> we're<00:03:32.820> all

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
interesting thing is some day we're all

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.210 
interesting thing is some day we're all
going<00:03:33.330> to<00:03:33.420> be<00:03:33.570> an<00:03:33.690> agreement<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.470> not<00:03:35.040> only

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
going to be an agreement and not only

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.670 
going to be an agreement and not only
will<00:03:35.520> they<00:03:36.060> be<00:03:36.120> changed<00:03:36.900> but<00:03:37.050> I'm<00:03:37.230> gonna<00:03:37.470> be

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
will they be changed but I'm gonna be

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.450 
will they be changed but I'm gonna be
changed<00:03:38.310> too<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:39.510> may<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.260> say<00:03:40.770> to<00:03:40.830> you<00:03:41.040> that

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
changed too and so may I say to you that

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.810 
changed too and so may I say to you that
maybe<00:03:42.090> we<00:03:42.360> ought<00:03:42.390> not<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.840> be<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:43.560> dogmatic<00:03:43.980> in

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
maybe we ought not to be so dogmatic in

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.990 
maybe we ought not to be so dogmatic in
certain<00:03:45.420> areas<00:03:45.570> but<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.530> do<00:03:46.740> know<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.430> this

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
certain areas but I do know that this

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.100 
certain areas but I do know that this
particular<00:03:48.270> passage<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.470> Scripture<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.220> a

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
particular passage of Scripture is a

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.510 
particular passage of Scripture is a
repetition<00:03:52.110> of<00:03:52.260> actually<00:03:52.860> what<00:03:53.070> he's<00:03:53.220> been

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
repetition of actually what he's been
