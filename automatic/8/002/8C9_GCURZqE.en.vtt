00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
really big deal so first let's look at

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.090 
really big deal so first let's look at
our<00:00:59.550> basic<00:00:59.879> page<00:01:00.030> 0<00:01:00.180> 20<00:01:00.690> 19<00:01:01.079> that's<00:01:01.710> our<00:01:01.859> tank

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
our basic page 0 20 19 that's our tank

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.969 
our basic page 0 20 19 that's our tank
page<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:03.120> basically<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> same<00:01:04.199> except<00:01:04.860> the

page it's basically the same except the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.980 
page it's basically the same except the
points<00:01:05.309> are<00:01:05.460> reversed<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.390> your<00:01:06.510> first<00:01:06.720> nine

you're<00:01:42.840> looking<00:01:43.049> at<00:01:43.259> your<00:01:43.560> bruisers<00:01:44.159> so

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
you're looking at your bruisers so

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.850 
you're looking at your bruisers so
typically<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.420> bruisers<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.409> had<00:01:46.590> two

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
typically with bruisers you had two

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.109 
typically with bruisers you had two
types<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.250> champions<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.759> those<00:01:48.000> who

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
types of champions you have those who

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.639 
types of champions you have those who
really<00:01:48.270> cared<00:01:48.540> about<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.840> early<00:01:49.140> game<00:01:49.320> stats

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
really cared about the early game stats

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.260 
really cared about the early game stats
unless<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.399> really<00:01:50.549> cared<00:01:50.790> about<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> late

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
unless we really cared about the late

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.850 
unless we really cared about the late
game<00:01:51.479> stats<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.960> tankiness<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
game stats and tankiness so the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.899 
game stats and tankiness so the
champions<00:01:53.159> occurred<00:01:53.340> about<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.549> late<00:01:53.700> game

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
champions occurred about a late game

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.359 
champions occurred about a late game
would<00:01:54.420> go<00:01:54.450> 920<00:01:55.049> 10<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.829> champs<00:01:56.070> who<00:01:56.130> carried

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
would go 920 10 the champs who carried

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.760 
would go 920 10 the champs who carried
about<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.640> early<00:01:57.060> game<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> lot<00:01:57.509> we<00:01:57.990> go<00:01:58.079> 21<00:01:58.530> 90

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
about the early game a lot we go 21 90

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.819 
about the early game a lot we go 21 90
so<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.159> had<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> champion<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.700> Lee<00:01:59.909> sin<00:02:00.240> and

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
so you had a champion like Lee sin and

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.609 
so you had a champion like Lee sin and
Jarvan<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.009> atrox<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.610> 20<00:02:02.850> 19<00:02:03.180> out<00:02:03.590> now<00:02:04.590> I

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
Jarvan and atrox going 20 19 out now I

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.050 
Jarvan and atrox going 20 19 out now I
think<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.100> much<00:02:05.280> more<00:02:05.430> viable<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:05.969> those

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
think it's much more viable for those

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.570 
think it's much more viable for those
champions<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:07.020> go<00:02:07.140> 920<00:02:07.680> 10<00:02:08.039> then<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.459> was

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
champions to go 920 10 then it was

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.400 
champions to go 920 10 then it was
previously<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:09.209> because<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.869> get<00:02:10.050> all<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
previously just because you get all the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.300 
previously just because you get all the
all<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.250> base<00:02:11.520> stats<00:02:11.819> although

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
all the base stats although

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.920 
all the base stats although
but<00:02:12.489> you<00:02:12.640> know<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.819> bonus<00:02:13.060> ad<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.569> deeper

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
but you know the bonus ad the a deeper

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.470 
but you know the bonus ad the a deeper
level<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:15.069> attack<00:02:15.310> speed<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:16.180> get<00:02:16.330> those

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
level the attack speed you get those

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.270 
level the attack speed you get those
early<00:02:16.840> on<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.440> later<00:02:17.650> stats<00:02:17.980> are<00:02:18.160> only

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
early on the later stats are only

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.680 
early on the later stats are only
released<00:02:18.610> phul<00:02:18.790> if<00:02:18.910> you're<00:02:19.030> building<00:02:19.209> damage

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
released phul if you're building damage

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.020 
released phul if you're building damage
you've<00:02:20.110> got<00:02:20.290> bonus<00:02:20.860> attack<00:02:21.040> damage<00:02:21.280> increases

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
you've got bonus attack damage increases

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.080 
you've got bonus attack damage increases
and<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:23.080> sort<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.319> thing<00:02:23.880> percent<00:02:24.880> damage

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
and that sort of thing percent damage

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.970 
and that sort of thing percent damage
increase<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:26.140> only<00:02:26.349> thing<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.620> Lee<00:02:26.770> sin

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
increase the only thing that Lee sin

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.350 
increase the only thing that Lee sin
might<00:02:27.160> want<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.430> do<00:02:27.520> is<00:02:27.640> still<00:02:27.849> splash<00:02:28.150> for

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
might want to do is still splash for

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.660 
might want to do is still splash for
executioner<00:02:28.989> that<00:02:29.980> would<00:02:30.160> be<00:02:30.250> up<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.459> the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
executioner that would be up to the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.880 
executioner that would be up to the
lease<00:02:30.819> in<00:02:30.970> player<00:02:31.209> then<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.410> allows<00:02:32.530> them<00:02:32.680> to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
lease in player then that allows them to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.190 
lease in player then that allows them to
with<00:02:33.400> their<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:34.180> early<00:02:34.450> flat<00:02:34.660> damage<00:02:34.989> just

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
with their the early flat damage just

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.259 
with their the early flat damage just
get<00:02:35.380> really<00:02:35.560> tanky<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.160> also<00:02:36.550> pick<00:02:36.760> up<00:02:36.849> the

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
get really tanky and also pick up the

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.000 
get really tanky and also pick up the
flat<00:02:37.569> tankiness<00:02:38.110> which<00:02:38.319> is<00:02:38.410> now<00:02:38.530> higher<00:02:38.769> up<00:02:38.890> in

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
flat tankiness which is now higher up in

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.470 
flat tankiness which is now higher up in
the<00:02:39.040> tree<00:02:39.220> hardiness<00:02:39.700> resistance<00:02:40.180> gives<00:02:40.390> the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
the tree hardiness resistance gives the

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.059 
the tree hardiness resistance gives the
NEX<00:02:40.630> armor<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.410> look<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.739> see<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.890> lot<00:02:42.040> of

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
NEX armor so I look to see a lot of

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.170 
NEX armor so I look to see a lot of
those<00:02:42.220> early<00:02:42.280> game<00:02:42.580> champions<00:02:42.940> actually

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
those early game champions actually

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.110 
those early game champions actually
going<00:02:43.300> 9<00:02:43.510> 20<00:02:43.900> 10<00:02:44.290> instead<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.709> 21<00:02:45.069> 90<00:02:45.580> just

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
going 9 20 10 instead of 21 90 just

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.880 
going 9 20 10 instead of 21 90 just
because<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.450> rebalancing<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.470> points

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
because of the rebalancing of points

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.289 
because of the rebalancing of points
it's<00:02:48.340> going<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.519> give<00:02:48.640> them<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.819> lot<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:49.060> flat

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
it's going to give them a lot of flat

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.190 
it's going to give them a lot of flat
stats<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.870> remain<00:02:50.110> useful<00:02:51.030> 21<00:02:52.030> 90<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:52.870> think<00:02:53.080> was

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
stats to remain useful 21 90 I think was

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.160 
stats to remain useful 21 90 I think was
gonna<00:02:53.319> fall<00:02:53.709> off<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:54.069> lot<00:02:54.690> as<00:02:55.690> something<00:02:56.080> you

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
gonna fall off a lot as something you

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.750 
gonna fall off a lot as something you
take<00:02:56.319> in<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.530> jungle<00:02:56.830> Turner<00:02:57.010> 190<00:02:57.459> was<00:02:57.580> really

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
take in the jungle Turner 190 was really

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.710 
take in the jungle Turner 190 was really
something<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.060> took<00:02:58.239> on<00:02:58.360> someone<00:02:58.599> who's

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
something you took on someone who's

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.509 
something you took on someone who's
gonna<00:02:58.840> build<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.290> lot<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.650> damage<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.160> scale

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
gonna build a lot of damage and scale

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.570 
gonna build a lot of damage and scale
off<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.849> it<00:03:01.030> now<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:03.160> doesn't<00:03:03.430> happen

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
off of it now and that doesn't happen

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.190 
off of it now and that doesn't happen
you're<00:03:04.269> not<00:03:04.390> gonna<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.690> know<00:03:04.780> three<00:03:04.930> percent

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
you're not gonna you know three percent

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.750 
you're not gonna you know three percent
increase<00:03:05.440> damage<00:03:05.590> on<00:03:05.799> any<00:03:05.830> kick<00:03:06.250> on<00:03:06.430> an<00:03:06.580> ad

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
increase damage on any kick on an ad

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.850 
increase damage on any kick on an ad
carries<00:03:07.180> huge<00:03:07.569> three<00:03:08.200> percent<00:03:08.530> increased

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
carries huge three percent increased

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.920

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
items if the game goes right i think

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.229 
items if the game goes right i think
this<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:30.130> going<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.280> be<00:03:30.400> less<00:03:30.609> and<00:03:30.790> less<00:03:30.910> viable

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
this is going to be less and less viable

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.390 
this is going to be less and less viable
simply<00:03:32.019> because<00:03:32.260> you<00:03:32.290> miss<00:03:32.620> out<00:03:32.799> on<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.069> early

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
simply because you miss out on the early

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.479 
simply because you miss out on the early
game<00:03:33.579> defensive<00:03:34.060> stats<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:36.010> also<00:03:36.250> are

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
your ideas your scar nurs who have

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.060 
your ideas your scar nurs who have
shields<00:04:16.510> who<00:04:16.900> has<00:04:16.989> fam<00:04:17.200> Bowl<00:04:17.410> abilities<00:04:17.829> and

shields who has fam Bowl abilities and

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.099 
shields who has fam Bowl abilities and
so<00:04:18.760> they're<00:04:19.299> going<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.510> do<00:04:19.630> all<00:04:19.660> right<00:04:19.780> without

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
so they're going to do all right without

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.230 
so they're going to do all right without
the<00:04:20.470> defense<00:04:20.830> and<00:04:21.099> so<00:04:21.669> they<00:04:21.789> can<00:04:21.909> still<00:04:22.120> go

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
the defense and so they can still go

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.659 
the defense and so they can still go
into<00:04:22.419> utility<00:04:22.630> for<00:04:22.960> extra<00:04:23.200> movespeed<00:04:23.669> 5%
