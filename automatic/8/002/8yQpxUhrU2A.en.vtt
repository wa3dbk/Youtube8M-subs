here and today i'm going to be doing a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.420 
here and today i'm going to be doing a
quick<00:00:21.360> product<00:00:21.689> review<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.170> three<00:00:22.859> cases

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
quick product review of three cases

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.720 
quick product review of three cases
which<00:00:24.270> is<00:00:24.509> the<00:00:24.900> griffin<00:00:25.590> flexi<00:00:26.250> grip<00:00:26.460> case

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
which is the griffin flexi grip case

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.179 
which is the griffin flexi grip case
which<00:00:27.570> comes<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.259> clear<00:00:29.090> smoke<00:00:30.090> clear<00:00:30.630> and

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
which comes in clear smoke clear and

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.220 
which comes in clear smoke clear and
also<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.580> graphite<00:00:33.330> color<00:00:33.660> which<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.960> called

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
also a graphite color which is called

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.360 
also a graphite color which is called
the<00:00:34.470> griffin<00:00:35.280> reveal<00:00:35.610> etch<00:00:36.110> graphite<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.379> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
the griffin reveal etch graphite and the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.070 
the griffin reveal etch graphite and the
reason<00:00:38.640> why<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:38.940> called<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.480> it

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
reason why it's called that because it

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.430 
reason why it's called that because it
has<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.800> carbon<00:00:41.790> fiber<00:00:42.089> look<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:43.199> i've

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
has this carbon fiber look so i've

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.240 
has this carbon fiber look so i've
already<00:00:43.739> unbox<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.120> reveal<00:00:45.960> etch<00:00:46.250> graphite

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
already unbox the reveal etch graphite

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.240 
already unbox the reveal etch graphite
case<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.870> exactly<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.620> same<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
case and it's exactly the same as the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.389 
case and it's exactly the same as the
other<00:00:50.610> two<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.180> set<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.170> back<00:00:52.410> has<00:00:53.100> this

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
other two and set for the back has this

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.930 
other two and set for the back has this
graphite<00:00:53.969> carbon<00:00:54.390> fiber<00:00:54.870> look<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> first

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
graphite carbon fiber look so first

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.900 
graphite carbon fiber look so first
let's<00:00:57.180> look<00:00:57.359> at<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:58.129> design<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> back<00:00:59.489> of

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
let's look at this design on the back of

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.990 
let's look at this design on the back of
the<00:01:00.359> case<00:01:00.719> itself<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.190> see<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.579> reflects

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the case itself you can see it reflects

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.430 
the case itself you can see it reflects
light<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.960> carbon<00:01:04.470> fiber<00:01:05.660> it<00:01:06.660> feels

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
light just like carbon fiber it feels

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.359 
light just like carbon fiber it feels
and<00:01:07.800> sounds<00:01:08.070> exactly<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.880> carbon<00:01:09.479> fiber<00:01:10.369> can

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
and sounds exactly like carbon fiber can

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.609 
and sounds exactly like carbon fiber can
you<00:01:11.490> scrape<00:01:11.789> it<00:01:12.060> that's<00:01:12.509> exactly<00:01:12.690> our<00:01:13.050> carbon

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
you scrape it that's exactly our carbon

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.740 
you scrape it that's exactly our carbon
fiber<00:01:13.920> sounds<00:01:14.429> the<00:01:14.610> actual<00:01:14.970> material<00:01:15.420> itself

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
fiber sounds the actual material itself

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.109 
fiber sounds the actual material itself
it's<00:01:16.560> got<00:01:16.800> that<00:01:16.920> fill<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.670> look<00:01:17.880> at

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
it's got that fill and that look at

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.389 
it's got that fill and that look at
which<00:01:18.300> reflects<00:01:18.780> light<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:19.950> carbon

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
which reflects light just like carbon

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.690 
which reflects light just like carbon
fiber<00:01:20.810> also<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.050> got<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.440> lovely<00:01:22.979> rubber

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
fiber also it's got this lovely rubber
