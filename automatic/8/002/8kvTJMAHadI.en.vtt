00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
over controlling and we were just acting

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.910 
over controlling and we were just acting
out<00:04:15.850> and<00:04:16.299> they<00:04:16.960> thought<00:04:17.080> it<00:04:17.140> was<00:04:17.320> only<00:04:17.440> women

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
and we've learned a lot since then right

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.630 
and we've learned a lot since then right
and<00:04:20.290> we've<00:04:20.380> come<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.620> long<00:04:20.830> way<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:21.280> now<00:04:21.460> they

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
and we've come a long way and now they

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.760 
and we've come a long way and now they
believe<00:04:22.000> that<00:04:22.150> there<00:04:22.330> is<00:04:22.360> a<00:04:22.510> link<00:04:22.930> genetically

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
believe that there is a link genetically

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.999 
believe that there is a link genetically
and<00:04:24.120> from<00:04:25.120> what<00:04:25.750> I've<00:04:25.960> read<00:04:26.260> because<00:04:26.500> I

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
and from what I've read because I

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:28.650 
and from what I've read because I
alerts<00:04:27.550> every<00:04:27.850> time<00:04:28.060> they<00:04:28.210> talk<00:04:28.389> about<00:04:28.479> eating

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
disorders and one of the well actually I

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.340 
disorders and one of the well actually I
guess<00:04:31.120> like<00:04:31.270> three<00:04:31.509> of<00:04:31.539> the<00:04:31.660> articles<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.139> read

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
guess like three of the articles I read

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.040

chromosome 10 they believe are looking

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.749 
chromosome 10 they believe are looking
you<00:04:40.120> know<00:04:40.440> like<00:04:41.440> they<00:04:41.620> may<00:04:41.830> lead<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.220> eating

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.980 
disorders and they may be what causes it
now<00:04:45.190> I<00:04:45.490> think<00:04:45.610> it's<00:04:46.150> always<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.509> nature<00:04:46.870> and

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
now I think it's always a nature and

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.240 
now I think it's always a nature and
nurture<00:04:47.110> together<00:04:47.650> that<00:04:47.889> creates<00:04:48.190> the

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
nurture together that creates the

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.650 
nurture together that creates the
problem<00:04:48.400> because<00:04:49.000> some<00:04:49.180> of<00:04:49.300> us<00:04:49.449> could<00:04:49.600> be

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
problem because some of us could be

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.090 
problem because some of us could be
predisposed<00:04:50.199> to<00:04:50.289> have<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.440> lot<00:04:50.620> of<00:04:50.770> things<00:04:50.919> but

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
predisposed to have a lot of things but

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.790 
predisposed to have a lot of things but
if<00:04:51.220> we're<00:04:51.400> not<00:04:51.430> put<00:04:52.150> in<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.330> situation<00:04:52.900> where<00:04:53.139> we

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
if we're not put in a situation where we

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.060 
if we're not put in a situation where we
have<00:04:54.130> a<00:04:54.160> trauma<00:04:54.520> or<00:04:55.050> we<00:04:56.050> get<00:04:56.199> so<00:04:56.470> stressed<00:04:56.860> out

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
have a trauma or we get so stressed out

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.040 
have a trauma or we get so stressed out
you<00:04:57.430> know<00:04:57.520> we<00:04:57.639> have<00:04:57.850> our<00:04:58.210> first<00:04:58.600> panic<00:04:58.960> attack

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
you know we have our first panic attack

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.450 
you know we have our first panic attack
if<00:04:59.349> we<00:04:59.470> don't<00:04:59.650> aren't<00:05:00.039> put<00:05:00.280> in<00:05:00.370> those

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
if we don't aren't put in those

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.129 
if we don't aren't put in those
situations<00:05:01.090> some<00:05:01.300> things<00:05:01.509> may<00:05:01.690> never<00:05:01.840> come

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
situations some things may never come

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.350 
situations some things may never come
about<00:05:02.440> so<00:05:02.740> I<00:05:02.770> believe<00:05:03.250> it's<00:05:03.400> both<00:05:03.639> but<00:05:04.180> they<00:05:04.300> do

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
about so I believe it's both but they do

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.480 
about so I believe it's both but they do
believe<00:05:04.630> there<00:05:04.930> is<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:05.080> genetic<00:05:05.380> component<00:05:05.590> and

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
believe there is a genetic component and

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.070 
believe there is a genetic component and
they<00:05:06.639> link<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:07.090> two<00:05:07.240> chromosomes<00:05:07.720> one<00:05:07.960> in

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
they link it two chromosomes one in

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.350 
they link it two chromosomes one in
chromosome<00:05:08.470> 10<00:05:08.680> okay<00:05:10.169> now<00:05:11.169> final<00:05:11.919> question

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
chromosome 10 okay now final question

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.820 
chromosome 10 okay now final question

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
it's not treating the underlying issue

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:57.960 
it's not treating the underlying issue
we're<00:05:56.710> just<00:05:56.830> taking<00:05:57.159> away<00:05:57.250> the<00:05:57.370> tools<00:05:57.699> and<00:05:57.880> we

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
we're just taking away the tools and we

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.580 
we're just taking away the tools and we
all<00:05:58.090> know<00:05:58.300> we<00:05:58.750> can<00:05:58.900> get<00:05:58.990> more<00:05:59.169> tools<00:05:59.409> and<00:05:59.500> we

all know we can get more tools and we

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.260 
all know we can get more tools and we
can<00:05:59.620> find<00:05:59.919> new<00:06:00.009> hiding<00:06:00.340> places<00:06:00.580> trust<00:06:01.030> me<00:06:01.150> I've

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
can find new hiding places trust me I've

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.850 
can find new hiding places trust me I've
had<00:06:01.330> clients<00:06:01.690> hide<00:06:01.990> things<00:06:02.229> in<00:06:02.349> the<00:06:02.440> craziest

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
had clients hide things in the craziest

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.010 
had clients hide things in the craziest
of<00:06:02.949> places<00:06:03.400> where<00:06:04.360> there's<00:06:04.539> a<00:06:04.599> will<00:06:04.780> there's<00:06:04.960> a

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
of places where there's a will there's a

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.100 
of places where there's a will there's a
way<00:06:05.110> so<00:06:05.259> I<00:06:05.800> would<00:06:06.490> say<00:06:06.639> no<00:06:06.849> I<00:06:07.210> think<00:06:07.479> we<00:06:07.900> need<00:06:07.930> to

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
way so I would say no I think we need to

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.529 
way so I would say no I think we need to
treat<00:06:08.289> the<00:06:08.409> underlying<00:06:08.740> issue<00:06:08.979> and<00:06:09.340> though

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
treat the underlying issue and though

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.790 
treat the underlying issue and though
when<00:06:10.539> we're<00:06:10.720> struggling<00:06:10.990> will<00:06:11.259> gladly<00:06:11.530> give
