00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.109
 first video where i give you a few 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.050
 want to introduce power exercises he 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.660
 even at home you can do today 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.880
 to stabilize the lower body during 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.890
 run or even with everyone else 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.529
 sports where you naturally legs 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.449
 it has to be very basic 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.730
 Exercises therefore also very easy and 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.769
 all you need is either 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.449
 a gymnastics band or a german 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.680
 I would band a German train 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.539
 recommend it because a bit 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.820
 stronger or he takes one 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.350
 gymnastics band maybe a golden one 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.780
 what then a greater resistance 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.850
 offers it's all about 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.700
 different muscle groups from â‚¬ 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.219
 sectors your adductors euro hip flexors 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.899
 your pretty trek but now all 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.430
 to explain in detail that would be much too 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.489
 take a long time and I want you 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.840
 Of course, quickly bring to the exercises 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.610
 Just imagine it like this 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.440
 a truck with a trailer 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.390
 if you do not train the muscles 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.280
 then wiggle around there and back 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.379
 if you put it up then it kinks 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.270
 Of course we want our muscles 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.909
 strengthen it so that it is quite a 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.840
 coherent unit forms and that 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.890
 Of course we are much more stable 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.510
 Stabilization is actually in everyone 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.970
 sport important above all things too 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.979
 at tennis football volleyball and 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.990
 Of course, even when running no preference 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.820
 sport you operate once somewhere 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.159
 fast changing needs it, got run 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.470
 These muscles are very important 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.810
 and you have to be very stable 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.490
 and if you could set there by virtue 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.369
 then of course you are better in too 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.930
 the sport stored long enough now 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.390
 Let's start your German band 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.979
 somewhere in something firmly in the safe not 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.930
 that you love furniture through the area 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.020
 fly and then you just look 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.390
 Do the exercises and make them so after her 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.799
 You should always feel tension on the band 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.470
 So never have in any 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.320
 position should make the band loose 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.270
 flutter around because then the muscle 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.759
 of course not claimed and that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.500
 brings you in the end, nothing else 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.180
 it is more difficult if you do it that way 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.520
 So I'm without you anywhere 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.649
 then it will be at the same time 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.229
 the stabilization in your other foot 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.030
 A balance is exercised with that 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.830
 Of course, it's a lot harder for her 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.510
 Of course you can do it somewhere at the beginning 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.670
 hold tight 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.900
 very clearly with the band you can 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.360
 of course, also your shank 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.159
 Musculature optimally with exercise if 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.569
 it still is among a small tube 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.430
 then you have a bigger one 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.379
 radius of movement so there you can 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.000
 really vary with the strength 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.989
 depending on how far you go backwards 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 the more difficult now, of course, the 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.650
 same synonymous for the rotation there can 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.750
 of course, you're turning inward 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.329
 rotate outside to the front to the rear 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.510
 just make that burn and go 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.400
 then just clockwise the 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.950
 walking through the really the joints 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.470
 the rotation in the entire foot in there have 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.290
 this strengthens your foot and makes it tough 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.389
 of course you can of course 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.730
 Just do the movement 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.590
 you have to do in your sport 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.180
 So do the same and then 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.040
 Simply insert the tape with 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.989
 then you have a resistance in the 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.720
 movement that you always do anyway 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.030
 You just have to try different ones 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.329
 variations from where he has the biggest effect 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.069
 in the muscle itself you can even feel 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.569
 He usually exercises in the 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.000
 You can do gym with it 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.470
 really good at home and I say 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.810
 you even if the resistance you 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.370
 may seem so small more 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.079
 strictly but really im 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.720
 thighs if you're there a bit 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.280
 train has on the tape is difficult 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.530
 Of course, the control too 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.209
 keep because it is not a machine 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.949
 give you a precise move 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.980
 but you always correct it 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:38.569
 need for your bathing and yours 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.940
 Feet just look for one 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.829
 edge goes with the hack on the ground 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.260
 and then as far up as it is 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.030
 is possible on the tiptoes and 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.010
 slowly let go again 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.519
 up and slowly down again 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.709
 to let 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.359
 very simple and if there is one more 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.109
 wants to have a bit more difficult 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.699
 it's like this 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.230
 There you can go a little further 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.120
 come down with the hack 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.579
 hold on somewhere but pull 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.470
 then do not get up but leave it 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.490
 do everything the feet 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.990
 you should do these basic exercises 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.180
 at least two to three times a week 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.550
 Of course we do a good job 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.950
 stabilization should be achieved 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.180
 about in the case of repetition of me 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.579
 say about ten repetitions 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.250
 do and so should you your band 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.139
 set your strength on it 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.169
 And he just makes you three sentences 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:28.080
 So each time you exercise three times 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:31.200
 do with ten repetitions and then 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.660
 you quickly realize how you run your course 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.669
 Economics can improve very well and 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.979
 that, in the end, that's what you do 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.470
 can achieve better times and 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.330
 of course you before eventual 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.400
 protect sports injuries very well 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.060
 I hope you have the video 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.680
 like 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.030
 These are the first exercises I do 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.979
 Now I'll do it in the near future 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.169
 to bring a few more videos like 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.600
 It's easy to do without a gym 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.790
 Home can really train effectively 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.550
 and what you also in the end 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.990
 keep going so stay tuned you can 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.520
 if you are looking for a german band 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.130
 you have to look in the infobox there have 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.200
 I link one to you and otherwise 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.970
 Just write me if you still 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.010
 have any specific exercises 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.440
 or if your exercises become one 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.360
 specific sport or want to know 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.520
 to a specific muscle group then 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.740
 I will record next time 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.740
 until then your daniel
